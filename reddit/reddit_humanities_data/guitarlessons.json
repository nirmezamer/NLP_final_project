            "Should I buy Online or from a store?\n\nI have finalized the Yamaha FG800 but I read many posts talking about the \"Setup\".  \nIf I buy it online do I need to take it to a store for setup? Or do you recommend I buy it directly from a store.  \n  \nTotal guitar noob and I have 0 idea most stuff.",
            "I bought my first ever guitar 9m ago, ready to buy a guitar that I hope to last me for good (not looking to buy another again/ own a squire sonic strat atm / looking to buy a fender strat now), which of the three do you recommend?\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cr6xidp3b66d1.png?width=829&format=png&auto=webp&s=e69b89553ea00d516c6fbe73c99f4b8630972c0b\n\n# \n\nI prefer a  thin neck (from strings to back of the neck)  and hope for better pickups.",
            "Why does the location of manufacturing influence the quality of a guitar?\n\n  \nThe implicit assumption seems to be that american build fenders are better than mexican built and those in turn are better than indonesian built fenders. But how?\n\n  \nIf employees are trained in the same way by fender, then build the guitar using the same materials and machinerie, and to top it off built the guitar following the same fender process, how in the world can the results vary from location to location?\n\n  \nIs this just chauvinism? Are people just basically saying only americans can somehow build guitars? It just doesn't make any sense. If the same process is followed the workers have the same training and the materials are the same, you would expect all three locations indonesia, Mexico, and america to produce guitars of similar quality.",
            "big beginner here. I am using DAW-VST to tune my guitar, and one VST shows octave while another shows Hz.\n\nTH-3 shows that my guitar goes from 6th string is E4 and 1st string E6, while NeuralDSP shows my 6th string is 82.4 Hz.\n\nI read online that \"standard tuning\" is 6 string to be E2 and 82.4 Hz.\n\nAm I tuned right or is there an issue? I am not good enough to discern if it's just guitar difference or octave is off.",

            "They aren't trained the same way nor do they use the same materials.",
            "You're looking at incorrectly. Theoretically, what you're saying would be correct if the premise was true...but it's not. Fender doesn't make the same guitar in all these locations. Their higher end guitars are made in USA where they have a better market for materials and labor, easier oversight, etc. The cheaper guitars, materials, training etc are purposefully outsourced to other countries where it's cheaper to\u00a0produce instruments, where quality isn't as important. If what you said were the case you should be able to buy a Mexican standard and an American standard and see a direct comparison of materials, but you can't. It doesn't exist.\u00a0",
            "I'm not sure why TH-3 is showing you're tuned 2 octaves up, but your strings would not still be in one piece if you were tuned 2 octaves up. You should be all good, and 82.4hz is just about what it should be.",
            "So what would you describe the difference in playability foremost and then secondly sound of the Mexican made Fender Stratocaster and the USA made Fender Stratocaster?\n\nI felt a markedly better playability and sound in my Mexico Fender Strat compared to my Indonesia Squire Strat.\n\nI don't understand why though, the neck's playability should not depend on the materials. It seems like the Squire has a more cumbersome neck like it's thicker. Maybe the Squire woods need to be thicker to withstand the stresses of the strings?"

            "Time for you to learn different voicings and challenge yourself to play the whole progression in one position. That will make the changes from one chord to another sound smoother and more connected.",
            "Finger picking in electric is pretty common in jazz and stuff, it definitely has a good sound I agree\n\nIdea sounds good, things to improve thatl make it sound better is keeping time (slow it down with a metronome n dont speed up until its all in time) and working on smooth chord changes",

            "Practice with a metronome set to the 16th notes you\u2019re sort of rolling on the chords, they might seem like a textural addition but they need to be in time too, cause it sounds sloppy. Overall chord progression, rhythm, and harmony is pretty cool here. I particularly like when you add a slide before a repetition, maybe add more single note embellishments like that.",
            "Sounds great.. only suggestion is to work on not rushing those arpeggios.",
            "I use picks sometimes but use my fingers most of the time on all types of guitars. I always have.  Definitely extends possibilities. I advise all players to add finger-plucking to their bag of tricks.\n\nI have always referred to what I do with my fingers as finger-plucking. I never use finger or thumb picks. Plain fingers are so much more versatile & expressive.\n\nYou will find that your plucking hand nails require more attention.\n\nRemember 'Mississippi Queen' by Mountain? Leslie West was playing with his fingers.",

        "content": "Pretty much as the title says, am I the only one that struggles with accidentally bending strings while forming chords? For example: when I finger this Bm triad, my A string gets bent down to where sometimes it ends up muted by my pinky on the D string. It\u2019s especially bad on faster chord changes and stretched out shapes like this.\nIt\u2019s the only real issue I\u2019ve found with my playing that I haven\u2019t been able to improve by just practicing more, so clearly my technique is lacking somewhere that I haven\u2019t been able to pinpoint.

            "You are not the only one. What this means is you have improved to the point where you are noticing the details more. Now you just need to... practice more. You'll get it, but now you need to develop the fine motor and listening skills to play clearly in tune.\n\nThat means spending time just focusing on varying your pressure on the strings to learn the minimum amount you require to sound the notes cleanly. Make sure you are applying pressure straight down on the string and not stretching it into a bend in either direction. It's just another thing we always need to control.",
            "You can beat this by practicing, but try practicing slower. \n\nThe slower you practice, the faster you\u2019ll be able to go. \n\nSlow down, don\u2019t speed up until you stop making errors.  Practice just between two chords for a while. Then add a third chord \u2026",

            "This is a mark of excess tension and effort. Instead of gripping with the hand to make contact with the fret, try bracing the guitar with your strumming hand and pulling the fretting hand against the fretboard. For thisand other stretches, it\u2019s way harder to keep things in line, so try relaxing your fingers on the strings in the correct place but not pressing down, then pulling the entire hand toward the fretboard as a unit, then relaxing, then pulling again, etc. That should help.",
            "Yes. Playing how you feel helps you find your own voice imo",

            "Great job!\n\nThat said, one thing to work on is relaxation \u2014 that pinky especially is carrying a lot of tension. Try playing this slowly as relaxed as possible while keeping all of your fingers over the fretboard within an inch of the strings. As soon as a finger is no longer fretting, make sure it\u2019s tension free \u2014 pliable if you were to move it with your other hand. That\u2019s probably the most important thing.",
            "As others have said, pretty good for 6 months. If you want to be pushed, I'd call your playing \"timid.\" Be more confident and play with more power.",
            "This is a great six months! I've actually been teaching myself the same solo for the past few months!\n\nOne thing that has really helped me has been practicing with a metronome (I usually just use the one that shows up when you Google metronome. I turn it WAY slow (I started at 50 bpm, compared to 96 on the recording) and just practice until I can hit every note right on time without mistakes. Then I bump it up 5 bpm and practice getting it perfect at that speed.\n\nNot only does this really help with memorizing, and of course make me keep more consistent tempo, but I find that it really helps me feel comfortable with the solo and never get worried about keeping up. If there's a part that's giving me trouble, I just drill down on that little bit extra slow until it's easy at any speed.",

            "What you do is put BB King\u2019s \u201cThe Thrill Is Gone\u201d on repeat.  It a basic I-IV-V minor blues format in the key of Bm so everytime he hits the I chord (Bm) you can play along.  This would allow you to practice sounding the chord well and give you some context for use as well.  There\u2019s a little Gmaj7 in the turnaround as well.  Don\u2019t let that throw you.  You just work on finding the root chord (Bm) and hit that chord everytime you hear the song go to the 1 chord .  But give it a shot.  It\u2019s the first chord when the song starts and once you find the pattern you\u2019ll hear it repeat a lot.  The tab for the song should be available online so you could follow along.  And if you\u2019re not skilled enough yet, maybe down the road a bit.  If nothing else, you\u2019ll hear one of the great guitar players show you how to use that chord.  Cuz BB parked his hand in that area A lot!"
