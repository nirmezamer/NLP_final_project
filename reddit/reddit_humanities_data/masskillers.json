        "content": "There have been a lot of posts lately asking what to do if you suspect someone is planning to commit a mass shooting/mass attack of some kind. \n\nIf your suspicions are offline, local, and personal/someone you know personally: \n\nIf it is not an immediate threat, call your local non emergency line. They will collect information from you, and investigate further if need be. Remember, wellness checks can be requested as well.\n\nIf it is an immediate threat, call 911 (or your local equivalent emergency line). An immediate threat would be someone making direct threats.\n\n\nIf the possible threat is exclusively on Reddit, please reach out to us via Modmail. Often times, people who are being reported to us have made comments in the past that you cannot see as they\u2019ve been removed by other means such as automod, for example. We also work with multiple other teams to gather information and build one report to FBI with as much information as we can possibly get in one single report.\n\nThis allows all information to be placed at once instead of multiple vague reports to the FBI, which can slow down resources.\n\nAt the very least, these processes will build a history for this person. If they are reported and nothing comes from it, a report a year later could help immensely. This happened through one sub I moderate on, and helped bring an arrest a year later when more threats were made, and the suspect was found with weapons and a manifesto.\n\nWe take all reports sent to us seriously, and we thank you all for helping us with these reports.",

            "I know two people in my life who I think have a potential of committing murder or mass murder, one hordes guns, has like 5 AR-15s with illegal mods and attachments and like a 2,000 sniper rifles and tons of pistols and shotguns.   He talks about his guns in terms of what they do to a human body.   He doesnt have many friends, is pretty depressed and anti-social, hes stable at the moment but if he snapped or became pissed people could die.  I have no idea how to report any of that because technically its not illegal enough for anyone to care.\n\nI have another friend who has guns and has gone full on mass shooter schizo with like, paranoid delusions and he cut off all his friends and blames the whole world around him for his problems and hates everyone / has no respect for life, hes also suicidal.  I honestly believe hell kill someone, could be me because he decided to hate me, might be himself or anyone he has a grudge against, but theres literally nothing I can do about it because none of it is illegal unless he makes a specific threat or kills someone",
            "At what extent is it time to contact officials, because personally i am having trouble to pass the feeling that i am overreacting. I recently witness a classmate who sat in front of me searching up gun ranges. And now everytime i go into class i immediately spot him to sit away from him, and he is in everyone of my classes.",
            "I tried to report someone, and The Suicide Watch mods  said this isn't true and to report directly to reddit admins. They then suggested that mass murder ideation is OK and told me I was creating a panic. I'm confused.",
            "Befriend them and snitch on them. I heard that one dude wanted to shoot up his school and they found out when he was alone his friend and 2 others heard the potential shooter say, I wish I can shoot myself and everyone here they werent playing and immediately swat surrounded the school and locked the kid up. Not taking chances",

            "Not serious for me to actually report. but I remember someone in my room said they wanted to shoot up the school and everyone in my class."
