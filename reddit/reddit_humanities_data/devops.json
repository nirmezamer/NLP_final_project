This roadmap is controversial, as it may be too use-case specific, but serves as a good starting point for what tools are currently in use by companies.\n* [This comment by /u/mdaffin](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/abcyl2/sorry_having_a_midlife_tech_crisis/eczhsu1/) - just remember, DevOps is a mindset to solving problems. It's less about the specific tools you know or the certificates you have, as it is the way you approach problem solving.\n* [This comment by /u/jpswade](https://gist.github.com/jpswade/4135841363e72ece8086146bd7bb5d91) - what is DevOps and associated terminology.\n* [Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/devops) - Step by step guide for DevOps or any other Operations Role\n\nRemember: DevOps as a term and as a practice is still in flux, and is more about culture change than it is specific tooling. As such, specific skills and tool-sets are not universal, and recommendations for them should be taken only as suggestions.\n\n**Please keep this on topic (as a reference for those new to devops).**",

        "content": "We stand with the disabled users of reddit and in our community. Starting July 1, Reddit's API policy blind/visually impaired communities will be more dependent on sighted people for moderation. When Reddit says they are whitelisting accessibility apps for the disabled, they are not telling the full story.\nTL;DR\n\n    Starting July 1, Reddit's API policy will force blind/visually impaired communities to further depend on sighted people for moderation\n\n    When reddit says they are whitelisting accessibility apps, they are not telling the full story, because Apollo, RIF, Boost, Sync, etc. are the apps r/Blind users have overwhelmingly listed as their apps of choice with better accessibility, and Reddit is not whitelisting them. Reddit has done a good job hiding this fact, by inventing the expression \"accessibility apps.\"\n\n    Forcing disabled people, especially profoundly disabled people, to stop using the app they depend on and have become accustomed to is cruel; for the most profoundly disabled people, June 30 may be the last day they will be able to access reddit communities that are important to them.\n\nIf you've been living under a rock for the past few weeks:\n\nReddit abruptly announced that they would be charging astronomically overpriced API fees to 3rd party apps, cutting off mod tools for NSFW subreddits (not just porn subreddits, but subreddits that deal with frank discussions about NSFW topics).\n\nAnd worse, blind redditors & blind mods [including mods of r/Blind and similar communities] will no longer have access to resources that are desperately needed in the disabled community.\nWhy does our community care about blind users?\n\nAs a mod from r/foodforthought testifies:\n\n    I was raised by a 30-year special educator, I have a deaf mother-in-law, sister with MS, and a brother who was born disabled. None vision-impaired, but a range of other disabilities which makes it clear that corporations are all too happy to cut deals (and corners) with the cheapest/most profitable option, slap a \"handicap accessible\" label on it, and ignore the fact that their so-called \"accessible\" solution puts the onus on disabled individuals to struggle through poorly designed layouts, misleading marketing, and baffling management choices. To say it's exhausting and humiliating to struggle through a world that able-bodied people take for granted is putting it lightly.\n\nReddit apparently forgot that blind people exist, and forgot that Reddit's official app (which has had over 9 YEARS of development) and yet, when it comes to accessibility for vision-impaired users, Reddit\u2019s own platforms are inconsistent and unreliable. ranging from poor but tolerable for the average user and mods doing basic maintenance tasks (Android) to almost unusable in general (iOS).\nDidn't reddit whitelist some \"accessibility apps?\"\n\nThe CEO of Reddit announced that they would be allowing some \"accessible\" apps free API usage: RedReader, Dystopia, and Luna.\n\nThere's just one glaring problem: RedReader, Dystopia, and Luna* apps have very basic functionality for vision-impaired users (text-to-voice, magnification, posting, and commenting) but none of them have full moderator functionality, which effectively means that subreddits built for vision-impaired users can't be managed entirely by vision-impaired moderators.\n\n(If that doesn't sound so bad to you, imagine if your favorite hobby subreddit had a mod team that never engaged with that hobby, did not know the terminology for that hobby, and could not participate in that hobby -- because if they participated in that hobby, they could no longer be a moderator.)\n\nThen Reddit tried to smooth things over with the moderators of r/blind. The results were... Messy and unsatisfying, to say the least.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/14ds81l/rblinds_meetings_with_reddit_and_the_current/\n\n*Special shoutout to Luna, which appears to be hustling to incorporate features that will make modding easier but will likely not have those features up and running by the July 1st deadline, when the very disability-friendly Apollo app, RIF, etc. will cease operations. We see what Luna is doing and we appreciate you, but a multimillion dollar company should not have have dumped all of their accessibility problems on what appears to be a one-man mobile app developer. RedReader and Dystopia have not made any apparent efforts to engage with the r/Blind community.\n\nThank you for your time & your patience.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/14n6ghq)",

            "I just have a question to Crossplane users here.\n\nHow do you bootstrap your crossplane controller?",
            "On my previous job we had lots of SWE teams and the company wanted to standardize how infra is deployed, we had some platform based security stamped TF modules that were deployed from spinnaker to a humongous amount of aws accounts but that didn't work well.  Then crossplane came up a year and a half ago, they wanted it directly in prod to replace tf solution. We tried a poc of mapping our sqs module. The tf module was provisioning an sqs and dlq. Trickery with resource policies for standard list of IAM roles grant and an escape hatch for adding additional access and some other stuff. The main issue were dynamic resource policies and having an optional DLQ by passing a simple parameter in a claim. This you can't build using crossplane xrds since there's no such thing as for loops and stuff - it is quite poor on features their xrd syntax. So to do the same dynamic thing that we did with TF is definitely was not possible at the time with what was there features-wise. I know they released crospplane functions that you can build yourself and deploy together with your crossplane - then it was in some early alpha, they actually had quite a thread in an issue about Turing complete features and how they don't want to find themselves in Hashicorp's place. But maaan, I have to write this basic stuff myself with functions? And if I want something more sophisticated? Also I specifically had a concern about the size of etcd with the amount of infra we were deploying. Also amount of logs and cluster cpu load. This thing had to be something distributed with a control plane or something and the product (crossplane I mean) wasn't ready for this kind of use, not from docs stand point nor security compliance and so on.\nAnd yes - as mentioned in another comment - you can't see if you are actually updating an existing resource or doing a destroy/create. And since this thing was designed in our case to be uses for allowing SWE teams to deploy their infra on their own this would end up badly since they often don't know what they are doing. With TF at least this is predictable in 99 percent of the cases.",
