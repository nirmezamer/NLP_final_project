If I was to suggest a change, it'd be to the entry on Virtual Machines:\n\n\"A Virtual Machine (VM) is a logically-defined approach to computing which enables the flexible use of physical architecture to service multiple functions. By sharing a pool of physical resources (such as CPU, RAM, and disks) multiple machines can run simultaneously, increasing resource utilisation efficiency and functionality, without the need for separate computers.\"\n\nThis definition is about what a VM can do, not about what a VM is (apart from a \"logically defined approach to computing\"). I'd change the first part to something like:\n\n\"A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software version of a computer system emulated on a real computer. Use of VMs allow multiple versions of computer systems to be run simultaneously on the same hardware. These versions can be the same as the underlying 'real' architecture, or emulate different architecture, allowing for software designed for one system to be run on another. \"",
