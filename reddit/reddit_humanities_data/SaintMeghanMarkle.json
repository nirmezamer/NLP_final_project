And even though the color was TOTALLY inappropriate, I thought she looked really good in that red number she wore to the concert where she thought she got a Standing O. It's such a shame, because there are clothes and techniques for literally every shape and size out there that make a person shine and her style used to make her shine and she pooped it all away.",

I can't remember her exact words, but I think she heavily implied some dishonesty on VG's end and that it was all part of a plan or some sort. Correct me if I am wrong. What do others think of this? I don't know VG obviously, but she was definitely underage when JE recruited her so EVEN if VG wanted to do things for him, or even if she thought that's what she wanted, and even if she KNEW that it wasn't just massages, she was under the age of consent and could not legally consent and therefore it was a crime on JE's end.

        "content": "Yesterday, I posted an opinion that is called Courage & Honor. \n\nSince then, I received suggestions from our fellow Sinners to send it to The Pat Tillman Foundation, various media, etc. Another Sinner posted a piece relating to a Daily Mail article on Pat McAffee\u2019s reaction to Harry receiving the Espy Award.\n\nOur group is an oasis to come to because we are a collective of voices who feel something missing in our world today- common sense, decency, dignity, respect and truth. Not \u201cher truth\u201d or \u201chis truth\u201d, but THE TRUTH. Truth that is backed by receipts, and not by anyone\u2019s distorted version of reality.\n\n If you read my post, you know that the Pat Tillman Award should not be given to Harry, as he is not worthy or deserving of it. A petition to ESPN is on Change.org, and it wants 2500 signatures, and currently has 2,185. 315 signatures are needed to achieve goal. Would it be too much to ask for those who don\u2019t want to see Pat Tillman\u2019s name be dishonored, let alone the legacy this young man has left behind to be blemished, because an award is being given to a person who is the antithesis of Pat and all he stood for? I suppose one can say the award\u2019s purpose is being markled.\n\nEven if Harry receives the award, at least we can say we are standing up for Pat Tillman\u2019s memory by being vocal about dishonoring Pat, our veterans, and to all those whose voices have gone quiet because of their selfless contributions.\n\nThe link to Change.org is here\n\nhttps://www.change.org/p/request-espn-to-rethink-awarding-the-pat-tillman-award-to-prince-harry/c\n\nThanks to Patti Minkel who started the petition, and to all who have signed.",

We have all read comments from people who served with hasno just how cosseted his time in Afghanistan was. His brother actually obtained his pilots licence and used it to help British people. Yet the halfwit continues to buy awards or have strings pulled behind the scenes to be given awards. He can\u2019t do anything on his own to deserve an award, he claims IG as his, but how much organising work does he do? He shows up with the fame whore in tow and takes centre stage as if it was all his hard work that ensured the games take place. He should be ashamed of himself and the skank.",

I understand that it's highly unlikely there will be a change, but now I hope that Harry is made aware of just how angry and hurt so many are over him receiving a stolen award!  I want it to make him uncomfortable and I want it to tarnish him receiving the award.  It's as if he cheated in some way to get first place.  Like taking steroids to get the gold medal.  I want Disney and ESPN to know people are angry about this and are willing to stand up, and have their voices heard.  Remember....silence is compliance!",

Thank you and I look forward to hopefully seeing a resolution to this absolute travesty of a coveted award that goes to a deserving person, not to a fraudulent anti-royal that has no business buying and accepting an award of this magnitude.

        "content": "Dear Disney and ESPN\n\nOver the last 24hrs, I've learnt a lot about Pat Tillman,  as a Brit, I'd never heard of him, so I'm grateful for raising awareness of HIM. I'd never heard of the award in his honour.\n\nBut as a Brit, I had heard of Helen Rollason, the first Female to become a mainstream commentator in British sport and broke down many barriers.  She sadly died in 1999 of Cancer whilst still in her early 40s. \n\nHer colleagues at the BBC crested an award in her honour to recognise people who shown great resilience and overcome challenges to promote sport, not just in the UK.\n\nSome recent recipients include Billy Monger, a talented young race car driver who lost both his legs at the age of 17 and still races now or Doddie Weir and Rob Burrow who both have done so much to raise awareness of MND/ALS and have both since passed away. \n\nOK there are a couple of mistakes,  Oscar Pistorius received his award 6 years before he shot his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp and it's right that we mention her name to not let her be forgotten. \n\nBut I want to draw your attention to the 2014 winner, where the award was presented to the Invictus Games Competitors - not the Patron, those who actually competed, all of them winners or not, from all 14 countries. \n\nIf you want to save face - follow suit, support the Competitors of the Warrior Games or Invictus - get some of them on stage.\n\nThere's still time to fix this.\n\n(Edited to correct typos)",

            "Excellent.  A lot of these organisations will double down when faced with (well deserved) criticism but to go in with a real solution, the opportunity for them to not lose face? That\u2019s got a much better chance of being heard. \n\nNice work",

            "ESPN and it's parent company Disney are fully captured by the progressive left in the U.S. For whatever reason the progressive left is duped by Madam's hokey and fake appeals to racial and anti-poverty issues. These are people that don't realize Hamas will kill gay people as fast or faster than they'll kill a Jewish person though. I think they see it as some sort of positive to have a British Duchess in Congress one day representing some super blue district. So they are trying to prop the Montecito Grifters up in their time of need. Fortunately, the progressive left's power in the U.S. is currently waning like Madam's.\u00a0",
            "I am old enough to remember when this happened to Pat Tillman, a true hero for wanting to serve his country after giving up a 3.6 million dollar a year football contract. He was killed by friendly-fire but it was covered up for a while. What his poor parents and widow must have had to go through. They must be so disappointed and disheartened that his award goes to Harry who is a traitor to his own family and country."
