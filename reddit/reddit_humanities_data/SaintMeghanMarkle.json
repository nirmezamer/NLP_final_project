But instead let's give it to Prince Harry...'**\u00a0\n\n**Replying to his buddy's point McAfee suggested to just 'make up' an award for Prince Harry.**\u00a0\n\n**'How about it's like ESPY for royal family member who doesn't want to be called ''royal family member'' who loves sports,' he said.**\n\n&#x200B;",
