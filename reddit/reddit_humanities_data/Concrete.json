        "content": "DIY FAQ\n\nLadies and gentlemen, I present below my humble attempt to try and keep from answering the same GD questions every day.  DIY types, please let me know if there's anything you'd like to see covered.  Here we go:\n\nBefore we even begin, the Number One question we see here on /r/Concrete is this:\n\n**My new concrete is splotchy!  Did my contractor screw up?**\n\nNo, he did not.  New concrete loses a full letter grade in appearance in the first 24 hours.  It gains that letter grade back over the first month.  Splotches, brush/broom marks, little pebbles and pills of concrete are all part of the process.  If it still looks bad after a month of traffic, you MAY have a legitimate gripe about the appearance.\n\n_____\n\nWith that out of the way, we can get started.\n\n**The Do-it-yourself FAQ**\n\n**What is concrete?**\nHere's an excellent 9-minute video that summarizes it nicely: [What is Concrete?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOHURuAf5iY)\n\n**I want to pour a patio.  Can I do it myself?**\n\nThe short answer is yes.  However, if you want your concrete to look professional, hire a professional.  There is an entire trade and skillset that are part of placing and finishing concrete.  If it comes out looking bad, it's going to look bad for a long, long time.\n\n**I don't care, I'm going to forge ahead.  What do I need to get ready?**\n\nHere's an excellent 14-minute video put together by a concrete contractor:  [How to Pour a Concrete backyard Patio Slab [Beginner Guide]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp4xBvQ3Djc)\n\nThe first thing you need to do is clear out any grass or organic material like topsoil under your concrete.  Concrete needs a solid base to sit on, and grass, etc will eventually rot and leave voids under your patio.  That's bad.  Along with that, you need a well-compacted subgrade for your concrete to sit on.  You can use a [hand tamper](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Kobalt-10-in-x-10-in-Tampers/1000377405?cm_mmc=shp-_-c-_-prd-_-sol-_-google-_-lia-_-106-_-lawnandgardentools-_-1000377405-_-0&placeholder=null&ds_rl=1286981&gclid=CjwKCAjwq7aGBhADEiwA6uGZpxa94kFjciLwLBZGmHxGhK8sJn15NRQ4uarU2US-GcOtSkTuSsiKuxoCSg4QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) or rent a [plate compactor](https://www.toolots.com/compacting-machine-c90-vibrating-petrol-road-plate-compactor.html?cid=1469602932&gclid=CjwKCAjwq7aGBhADEiwA6uGZpzE_ScnX9kGsQcjoM3BUQn0phqArN4IHCZV0xSOvF2dgysE3JbhmbxoCQywQAvD_BwE).  Having a well-compacted subgrade is going to have a significant effect on the useful life of your (in this case) patio.\n\nThe second thing is to consider drainage.  When it rains, where is the water going to go as it collects on your patio?  Hint:  You don't want it going into your house, so slope your concrete away from your back door.  And any outdoor concrete needs to slope SOMEWHERE.  Don't make it flat.  A good slope is 1-2 percent, or between 1/8 and 1/4 of an inch per foot.  If your patio is 10 feet wide, the far edge needs to be 1-1/4\" to 2-1/2\" lower than the near edge.  You'll need to slope your subgrade to drain so your concrete maintains a consistent thickness.\n\nNow you're ready to set a form.  For a patio, a 2x4 is usually sufficient.  Just hold it a half inch off the ground to get a full 4 inch thickness.  Don't worry, the concrete will be stiff enough that it shouldn't be a problem.  If you're still worried, you can just shovel a little dirt, gravel, etc up against the back of the form for belt and suspenders.\n\nYour formwork needs to be STRAIGHT and SQUARE.  You need a stringline, your eye isn't that good.  Drive a nail partway into the corner of your form board at one end and another nail at the other corner.  Stretch your line from one end to the other, leaving it some known distance away from the actual form board.  I usually go with 1/8\" because it's easy to \"eyeball\" that measurement.\n\nOne of the cool things about construction layout is the 3-4-5 triangle.  It just so happens that a triangle that has sides of 3-4-5 makes a perfect right angle between the 3 and the 4 sides.  This can be inches, feet, centimeters or miles.  As long as the proportions are increments of 3-4-5 you can lay out a perfect 90-degree angle.  Here's a 4-minute video demonstrating:  [How To Make A Perfect Right Angle [3-4-5 Method]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eajEY8WbVwc)\n\nYour form needs to be able to withstand several hundred pounds of pressure, both vertically and horizontally.  I know that sounds like a lot, but it's true.  When in doubt, put some extra stakes in.  You'll probably never know if your form was too strong, but you'll know immediately if it was too weak.\n\nReinforcing--you need it.  More is better.  For a 4-inch patio, I'd suggest at a minimum 6x6, W2.9 wire mesh.  You won't find it at the big box store.  You'll have to go to a contractor's supply type place.  Some national retailers are CMC, HD Supply/White Cap and Ram Tool.  Or you can just find a local concrete supply place in your town.  Some people prefer rebar, and that's even better.  If you go that route, #3 bars every 18\" is a good starting point.\n\n**Okay, I'm all formed up and have my reinforcing in place.  What now?**\n\nWell, now you need to call the ready mix plant.  They're the ones who will bring you the concrete.  When you call, the dispatcher will know pretty quickly that you're a DIYer and may be a little curt with you.  Cut him some slack.  You'll be ordering your concrete from them, and are subject to their availability, so you need to understand that even though you wanted to pour your patio tomorrow morning at 7am, they may not be able to get your concrete to you.\n\nThe 2 things you need to know before you pick up the phone to the ready mix plant are How Much and What Kind.\n\n**How much?**\n\nConcrete is sold by the Cubic Yard (or Cubic Meter).  You need to calculate the volume of concrete you need before you call.  In our patio example (10x20 patio, 4 inches thick), your calculation will be 10 x 20 x .33=66 cubic feet.  Notice that the thickness value wasn't 4.  4 is the thickness in INCHES, a very common mistake.  Anyway, there are 27 cubic feet in a cubic yard (3x3x3, duh), so that gives us a concrete volume of 2.444 cubic yards.  Admittedly, the metric calculation (like almost all metric calculations) is much easier, but let's roll with it.  You can't order 2.444 cubic yards, and you wouldn't want to anyway--you need a little extra in case you messed up somewhere.  I add 10% for slab pours and round up to the next yard.  In this case, we'll be ordering 3 cubic yards.\n\n**What kind?**\n\nThere are literally hundreds of recipes for concrete, called mix designs, available at your ready mix plant.  For our example, we want a 4000 psi, air entrained mix.  4000 psi is the design strength of the mix, meaning that if we were to cure this concrete under laboratory conditions, it would withstand a compressive load of 4000 psi.  That's pretty awesome.  Because this concrete is outdoors, we want air entrainment in the mix.  It's basically a chemical that causes lots of very tiny bubbles throughout the concrete.  This gives it some resistance to freeze/thaw.  It also makes it harder to get a smooth finish but we don't care about that.  We're not hard troweling any outdoor concrete.  We don't want it so slick that you'll slip and fall after a couple of red wines at your New Patio Party.\n\n**Why do I want 4000 psi?  Isn't 3000 psi cheaper?\n\nYes, but only by about 3%.  You're obviously a cheapskate because you're voluntarily taking on this backbreaking job, but come on.  Nobody's THAT cheap.\n\n**Okay, concrete is ordered.  What do I need to do?**\n\nFirst things first:  You need to know how the concrete is going to make it from the truck into your form.  As a DIYer, you have basically 2 options:  Tailgating or wheelbarrows.\n\n**Tailgating:**\n\nThis is the VERY MUCH preferred option.  You'll just put some chutes on the back of the truck and dump it right into the form.  Some things to watch out for, though, is splatter.  As the concrete comes out of the chute, it's going to fall off in chunks and splatter around,  You don\u2019t want anything around, like cars, patio furniture, etc. nearby that isn't covered.\n\n**Wheelbarrows:**\n\nThis pretty much sucks.  If your patio is inaccessible by concrete truck, you're going to have to wheel it.  This is going to double your labor force.  In order to keep things moving at a decent pace, you're going to need 2 wheelbarrows plus one for every 40 feet of distance.  Also, you need to consider that a wheelbarrow that's about 2/3 full of concrete weighs SIX HUNDRED POUNDS and is not for the faint of heart or weak of back. Also, wherever you're loading your wheelbarrows needs to have a sheet of plywood down or something.  Some concrete will inevitably drip off the chute.\n\nYou need to have a spot for your concrete truck to wash out.  It can be as simple as giving the driver a wheelbarrow that he can fill with water and concrete slurry, but you need to have a spot to dispose of it.  And if you do it in a storm drain I'm going to hit you with a comealong.  Don't be a jerk.\n\n**Holy shit, concrete's here!  What do I do?**\n\nAs previously discussed, the first step is getting the concrete in the form.  Here's a good 10-minute video: [How To Pour And Finish A Concrete Patio (Against A House)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc53qnlIj-Q)\n\nDon\u2019t let the video fool you.  This is more difficult than it looks.  I'd like to just take a moment once more to implore you to hire a professional before you take this on yourself.  Like I said, if it looks bad it\u2019s going to look bad for a long, long time.\n\n**Okay, concrete has been screeded, floated, troweled (and broomed).  What next?**\n\nYour concrete has SET, but it has not CURED.  There's one final step in the placement and finishing process: curing of the new concrete.\n\n**How do I cure my new patio?**\n\nThere are old-school methods, high-speed methods and plain old dumb ways to cure concrete.  The easiest way is to apply a curing compound to your slab.  It is basically a coating that keeps water from evaporating from the surface of the slab, causing it to shrink.  It also traps the available water molecules inside the concrete, giving them the best chance to react with the cement, further hardening your concrete.  If you live in an arid climate, some kind of curing procedure is an absolute must.\n\n_____\n**\"I hired a conctractor\" FAQ**\n\n**My concrete is still splotchy in color/I can see shadows of the rocks.  Did my contractor screw up?**\nProbably not.  Color variations are perfectly normal over the first few days and/or weeks.  If your concrete is less than a month old, wait until it is.  Also, there is no guarantee that 2 concrete pours will be a perfect color match, but they will very likely even out to the point that you can't tell the difference.\n\n**The broom finish looks weird on my driveway.  What do I do?**\nNothing.  In 6 months of traffic the \"lines\" in the broom finish all kind of fade away and just leave a lightly textured surface.\n\n**I got a quote for a job and I think it's too high.  What do I do?**\nRead the DIY FAQ and do it yourself.\n\nHere's another excellent reply from a /r/Concrete regular:\n\nYou are getting the contractor minimum price.\n\nAs contractors, we make money on square footage, so if there isn't significant square footage, we just charge a flat fee. It takes the same excavation equipment, trucks and pouring equipment, and almost the same labor to do a 10 x 10 slab as it does to do a 20 x 20 slab, and the 10 x 10 is 1/4 of the size. While the amount of concrete required is 4 times as much, all of the other costs are virtually the same.\n\nIn addition, the redi- mix company charges a fee for short loads because it costs them the same amount of fuel, and almost the same labor to deliver a yard of concrete as it does 10 yards. This means the contractor is ordering 1.25 yards for your job but is paying the same amount that he would for three yards of concrete.\n\nThis is what is referred to as economics of scale. If a builder is contracted to create a building, the larger it is, the less it costs per square foot to build. While the larger building costs more overall, it is less money per square foot to build than the smaller building. This principle applies to many industries outside of construction.\n\n**Does this (insert photo here) look okay to you?**\nIt's really helpful to see the \"defect\" you're asking about from a variety of distances and perspectives.  But to answer your question, yes, it's fine.\n\n**The sides of my patio look all messy now that the forms are removed.  Did my contractor screw up?**\nPlease see [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/Concrete/comments/17p3nwc/is_this_normal/) for a visual representation.  The answer is, it depends.  What does your agreement say?  In all likelihood, you just need to add a little soil to grade your yard up to the elevation of your new patio.  This should be discussed with your contractor before the pour.  Having said that, your concrete guy should clean up all the concrete overpour (boogers) that inevitably find their way onto the ground just outside the form.  Just make sure it's discussed beforehand.\n\n**My contractor poured a slab last month, and now it has a crack in it!  What do I do?**\nWell, there are three certainties about concrete: it will get hard, it will crack and no one's going to steal it.  Very likely the crack you're seeing is a normal, if regrettable part of the curing process.  As excess water not used by the hydration reaction wicks out of the concrete, it shrinks a little.  If the distance from the edge of the pour to that spot is too great, the concrete literally pulls itself apart.  The good news is that 19 times out of 20, it's nothing much to worry about structurally.  That's why we generally put reinforcing in the concrete, and attempt to mitigate that situation with control and expansion joints.\n\n**What's a control joint?**\nA control joint is a spot in your pour where the contractor deliberately makes it \"easy\" for the concrete to crack along a nice, straight line.  In the case of sidewalks, for instance, he uses a grooving tool to \"cut\" the sidewalk into 4-foot panels.  In larger pours, perhaps he will use a concrete saw.  This https://imgur.com/a/6xXrQIF/ is an example of a control joint in a sidewalk doing its job.\n\n**What's an expansion joint?**\nAn expansion joint is needed every few control joints.  As your concrete gets warmer and cooler, like every substance in the universe, it will grow and shrink.  The expansion joints are there to provide a cushion for the panels in your driveway to grow and shrink against each other.  In a 4-inch thick patio or driveway, an expansion joint every 4 control joints should be sufficient, but that's just a rule of thumb.  Your contractor will know better than you or I about the conditions in your area.\n\n**How often should I have control joints?**\nThe rule of thumb is the thickness in inches, multiplied by 3, in feet.  So, a 4-inch pour would have control joints every 12 feet.  This rule is by no means hard and fast, and the local procedures will vary.\n\n**My concrete cracked, even though the contractor installed control joints.**\nWell, that kind of sucks, but it does happen.  See the above answer regarding cracks.\n\n**THE WRITTEN AGREEMENT (Contract)**\nYes, you need a written agreement.  Yes, it will have some language on it that you likely don't understand.  Yes, it needs to be signed by you and the contractor.\n\nSome things that need to be on the agreement:\nThe exact scope of work--Exactly what is Joe Concrete going to do for you?\t\n\n* How many SF is it?\n* How thick?\n* What type of concrete is he using (psi, fly ash, etc)?\n* What will it be reinforced with?  Rebar or mesh?  What type and spacing?\n* Will there be any expansion joints?  How many feet?  Where are they going?\n* What about control joints?  Tooled or sawn?  What spacing?\n* Will the concrete slope away from the house?\n* Will there be stairs?\n* What type of finish will be on your concrete?  Smooth trowel?  Light broom?\n*If the concrete is stamped?  What pattern?  What colors?  Integral or shake-on?\n\nOnce that is established, you need to know how Joe Concrete is going to do the work.\n\n* How will he access the back yard?\n* Will the concrete be placed by wheelbarrow, buggy or pump?\n* Will he have to remove a fence?  Who's putting it back?\n* Does he have a place to wash out trucks?\n\nAfter Joe is done, what will he do?\n\n* Will he wreck his own forms?  Clean up overpour?\n* Backfill around the edges?  With what?\n* Haul away any debris, or just leave it for your trash pickup?\n* What will he do to fix your yard after he tears it up with his equipment?\n\nAnd, some General Conditions-type stuff, like:\n\n* Will Joe provide a Port A John, or will his guys just run down to the gas station at the end of the block?\n* If required, will Joe procure the necessary permits?  Do you care if he does not?\n* Does Joe carry Contractor's General Liability and Worker's Comp insurance?  What are the limits of those policies?\n\nFinally, the price:\n\tThere needs to be a draw schedule shown.  For example, 10% when you sign the agreement, 25% when the demo is finished, etc.\n\nTHERE NEEDS TO BE AN AMOUNT OF RETAINAGE ON THE AGREEMENT.  This is the last draw, usually 10%, that is Joe's profit on the job.  Yes, dear Homeowner, the profit margin on this backbreaking work averages out to about 10%.  Retainage is an incentive for Joe to come and address any small defects, splatter on your windows, fix landscaping, etc.  This is done via a Punch List.\n\n**What is a Punch List?**\n\nThe Punch List is the things that Joe needs to complete in order to be paid his retainage.  It is up to you, dear Homeowner, to prepare this list in as precise (and concise) a manner as possible.  You get ONE SHOT at this.  Once Joe does everything on the list, he is contractually owed his final draw.  You don't get to call him back out 4 more times because you forgot to add items to your punch list.  So, identify whatever it is (concrete spatter on the window, form not wrecked, overpour not cleaned up, etc) with a written description, a location and a photo.  Compile your list and put it into an email.  Let it sit overnight.  Then read the draft of your email and ask yourself if Joe will understand everything on this list and, more importantly, will he be able to effectively communicate the items on the list with the guy(s) who will actually be coming out to punch out your job.  You cannot be too clear.  \"Three dime-sized bits of spatter, lower left corner of dining room window\" kind of thing.\n\t\nTry not to beat Joe over the head with this punch list.  He works hard and has done his damnedest to do you a good job.  It's very easy for homeowners to get power-trippy at this stage of the game, particularly if the job didn't quite go as planned.  Don't be that guy.\n\n* My job has a material defect (excessive birdbath, wonky stamp pattern in one spot, excessive/not enough slope) but it's not a total shit-show.  What do I do?\nThe FIRST THING to do is to call your contractor.  Usually these things can be negotiated away between you and him.  He doesn't want to remove and replace an entire patio because there's a birdbath in one corner, and it's unreasonable of you to ask him to.  So y'all put your heads together and figure it out.  Generally there are 3 things that can be done:\n\n* Overlay--apply a repair mortar over the affected area and try to match the finish as closely as possible.  This is a good solution, and the least burdensome on the contractor but the patch will ALWAYS be a slightly different color than the existing concrete.\n* Remove and replace the affected area--Significantly more expensive for the contractor, and the replaced area won't quite match the rest of the pour, but if the defect is more severe, this is an option.\n* Credit--the contractor just gives you back a few bucks and you just sweep the water off when it rains.\n\n99 times of 100, one or a combination of these solutions is enough to both satisfy you and keep your contractor out of bankruptcy.",

        "content": "Note: this is usually completed about a week or so after concrete placement.   For whatever reason, these tendons were cut and capped before they were stressed.  The builder realized the foundation was never certified, so they had to locate all of the live ends, chip out the grout and pull them.  \n",

            "Thanks for sharing! It\u2019s refreshing to see our tradesman doing what we do beyond the residential stuff.  \n\nI have nightmares of installing tendons as a greenhorn. Going home absolutely covered in grease..",
            "I used to work at a company that did flat panels for tilt up construction. 120' steel bed, we'd set gates , rebar and run the cables before lunch - they would tension the cables while we took lunch, then more rebar and start pouring. \n\nWe would turn the bed around every day. They had a steam system that would heat it up and dry it over night. Come back in the morning, cut the cables between the gates with a torch and they would suck up a little bit back into the slab. Crane would lift them out then we'd repeat. God awful fucking work in the heat of the summer when the bed was 200 degrees and you're spraying release oil onto it before setting it up again.",
            "Seems extremely dangerous?\n\nHow does this add strength to the slab if it\u2019s already dry?",
            "As a structural inspector, we would have to come monitor/sign off on this exact practice. This process is only used as a follow-up procedure - If one or more tendons were measured to be understressed when checking the whole foundation, the stress crew would come back out and re-stress the tendon(s) in question.\n\nWe would document (photograph) the calibration sheet for the ram, and visually confirm the PSI gauge on the ram as they added stress to the tendons.\n\nIn a normal stressing situation, the crew comes out a few weeks after the pour, stress ALL tendons, and an inspector comes by after the fact and measures the cables for the proper elongation before they cut/grout the live ends. If any cables are measured to be understressed (there\u2019s a formula for how much cable should be exposed after stress, based on tendon length), that\u2019s when a crew would come back out and have to chip the grout to expose and stress the tendon.",
            "What holds the tension after the hyd ram is removed?",
            "I've seen many cables stressed on the cast in place jobs. \n\n1. I have never seen 1 stressed like this, it works, but it seems like they're jerry rigging it. Did the cable break, or was it that short?\n\n2. I've never seen any cables stressed that late in construction when stone in on this building, usually done after the 80% break test.\n\nI'll give them credit for the ingenuity for stressing the cables.",
            "Not like this",
            "No, but I've seen what happens when a blown hydraulic hose sprays an eyeball.",
            "Looks like another fellow Keller employee   \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb",
            "Something doesn\u2019t add up, they usually stick out 2-3\u2019. Somebody cut them and underpinned without stressing them?"
