        "content": "Hi All, Have been going through a real dark time at the moment and would love some advice or any insight for those who may have had a similar experience.   \n  \nMy Mum, whom I now live with and care for full time has dementia and I've been looking after for many years. Though unfortunately it's getting to the stage that it's almost an untenable arrangement and really taking a brutal toll on me. I left my stable full time job to look after her and now am in a predicament.   \n  \nI've been looking at homes/aged care/ etc but there seems to be massive disadvantages and minefields where I could lose the family home to leverage this endeavour.   \n  \nHas anyone navigated a similar path before or can recommend a financial planner or accountant that has knowledge in this sort of situation?   \n  \nOr any advice at all would really help. Really feeling lost and just want to make sure I don't make any mistakes.",

            "We used a company called Age Care Directions to navigate the process when my Dad had to go into care. It cost about $1000 10 years ago, so youd probably be up for a couple of grand now, but it was completely worth it, they were brilliant.",
            "Have you been in touch with Carers SA?",
            "I wish you all the best. I'm an only child and my mother has recently been diagnosed with Alzheimer's. This is a such a scary thing to navigate and to see happen to the people you love. So far have engaged doctors and got her registered at my aged care, though nothing has come from this yet. I believe as you need it you can contact them, get as assessment and then can lodge for assistance and payments for things as you need them. \n\nI have nothing but the best wishes for you and pray where you can find moments of respite and joy you embrace them.",
            "How long have you lived with her? The family home might be exempt if you have lived there for a certain period of time.  \n\nGood luck for the future, the aged care system is confusing at the best of times.",
            "Sending you a warm hug  ",
            "Have you gone through my aged care? Maybe you can keep her at home with help and one of their level 4 packages?",
            "If u can afford a RAP it will be fine.  Get an ACAT assessment for her and start looking at homes for respite.  If she is on the pension u can get 3 months paid for by the government",
            "If she is above 65yrs old, she may be eligible for the home care package program if you choose to have her at home. As someone mentioned above, get a GP to have a thorough medical history, then contact My Aged Care. This process takes time. You can choose a reliable licensed provider to help you through the application process, and I believe it is a free consultation. While you are waiting for the package to be approved you can call Carer Program to get respite care to help you for a short term. I dont know the process for residential care, hope someone on here can help you.\nCaring for someone living with dementia could be very tiring and stressful from time to time you will need to look after yourself too. Dementia Australia has a lot of resources to help carers like you.\nAll the best!",
            "If you are looking for an aged care facility the best I've been to (and I used to work for a homecare provider) is Eldercare the Lodge on King William Rd. My grandmother was there until she passed recently. It wasn't perfect but they have excellent staff that are caring and go the extra mile. Every time I visited I was always impressed by the staff.  It wasn't cheap though. Good luck.",
            "If you haven't already, get in touch with Carers SA, they may be able to provide some guidance or assistance."
