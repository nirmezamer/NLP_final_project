        "content": " \n\n**Update: Bloons TD 6 v43.1 - Update Notes!**\n\n# Changes\n\n* Fixed some idle animation loop issues with Rosalia so she no longer visually freezes\n* Rosalia should now play sound on target priority arrows (first, last, close, strong)\n* Extended the Resolution Selection UI as the last option was not visible on all resolutions\n* Resolved a crash that could occur using the \"Restrict\" button in Edit Odyssey menu\n* Players are no longer unable to view the team page for teams they have applied to\n* Standard game hints will no longer display during Boss Rush even when enabled\n* Team Message Board has been updated with better descriptions for \u2018Improved Scores\u2019\n* Relics on the Boss Rush Milestone Complete screen can now display their description\n* Paragons are now correctly localized in the Challenge Editor Tower Restrictions UI\n* Corrected an issue causing a large number of \u2018things\u2019 to not work as normally expected\n   * The main note here is for 'changed CHIMPS starts' on many expert maps. This occurred in 43.0 due to work in the background of the game rebuilding older more rigid parts to be more flexible and moddable, one improvement also caused a number of strange issues including collision detection to be checked slightly less frequently and wasn't noticeable in most cases aside from the very precise requirements of high end chimps maps.\n   * We are now looking into incorporating some of these 'precise CHIMPS starts' into automated testing to catch strange niche situations like this earlier in the future\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nFull list of changes for update 43.0 can be found here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/btd6/comments/1d3029q/update\\_bloons\\_td\\_6\\_v430\\_update\\_notes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/btd6/comments/1d3029q/update_bloons_td_6_v430_update_notes/)",

            "shoutout ninjakiwi team for being so fast to fixing a bug like the chimps starts \n\nthis is why you guys are the goat ! ! !",
            "auto-checking expert chimps starts for updates is a very cool idea",
            "Now this mini update is awesome. Good explanation with the whole issue with ruined precise CHIMPS starts and the issues behind the bug. Also, your efforts to automate CHIMPS starts as part of your game testing is a brilliant idea.",
            "There was a bug i think i ran into whilst playing Rosalia, and it's that the keybind that allows her to switch between weapons (i think its Monkey Special 1 or 2) doesn't work when trying to switch from the Laser pistol to the grenade launcher. Little tiny thing that would help me be able to manage her better. Thanks for fixing these issues so quickly as well!",
            "Other game devs: Oh, there's a bug you found? Wait until the next big update for us to fix it. Should take about a few months\n\nNinja Kiwi: Releases 2-3 mini-updates in 2 or so weeks just to patch all bugs possible",
            "I appreciate you guys pushing this update out so quickly so that Expert CHIMPS works again",
            "I love you NK but please make Rosalia attack when repositioning. The downtime is huge specially if you wanna micro her in advance and expert maps",
            "I've found this weird issue with Rosalia where she just stops aiming at the bloons. I think, after a few leave her range, she gets stuck aiming at one spot, and when new bloons enter her range she just shoots off into nothing. Hoping this can get fixed in a patch? It's kind of annoying",
            "Thanks for getting this out so quickly!",
            "I had an odd bug happen to me after update 43, not sure how to repeat it but after repositioning Rosalia she would attack towards the top of the screen for a few seconds before targeting bloons. This happened twice but I'm not sure why"
