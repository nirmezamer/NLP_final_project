            "Tell us what the 7th milestone rewards were....",
            "i got one pop, can i also get an avatar that says \"participation trofy\" in comic sans ms font",
            "I feel like having this be a reddit-only thing was a significant misplay. Not only did a lot of active players certainly miss out (many will find out later and likely be annoyed). \n\nIts also poor design. If players in game got the announcement there'd be more hype. If there wasn't a nearly 3-day gap towards the finish line where we had no idea what our progress was we'd have pushed harder. Particularly if there was an in-game meter that showed progress...that would have been awesome and so much more fun.\n\nThe event was better than nothing but not by much.",
            "I think the game needs to do a slightly better job in game of advertising the events tbh. Without Reddit I would have had no idea just game it was happening.",
            "19 random powers... can you please add one more to make it 20? Please?",
            "I have no idea if I participated or not, because it was unclear. I did the birthday BAD event already so it said it was completed and it gave me a extra reward the other day but there wasn't any note that there was a special event going on with it?",
            "The fact that I only found out about this event after it had gotten to milestone 3 AND it wasn\u2019t clear how to actually enter and submit scores makes this pretty annoying. I had even gone back to major announcements to see if anything had been made clear and found very little information.",
            "Respect to everyone who grinded the quest out, I got way too bored to do it after a bit",
            "Why was there not an in game notice for this? I didn\u2019t even know it existed until seeing this post and only who participated get rewarded :( I don\u2019t even know if I participated or how to participate",
            "Was there even a popup in game about this? I only found this event because of the discord pings. I had to dig back through the event quests to find it too, and it said \"already completed\", so if I didn't know better I wouldn't have even done it."
