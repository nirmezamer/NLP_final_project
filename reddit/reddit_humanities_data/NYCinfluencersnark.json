On the Arielle Charnas post I saw many comments towards her religion and when people commented that they were offended at the stereotype they were heavily downvoted. Its sad to see the increase in hate in the world - really sad to see it in here",

Maybe adding some clearer rules about whether shaming people for choosing to get plastic surgery counts as body shaming or not would be helpful for this community. I dont really think thats cool.",

While I do agree you don\u2019t neeeeed a college degree, this tool acts like it\u2019s his hustle that got him to where he is. What is infuriating about this guy is that he ignores the leg up he started with. The guy was born on third base, of course he didn\u2019t need a college degree. He acts as if waking up at 4 am to send emails helped him afford a townhouse in Brooklyn, and you, regular person not well off to begin with, could do the same! He\u2019s so smug about not having a college degree. I can\u2019t imagine the fact that he doesn\u2019t have a college degree (though I believe he actually did go to college, just didn\u2019t graduate?) but still managed to become an absolute corporate shill impresses anyone. Maybe I\u2019m wrong? I would love to see this guy use his platform to do something for the good of someone else that isn\u2019t feeding them corporate bullshit terms to help them ace their next performance review. ",

He most definitely is a privileged white man who got his start when the world was in a very different place, but I really dont mind the positive outlook. He isnt spreading any misinformation, so as far as Im concerned its a step up from the mass amounts of videos just complaining about how opportunities suck for young people nowadays (even though they unfortunately do)",
