            "I think these are great rules but I also think we should add to keep race and religion and any other bigotry out of it. On the Arielle Charnas post I saw many comments towards her religion and when people commented that they were offended at the stereotype they were heavily downvoted. It\u2019s sad to see the increase in hate in the world - really sad to see it in here",

Maybe adding some clearer rules about whether shaming people for choosing to get plastic surgery counts as body shaming or not would be helpful for this community. I don\u2019t really think that\u2019s cool.",
