Ever.**\n\nDon't try to make yourself or someone you know into a meme.\n\nAlso, we do not allow witch hunts on the subreddit.\n\n_____\n\n##Rule 9: Use an approved host\n\n**Shortened links, Facebook, Tumblr, Blogspot, etc, will be automatically removed.**\n\nPlease use one of the approved websites listed on the sidebar to make your post.\n\n_____\n\n##Rule 10: Mods have the final say\n\n**We reserve the right to remove posts, remove comments, and ban users at our own discretion.**\n\nDue to the nature of the subreddit, interpretations of what is a meme and what is an image macro sometimes have different opinions and thus decisions have to be made.\n\n_____\n\n\n#[Always feel free to message the moderators if you have ANY questions!](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAdviceAnimals)",
