Ever.**\n\nDon't try to make yourself or someone you know into a meme.\n\nAlso, we do not allow witch hunts on the subreddit.\n\n_____\n\n##Rule 9: Use an approved host\n\n**Shortened links, Facebook, Tumblr, Blogspot, etc, will be automatically removed.**\n\nPlease use one of the approved websites listed on the sidebar to make your post.\n\n_____\n\n##Rule 10: Mods have the final say\n\n**We reserve the right to remove posts, remove comments, and ban users at our own discretion.**\n\nDue to the nature of the subreddit, interpretations of what is a meme and what is an image macro sometimes have different opinions and thus decisions have to be made.\n\n_____\n\n\n#[Always feel free to message the moderators if you have ANY questions!](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAdviceAnimals)",

Until now I've still had fairly high hopes for Biden, but if we get much more of that before the election I think Trump has it.\n\nThe age factor is the #1 issue I see brought up about him, and the more ammo his opponents have to shoot Biden with regarding it, the worse it will be. Democrat messaging needs to show him with some energy and also do their best to stave off voter apathy, because I think that's the biggest issue.",

Trump, obviously more coherent, didnt answer some questions, but he did let Joe biden speak and was much more tame then I thought. \n\nJoe Biden it was just sad....just a train wreck. \n\nWhen Trump hit him with \"I dont know what you just said and I dont think you do either\"  that was just savage"
