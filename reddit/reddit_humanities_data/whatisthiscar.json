        "content": "# New users:\n\nWelcome to r/whatisthiscar! Feel free to post an unknown vehicle you'd like identified. If you already know the vehicle and are trying to challenge users' knowledge, please post in our sister-sub, r/namethatcar. Aside from that, try your hand at IDing some posts in either sub. If you're into motorcycles and mopeds, you might enjoy r/namethatbike. Our even more kinky visitors will also get a kick out of r/namethatplane. Enjoy!\n\n# Regulars:\n\nHey, we need to talk... You're great and all, but you've been getting awfully moody and confrontational. Yes, it's you. Stop it. Not everyone is a car guy. It's hard to believe that some people weren't popping chubbies to Gran Turismo in their formative years, but it's true. **This community exists for non-gearheads to learn more about cars and carspotting, maybe ID a hit and run or a burglar's car.**\n\nFrom here on out, there will be no more shaming an OP for not knowing a vehicle and asking - *that's why we're here*. Just because a car seems common or well-known to you doesn't mean it's the same for others. Some cars weren't or aren't available in other markets and some people are just looking for more information on the year and trim.\n\n\"hOw Do U nOt KnOw \\[*CaR*\\]?!?\" comments will be removed and I highly recommend other users report them. A better way to express this sentiment could be \"I learned about this car from \\[*insert game/movie/anime*\\]!\" or \"I have this poster on my wall next to Rita Hayworth!\" [You get to feel that superiority from telling others you know a thing, while also not coming off as a complete douche nozzle!](https://i.imgur.com/LXmKMfJ.jpg)\n\nCan you see the badge? That's cool, but no one cares. Not everyone has great vision or the zoom to compensate for that. Then, there's the swaps. I often see a BMW M3 at the local gas station, but oh wait - it's actually a 20-year-old Honda Civic with Bimmer badges and grille. It's surprisingly well-done, too... I've seen all manner of swapped badges here and IRL, so stop pointing it out. Those comments will also be removed.\n\nIf you're exceptionally uncivil and/or make a habit of it, I'll gift you a shiny new temp ban. You want to go for a hat trick and continue the incivility in mod massaging or my DMs, I'll gladly upgrade that to a permaban and mute. You're not acting in the spirit of this sub and I refuse to let that toxicity fester any more than it already has.\n\n# Old Heads:\n\nYou know who you are. I love you guys, so keep on being you. You're the reason why I've been here and r/namethatcar for over 7 years, why these communities became and continue to be popular. That unending patience is what helps newbies get into so many communities and fandoms. So, thank you for that. Here's to another 7 years and 56k more subscribers.",
