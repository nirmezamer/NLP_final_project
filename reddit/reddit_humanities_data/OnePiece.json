            "Emeth is a word from Kabbalist Jewish Mythology. The legend goes that some rabbi molds a golem out of clay and writes the inscription Emeth upon its forehead to give it life. As the golem grows and grows he realizes it could become problematic, and decides to wipe off the \"E\" to instead have the inscription say \"Meth\" which translates to \"death\". Upon doing so, the clay golem disarticulates into a pile upon the rabbi's head, killing him instantly.",
