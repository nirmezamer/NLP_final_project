            "Remember, there was no flashback before Vegapunk \"died\". \ud83d\ude02",
            "Thematically, this chapter perfectly encapsulates what One Piece is about, and especially what is being built since the reveal of G5.\n\nMy personal theory: The reason the elders and the WG want to get rid of the fruit so badly is not only because of what it symbolizes or the power it gives to the user, but because it can also power up other people around it. The drums of liberation not only inspire people, they give them the tools to free themselves.\n\nI am **not** saying that Luffy has the power to give anyone G5. However, I do think his awakened form can power up people in multiple ways if they are inspired enough by it.\n\nBonney's fruit for example. She can tap into potential futures, unless she learns the truth and cannot believe it will happen. She turns into a Nika form multiple times, although she only takes the rubber characteristics, because that is all she knows about him at that point. Once Saturn tries to break her spirit and tell her Nika isnt real, she conjures a very weak form, because she doesnt fully believe a \"Nika future\" is possible.\n\nHowever, now that she **sees** right in front of her that Nika is very much real, and that liberation is possible, she manages to come up with a fully \"free\" future of herself, which copies the physical characteristics of G5.\n\nThat, I believe, is Nika's true power. Luffy isnt simply metaphorically freeing people, he inspires freedom to the point that they get powered up as well. I dont know how this would interact with other devil fruits, or with those who have no devil fruits at all, but I believe this wont be the last time someone seeing G5 will gain themselves a new form as a result.",
            "Bonney is starting to really seem like the last crew member under the title of \"luffy's protege\" \n\nShe's the youngest person there and luffy seems keenly interested in teaching her how to stand up for herself and be free.  He was showing her how to throw a punch a few chapters back and now he coached her into being a nika herself.",
            "Everyone is too busy on Bonney but what about the last bit of vegabunk recording saying among u there are\u2026.and their names are\u2026. And the recording cuts off\nDoes that mean there is sort of other major figures besides joy boy that the D clan members inherits their will.",
            "The real question is: does Bonney just appear as Nika or have Nika powers",
            "I love how amongst all the tradegy \u00a06 years old bonney faced, she has the power of becoming whatever future she envisions herself. This is poetic.",
            "This chapter just proves, just like back in Wano, that a lot of OP fans can't read.\n\nWe literally dee Bonney turn Luffy into his old man self from the bad timeline.\nWe see her use a weaker version of the Muscle Muscle form in her \"Nika-like future\".\nWe literally see Bonney turn into a giant, an entirely different race.\n\nHow the hell some people are acting as if this came out of nowhere?\n\nBtw, each time, her power lasted for a very short time, far shorter than Luffy's so calm your panties powerscalers\n\n\n\nAlso, this moment isn't about a power up for Bonney. If you were actually paying attention, you'd see how connected Nika is to Bonney's family. How the idea of Nika finally setting them free was around from Kuma's childhood.\n\nBonney becoming Nika for a moment isn't a power up to day \"Bonney is top 5!!!\". It's a cathartic moment for her whole family and them finally being free from being slaves and victims of the WG.\n\nThat's why this is Bonney at her most free (and there is no one freer than Joyboy/Nika), why the flashback to Kuma talking to Ginny exists, and why Bonney heavily resembles her mother in her Nika form.",
            "How I see the \"Is Bonney OP and can she literally do anything and copy any fruit\" debate:\n\nBonney's distorted future is based on if she believes that future is possible. As she learns more about how things work her distorted transformations become more limited as she will no longer believe them to be possible. E.g. if she knew for a fact and she believed people couldn't grow an extra arm later in life, she wouldn't be able to distorted future where she had 3 arms.\n\nCan she copy any devil fruit power? This is unclear because we don't know if she knows people can only eat one devil fruit. If she knew this then she cannot believe in any future where she is using someone else's devil fruit powers (unless she also knows blackbeard has two).\n\n\"But what about Nika transformation, she is copying Luffy's DF powers\" Yes, we as readers know this, but Bonney would have to know this too. The only people we have seen talk about the fruit are the elders who know its the nika fruit and Vega Punk who said the gum gum fruit isn't in the old devil fruit books.\n\nLuffy isn't telling her \"This is just my gum gum fruit gear 5 form\", he is saying \"this is how i look when i am totally free\". It is entirely possibly in Bonney's child mind that there is a disconnect between this transformation and his fruit.\n\nNow back to the blackbeard thing I mentioned earlier: If she knows about Blackbeard having two powers then all bets are off. Nobody knows how he did this. Is it special to him because of his body, is it special to him because of his fruit or can anyone potentially do this? Without knowing the how but knowing someone has done it, this would open her back up to seeing a possible future where she has another power.\n\n\nSo to all the people saying \"can she just say give me a magma future and get lava powers\" I would say possibly but it's unclear, depending on what she actually knows about DF.\n\n And I wouldn't be shocked if an elder literally tries to tell her during the fight that she cannot be nika because of XYZ and possibly breaking that belief and forcing her to de-transform.",
            "People are missing the thematic nature of Bonney transforming into Nika. Her powers limit is her belief a future event could have ever happened. So with Luffy telling her that anything is possible she believed she could trully become free. In doing so she turned herself into the person who is the most free, turning herself into Nika. We have seen Bonney use her powers in similar fashion but she lacked the conviction to go all in until Luffy encouraged her. Now that she trully believes she can be Free she is able to become Nika. Powerscallers themselves put limits on characters which is the opposite of what Nika is about. He is the God of Liberation, the one who will free all the people's of the One Piece world from the yoke of the World Government. Bonney turning into Nika is but the first step towards a Liberated future."
