            "I was just present yesterday for Sikran and Silken Court. Sikran while easy in heroic will hopefully be fun in mythic. The blue swirlies could use a touch up. Tank mechanic is just an easier Rashok. Silken court apart from the buggy as hell intermission seems really interesting I just think that the webtethers could use an indicator when they are about to rip. Was our no1 wipe yesterday that they just seemed to rip without indication. I did not play the mechanic so I can only say that.",
            "No, but they can burst right off the rip, especially if they are using a specific build/trinkets. WWs that play it in keys similar to how they play it in raid (ashes + torch, with serenity) are going to do infinite threat immediately because they are using an on use stat buff trinket + all CDs that require no ramp up time which means they are just doing way more threat than most DPS in the first few seconds of a pull. Alternatively, if they are playing a more M+ centric build (storm earth and fire, plus nelth trinket rather than ashes) they should basically never rip threat outside of maybe torching on pull when the tank hasnt started to build threat. As a WW player, if the WWs in your keys are playing the ashes + sere build its on them to know how to play pulls without pulling threat, there is nothing the tank can really do outside of gathering faster and watching for threat drops to try to taunt before the WW gets meleed.\n\nEdit: I forgot another thing. While there are other classes that have very short ramp up time, a lot of them are fairly even cleaving from the start (see ret pally hitting divine storm). WWs do alter their rotation in AoE situations to emphasize AoE (hitting spin more and rising sun kick less) but they are still going to do a good amount of ST damage via blackout kick, strike of the windlord and FoF. This means they have the unfortunate combo of being a class with little to no ramp up time, a build that emphasizes their CD windows, and do a fair amount of ST/prio target damage even when AoEing (and are melee so no decreased threat scalar like ranged) which is a recipe for pulling threat. Add in trying to start their burst too soon (while the tank is still gathering) and/or targeting a different mob than the tank, and it's basically guaranteed to happen. I guess that's one thing you can do to help as a tank: ask your WW if they can target your target when possible, and try to stick to prioing one mob when people are in CDs so that the threat necessary to pull aggro is higher (I know some tanks like to spread out their first hits in order to get a baseline of threat on all the mobs, which can also be a good idea depending on the tank you're playing and the comp youre in). In the end it's still their fault if they rip aggro, but at least with this you can say you did what you could to prevent it from happening.",

With mass dispel and PI being nerfed in DF I really don't see why they can't give something back, of course taking into account that shadow might become even more OP.\n\nMaybe the priest designers will get rid of the stick up their arse within the next 2 months, blizzard did do the whole affix rework after all, but given they thought pre rework oracle was even remotely fine I don't have my hopes up at all."
