            "I just ran across Hamlet\u2019s [article](https://web.archive.org/web/20190824164741/http://iam.yellingontheinternet.com/2014/01/29/raid-awareness-is-a-learned-and-practiced-skill/) on raid awareness again and curious what other\u2019s experiences with intentionally developing it as a skill are. I have historically poor situational awareness in situations beyond WoW (driving, sports, other games) and I generally pay more attention to my bars than to anything else on my screen, which has worked out okay up to a CE level.\n\nI find this to be a much bigger issue starting at medium level m+ keys, especially those where kicks/stops/defensives aren\u2019t/don\u2019t need to be assigned so you\u2019re left to make judgement calls and loosely coordinate with guildies where needed. For example: I\u2019ll call \u201cfirst kick on x\u201d get my kick and then in the process of doing my rotation and dodging swirlies usually not notice if other casts are going off, if there\u2019s something I need to throw out a stop for, or even if it\u2019s my \u201cturn\u201d to kick again.\n\nI believe this needs to be partially solved through UI, and I\u2019ve started leaning more heavily on sound-based alerts but I would love to hear other\u2019s experiences with shifting attention towards what is actually happening on the screen",

            "not convinced no affixes and crazy scaling is healthy for m+ but don\u2019t wanna be negative because the changes were way better thought out than the previous ones",
            "Hmm...**now that I'm thinking about it, what if the timer was removed for +2 to +11 keys, but only added back into +12 keys?**\n\n**This requires some explanation**, so bear with me.\n\nThe M+ timer was introduced in Legion with early M+ in a one size fits all approach and going off Challenge Modes. The idea of the timer was to encourage you to master the dungeon, on top of preventing degeneracy. Namely:\n\n* Spending 3+ hours in a dungeon and slogging through it for the smallest carrot\n\n* To prevent degeneracy like waiting around for Bloodlust and CDs every single pack\n\nThe M+ timer is also fascinating from a casual player psychology - the negative reputation it has garnered is namely due to (A) the time pressure one feels when they see a visible clock counting down (B) the belief that players are rush rush rushing because of the timer.\n\nI want to counter (B) a bit, because if the M+ timer was solely causing players to be impatient and rush through the dungeons, then we wouldn't see impatient players rushing through Normals, Heroics, M0s, MoP Remix dungeons, raids, and see this rushing in so much different content. The rush behavior can be attributed to some players being jerks, some players being impatient, some players being impatient and having no idea what they are doing (the deadliest combo since they can wipe your groups) etc. BUT the truth is most players rush through content because understandably they are busy, they have more things to do, they want better things to do and this thing they are doing right now is a chore they want to get out of the way. Even if you go all the way back to Classic, you wouldn't stop players from rushing the content even if the punishment is massive time loss, and we know that because Classic today has a massive speed running community. So if the M+ timer is removed, I doubt players would suddenly take it really slow (though I suspect the naysayers would be claiming that M+ timer has rotted the community's brain and everyone is forever rushing)\n\nTo a casual player who has anxiety against a timer, the M+ timer is a hindrance. To an experienced keystone hero, the M+ timer is a *mechanic*, a *safety valve* and a *resource*. How tight or wide the timer is, defines pulls, strategies and builds. The M+ timer for keystone hero is in essence the DPS meter for a raider. \n\nSince there are more casual players than keystone heroes, I think further targeting and some safety valves that don't involve the timer, would be extremely helpful in curbing the worst aspects of removing the M+ timer. \n\n* If players want to 'soak it all in', we can expand Story Mode to accomodate that\n\n* If some random new player doesn't know what they are doing and gets swamped, we should be following FFXIV's model of encouraging mentorship and looking after newer players\n\n* If we got an impatient player problem with 'i have no idea what i'm doing', that's probably an animation and game design and teaching issue that can be addressed to mitigate this\n\n* If players want raid style hard dungeon content, then Mega Dungeons can step in\n\n* And through it all if players are being encourage to sit around to wait for Bloodlust for each pack in a +8 key, I feel like we need to observe and see how much this is happening and build something targeted.\n\nWith all that said, I'm not seeing the reason why the M+ timer is needed. It probably has to be done carefully because a big QoL change like this would be extremely awkward to take away for casuals. But I'm open to trying it if it gets more players into M+ and makes the experience smoother.\n\nWith +12 now instituting the timer, I feel like this foundational change works better for both types of players.\n\nThoughts?",
            "Hiding your action bars and training yourself to memorize your binds can help you break the habit of staring at your bars. This will have the cascading effect of allowing you to focus on everything else on screen.",
            "This comes from purely an m+ point-of-view, but I feel like it bears repeating.\n\nI feel one of the biggest problems with awareness is fotm swapping and how it trickles down to keylevels where the players would gain a lot more getting better at the game rather than swapping classes too often. Even when talking about specs being outliers, as far as the vast majority of the playerbase goes, people are not even close to maxing out their possible utility/output of their class and thus don't gain the seemingly high value people place on meta specs.\n\nThe best and quickest way to gain more awareness and skill is to stick with a class until you understand everything about it inside out, from the core rotation to the extent of all the possible abilties. Your mind should be aiming further and further ahead in a key, planning how the next pull is going to go as far as stops and resource pooling are concerned way before even getting to that point.\n\nPeople might think they understand a class after a few weeks of playing, They don't. They might be able to play their class somewhat decently and do a stop here and there, but the level of awareness has an incredibly high skill ceiling. There's a handful of players way, way above title level who are capable of spec swapping efficiently and quickly, but those players on top of being very skilled also have the awareness and universal gameplay knowledge sorted out so they can push more time into being comfortable with the new class.\n\nThere are boomies, mm hunters, ele shamans, warriors and retris in top 50 parses for most of the different +19 keys (I don't want to get into the whole \"m+ parsing is a joke\" debate. Yes, the parse numbers are biased, the top run rankings are not AND most of the top runs are logged). On average the top parse being a shadowpriest does around \\~10% more overall. This is also with a sample size hugely favoring the spriests, so it's like comparing the best potential run a shadow priest can have out of a hundred vs. just a random key someone happened to time with an off-meta class. I'm absolutely not saying to go off-meta if the aim is to push keys at this level, but for anything below that, especially way further down, you can easily outweigh the potential gain from meta specs just by getting better at one class and thus freeing more of your brainpower to actually learn awareness.\n\nP.S. I know community perception is the biggest reason for swapping classes to get more invites, but that's kind of what I'm trying to fight against here.",
            "I got to play every boss except for Sikran.\n\n\nBosses ranged from \"inoffensive\" to \"very good\".\n\n\nTbh any tier where the worst boss can be called \"inoffensive\" is a good tier IMO.\n\n\nSilken Court seemed kinda trash for melee, but that's probably the worst thing I can say about the raid.\n\n\nPrincess in particular seemed like an absolute banger of a fight."
