            "Properly started **Unicorn Overlord** on the hardest available difficulty and am now about 40 hours in. Oh boy is this game good. I can't stop thinking about it, I've been moving units around in my dreams. It's so well structured, with long main and sidequest battles broken up by little liberation skirmishes, and so many recruitable units provide a near constant dopamine drip, which also means there's always something new to experiment with. Everyone knows the story is pretty cut and dry, but I've been surprised a couple times by interesting sidequest moments, and I do think the localization probably elevates it.",
            "**SMT VV**\n\nIts so good, hours fly like nothing when playing this game! Forgot how great it is and the new features like the QOL demon fusion stuff and the new demons in early game makes it a fun experience so far.\n\nNice to play with my favs like Mermaid and I'm also happy I chose the Switch, since it used my save file to give me the essence of my best demons!",
            "Mostly Xenoblade Chronicles this week.\n\nI've reached the Nopon Village and I'm about to fight the Telethia blocking the road in the corner here. The Eryth sea's a pretty neat visual, wonder if it'll get explained more later. I've finally swapped my party around and put Dunban and Melia in play to try and raise some more affinities. I figured Melia was either gonna be like a cleric or a holy mage, didn't expect the typical elemental mage. But she plays a lot different than most mages, partially due to Xenoblade's combat, partially because she needs to summon elements before she can attack with them. That's kinda neat. I've also finally looked at the Collectaepedia, filled in basically everything but the Bionis's insides, but there's nothing to gather in the Third Lung anyways. Riki exists, he's got a lot of funny armor sets. I hope the story gives him a chance to prove his worth. The party's kinda just dunking on him and he's not doing anything to make me not agree that he's a bit lame. His skills look fun at least.\n\nAnd I played a little bit of Tokyo Mirage Sessions - found my first sidequest that seems too challenging for me at the moment, rescuing some girl's performa from a monster in the Shibuya dungeon. And got to look at the Daitou TV dungeon, only got to do the first loop around and broke down a wall. This place is neat. Eleonora's nearly caught up in level to the rest of the group, definitely looking forward to teaching her more skills. She's not much help with session chaining right now.",
            "For the first time since...well before the pandemic anyway, neither of my two active games are JRPGs (Tears of the Kingdom and Disco Elysium).\n\nI just finished **Octopath Traveler**. Sort of. I didn't finish it. For those who don't know, it is because they locked the ending behind a lame time consuming boss rush followed by a superboss. No saving. No warning of the extreme difficulty and unavoidable need to grind beforehand. Terrible design choice. Forgivable 30 years ago when that's just how games were, unforgivable today. What a shame. That's all I have to say about it.",
            "**Tales of Arise**\n\nI've beaten the 5 warlords and done a bunch of side-quests. Now, I just got enough of the fighting system. It's very repetitive and I prefer turn-based. I've used a lot of DLCs and turned the difficulty to Very Easy so I can avoid as many enemies as I can and just rush through the game. The story is nothing amazing, but I still want to see the ending and craft more weapons.",
            "**Skies of Arcadia Legends**\n\nI've just crossed the South Ocean to reach Ixa'taka\n\nI've been told by a lot of people on different occasions that the Skies of Arcadia setting and tone would fall in line with what I love in JRPGs. And well, at least so far they are absolutely right. Sky pirates, floating islands and airship combat? Sign me up. I don't know why I didn't give this a go sooner honestly.\n\nI don't have too many thoughts about the plot itself, but I really like my party members, Vyse and Aika in particular, and the dialogue and interactions between them have been great. \n\nCombat has been mostly fun so far. Really enjoying the boss battles and the variation the occasional airship combat brings. I wish combat animations in general were a bit faster tho. And way too many encounters have enemies with insta-death spells, I don't find this a fun mechanic in general, but their hit rate is also really high, I think I had one or two misses at most so far. Aika does have a move to block them tho, so it's not as bad. Encounter rates have been good for most of the game, but crossing the South Ocean was a pain.\n\nAlso, I can't help but notice how Nostalgia (the DS game) had a clear inspiration from Skies of Arcadia in a lot of ways. I always thought that game had a bunch of good ideas that weren't well executed, so I'm glad to have at least the airship combat already being better here.",
            "Recently finishes **Valkyrie Elysium**, I thought it was a fairly solid action game. Story is fairly weak, alongside the characters. Gameplay is fun, but can get a bit repetitive. I recommend it, but not a game to play all at once. Playing a main story chapter or a couple of side quests in a day was what I found the most enjoyable balance \n\n3 chapters in to the switch version of **Paper Mario The Thousand-Year Door**, love the game and the remake is great! Great way you get into the Mario rpg games\n\nStarted **Final Fantasy VII**, about 4 or 5 hours in (I just finished the Sector 7 sequence) and I am loving it. It is wild how fast paced the Midgar section of the game is. My only full experience in the FF7 universe is Remake, so it has been delightful to see the differences between the two, and how remarkable both versions of Midgar are!\n\n*edits are to fix punctuation and such",
            "I had a completely free day Thursday, and with all the hype around SMT Vengeance, I decided I'd get it even though I was skeptical of the need for it after already playing SMT5. Searching PSN is when I discovered the game didn't come out until Friday. Whoops! I kept browsing and ended up getting **Soul Hackers 2** for $14.99.\u00a0\u00a0I've now got about 10 hours into it and must say I'm enjoying it. It's definitely scratching the SMT itch that I clearly had. Same great gameplay- the only real difference is the use of 'stacks' rather than Press Turn. Game seems very solid.",
            "As a big fan of SMT V i'm playing **Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance** of course. 10 hours into the Canon of Vengeance and i'm now on the >!Lahmu fight at school!<. I'm really loving the changes in the CoV so far (can't speak for the quality of the story changes yet tho) and the QoL improvements have also been great. Absolutely loving it.\n\nIt's also just great to have this game run at (mostly) stable 60+ FPS. And the image quality looks better than on the original Switch version too.",
            "Having an amazing time with **SMTVV**! Didn't actually finish the original version, but I went with Canon of Vengeance for my first playthrough of VV. So far, things have felt easier than the original? But I may have just gotten very lucky against Hydra (it literally missed Nahobino nearly every turn, lol). Worst thing so far is, like the original, unique skills can make fusing more painful. Like goddamn has Mermaid's ice skill been helpful, but I'll of course need to fuse her away. Looking forward to seeing how CoV ends up diverging (besides how it has so far simply with meeting Yoko)."

            "This might depend on how you define 'skill'. There are definitely turn-based games where it's possible to do low level runs.

        "content": "So with the new Dragon Quest III trailer I definitely think that HD-2D is the best style for a franchise like Pok\u00e9mon. I know HD-2D is from Square Enix explaining why other games from other companies can't use this style, but maybe they can reach an agreement\nIt's been years since Pok\u00e9mon started using the 3D models since X & Y and probably a lot of people prefer it. But I think it would be better for the franchise to use this art style:\n\u2022 For remakes like a Black/White will be much better than what they did with Diamond & Pearl. \n\u2022 3D is good too yes, but it is clear that Game Freak    do not exploit their full potential (just see Scarlet & Violet). Of course is not a financial problem (being the most profitable franchise) just a \"people will buy it anyways\".\n\u2022 Having the old games a cross movement for the characters and being turn-based is perfect for this style.\n\u2022 If they don't have to dedicate that much hours into modeling an entire 3D open world, etc they could invest their time in improving the story, characters,...\n\nSeeing for example what the Zelda team is capable of doing to the franchise in a limited console like the Switch puts the Pok\u00e9mon dedicated team in a much worse place and it's frustrating to see the wasted potential.

They cannot prohibit others from making a game with the same look, just from promoting it with that term.\n\nThat being said, I absolutely would love if pokemon went that route at least for the 5th gen inevitable remakes. It would make sense considering Black and White and their sequels were already doing something similar graphic-wise. Sadly, most of the casual audicence thinks that 2d is inherently obsolete compared to 3d, so I just do not see Game Freak taking the risk with something that is not a spin-off with different gameplay.\n\nI do love seeing the fans' depiction of what it could look like though:\n\n[https://youtu.be/fMJcgiyFOps?si=LA4Z6H8etbkzVVC1](https://youtu.be/fMJcgiyFOps?si=LA4Z6H8etbkzVVC1)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ijj-pAitQfg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ijj-pAitQfg)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrCWe9Jm5jg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrCWe9Jm5jg)",
