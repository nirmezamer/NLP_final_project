        "content": "# We made it!\n\nThank you to everyone in the community for your patience and kindness as we tried some new rules during the latest For Rent update. Most mods have been updated since the latest patch and we are happy to get back to our regularly scheduled activities.\n\n# New Rule (Trial Run)\n\nThat being said, we are going to trial run a change to the rules going forward around posts requesting help with mods being \"broken\" or \"glitchy\" etc. These posts will now have to be accompanied by additional information to help the community better understand the issue. Information like your mod list, what you've tried to resolve the issue, relevant screenshots are all things that would provide additional information.\n\nPosts titled \"Help?\" with a screenshot and nothing else will run the risk of being removed as spam. (Providing additional information in the comments below the automod response is also sufficient.)\n\nIf you see a post that you do not think meets the criteria above, feel free to report it and a member of our Mod Team will review it. Even if you think a post does not meet the criteria, please remember to be respectful of other community members. Helping others and sharing our knowledge of mods and custom content is the reason this subreddit exists, whether it's as simple as sharing your favorite creator or a work around for a broken mod.\n\n*As The Sims 4 continues to roll out content or any major updates, we will reinstate our \"no broken mods\" rules temporarily to avoid spam.*\n\n# Thank You\n\nThank you to everyone in this community,  your willingness to lend a helping hand, provide advice, and engage in constructive discussions is what makes our subreddit special. We will continue to work on our FAQ/Wiki to better support the subreddit in the new year.\n\n*If you would like to assist in creating a wiki section, please reach out via modmail.*\n\nPlease remember to be kind and as always, update your mods.",

It was in its own folder in the mods folder but then I took the stuff out of the folder and put it outside of the original wicked whims folder in the mods folder. I don't know if that would fix it but thought I'd see what people say. I have all the animations installed too. I also have a bunch of other random stuff installed for the sims so I don't know if that would be why (including but not limited to MCCC and basemental drugs but also a lot of CC). If no one knows why, I'll just uninstall it and wait for it to get updated again. ",
