        "content": "Greetings Tarnished!\n\nThis is the place to ask any questions you may have about Elden Ring. This includes obscure detail questions, \"newbie\" advice questions, build questions, boss advice questions, and what have you.\n\nWell written, constructive criticism is fine but please avoid ranting about aspects of the game you just don\u2019t like. This includes \u201cso and so boss is stupid and too difficult.\u201d\n\nIf you are interested in the game but don\u2019t own it yet, please don\u2019t post \u201cshould I buy this game?\u201d or \u201cIs this game worth it?\u201d. If you have played other FromSoftware games and enjoyed them, the answer is yes. If you haven\u2019t, just do a little research! These games are difficult, and sometimes frustrating, and not everyone is going to enjoy them. And that\u2019s okay!\n\nLastly, be friendly! We are all here because we are interested in the same game! Please treat your fellow players with respect.\n\nHere are a few helpful links:\n\n[Our Discord](https://discord.com/invite/r-eldenring) which has an awesome [Helper Request System!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/uda81o/er_discord_bossdungeon_help_request_for_all/)\n\n[Elden Ring Wiki](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Elden+Ring+Wiki)\n\n[Elden Ring Map](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map)\n\n[Most Recent Patch Notes](https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-106) (1.06)\n\n/r/BeyondTheFog for co-op help!\n\n/r/PatchesEmporium for item trading!\n\n/r/EldenRingBuilds for builds and build help!\n\nOur community password is **straydmn**\n\nRise, Tarnished!",

            "So I'm at the final boss of the DLC and I can consistently get to his second phase but I die to most of his moves mainly the one after the rock sling where he dives down with four illusions then comes down and then the one after he sucks you in and scream and then combos there is also that 1 move where before he does the simultaneous sword\nslashes, I ger hit by one of the moving swords then staggered in the said sword slash how do I dodge\nthenn",

I watched a video of dudes tanking through boss attacks with it. What gives? Did it already get patched?",

            "Anyone else experiencing PC performance issues post update? I was under the impression that the game would run exactly the same as before, however I'm finding framerate drops in areas that I otherwise wasn't, I'm going down to 40 FPS at points in the Limgrave Tree Sentinal fight and I never had this issue before, pretty much never dropped below 50.",
            "MY fps dropped to the 45ish everytime i looked at the dlc big tree, or certain direction, changing to low doesn't help at all its so weird.",

            "My game is stuttering every 2 seconds or so and is catching up which is making it unplayable I have tried every fix under the sun and nothing has worked so far. Idk what to do at this point is there going to be a patch that addresses this?",
            "My game is stuttering like crazy. It\u2019s weird, cause it\u2019ll run fine for a while, then just start stuttering like crazy. If I restart the game, it\u2019ll boot up, start working for a while, then start stuttering again. It\u2019s like the game over time becomes unable to handle continuing to load the game. \n\nAny idea on how to possibly fix this?",
            "everytime i try to summon help it says summon unavailable it was not doing this in the base game  \ni also cant exit the game or put summon signs down when this happens",

            "Lands Between Jar Warriors and Shadowlands jars are different. Former is the flesh of fallen warriors stuffed in a jar. No atrocities there, just a bit icky. The latter is the effect of horrible experiments performed by hornsent on shaman people. Great Jar is probably filled with the flesh of warriors that died in the arena he is guarding.",
            "You are confusing two things: In the Shadowrealm the Hornsent tortured Shamans by first whiping them until their inflamed flesh bulges out of their body, and you get what these flesh blob enemies are. Then they are put into jars. They could do that, because Shamans have a special body, that heals and merges easily (My theory why Godrick could graft shit onto himself). Iirc the intent wasnt pure torture but some kind of spiritual thing. \n\nWarrior Jars, the jars with hands and feet, are a completely different thing. Idk how they are made, but it got nothing to do with the Shadowrealm massacer of Shamans.",
