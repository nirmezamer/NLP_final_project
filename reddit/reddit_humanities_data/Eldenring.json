        "content": "Greetings Tarnished!\n\nThis is the place to ask any questions you may have about Elden Ring. This includes obscure detail questions, \"newbie\" advice questions, build questions, boss advice questions, and what have you.\n\nWell written, constructive criticism is fine but please avoid ranting about aspects of the game you just don\u2019t like. This includes \u201cso and so boss is stupid and too difficult.\u201d\n\nIf you are interested in the game but don\u2019t own it yet, please don\u2019t post \u201cshould I buy this game?\u201d or \u201cIs this game worth it?\u201d. If you have played other FromSoftware games and enjoyed them, the answer is yes. If you haven\u2019t, just do a little research! These games are difficult, and sometimes frustrating, and not everyone is going to enjoy them. And that\u2019s okay!\n\nLastly, be friendly! We are all here because we are interested in the same game! Please treat your fellow players with respect.\n\nHere are a few helpful links:\n\n[Our Discord](https://discord.com/invite/r-eldenring) which has an awesome [Helper Request System!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/uda81o/er_discord_bossdungeon_help_request_for_all/)\n\n[Elden Ring Wiki](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Elden+Ring+Wiki)\n\n[Elden Ring Map](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Interactive+Map)\n\n[Most Recent Patch Notes](https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-106) (1.06)\n\n/r/BeyondTheFog for co-op help!\n\n/r/PatchesEmporium for item trading!\n\n/r/EldenRingBuilds for builds and build help!\n\nOur community password is **straydmn**\n\nRise, Tarnished!",

            "Any of y'all sticking to RL 150? or y'all think a higher RL will be the norm moving forward?",
            "At what blessing level did you guys fight Rellana?\n\nBarely scraped by at level 4, wonder if I should\u2019ve explored other areas before\u2026 Either way, what a boss!\n\nAlso, if you\u2019re struggling with her moon attack: time the first moon and jump, jump, jump with no delays",
            "Anybody else working through the expansion and getting the repeated feeling of being robbed on things that feel like clean hits? Maybe I'm connecting and poise on enemy attacks is inconsistent?\n\n\nSomething is different in a way that makes my big hammer that I've played through the rest of the game with feel very inaccurate. I mean, I'm not great at the game, but most of the time when I'm constantly dying, it feels fair. I'm running into a lot of deaths in the expansion that don't feel fair."

            "Just to get this out of the way, if you suddenly lose HDR on the PC version of Elden Ring, the usual solution is to make sure HDR is turned off in Windows display settings but turned ON in game, close the game, and restart your graphics driver. That is Win+Shift+Ctrl+B.\n\n That has worked for me since I got my OLED monitor a year ago and it worked for me again yesterday.\n\nNo I don't have an answer for low fps, stuttering, etc. My framerates have just about halved game-wide with no change in settings.",
