            "Here is an illustration of what [scientific skepticism is not](https://i.imgur.com/kdrstv6.jpg)\n\nIf you're like this seagull and you don't trust peer reviewed evidence or official sources or scientists or academic consensus and you're visiting here looking for other seagulls, you're going to be disappointed.\n\nFor regulars - let's try and be tolerant of people like this and engage with them. Many of them don't have good epistemic toolkits and they could benefit from learning about skepticism by seeing how it is applied to claims that they acknowledge are false.",
            "Dr. Novella does really important work for our community.",
            "It's sad to see how little attention this post got. Lots of members of this community need substantial instruction on skepticism.",
            "I have been in the movement for 30 years and I never connected with Novella or SGU content.  It is interesting how you can be so close to something and completely miss it.",
            "The key to skepticism is a well-defined scientific method able to sift science from fake, pseudo- and wannabe science. Validation and falsification are key to that. Although you mention *falsification* in the article above (defining your skepticism project), you don't define it and you haven't given a summary definition of science or scientific method either. I think your should.",
            "Hi - I would strongly suggest adding a description of the subreddit to the **sidebar** (or the \u201cabout\u201d section on mobile. You can add a link to this article there, and this would make it a bit more visible/accessible than having a pinned post. Thanks!",
            "The lack of punctuation in the headline is killing me.",
            "The substance of the article\n\n> **Respect for Knowledge and Truth:** Skep\u00adtics value reality and what is true. We therefore endeavor to be as reality-based as possible in our beliefs and opinions. This means subjecting all claims to a valid process of evaluation.\n\n>**Methodological Naturalism**: Skeptics believe that the world is knowable because it follows certain rules or laws of nature. The only legitimate methods for knowing anything empirical about the universe follows this naturalistic assumption. In other words, within the realm of the empirical you don\u2019t get to invoke magic or the supernatural.\n\n>**Promotion of Science**: Science is the only set of methods for investigating and understanding the natural world. Science is therefore a powerful tool and one of the best developments of human civilization. We therefore endeavor to promote the role of science in our society, public understanding of the findings and methods of science, and high-quality science education. This includes protecting the integrity of science and education from ideological intrusion or antiscientific attacks. This also includes promoting high-quality science, which requires examining the process, culture, and institutions of science for flaws, biases, weaknesses, conflicts of interest, and fraud.\n\n>**Promotion of Reason and Critical Think\u00ading**: Science works hand-in-hand with logic and philosophy, and therefore skeptics also promote understanding of these fields and the promotion of critical thinking skills.\n\n>**Science vs. Pseudoscience**: Skeptics seek to identify and elucidate the borders between legitimate science and pseudoscience, to expose pseudoscience for what it is, and to promote knowledge of how to tell the difference.\n\n>**Ideological Freedom/Free Inquiry**: Science and reason can flourish only in a secular society in which no ideology (religious or otherwise) is imposed upon individuals or the process of science or free inquiry.\n\n>**Neuropsychological Humility**: Being a functional skeptic requires knowledge of all the various ways in which we deceive ourselves, the limits and flaws in human perception and memory, the inherent biases and fallacies in cognition, and the methods that can help mitigate all these flaws and biases.\n\n>**Consumer Protection**: Skeptics endeavor to protect themselves and others from fraud and deception by exposing fraud and educating the public and policy-makers to recognize deceptive or misleading claims or practices.\n\n>**Addressing Specific Claims**: Skeptics combine all of the above to address specific claims that are flawed, biased, or pseudoscientific and to engage in the public discussion of these claims.\n\n>**Cultural Memory**: Skeptics as a whole act as the cultural memory for pseudosciences and scams of the past. Such beliefs tend to repeat themselves, and remembering the past can be very useful in quickly putting such beliefs into their proper perspective.\n\n>**Science Journalism**: Many skeptics spend a large portion of their time doing straight science communication and journalism, which is important because science is so central to our mission. This is also an important skill to explore and develop because it is so rarely done well. Correcting and criticizing bad science news reporting, especially in the Internet age, has become a large part of what skeptics do.",
            "Thanks for sharing",
            "As if this sub has much to do with scientific skepticism anymore.\n\nLooking at the post titles, mostly it's subject Trump, GOP, Elon Must (being a \"nazi\") etc. It's yet another left wing echo chamber. The mods do nothing to keep this from happening and political blow-hards will always take every opportunity they can to push their political bias, if you let them. \n\nAnd these posts get the most attention, the most comments."

As my compassion knows no bounds, I have forgiven those who let me sexually assault them, even though they are as skanks in my eyes.\n\nI would like to express my sincere and deepest hypocrisy to all my subscribers and hope and pray that this will be enough to get me back on YouTube where I can start raking in the cash once more.\n\nThe Lord our Russell Brand\n\nAmen, nr Henley-on-Thames\n\nGoddington, Surrey, UK",
