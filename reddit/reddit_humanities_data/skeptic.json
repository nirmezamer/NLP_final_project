            "I have been in the movement for 30 years and I never connected with Novella or SGU content.  It is interesting how you can be so close to something and completely miss it.",
            "The key to skepticism is a well-defined scientific method able to sift science from fake, pseudo- and wannabe science. Validation and falsification are key to that. Although you mention *falsification* in the article above (defining your skepticism project), you don't define it and you haven't given a summary definition of science or scientific method either. I think your should.",
            "Hi - I would strongly suggest adding a description of the subreddit to the **sidebar** (or the about section on mobile. You can add a link to this article there, and this would make it a bit more visible/accessible than having a pinned post. Thanks!",

            "Yeah he's definitely an important figure in skepticism and one and great advocate of science and critical thinking. In short, dude's awesome. \n\nI really like that TheSGU doesn't talk religion much. To many, skepticism is atheism and atheism is skepticism. And I don't shy away from my atheism but more importantly, I'm a skeptic. And when I do talk religion, MOSTLY I'm talking to the anti science fundamentalist crowd."

Few people may have watched the debate, but enough people cut, edited, and posted eight or ten second clips across multiple social media accounts - moments out of context that millions have seen, and memes that have concretized the most superficial binaries in the minds of low information voters. Cope all you want, but outside of the death of one of the two candidates, its clear that the election is already over. Americans should now prepare themselves for Trump II: Electric Boogaloo.",
