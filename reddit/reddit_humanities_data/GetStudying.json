So, in general, a post will look like this:\n\nThings I have to get done today:\n\n~~1: Post Accountability Thread~~\n\nIf I had more to do that I had not completed I would list them and update this when these things were complete.\n\nAlso, if I saw someone doing something that I happen to be well-educated or have some sort of expertise in I can offer support or help on the topic/task.\n\nThe thread is a versatile one, use it in a way that helps you and others stay on task!\n\nHappy studying!",

        "content": "ahhhh i hate being on antidepressants while being in school because it basically knocks me out almost 24/7. ive tried talking to my psychiatrist about this but it seems like they dont understand no matter how hard i try to explain.\n\n its gotten to the point where during exams i dont take my meds so i can actually be awake to study but its not really effective because the moment i hit a low point it gets bad \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\nand before anyone says anything about my lifestyle i go to the gym 3x a week and stay active, i drink plenty of water, i eat normally and regularly (but antidepressants make me eat more)\n\nim honestly also just really done with antidepressants sometimes even tho it keeps me sane and not a ball of anxiety and depression. it makes me numb from sadness but also joy as well. it makes me feel so disconnected from reality and honestly sometimes i feel not real. it feels like im viewing my world from an outside perspective and its tiring. i do want to live, i work so hard everyday, mainly because i just wanna get out of my home. \n\nit would be great if anyone could give me any tips on how to overcome this or give me any advice! thank u so much :)\n",
