        "content": "Hey all,\n\nMarcel P here - I want to make a post on improving at TFT targeted at players more serious about wanting to improve anywhere from the Master to Challenger range. I\u2019ve made some good improvements myself this set peaking at NA rank 2 1700LP and want to share what worked and didn\u2019t work for me. None of these thoughts/tips/pitfalls are specific to anything about set 11 and should apply for any subsequent sets.\n\nThis sub has been missing detailed posts from competitive players as of late (save for a few Aesah posts here and there regarding stats), so I figured I'd change that up a bit. This is a long, detailed, fairly in-depth post, so here's a short summary at the top.\n\n*Short form post / tldr;*\n\n# Things that helped me\n\n**Coaching sessions with better players**\n\n**Use error patterns/habits in your gameplay to guide what you should work on**\n\n**Play more open-minded/freely, potentially on a smurf account, to test different playstyles**\n\n# Common pitfalls when trying to improve\n\n**\u201cI\u2019m already good enough at x, I just need to improve at y\u201d**\n\n**Being a critic instead of a sponge when watching streams**\n\n**Not using stats enough**\n\n# TFT gameplay common pitfalls\n\n**Too often taking augments that will only pop off 1-2 stages later**\n\n**Undervaluing DPS/stats of naked units on your board in the early/midgame**\n\n**Playing into a 3+ way contest because you have a strong opener for the line**\n\n**Thinking in \u201calways\u201d and \u201cnever\u201d. There is too much nuance in TFT for that line of thinking**\n\n*Long form / detailed post:*\n\nIn set 11 I had what was probably my best set so far, reaching **1700LP rank 2 NA** during competitive season and making a good run at qualifying for regionals (missed out by a few spots due to a bad Tactician\u2019s Trials 1), finishing with 179 qualifier points with a few solid tourney days across the different cups. I also made top 16 ladder snapshots (to skip Trials and play directly in the Cup) for 2 out of 3 cups when many top players I consider much better than me were struggling to achieve the same. But yeah needless to say, still lots of room to improve.\n\nPrior to this set, I would **typically peak at 1300ish LP around the competitive season and was never consistent enough in competitions** to have a real shot at making regionals. I was pretty hardstuck at this range over many many sets (\\~set 5 to set 10).\n\nI had already had previous sets of playing over 1000 games, so it wasn\u2019t just that I played a lot this set. **So what did I do differently?** I paid for coaching sessions. Watched my own replays more. And just overall took a much more critical approach towards my own gameplay rather than just spamming games and spam watching streams. And yes I did also spend a lot more time on the game in comparison to previous sets (adding up both time played and time spent studying/thinking about the game).\n\nAs an aside, many of these tips/thoughts are ones I\u2019ve used to improve in some form across other endeavors: I hit rank 1 at Clash Royale back in the day and I used to compete at D1 college golf and on the national team in the Philippines. I also used a similar process to improve at coding interviews to land a FAANG software eng job ~~that I\u2019ve since been shirking to try and improve at TFT~~.\n\nI listed 10 tidbits/pitfalls above - let me go into more detail over each one and how each helped me and how it might help you.\u00a0\n\nIf you find any of this interesting, feel free to come and chat about any of this on my new Twitch stream at [twitch.tv/marcelp\\_tft](http://twitch.tv/marcelp_tft). I\u2019m just starting out, so it should be an easy environment to ask any questions you might have about anything I\u2019ve discussed here. I just invested in a new mic/cam setup and I plan to be online a ton over the next couple of weeks (as well as right now as this post drops).\n\n# Things that helped:\n\n**Coaching sessions with better players**\n\n* This was probably the approach that made the biggest difference for me. Like anyone trying to get better at TFT, I was having difficulty finding errors in my gameplay on my own. Watching your own recordings can only get you so far with your own analysis.\n* **My main goal with these sessions was to find patterns of misplays across multiple games to uncover misunderstandings/flaws in my mental model.** I think it\u2019s quite easy to autopilot through a single game over a single coaching session and just look through mistakes one after the other, but this likely won\u2019t yield as much value as finding out something like: in 4/4 games, a top challenger player thinks your 3-2 augment choice is way too slow (i.e. you fall behind tempo).\n* I showed the same set of multiple games to 2 different coaches (Aesah and Guubums, both of whom were extremely helpful and I did a repeat session with both, 2 each). TFT is a complex game that we all play imperfectly even at the highest level, so it was no surprise to me that there were quite a few things the coaches didn\u2019t align on over the same game. But when they did align on calling out the same types of mistakes (in my case, it was around augment selection 3-2 and 4-2 and my strongest board play on stage 3), then I was way more likely to be wrong and could use that as a strong indicator of something to improve in my mental model.\n* **I can\u2019t stress enough how useful it is to get more sets of eyes on your game reviews.** Some of these games I showed Guubums, I looked over on my own and assigned the blame to the wrong thing, like oh maybe I shouldn\u2019t have 4-1\u2019d here but instead 4-2 to have more gold. Turns out I was just playing Lillia completely wrong (overvaluing Morg and itemizing Morg 2 just because it was starred up, not playing around Alune enough), and my decision to level on 4-1 was probably completely fine. I felt more confident that this was indeed the case when I started having better scores with Lillia implementing these tips.\n\n**Use error patterns/habits in your gameplay to guide what you should work on**\n\n* Am I suggesting that everyone go out and spend on coaching for multiple games with multiple coaches? I mean, if you are willing and able to do so, then go for it, it certainly helped me out.\n* But my point is moreso that **you can\u2019t rely on a single session and a single person to basically point out all your deeply rooted misunderstandings that are holding you back in TFT.** That\u2019s up to you to uncover - all a coach over a single session can really provide you with is their thoughts on decisions within that game and maybe in some cases their best guess as to why you had that misunderstanding. Maybe get a coaching session or two if you are open to it, and then watch many other games of your own and see how many times you make similar mistakes. Then **ask yourself: why am I consistently making these incorrect decisions in these similar scenarios?** And iterate on a potential way to spot recognize these on the fly midgame and correct them.\n* Example: This last patch, I found that my stage 2 was often quite weak and I lacked direction. When reviewing a couple games with Deisik, he twice mentioned over 2 different games that he wouldn\u2019t have held a pair that I held (in this case it was Qiyana pair when I had no duelist units) and instead he would have held things like cait 1 and jax 1 for a stronger early game around ghostly/inkshadow. I watched other games of mine and noticed a similar pattern - I was autopiloting a bit to hold meaningless pairs (because I didn\u2019t have good units around them anyway) instead of holding other more valuable early game units. So my takeaway isn\u2019t that holding Qiyana pair is bad. It\u2019s that I need to reassess my understanding of valuing pairs over valuing synergistic units to make a strong board stage 2.\n* Because IMO that\u2019s where the real value is when trying to improve. Having one-off tidbits of knowledge is helpful. But, as another example, recognizing that your augment selections on 3-2 often lead to a weak stage 3 where you are relying on a big comeback on stage 4 from low HP is something you can work to correct and will likely lead to improvements that will directly help in more of your games. More details on TFT specific errors and improvements below.\n\n**Play more open-minded/freely, potentially on a smurf account, to test different playstyles**\n\n* In previous sets, I often avoided playing risky econ traits unless the situation REALLY called for it. I was afraid of botching a 1-life cashout rolldown + transition. I assume this isn\u2019t an uncommon sentiment - who wants to eat several 8ths feeling like you completely messed up your last turn and died at one life?\n* Top players clearly did not do this - if anything they lean into econ augments as often as they can. I decided to improve my fortune gameplay in as risk-free a way as possible: play 20/20 fortune on a smurf account. I\u2019d get the reps I needed to improve at this playstyle without the risk of losing LP on my main account while trying a different playstyle.\n* I found that even at lower elos, I was often messing up my cashout/transition turn. So I\u2019d watch the replays of my transition rounds (given I was playing fortune as often as possible on this account, I had many replays to look through) and compare them side by side with what the Fortune GOAT Setsuko would do on stream. Basically breaking down why I was losing time and what he did differently.\n* It turns out orders of operation are extremely important for a cashout turn: first, sell all units on board and bench (as these can definitely slow you down if you fill up your bench) you won\u2019t need. Then, roll as much as needed til stable. Then, position the board. And only after all that does Setsuko make items.\n* When watching my replays, I occasionally did these in the right order, but it was often pretty haphazard. And this is precisely what would lose me the 5-10s I needed to stabilize. So after this analysis, I tried really hard to commit to doing this exact order of operations every time. And trying this out felt risk free since I was playing all on my smurf. With each fortune cashout rep I played and reviewed and iterated on, my cashout turns improved, my fortune scores improved, and now even on my main account I don\u2019t shy away from this line at all.\n* Moral of the story here is: **there are some playstyles that will feel too risky / stray too far away from your comfort zone.** Econ traits are not the only one - maybe you don\u2019t feel comfortable playing 5 loss through stage 2. Or maybe there are some augments you literally never take because you don\u2019t know how to play with them and don\u2019t want to risk losing LP trying them out. **Taking the time to learn them (most especially if you see other good players often use said line/augment) and getting tons of reps at them in an environment that feels risk-free can be extremely beneficial.**\n\n# Common pitfalls when trying to improve\n\n**\u201cI\u2019m already good enough at x, I just need to improve at y\u201d**\n\n* This is a sentiment I hear (and have mistakenly thought about my own play as well) fairly frequently in different flavors. \u201cMy early game is already solid, I just need to get better at capping my late game boards\u201d. \u201cI play reroll comps nearly perfectly, I just need to learn the meta 4 cost lines.\u201d, \u201cMy positioning doesn\u2019t really need work at my elo, I just need to study the stats more for the current meta.\u201d\n* **I think most people correctly understand that TFT is a multifaceted game with many different skill sets. But many fail to recognize just how deep each aspect truly is.**\n* I was definitely in this camp prior to this set. I thought many aspects of my game (such as early/mid game strongest board, augment selection using stats, etc.) were already near peak form, and I just needed to uncover some other minor issues to break through the plateau I was at. Then I did some coaching sessions and found that 2 different players both better than me thought I had a LOT to improve on with both augment selection and strongest board (more on these 2 below).\n* Another thought experiment to further drive this point home:\n* Say we divide TFT into some arbitrary set of separate skills, each with a skill rating from 1-100 (100 meaning you perform said skill perfectly). So for example as a player you can have a rating of 75 for Positioning, 60 for Rolldown Speed, 55 for Strongest Board, etc. etc.\n* What would you imagine the best players\u2019 skill ratings to look like? For example someone like Setsuko or Dishsoap (yes I\u2019m an NA player so these are my examples).\n* IMO (and many top players state as much), we are all so far from playing \u201cperfect TFT\u201d. Competitive TFT is a game of who makes the fewest mistakes. Even the best players are operating at \\~90 at best at their strongest skill ratings. Even lower at skills they can improve on.\n* If you believe this to be true, what this means for anyone like you and me who is not a top player is that **there is a LOT to gain from improving even at things you think you might already be good at.** Even our perceived \u201cstrong points\u201d are likely just at 70-80 skill points or lower and have tons of room for optimization that will significantly improve your placements.\n* Something that seems basic such as playing your strongest board through stage 2 and 3 is something that I as a \\~1300LP consistent challenger player had a LOT to improve on based on my coaching sessions. More on this below.\n* Yes, it can be helpful to first try and improve your weakest points. But **at most levels of play, you can basically consider every point as a low hanging fruit**, as there are very likely so many things you can improve at literally every aspect of your game. In summary, don\u2019t think you are above improving at even the most seemingly basic aspects of the game.\n\n**Being a critic instead of a sponge when watching streams**\n\n* We all recognize how valuable a resource watching streams is for improving at the game / learning the meta / learning different playstyles etc.\n* But somehow, it seems quite common to me (especially at the Master/GM level) for people to basically assume the following: every time the streamer makes a decision that seems contradictory to my own understanding of his/her spot, the streamer is likely committing an error.\n* Which in my mind is sort of baffling. I\u2019ve tried learning via streams/videos at other activities (golf, chess, Clash Royale, etc) and have always taken the approach that if a player who obviously gaps you in skill makes a very different decision than you would have in the same spot, this is a key opportunity for learning.\n* Imagine watching a Magnus Carlsen chess stream and being like, nah, that one move he made was awful, I would have gone for Nf3 instead.\n* This is basically how silly it is to take a mostly critical approach to watching TFT streams of top players. Because the reality of it is that, yes, the top players do gap you (and me) this much.\n* My guess is that TFT is just that sort of activity that lends really well to backseat gaming where you assume you could easily make better decisions than the streamer you are watching.\n* Nevertheless, taking the exact opposite approach of: **\u201cif top player/streamer does something different than I would, then I\u2019m the one that\u2019s wrong and I need to figure out why\u201d** is something I\u2019ve been using to consistently improve at this game.\n\n**Not using stats enough**\n\n* TFT changes way too much (read: frequent patches, bugs, ever-evolving meta, etc) to solely rely on intuition to play the game.\n* NA GOAT Dishsoap says he spends hours staring at various stats before coming up with a gameplay for a new patch.\n* If you listen to his podcast with Frodan (another great resource for improving at the game), he often has the correct answer to basically every obscure stat question Frodan throws at him in the Q&A portion. Things like: what is the best support item for a given comp? What is the best radiant item for a given unit? What about the best artifacts? Best types of augments for a specific reroll like such as Shenna? You won\u2019t always be able to search every stat especially when under time pressure in game.\n* From chats with players at various skill levels/ranks, IMO there is a really strong correlation between those who \u201cknow the stats\u201d with each and every patch and having a higher rank.\n* Of course stats can be misinterpreted, and are never the be-all-end-all to any decision (see the section on nuances and \u201calways\u201d/\u201dnever\u201d), but by and large I feel like stats are significantly more underused than they are overused by players trying to improve. Listen to Dishsoap/Frodan\u2019s latest podcast episode with Aesah as a guest for even more nuances on stats.\n* **Here are some other stats/tools you may not know about that are extremely useful:**\n   * MetaTFT has a tool to see stats of traits/boards by stage. i.e. what are the strongest boards on stage 2? Stage 3?\u00a0\n   * MetaTFT desktop app can tell you how many units you were expected to hit given how much gold you rolled and how many copies of a unit your opponent were holding at every point in a game. Super helpful for post game analysis.\n   * MetaTFT has portal-based stats, i.e. how good is x augment when played on y portal\n   * [Tactics.tools](http://Tactics.tools) advanced explorer can show you things like the best support items for a given line (independent of the item holder) if you unclick \u201csplit by item holder\u201d\n   * [Tactics.tools](http://Tactics.tools) player page can show you things like: how often are you making x item on y champion, how often are you playing z champion at 2\\* vs 3\\*. And you can compare these to top players\u2019 profiles to see if you are playing a given patch in an extremely different (and potentially suboptimal) way.\n\n# TFT gameplay pitfalls\n\n**Too often taking augments that will only pop off 1-2 stages later**\n\n* I think most good players recognize that item and econ augments give good value on 2-1 and board-wide combat augments like Jeweled Lotus are much better on 4-2.\n* It\u2019s usually the 3-2 selection that can be a bit tricky in this regard. And I think the biggest culprit here is **getting baited into an augment that is good for your endgame board or a point in time 1-2 stages later when you need some sort of strength right now.**\n* Example: you\u2019re playing Janna/Lux reroll. Your items are looking good for your backline (shojin, nashor and a rod, with no frontline items in sight), and you\u2019re offered Stand United, Jeweled Lotus 2 and Sleight of Hand.\n* If you just look at the stats for this comp, you\u2019ll find that Stand United has the best stats out of the 3, followed by JL2, followed by Sleight of Hand.\n* But it\u2019s important to recognize what these options mean for your specific spot and how they compare to each other:\n   * Stand United 2 gives 12.5 AD/AP to your board on level 6. Right now this is on mostly naked units except for your one carry. Then it gives 15 AD/AP when you add Morg on 7 (probably near end of stage 4 in an average game), likely with 2 fully itemized units. Then on 8 (probably stage 5) when you add Annie you\u2019re getting 17.5 AD/AP whole board, maybe with nearly 3 fully itemized units.\n   * JL2 is giving you crit stats that are mostly leveraged by your units with AP items. So you buff 1 itemized unit on stage 3, then maybe an itemized unit and a half on stage 4, and then possibly 2 fully itemized backliners on stage 5.\n   * Sleight of Hand gives you a TG that you can immediately throw on Illaoi/Diana for some needed frontline on 3-2. It also provides you with some frontline insurance in the case that you drop no frontline items on wolves which is potentially game losing.\n* So the overall comparison probably goes as follows: Stand United 2 is probably the best late game augment, JL2 can probably rival Stand United 2 late game if you have other AP based augments like Learning to Spell, and Sleight of Hand is the strongest right now and will probably be stronger for your overall board until mid stage 4 at the earliest. As well as saving you from a potential 8th where you drop no frontline items on wolves.\n* Now does this mean Sleight of Hand is always the right play in this type of spot? The answer, as is usually the case in TFT, is it depends. Do you have a potential winout setup and reason to believe you will make it to the late game? Are there other people in the lobby with stronger winout setups than you? The more winout potential you have and the better chance you have to make it to late game, the more you should lean towards the late game spiking augments. And vice versa when you have lower HP and have less winout potential.\n* Other examples of the similar scenarios:\n   * You\u2019re playing Teemo reroll with no frontline items and you\u2019re offered Lucky Ricochet and also some frontline item augments on 3-2\n   * You\u2019re playing Ghostly reroll and you\u2019re offered a Ghostly crest on 3-2 and also a frontline augment when you\u2019re lacking frontline.\n   * You\u2019re playing a reroll comp and took a reroll augment on 2-1 and the game drops very few items on Krugs. You\u2019re offered JL3 on 3-2 and also Buried Treasures (or overwhelming force or the AP item prismatic augment). JL3 spikes way later, but itemizing your naked 2 and eventually 3\\* units will give you so much more strength in the next stage and a half or so.\n* **As you get higher up in elo you\u2019ll find that players are more often taking the augments that are strong in the moment (except for situations where they are in a good spot to play for a winout). So taking the slow augments when you don\u2019t have true winout potential will really hurt your placements - you\u2019ll be weak at stage 3 and lose anyway to the players with real winout potential in the late game.**\n\n**Undervaluing DPS/stats of naked units on your board in the early/midgame**\n\n* This error usually shows up in the early/midgame when trying to play strongest board late stage 2 / stage 3. **It\u2019s very easy to be lazy and overvalue traits to determine your next in instead of truly thinking about what your board needs and what sorts of stats every unit in your shop can give you regardless of traits.**\n* I was doing a coaching session with Guubums and we were looking at a game where I had a frontline of Cho 2 holding Crownguard with 3 Fated (Ahri, Thresh, Kindred) and Neeko for Arcanist + Soraka for 2 heavenly. I level to 7 on 3-5 and put in a Tahm Kench, seeing as my itemized frontline 2\\* unit is Cho so it makes sense to beef it up with a trait.\u00a0\n* Guubums immediately goes, dude, you have a Lee Sin in your shop, there\u2019s no way it\u2019s 3 Mythic here. Just throw in the Lee.\n* I\u2019m a little surprised - I have no duelist on my board and I\u2019ve usually played around trying to strengthen my starred up itemized units. After the session I look up the stats on the units:\n   * 2\\* Cho: 1170HP, 40 armor, 40 MR.\n   * 1\\* TK: 850HP, 45 armor. 45 MR.\n   * 3 Mythic: +93HP on my Cho (and nominal stats on Neeko/TK).\n   * 1\\* Lee: 1100HP, 55 armor, 55 MR. And a buttload more DPS, even without Duelist.\n* Another game, Guubums picks up on a similar error on stage 3: I\u2019m playing a Fated board around Ahri 2 with Shiv, and I find an Ashe on 3-2. My board is clearly starving for DPS, but because I\u2019m too focused on beefing up my itemized starred up AP unit, I barely give naked Ashe any thought and don\u2019t play her on my board. Mind you Guubums isn\u2019t even suggesting to transfer items, but just to play the traitless Ashe. In hindsight he was definitely correct as my board lacked serious DPS throughout stage 3.\n* This goes back to a previous point of mine - given these 2 errors caught by Guubums, clearly I had some misunderstanding in playing strongest board and tried to update my mental model given this error pattern. Now in every game I play, whenever I see naked traitless 3 costs on stage 2 and naked traitless 4 costs on stage 3, I try and put a bit more thought into playing the unit on my board. I\u2019ll right click the unit and check the stats, see if it makes sense to play this stat stick over a trait that isn\u2019t doing much for me.\n* I think playing things like traitless Sylas on stage 3 is somewhat obvious to most good players given the clear strength of the unit. But Guubums was even mentioning things like naked traitless Lillia being fairly useful for a dps boost on stage 3. **Basically you just need to recognize what your board is missing, whether DPS or tankiness, and truly consider every single resource you have in your shop whether or not it aligns with your traits and items.**\n\n**Playing into a 3+ way contest because you have a strong opener for the line**\n\n* You load up a game, drop Yone from orb, drop chain bow sword cloak opener. Easy Titan\u2019s BT slam into a melee comp game, right?\n* This was exactly my spot and my decision in a game I reviewed with Aesah. He saw this and goes, Marcel, you\u2019ve already committed one pretty big error here: I didn\u2019t check to see how many others were playing melee as well.\n* Turns out 2 other people were playing around melee opener that game. I believe this was the patch where the only viable melee line was Heavenly Kayn/Lee duo. I actually **5 streaked through stage 2, but one other player hit Kayn 2 and went top 4, while me and the other contester missed and bot 4\u2019d. Does this sound like a familiar scenario to any of you?**\n* Prior to this discussion with Aesah, I had assumed that I was always down to multi-way contest a line if my opener was good for it. I\u2019d potentially 5 streak and be in a better spot than my contesters, have higher HP, more gold, and roll on 4-1 ahead of them. If they still hit and I missed, then BG, not my fault.\n* Aesah made really strong arguments as to why this logic doesn\u2019t capture the whole picture:\n   * 1.) You lose out on tons of carousel outs for basically the entire game. Kayn on stage 3 carousel? Gone. Wukong stage 4 carousel? You wish. Need that glove desperately on stage 3 carousel? Surprise surprise, the 2 other reaper players are also really glove hungry.\n   * 2.) If other players in the lobby catch on that there\u2019s a 3 way Kayn contest, any one of them (or multiple of them) can hold every Kayn they see at the cost of econ. It\u2019s likely extremely good EV for them to do so: potentially sending all 3 of you to a bot 3 placement.\n   * 3.) Just because you roll on 4-1 doesn\u2019t mean your contesters won\u2019t also do the same. Sure, you might be rolling 10-20 more gold than them. Maybe you\u2019re favored to find more Kayns than either one of them on 4-1. But how often are you going to fully 2\\* your entire board on 4-1? Those games are far and few between - most games you only find enough units to be somewhat stable, and then continue to roll throughout other parts of stage 4 / early stage 5 before going 9. And all those rolls will be extremely inefficient compared to if you were to just have played another less contested line.\n* Another way to think about this: let\u2019s say you have 1 kayn after your 4-1 rolldown and have 30 gold left. Your opponents also roll and have 3 kayns between the 2 of them. So there are 6 kayns left in the pool.\n* Compare this to the scenario where you play a fully uncontested line. You have 1 Ashe after your 4-1 rolldown and 30 gold left. Zero ashes out of the pool. So 9 ashes left in the pool.\n* You\u2019ve effectively increased your gold by 50% with regards to rolling for your 4 cost carry. Which can be thought of as basically being up a full augment (or behind a full augment depending on how you look at it).\n* I think having this aversion to playing multi-way contested makes the most sense in lines where you REALLY have to hit a very specific 4 cost unit 2\\*. Kayn with reapers and Lee with duelist being the prime examples. And some counter examples: Syndra (where you can stabilize with Kindred 2\\*), Ashe (where you can often stabilize with Aphelios 2), basically lines that have multiple outs besides 2\\*ing a single 4 cost carry.\n\n**Thinking in \u201calways\u201d and \u201cnever\u201d. There is too much nuance in TFT for that line of thinking**\n\n* The most common way this pitfall manifests is in augment selection. **Anything lower than \\~4.6? Never take. Anything better than \\~4.3? Always take. This line of thinking is really easy to fall into and limits how well you can adapt to any given scenario.**\n* Ideally you condition your decisions on as many variables as possible (portals, your earlier augments, HP, gold, etc.) instead of falling into this autopilot decision making approach.\n* Some obvious examples: playing in a Kayn encounter portal means item augments for immediate strength on 3-2 such as shiv/crownguarded/fully adapted are way higher in priority (some of these people consider as basically never takes). Playing spatula/loot subscription portal means Branching Out has quite a bit more potential. Augments that give an infusion of gold (Missed Connections, Dynamic Duo) are way more valuable when you are really low on gold.\n* Maybe less obvious for some:\n   * Augments that give you some gold on 2-1 (like Iron Assets, often an always-take for some players) are less valuable in portals where you start off with a lot of gold already.\n   * Augments that give you tons of item resources or traits that do the same (such as Fortune or 7 inkshadow) become less valuable when portals / encounters already give you a lot of resources.\n   * Level Up is quite a bit better when you are able to quickly get to 50 gold (via portal giving you gold or a gold opener) and quite a bit worse when you don't have much gold.\n* This type of error is of course not limited to augments.\n   * Always rageblade on Ashe: What if you have pumping up 3 and your item economy is much better if you burn two bows on red buff Ashe?\u00a0\n   * Do you never take the upgraded 2 cost from Morgana encounter over the 7 gold? What if you\u2019re playing a 2 cost reroll comp and you\u2019re already quite rich?\n* Your goal should be for each of your decisions to capture as much nuance as possible, factoring in things like portal, your gold situation, the rest of the lobby, your HP, item economy, augments, etc.\n* You should find that when you are truly considering as many possible variables as you can, your thought process will rarely settle on an \u201calways\u201d or \u201cnever\u201d type of statement with any decision, but rather an \u201cit depends\u201d.\n\nlolchess: [https://lolchess.gg/profile/na/Marcel%20P-2982/set11](https://lolchess.gg/profile/na/Marcel%20P-2982/set11)\n\nTwitch stream: [https://www.twitch.tv/marcelp\\_tft](https://www.twitch.tv/marcelp_tft)",

Here are my Five Exalted achievements in the top tier. This page shows Qujing and Little Taliyah's achievements, and Carelessd\u2019s achievements on NA server. It is very capable of winning and ranking high, and the flex playstyle is hard to get stuck on seven or eight, once mastered, it\u2019s easy to rank up.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uf2haf08bf9d1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=8eb1dfcc2ad7af2d60086a9b2167f3e611aa1ad6\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the composition of the Five Exalted lineup. Take any Exalted template for example, with Sivir and Aphelios activating Trickshot and Sniper, connecting Ashe and Kai'Sa as physical carries. Additionally, Exalted includes a magic carry, Morgana.\n\nTransitioning to mid-game stage 3, I can observe how many players are using Kai'Sa and Ashe, choosing the less popular one as my main carry.\n\nFrontline choices are actually very flexible. The four four-cost tanks Galio, Annie, Ornn, and Nautilus, whoever appears, keep them, and use whoever reaches two stars as the main tank with tank items. Among these, priority is given to synergy activation. For example, if there is Tahm Kench in the Exalted template, bringing Galio can activate 2 Bruisers, so Galio is prioritized over other tanks.\n\nThe same goes for three-cost units. Amumu and Lux can activate Porcelain, Illaoi and Morgana can activate Ghostly, so they are prioritized over Thresh and Diana without synergies. But when rolling for units, keep everything, use whoever reaches two stars first. For equal quality, Amumu and Illaoi are better than Diana, but a two-star Diana without synergy is better than a one-star Illaoi or Amumu with synergy.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zkggomnbbf9d1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4dcb38060331ca65bfd70762f338cc03f2e2c2c\n\nA strong, reasonable Five Exalted lineup must have a frontline, single-target damage, and AOE. The left image shows a lineup I constructed based on the Exalted template, with Kai'Sa as single-target damage, Morgana for AOE, and the frontline with Ornn. Then I find synergy units like Behemoth, Inkshadow, and Bruiser.\n\nThe frontline choice depends on the roll. If Nautilus comes first, pair him with Amumu or Illaoi to form 2 Wardens within the Exalted system. If it's two-star Galio or Annie, my frontline and corresponding synergy units will be them and their partners.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ncvaaphbf9d1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b885f762f4fe4fcc7419569612e8735d7f9b0c7\n\nHow to choose the flex synergy unit? The main role of the flex unit is to activate synergies. Besides the highest priority of activating the main carry and main tank\u2019s synergies, the next priority is team-wide beneficial synergies.\n\nHere are some excellent team synergies for the Five Exalted lineup: 2 Bruisers add 100 HP to the whole team; 2 Arcanists give 20 AP; 2 Ghostly if souls are stable give a 20% damage boost; 2 Altruists give 10 armor and MR; 3 Inkshadow provide a full item to the carry or tank; 2 Invokers give 5 mana every 3 seconds to the team.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fzqzta8jbf9d1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddb62ca733487de38811e0933d7b4f023be3999a\n\n# Which units are used in Five Exalted? \n\nThis is the Grandmaster and above 14.12 ranking, excluding major trait interference, sorted by delta descending single-unit rankings. Excluding Syndra, almost all 4 and 5-cost units can be used. \n\n* Recommended orange units: Sett, Udyr, Hwei, Azir, Rakan, Irelia, Xayah. \n* Purple units: Sylas, Morgana, Lillia, Kayn, Ashe, Kai'Sa. \n* Premium frontliners: Galio, Illaoi, Tahm Kench, Amumu, Thresh. \n* Usable frontliners: Nautilus, Annie, Ornn. \n* Damage units positioning: AOE, single-target, endgame functionality, each unit has its role. \n* High-value substitutes: Two-star five-cost units over two-star four-cost units, Kai'Sa replaced by Xayah, Ashe replaced by Irelia, Lillia replaced by Hwei, Kayn replaced by Wukong.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4q3kyk0mbf9d1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=5042bd53201e7e68df6f0f4c957c6921ac48da2b\n\nAt the start, look for Exalted. If the Exalted template only has 5 units and includes five-cost Exalted, then do not consider playing Five Exalted flex. Small team editor only selects Exalted, transitions to build frontline and carry items, and confirms the general direction of the lineup. Physical backline Kai'Sa, Ashe, magic warrior Sylas, physical warrior Kayn, magic backline Lillia.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4c6xlzyvbf9d1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=e457280e5d236bb5b1dcc6e04de0a53f2d95cdb4\n\nAfter choosing Hextech Augments, aggressively level up, maintaining win streaks to level 8 and preserve health. If economy is bad, accept starting late at 4-3 or 4-5. At level 8, decide rolling strategy based on health. If above 60 health, soft roll for one-star main tank and two-star main carry or two-star main tank and one-star main carry, then save to level 9 and roll. If below 60 health, roll for two-star main carry and main tank at level 8, then level 9 for two-star five-cost units.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0ksr01axbf9d1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=9cab1515eb09576b84d2c7bb785ca7cc2c48c9fe\n\nTo master Five Exalted, early game transition must be well done. Transitioning smoothly with win streaks in early stages to the stable stage four Five Exalted, versus barely surviving with one win one loss or losing streak at 4-1, will yield completely different results. Exalted is a transition route, and early game should be decided based on what units and items are drawn, not by waiting for the Exalted template. In other words, don\u2019t force Five Exalted, prioritize transitioning smoothly. If the early game transition is successful, congratulations, you are likely in top two. If it fails, don\u2019t play Five Exalted, consider other options.\n\n  \nDuring early transition, a strong frontline is always beneficial. I categorize damage units into AD, AP, and warriors. If the early game is favorable for AD transition, with AD items and drawn units, we can use Storyweaver Sivir, Sniper Caitlyn, or Senna for transition, later passing to Kai'Sa/Ashe/Xayah or Kayn, and ultimately to Irelia. If favorable for AP transition, use Storyweaver Zyra/Teemo, frontline with two-star Ahri/Kindred for three Fated transition, later passing to Lillia/Sylas, and ultimately to Hwei. If favorable for warrior transition, use Darius, Qiyana, Malphite, Yorick, and transition with this combination, later passing warrior items to Kayn/Sylas. If a Reaper is drawn, consider switching to Reaper comp. Note if the warriors are not \u201cpure warriors,\u201d meaning you built Justice, Deathblade, or Bloodthirster, then at 8 population, don\u2019t bring warriors, give Justice and Deathblade to AD carries (backline), Bloodthirster to tanks.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/faxk964zbf9d1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=c19e17b8ef84e98612904e245e87ed00cb0376a7\n\nUnderstanding low-cost Five Exalted playstyle starts with understanding low-cost unit rhythms. \n\nOne-cost: don\u2019t roll early, if many are drawn, at 2-1, rush level 4 for a round of three-star one-cost units. Otherwise, stay at level 5 with 50 gold to slow roll three-star one-cost units. \n\nTwo-cost: maintain win/loss streak to 3-2, reach level 6 to roll for two-star main carry and frontline, then slow roll for three-stars at level 6. \n\nThree-cost: stabilize health, reach level 7 at 4-1, roll for two-star main carry and frontline, then slow roll for three-stars at level 7.\n\nThen find suitable low-cost main carries, generally from Exalted template low-cost units, or other low-cost units that can connect synergies. For example, from the Exalted template, choosing Senna as main carry, being a two-cost unit, best to chase three-star Senna at level 6. Hence, the lineup should be a level 6 composition, other units should also be primarily one, two, and three-cost units to facilitate three-star Senna before leveling up for other synergies.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7oa5r6f1cf9d1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=b512b88fd7f25f9b0227afa23b98438459168465\n\n  \nAfter choosing the main carry, the next step is the main tank, ideally of the same cost as the main carry, to align card pool probabilities. Best to activate synergies and be a tank. In this example, I choose Shen as the main tank and Tahm Kench as secondary tank instead of Riven, as she is a warrior. Hence, the final lineup is constructed as shown in the image.\n\nNext, follow the conventional low-cost lineup rhythm, deducing your constructed lineup\u2019s rhythm. Using the above lineup as an example: maintain win/loss streak to 3-2, reach level 6 to roll for two-star Senna and two-star frontline. Save 50 gold to slow roll for three-star Senna and Shen. Once front and backline are three-starred, level up to complete Five Exalted, or if three-star Senna is quickly achieved and Shen is lacking, level up to find two-star four-cost frontline.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/98xstfgdcf9d1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=f61c732fd0b6be448edef5092f3274e96fb2f42b\n\n  \nHere is the equipment table for Five Exalted magic or physical lineups for reference\n\n======\n\nMe\u2014\u2014Master-GM player in EUW:\u00a0[https://lolchess.gg/profile/euw/autochess%20xjdrtf-EUW/set11](https://lolchess.gg/profile/euw/autochess%20xjdrtf-EUW/set11)",

        "content": "# Intro\nHi /CompetitiveTFT!\n\nI\u2019m back with another text-heavy post on the subreddit. This is only my second major post so I wanted to re-mention that my credentials are a bit different than most who may frequent and post on this sub; although I\u2019ve been playing since set 1, I only really started delving deep into the game beginning in set 9. That said, I\u2019m nowhere near a challenger-level player.\n\nHowever, I do have close to 15 years of experience in data evaluation and multivariate analytics (among other things) working for a global investment bank. When I finally discovered tactics.tools in set 9, I went from a casual TFT player to a \u201ctry-hard\u201d player, as the game really connected with my extensive experience in data manipulation and trend analysis. \n\nBefore jumping in, I wanted to mention that I am utilizing data from MetaTFT and utilizing a filter of Master+.\n\n# Caretaker\u2019s Ally\n\nI think I am one of many who really like this augment. It feels a lot like the exalted trait or the branching out augment in that you are unable to go into a game forcing one/two comps \u2013 you get a champion and you now need to build your strategy around it.\nIt is currently the strongest silver augment at an AVP of 4.17. So what is the point of this post? I want to address three questions:\n\n1. How do each of the units perform at 3 stars? \n1. What does the average amount of games for each unit imply?\n2. What is the preferred strategy that is being utilized for each champion (note - this is not meant to imply the BEST strategy for each unit, only the most utilized strategy, per the data)?\n\n# Two notes before we jump into the data \n\nFirst, I need to acknowledge that the current patch has limited data so I did utilize patch 14.12 to ensure I had a large enough sample size. That said, I did compare the statistics for each of these units between patch (14.12) and the current patch (14.13). The largest variance in AVP between the two patches were Senna (-0.38 \u2013 sniper buff related), Janna (-0.27 \u2013 I\u2019m not sure why she is this much better in current patch) and Kindred (+.15 \u2013 Ahri/Syndra nerf). I felt comfortable enough that Patch 14.12 is \u201cclose enough\u201d to this patch to simply utilize the larger data set.\n\nSecond, when filtering by games with the Caretaker\u2019s Ally augment, the statistics don\u2019t actually tell you what unit was received. For example, if there is a game with Caretaker\u2019s Ally that has a final team composed of Zyra, Shen, Aatrox and Riven, all at 3*, there isn\u2019t a way to figure out which unit was the unit provided by the augment. Still, there are some reasonable assumptions we can make and quite a few things to learn, regardless of whether we are 100% accurate.\n\n# What does Masters+ data show? \n\nWithout further ado, when a player takes Caretaker\u2019s Ally, this is the AVP of each unit at 3* and the amount of games played.\n \n* Aatrox  (AVP of 4.03 over 1,197 games.)\n\n* Zyra  (AVP of 3.75 over 1,607 games.)\n\n* Shen   (AVP of 3.92 over 1,775 games.)\n\n* Lux  (AVP of 3.82 over 1,740 games.)\n\n* Janna   (AVP of 3.68 over 1,194 games.)\n\n* Senna  (AVP of 4.08 over 1,058 games.)\n\n* Kindred   (AVP of 3.57 over 947 games.)\n\n* Riven  (AVP of 3.84 over 937 games.)\n\n* Neeko   (AVP of 3.92 over 743 games.)\n\n* Qiyana  (AVP of 3.92 over 695 games.)\n\n* Yorick   (AVP of 4.82 over 696 games.)\n\n* Teemo  (AVP of 3.56 over 1,068 games.)\n\n* Gnar   (AVP of 4.27 over 849 games.)\n\n#Some initial takeaways on the raw AVP data\nThe first thing your eyes likely saw:\n\n1. As expected, Yorick is by far the worst champion to get, as even at 3*, you have an AVP of 4.82. Gnar is also pretty bad to get, at 4.27.\n\n1. Teemo and Kindred are the best champions to get, with an AVP of ~3.56\n\nDigging a little deeper we see that frontline units (Aatrox, Shen, Riven, Neeko, Qiyana, Yorick and Gnar) are worse to get than backline units (Zyra, Lux, Janna, Senna, Kindred and Teemo). \n\n1. AVP for frontline units is 4.00+ whereas AVP for backline units is <3.70.\n1. Riven is the best frontline unit at 3.84; accounting for the buff to Senna (now averaging 3.70), the worst backline unit to get (Lux, 3.82) is still better than the best frontline unit to get (Riven).\n\n# Looking at the game count per champion...\n\nThere are 13 2-cost champions, which means that when you pick Caretaker\u2019s Ally, each 2-cost unit has a 7.7% chance to be picked. The data set I'm reviewing has ~13,000 games, which should be assumed to be a large enough data set that, statistically speaking, each of the 2-cost champions were provided by the augment a relatively equal amount of the time (in this case, each champion should have ~1,000 games or so).\n\nIf the odds to get each champion are equal, why is there such a large disparity between game count? Additionally, why do you think that Shen and Lux have over 2.5x the amount of games (~1,750) than Yorick and Qiyana have (just under 700)? \n\nIs it because Riot knows how bad it is to get Yorick with this augment and therefore skews the odds so you don\u2019t get him as often as other 2-cost champions? If only! \n\nI think we need to go a little bit deeper with the data, while combining some of our game knowledge, in order to answer this question. Before we do, let's calculate the percentage that each champion gets to 3* versus the expected number of games the champion was provided by the Caretaker's Ally augment. \n\nA quick example of the calculation, in case there is any confusion. Neeko was 3* in 743 games of the ~13,000 games with Caretaker's Ally. Utilizing our assumption that, of the 13,000 games played with Caretaker's Ally, the augment chose Neeko for ~1,000 of those games. This implies that Neeko was only 3* 74% of the time that she was provided by Caretaker's Ally. \n\n#Based on this calculated percentage, three distinct groups of champions appear:\n\n1. Yorick, Qiyana, Neeko and Gnar have ~75% play rate at 3* . This implies that the player didn\u2019t 3* the unit that was provided by Caretaker\u2019s Ally ~25% of the time. This could be because the player died before making the 3* but I actually think this implies that the player utilized the unit to hold items and for early game tempo before deciding to sell the unit. For example, a player may have utilized Qiyana to hold Kayn/Lee Sin items and, on their level 8 roll down, they 2* Kayn/Lee Sin before hitting 3* Qiyana. Or, they got Yorick and realized that items on a 2* Ornn was way better than a 3* Yorick.\n\n1. Aatrox, Janna, Kindred, Riven, Senna and Teemo have ~105% play rate at 3* . This implies that the unit is valuable at 3* and fits within a meta lvl 8/9 comp. For example, Teemo/Aatrox/Riven fit well within a brusier/trickshot composition. Similarly, Kindred is an amazing unit to have 3* in a fated/dryad comp but you don't necessarily want to roll for it at 6. I believe the play rate is slightly higher for a few of these units (Aatrox, Teemo, Senna) because of the next group of units. \n\n1. Zyra, Lux and Shen have ~170% play rate at 3* . This implies that, if you hit one of these champions with the Caretaker's Ally augment, the preferred method to get to 3* is not by leveling but by rerolling with other 2 or 3-cost units. For example, the Zyra/Shen ghostly, Zyra/Lux/Janna duo, Shen/Senna/Aatrox ghostly, etc. The much larger play rate is interesting here; the statistics indicate that even if you don't hit one of these three champions, getting champions like Aatrox, Riven, Janna or Senna as your Caretaker's Ally champion, many players will still try to hard force one of the reroll compositions (which largely include at least Zyra, Lux and/or Shen).\n\nSo, with all that said, the question has got to be\n# For each of these units, is the most common strategy currently being utilized the actual best strategy to attain the highest AVP?\n\nAnd with that, I'm going to wrap up this post! I know, what a tease! The truth is that I started with the question \"what is the best strategy for each 2-cost unit when you take Caretaker's Ally\" and, in the midst of trying to answer this question, I felt the need to \"work backwards\" and document the initial assumptions, as answering the question became a lot more complicated than I expected. The inability to know which champion was provided by Caretaker's Ally makes the analysis a degree harder than it should be!\n\nI do plan to \"answer\" the question in a follow up post, at least in regards to what can be known through data analytics, but I thought this was a good stopping point to see if there is (1) interest in a further review of this topic/augment (2) see if anyone arrives at different conclusions than what I outlined above and (3) see if anyone had reviewed this augment in depth and had any thoughts to share.\n\nThanks for reading and let me know what you think. \n\n# A P.S. entirely unrelated to this post\n\nIf anyone of importance is still reading at this point - PLEASE bring back 1v0 mode on PBE or allow us to create custom TFT games within the client. Folks competing in tournaments get access to the tournament realm (which has this ability) and it seems competitively unfair that most don't have access to this tool.",

            "I knew Yorick was the worst, but damn it is awful. Also knew Teemo was great but didn't expect it to be the best (especially after Fated nerfs). Teemo 3* is insane though, and you don't have to play the reroll board so you can just go 8 and play Kai'Sa Bruisers.\n\nI'm most curious about how frontlines like Riven in particular are played. Riven carry is a viable comp, though I've only used it with Silvermere Dawn (Innervating Locket is also good). But Riven can also be played in a ton of viable comps. Do you still go for AD bruiser items on her or do you slam tank items? The stats from last patch show items like BT Titan's are the most common and perform well, but the sample size stats to drop off rapidly after that.\n\nI do think the best way to play the augment in most cases is to not play a reroll comp. For example, you mentioned Zyra having a very high 3* rate and see it being played with Ghostly reroll units. But you could just carry Zyra to push levels and end up with a Zyra 3* or even just sell the extra Zyras and transition to a stronger board with the tempo.",

            "Great post! \n\nThe few times i've taken it, I haven't 3* the unit, but basically utilized it as an econ augment. As it provided units I never wanted to play. \n\nI no longer pick this when I see it, but this makes me more intersted.",
