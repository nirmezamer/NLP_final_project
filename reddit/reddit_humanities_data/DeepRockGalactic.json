            "I assume there is a separate set of Deep Dives for consoles this week since the DLC has not yet launched there?",
            "Last mission of the EDD makes me wonder if they ever plan on letting Bosco help more on escort missions. My build was very kite-reliant (I mean I was a scout) and I went in blind, but ended up losing the dozer at about 70% through the Heartstone.  \n  \nFirst mission was pretty straight forward.  \nSecond has a dead end area where you'll need one of aquarqs from, but super simple if you have a driller. Soloing as a scout I had to rely heavily on Bosco. Getting one of these off the bat otherwise may be wise.  \nThird is not horrible up until the end, but is kind of a standard 1-stop escort mission with easy to reach shale. \n\n  \nTons of nitra I never got to in the 3rd stage.  \n  \nIn a normal group I don't see this being that bad, but if you're solo you'll definitely need to kill things asap. Again, a fairly typical haz 5+ escort...\n\nI don't like escort so am unlikely to try soloing again, but may end up joining a group of randoms at some point.",
            "This week's normal Deep Dive really loved ranged enemies, and missions that take a long time.\n\n* **First Stage** - Big nice open cave. Nothing too advanced. All three Mini-mules are fairly easy to reach, so is the Morkite Geyser. Plenty of Nitra thanks to the Mini-mules and a single leech in the roof. \n\n* **Second Stage** - So many ranged enemies, thanks to the new Duck and Cover warning. The mission itself otherwise ain't too much trouble, with the Morkite Geyser being in an in-between cave.\n\n* **Third Stage** - Duck and Cover makes it's foul return. The area around the Caretaker is spacious, so minimal terraforming is needed. The Twin's cocoon is right above said Caretaker. Plenty of Nitra available once more. \n\nI played Gunner together with an Engineer and Driller, on Steam.",
            "Failed the EDD on the first try with the dozer at 90% complete... It was sad. Two people in the group were clearly unaware of the new rock prison wave and how much damage it does to the dozer. Me and the other guy franticly typed in chat trying to get them to walk away from her, but she lost both her sides that wave.\n\n  \nPlease make sure your team knows the new rock mechanic in escort duty does A LOT OF DAMAGE to the dozer.",
            "For the last stage of the Deep Dive, do the data vault first. Once the data vault is defeated, immediately start the boss battle with the dreadnoughts. The explosion from the data vault should drain most of their health.\n\nOverall, a very fun, if hectic, deep dive.",
            "i've been waiting for this, thanks for the speedy heads up",
            "Never understood why people hated Duck and Cover so much until I played this one",
            "It's really satisfying to pop the egg right as caretaker is about to die, his death explosion kills the dreadnaughts for you.",
            "Interesting deep dive to get back into deep dives on\n\nStage 1 wasn't really memorable. As of writing this message I am currently on stage 2 with a Driller build that is very lacking in range. The bramble mortar guy over the oil refill zone is interesting. It's my first time seeing it and my first time playing duck and cover, seeing so many acid spitters at once was pretty new. I've been down a couple of times but Dotty is doing alright. Will write more when it's over one way or another.\n\nI broke through the Heartstone and then got sniped by four tri jaws at the same time and lost. RIP, was asking for it with a flamethrower and full auto subata build lol. No range at all\n\nEdit: came back later with Gunner and won, saw stage 3 is Industrial Sabotage with Duck and Cover, decided I'm good. A cosmetic OC isn't worth that lol. It'd probably be a beard anyway"
