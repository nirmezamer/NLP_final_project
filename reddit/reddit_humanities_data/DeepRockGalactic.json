            "This is by far the best season yet. Great mission, great random event, overall good new modifiers and enemies, good QoL all around. Still hoping one day they add the option to mute the game when tabbed.",

            "Season 5 goes hard, feel free to play it",
            "I was with a group earlier & we found a jetboot crate on a drillevator mission. Unfortunately when it came time to head out, we couldn't equip the jetboot v2s to escape & almost wiped. Was there something I missed?",
            "The new mission is crazy fun! \n\nalways singing \"it raining bugs, Hallelujah!\" on the way down",
            "In my first deep scan mission, moments after activating the drillevator we got two bulk detonators. Killing them before they reached us wasn't too much of a problem, but when they exploded they rained bomblets down on us which killed three. I only survived because I was under the gunner shield *and* had max health, and I still nearly died.\n\nBulks seem pretty hard to deal with when you can't get any horizontal distance from their explosion.",
            "Haven't had a chance to try it out yet, nor anytime soon, so I've got a question. How does Engi's turrets interact with the drillevator? I'm trying to avoid youtube because I want to go in blind. Thanks.",
            "Anyone else feel that the drillevator is a bit too small and cramped?",
            "Made myself a really nice sandwich this morning",
            "Looks like Mission Control is back to repeating voicelines. Was doing the dive and he kept telling us to connect the pipeline to the pumpjack even as we were escaping"

            "EDD rates in my top 10 easiest EDDs ever and I've been playing since S2. Sub 25 with randos who were obsessed with grabbing every nitra vein. Sub 15 feels very doable with a coordinated team, I might even put a sub 10 on the books if you were really on top of your game e.g. team suicides and scout drop pod clipping to skip extractions.",

            "I mostly play solo (and I'm not that good, play on Haz 3 or 4 usually), I failed the EDD on the second stage because it turned out I wasn't built to quickly beat the hive guard with the engineer build I had going (was trying something new), ended up getting massively overrun.\n\nBut ended up clearing the whole EDD with my DOT Driller (Disperer Compound Sludge Pump with Radioactive Microwave Gun), it's not the best at mactera and other things that keep their distance, but it's just about a king of crowds and can melt tough enemies on the ground too. It was really fun!",
            "I did my first EDD today with these ones.\n\ngod damn that second mission was hard, me (engineer) and my scout friend were trying for like 3 hours to get it. we decided it would be best to kill the dread first and oh boy it had to be the dread that spawns waves of garbo before you can kill it lol. that ontop of fast enemies that hurt you a lot was... a lot to deal with. also insane amounts of \"special\" grunts (armoured, slasher)",

            "Yea the dread and waves were tough for us too without a driller to clear the area. We took over an hour for the whole dive."

It is extremely well done, I have seen all of it (enemies, events, etc.) And the ONLY gripe I have is the caves not spawning enough Nitra to keep up with Max5 difficulty.. \n\nWe are getting swarmed faster then we can find Nitra and typically can't get to it fast enough without worrying about being downed so fast from Vulnerability II.. \n\nThrew a x3 Dreadnaught Double XP with Swarmageddon on Max5 right out the window after successfully combating an Omen and the first 2 dreads due to no ammo, everybody used their iron will to res one another and then go on a desperate search for Nitra to no avail :(\n\nIf at all possible, a Nitra spawn increase and/or discounted resupply pod price for max5 would be awesome (maybe 60 or 50?) Otherwise it just seems too difficult to keep up with the enemy spawns and health damage required to kill them when you got a team of 4 :(\n\nBut if this is the way you intended it to be, very well...\n\n\n\nWith love, LT LowBalls\n\nRock and Stone!!!\n",

            "It might be more interesting if management sent in an extra resupply container every once in a while, but had bad aim, so you have to make it to the ammo drop point.\n\nIt would break up the normal routine of ammo resupply,  and force you to run over to pick it up, instead of only calling it in a convenient spot.",
            "I think focusing to build and play for extreme ammo economy could be a cool challenge",
            "I... Don't have that issue. I've never ran out of ammo (or occasionally) and beaten max difficulty couple of times. But perhaps this is because I am a scout main and prioritize nitra at the beginning.",
            "Gamers trying to comprehend the idea that hard difficulty can be challenging while still being fair and enjoyable to play: (impossible challenge)\n\nWith OP on this one, and literally anyone that have actually played max haz5+",
            "I've never seen leadstorm as ammo efficient, unlike aoe AC or Hurricane",
            "Meh people will tell you it\u2019s supposed to be like that and to just play regular haz 5 on missions in hazardous biomes and/or with warnings/anomalies\n\nPersonally what I do with my pals is focus on a good crowd clearing/ammo efficient build, they only activate \"more bugs II\" cuz otherwise it\u2019s unplayable. Unfortunately that doesn\u2019t gel well with Elimination or Industrial Sabotage missions, nor random boss encounters",
            "Gotta agree with you here OP, getting screwed over by not having enough nitra really sucks",
            "Maybe if devs could implement extra nitra for money paid modifier or something, it could be a good solution. I'd washer a guess people play haz 5+ not for goldor something else anyway, so this could solve this issue perhaps. It'll be even better if that modifier would have tiers. Or just spawn more nitra depending on extra modifiers or something.\n\nNot that I have a horse in this race though, I've yet to become good enough to deal with Haz 5 consistently lol",
            "would be awsome for S6, if minerals could spawn deep in walls. Then make so scout can detect them somehow and make drillers good at collecting minerals too",
            "So i've been reading through here a bit and my first idea is: make it a perk to mine % more nitra or minerals in general\n\nThat way you have to build and sacrifice something for it, i think that would be fair and balanced."

            "Why is the same OC counted as a Clean for the GK2 but a Balanced for the Bulldog?",
            "Above one is for the GK2 which is full auto, while the bottom one is for the bulldog which is slow semi auto. The former you\u2019re spraying enemies down anyway so the increased sample size ensures you deal more damage most of the time for a given enemy. This is technically the case for the ladder (with a lower minimum), but since you\u2019re only shooting 1-4 bullets at a slower rate you might actually be affected by a less than 100% damage roll (i.e. \u201cI thought this gun could one shot acid spitters!\u201d)",
            "Random is a vibe not a concept",
            "Those dice are Wrong!  Opposite sides are supposed to add up to 7, so 1 would never be adjacent to 6, nor would 2 be adjacent to 5.",
            "Subata shoots a lot more bullets, making each bullet matter less, so the higher damage on average usually evens out to higher than 100. \n\nOn the bulldog, every shot matters considering the higher burst, so a bad shot actually makes quite a difference.",
            "I think it's because of the greater difference/range the Bulldog has",
            "These OCs are boring. I remember a wise man said that they should inflict random statuses instead, especially for subata, it needs more",
            "110% damage for the full auto 137% damage for the semi auto seems like a fair trade to miss breakpoints on a trijaw that is about to wipe your team.",
            "There is also incoherence with stuff like the overdrive for the laser. It is a clean OC, the downsides only happen if you choose to use the alternative way of firing which is enabled by the oc. You can just decide to not use it, there will be no drawbacks. It is clean.\n\nSame for the brand new flamethrower OC.",
            "The range of damage, both up and down, is significantly more for the Bulldog, making it more balanced and less clean, that\u2019s all there really is to it"
