            "Team Avatar Treasury (previously released as a box set) is the name for the collection of the first three ATLA one-shot graphic novels: \"Katara and the Pirates' Silver\", \"Toph Beifong's Metalbending Academy\", and \"Suki Alone\". The library edition is a hardcover book with some extras.",
            "YES I knew it would serve me to hold off on getting these individually.",
            "Suki fans should be happy about this, they think shes ignored often.",
            "Why do you guys think it took so long for this to be collected in the library format?",
            "ugh, so smart! i caved and bought the paperbacks. . . ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)\n\n(though i lowkey wish this library edition would include Azula and Iroh's forthcoming story in it as well!)",
