            "Hmmm, I'd dearly love to contribute and I'm an amateur photographer. Having shot hundreds of images in Israel over the past decade(s), I've been looking through my city-scapes (mostly Haifa, Nahariya and Tel Aviv) and recognizable Israeli landscapes but in the banner size quoted nothing really fits.\n\nI definitely am looking forward to see what others can come up with and maybe get inspired for my next visit in October (just got back on Wednesday night). Cool idea! If I do come across a potential, how do we upload in the comments? I can only see a way to link, not to upload an actual image.",
