            "Hmmm, I'd dearly love to contribute and I'm an amateur photographer. Having shot hundreds of images in Israel over the past decade(s), I've been looking through my city-scapes (mostly Haifa, Nahariya and Tel Aviv) and recognizable Israeli landscapes but in the banner size quoted nothing really fits.\n\nI definitely am looking forward to see what others can come up with and maybe get inspired for my next visit in October (just got back on Wednesday night). Cool idea! If I do come across a potential, how do we upload in the comments? I can only see a way to link, not to upload an actual image.",
            "i did not know you cant post images here tbh, i guess just link to the image (imgur would be the best)",
            "the 2000x224 ratio is kind of absurd, there's almost no photo that would look good with that framing.  I believe they really only care about the height since the dimension they gave is what the current top banner is with several photos stitched together horizontally.",

I have 2 friends that do this a lot in nyc to all kinds of people, and Im always surprised they havent been knocked out yet. Natives were right, it steals a little piece of soul.
