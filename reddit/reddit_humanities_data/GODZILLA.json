            "I mean, realistically, no one would expect a creature like this to exist and she probably thought K\u014dichi was simply over exaggerating due to PTSD. So obviously, after seeing the giant monster that matches the descriptions of K\u014dichi\u2019s tale, she\u2019d obviously wonder that\u2026\n\nI don\u2019t think anyone ordered a Yappachino but you got one anyways.",

In the movie, and on the stock SH figure, he\u2019s very much a charcoal gray color with patches of tan across his body, most notably on his feet and chest. And, his fins also have some color to break up the grayness."
