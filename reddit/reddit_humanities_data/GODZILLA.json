            "Gamera in monster verse when?",
            "Gamera should be given more love.",
            "Great kaiju. I kinda hate how some either make his trilogy to be the only movies worth anything in the genre, or the ones that treats his showa era like the worst thing to happen to man. I think it's beautiful that the same character was able to inspire different unique takes whole still having his own identity. \n\nI will always prefer godzilla, but gamera earned hiss place alongside him",
