            "Perfect day for brainstorming. I have a book I just started writing (never publish, just personal short-ish stories) and I'm also looking for recommendations. Tried making a post, but apparently the auto-mod said they don't like it, and to list it here.\n\nI haven't read any *current* books in quite a long time, and I'm currently trying to get some inspiration of how to structure things a bit more clearly and eloquently.\n\nI'm curious of 1) which \"older\" author is your favorite as far as their writing style, 2) favorite \"newer\" author, 3) a good book or series that you find to be very well written.\n\nIt drives me *insane* when a book feels like it's written for a.... different audience. I grew up on books written by Edgar Rice Burroughs, Louis L'Amour, C.S. Lewis while also stumbling across Nora Roberts more recently.\n\nI like SciFi and Fantasy, and I'm wanting to branch into more adult books to see how things are done in books these days. I've written plenty of adult content for others, but never cared for the ones I attempted. They seem like they are childish in a way; inexperienced with a fantastical (though wildly impractical or unrealistic) idea of what is happening. \n\nI'm not old, I just hate moderate to piss poor effort in writing quality. Takes me completely out of the world I'm trying to get into.",
            "I struggle with names and titles. Do any of you have resources you use to help with that?",
            "How could I wrote someone who's pretending to be someone else, a good person who's funny, likeable, the person who they've always wanted to be etc when they're actually someone who's deeply calculative and a good liar.\nThey see themselves as the person who they pretend to be but deep down they know that they aren't, they ideally want someone who would accept them for who they are.\nI'm really thinking about how to show this kind of character, for example, their thoughts being extremely to the point and shrewd while their speech is extremely long and comedic.\nAny ideas?",
            "Dialogue or summary, which is the best? I am struggling with this dilemma. The situation is this: A secondary character will reveal some lore of the world and the political situation. However, I can't choose between a good long dialogue or a much quicker analytical summary. Any Advice?\n\nThis lore is relevant to the story",
            "FRIENDS-TO-ENEMIES-TO-LOVERS\n\nHow soon should I introduce the fact that childhood friends turned enemies are actually fated to be lovers?\n\nFor context, (werewolf novel) WMC was brainwashed into a revolution as a young child, and was subsequently taken into hiding with her future LI. They grew up as friends in hiding, LI eventually finds out she was the \u201cleader\u201d of the revolution, immediately hates her. Later they find out they are mated, he ends up rejecting her and takes off for years. She ends up proving her loyalty to the wolf-King and is given a pardon and is informed the Moon Goddess is now going to repair the rejected bond rather than give her a new mate. Now LI is back and they haven\u2019t seen each other since the bond was fixed, but I have to bring them back together soon for a mission.\n\nI\u2019m on Chapter 16, bond was fixed in Chapter 12-ish, after some heated arguments between WMC and LI. Should I just bite the bullet and do it in this chapter? It feels like too much to put in just a couple of chapters \ud83d\ude05",
            "Was going to put this in its own post because it's a rather long question, but got a warning to put it here when I added the title, so sorry in advanced for how long this is. I wrote the post before already, so I'll just put it here I suppose.\n\nI am writing a cultivation novel and would like some help figuring out what items would be necessary to bring a person back to life in my story. The character who's going to be bringing this person back to life is a peasant who's hoping to raise a martial master from his grave and make them mentor him. He is, of course, an idiot, if that's relevant, but I need him to successfully perform this task.   \n  \nThis is relevant because he likely wouldn't have access to any crazy artifacts that you might see an established cultivator struggle to obtain. It's possible for him to stumble across some sort of part or egg or something of a legendary beast by chance, because I don't want it to be super easy to raise the dead in this world, but he needs to manage it in the beginning of the story. I don't want to have too many details beforehand about him obtaining those items because this resurrection takes place at the very beginning of the story and the plot can't get properly started unless the story begins with him in the cemetery performing said ritual. Him going through a bunch of hardship in the beginning that he likely wouldn't survive in his state would sadly be way too awkward to fit into the exposition.\n\nDoes anybody know some items that could be used for this ritual, or any items he could stumble across by rare (yet convenient, lol) chance? Usually there would be some big arc building up to a revival in cultivation stories, but the whole point of this is that the protagonist, desperate for a mentor in the beginning of the story, resorts to raising the dead, only to revive the wrong person and have to deal with the annoying person he accidentally brought back instead. I'm open to having somebody pulling the strings behind the scenes that gave him these items, but ultimately my reason for asking this is because I have no idea what kinds of items would usually be necessary for this in a cultivation story or how they would be used.",

            "Not sure where this would go, so apologies if this belongs in a different thread, but...Does anyone know if there's a database for all the writing/publishing resources?

            "Is there such a thing as a mystery writer's wiki or database where one can look up certain details? For example something such as how much of a certain substance would it take to kill a person? Looking for book contents and I feel googling it would put me on some sort of watch list.",

            "\\*Title: The Interloper, Chapter 1\n\n\\*Genre: Hard sci-fi\n\n\\*4245 words\n\nHi, there, I'm a newcomer here. I'm typically someone with more of an interest in science and philosophy, but enjoy speculative fiction as a vehicle to explore these concepts.\n\nSo, here's the first chapter of a story I'd like to receive feedback on. Given that this is hard sci-fi, the focus of a lot of my effort has been trying to make sure that the events in the story align as much as possible with current understanding of science and principles of logical consistency. However, I've also tried to make sure the writing is up to snuff - I've thrown away a few previous stories due to thinking they weren't delivered in a satisfying way, and the only reason why this has been posted here is because it meets my personal criteria for readability.\n\nI'm not looking for any specific feedback. While I would certainly appreciate pointers on where the plot deviates from believable scientific speculation or generally just strains credulity, I'd hugely appreciate (and am mostly expecting) feedback on aspects such as how the prose feels and flows, on how understandable the writing is, and whether the dialogue feels authentic enough.\n\nLink: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VRUve1NXcBEBN6eKt5VrXY-CnToFxnJh9e8yOZ\\_LYZk/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VRUve1NXcBEBN6eKt5VrXY-CnToFxnJh9e8yOZ_LYZk/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nExcerpt:\n\nTwo months, fifteen days, twenty-one hours, and counting. That\u2019s how long I\u2019ve been here, dying in slow motion, my body slowly rotting from the inside long before I\u2019ve even had the chance to take my last breath. My final resting place will be a twisted, hyperbaric coffin named *Proteus,* forged from metal, glass and concrete, entombed deep in the waters of a lifeless abyss.\n\nThe luminaire assemblies that line the walls of the hab gradually flicker on and illuminate the chamber in a sickly off-white glow, mechanically simulating a diurnal cycle for all its doomed inhabitants.\n\nIn the station, an ever-present soundscape practically smothers us, heavy and ominous and oppressive. The very walls that protect us from the elements scrape and buckle incessantly like a soda can under pressure, as if they could crumple inwards and crush us at any moment. In the endless, murky depths outside, the hydrothermal fields produce a subtle, low rumble that seems to emanate from somewhere in the very core of the world, like a massive sleeping god under our feet only kept alive by its host body\u2019s eccentric swings from periapsis to apoapsis and back again. Softly stirring as it\u2019s unwittingly press-ganged into providing the energy necessary to sustain *Proteus* and keep it from falling apart.\n\nI hear Whitlock faintly stirring in the bunk underneath me. The bed creaks as he slowly, gingerly sits up and begins to vomit into a bucket, choking and heaving and gasping as the contents of his stomach unceremoniously escape his body. Once the retching is over, there\u2019s laboured breathing and a soft, low thud; the sound of a head being rested against a bunk pole.\n\n\u201cHey, you okay down there?\u201d I call to him, my voice raspy and worn.\n\nNo response.\n\nStill extremely tired, sore and unwilling to get up, I close my eyes and try to ignore the faint glow behind my eyelids, letting the deep, all-consuming drone lull me back to sleep. Slowly, I lose awareness of my limbs and then my body, and very nearly manage to fall into a state of blissful oblivion until a quiet thumping and rustling emerges from near the door of the module, breaking me out of my hypnagogia.\n\nI blearily crack open an eyelid, and strain through the harsh fluorescent glare to see who it is. It\u2019s Spivey putting on his uniform and shoes, getting ready for the day ahead so he can pretend to be useful.\n\nOf the lot of us, he\u2019s the only one that\u2019s bothered to act like the mission still matters. When he\u2019s not doubled over in horrible agony and hacking up a lung, he conducts routine structural checkups, analyses sediment samples near hydrothermal systems, collects data on the topography of the seafloor, and performs a million other experiments that no one will remember. Amassing an ever-growing corpus of information so he can stave off the overwhelming despair and grief, desperately trying to convince himself that he still has a role to fill in spite of his impending doom.\n\nHe zips up his jumpsuit, and turns to us.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m gonna have a look at field C-21. You two can rot in your bunks all day or you can help.\u201d\n\nI groan and reluctantly peel myself from the bedsheets.",

Their friend Edgar was high on blueblood and half a joint he\u2019d found in his pocket after dinner. He might have taken Sean and Miguel up on having a hit of the baggie of synthetics they shared, but he\u2019d always preferred to celebrate special occasions with a nice mellow. Jody, seven beers deep, clung to Reese\u2019s shoulder as they stumbled forward. Reese, ever the square, was sober. The group were walking down Santa Lucia Street, cackling at one of Sean\u2019s stories about the time he and his ex had misread a road sign during a day trip and it became a week trip.\n\n\tWhen he finally found his breath again, Edgar wiped his eyes dry and cleared his throat.\n\n\u201cMiguel, it\u2019s been real, man. It\u2019ll be hard to see you go.\u201d He gripped Miguel\u2019s hand and gave him a thump on the back.

It\u2019ll be a good night for a spirit hunt, he thought as he strode down the snowy path with a spring in his step.\n\nDespite the attacks by spirit monsters, the walled town of Rhelton was surrounded by a sprawling shantytown teeming with life.  Arion raised his guard as he approached the sea of tattered canvas tents.  He shifted his eyes between the scores of people, wary for signs of cutpurses or cutthroats.  The smell of the place hardly helped his focus.  Every nook of the slum reeked of unwashed bodies and heavily spiced stew that made his eyes water.\n\nNearly everyone Arion passed stared up at him with sunken, hungry eyes.  Children stopped playing and either pointed at him or ran when he walked by.  Older folk were bolder.  They hissed at him and stood guard in front of the younger ones.  They brandished kitchen knives, pitchforks, or even holy Sun charms meant to ward off evil.\n\nThe sight of all those angry faces only worsened Arion\u2019s tics.  Every few seconds, he\u2019d feel a burning urge to jerk his head to the side, slap himself, or snarl like some rabid animal.\n\nEach time a tic slipped past his guard, he drew more bad attention to himself.  Then the new narrowed eyes on him only inflamed his need to twitch or snarl again.  Arion plastered a smile on his face and muttered, \u201cit\u2019s alright, folks.  I\u2019m a spirit hunter.

            "I relate. Just write. Get those characters moving. Sometimes it will surprise you to see that is indeed enough for a short novel, and other times it will take you to new paths, subplots that will show up as you go. Naturally, it depends on what story you are writting. Solutions will not take the same form in a spy thriller than in a historical novel set up in ancient Rome. Think also on what commentary the novel can carry. A detective novel is not just about the case, for example, but the whole world around it, a social commentary on the circumstances, the street, a political sideplot. A historical novel is not just about characters in the middle ages moving thorugh the specific plot, but about representing more accuratelly that period. Show that world. As usual, the root advice here is to read. Check books on the genere you are tackling, grab a couple of novels (good or decent ones, to be on the safe side) and read them trough and trough and isolate the main plot with those things that are not, the side plotd or mere background, and you will get a clearer vision on how to bring your novel into a more complete form.",

            "I think everyone will say the same thing and tell you to write anyway. I am someone who plans minimally and writes on the fly. If I had a bare bones structure I would start writing and tell myself I couldn\u2019t put in plot point x until I had written a certain number of words. Essentially space out your current ideas with new material in the spaces between the sketchy outline. I would bet you would need to close only two gaps this way before things fell into place. If it really speaks to you, give it a try.",

But there is also this terrible fear of waking up from this dream and being told we really suck and have no talent.\n\nYou don't have this fear?\n\nOkay so maybe it's just me then.\n\nI'm so afraid that it prevent me from writing. I have intrusive image of me one day posting my writing in a sub here or a forum online, asking to receive constructive criticism, and then receiving nothing, then again asking for it and coming back to it a few days later to find one comment after another of people saying really hurtful things about me lacking talent and having no business writing.\n\nI guess I won't know until I do submit my work, but I wonder how other writers (or other artists in general) do it. How do they face and even welcome criticism? I've read that even great writers sometimes received really harsh criticism and some only became famous and appreciated for for their work years after their death. Such a sad thing that it can even happen to the best of writers. What chance do the rest of us have?\n\nThere is nothing you can do to prevent that kind of crushing reaction for certain. You could work on the same draft for weeks and months and years, and still have people saying it sucks. I feel writing takes a kind of courage that people don't always talk about. It's a tough business.\n\nBy the way, I've seen people give really hurtful criticism and drawing all kinds of conclusions about an author whose work they did not like, so I'm not just imagining a worst-case scenario.",

            "Go to goodreads and look up 1 star reviews of your favorite books. There are people over there taking a massive dump on anything from Pride and Prejudice to The Lord of The Rings. Absolute classics, definitely very good books, and yet they have some terrible reviews.\n\n\nYour writing will never please everyone and that's a good thing. If 80% of people don't like your stories, but the other 20% are hardcore fans, who cares?\n\n\nWrite for yourself. No one is looking over your shoulder. You don't have to share your stories, if you don't want to.\u00a0\n\n\nThere's also the writer's curse. Something you really like today can look like shite two weeks later. That's good, because it means you've grown as a writer. You start noticing more and more flaws, which you can then edit, until you like it again.\n\n\nEvery writer in history has produced bad, clunky sentences and sometimes whole books that just didn't work out at all. It's the same in other fields, too. Look at the Beatles. They have some amazing songs and some that make me go \"what the hell were they thinking?\".\n\n\nIt's necessary. You will never write only good things. Not every sentence will be good, not every story will be good, but some of it definitely will. That \"some\" will grow. Instead of 1 out of 10 sentences being good, now it will be 3. Soon it will be 4 or 6 and before you know it, bad sentences will be the exception.\u00a0\n\n\nAgain, no one is watching you. Just write. Accept that you WILL write some bad stuff, maybe a lot of it in the beginning, but you will also get better at it. What others might say about your work doesn't matter. You're not a pro yet, you're still learning.\n\n\nJudging by your post, you are definitely able to express yourself clearly. That's a big step towards being a decent writer, in my opinion.",

That's not on me, that's them.\n\n\nI've worked retail, service industry, and as a freelancer on projects big and small. I have seen folks complain about the stupidest stuff and have learned its often really more reflective of who they are as a person than the thing they are complaining about.
