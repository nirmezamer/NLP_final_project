            "I am looking for writing software not geared to novelists as there are many different types of books, including nonfiction books, manuals, textbooks, and of course novels. I am writing a dungeon and dragons monster book coming with at least 200 unique monsters, statblocks and origins. There are tools geared towards writing one single statblock but i am not aiming for one single statblock and also do not have the ability to change the color scheme instead opting to make it look as official as possible. I want to set myself apart by having something with a unique color scheme for the statblocks so i don't interfere with Dnd Brand identity and open myself up to lawsuits. \n\nAre there any websites or programs not geared towards novel writing or at least adaptable for non novel writing",

            "\n\nI read it! The synopsis spoke to me. Overall a good story and Im engaged to know more. Bernice is a great character. Keep going!\n\n. But. when you are done your first draft you are going to want to do some heavy editing. Here are some preliminary thoughts I had while reading:\n\nTheres a lot of information about the MC in the beginning that should be revealed slowly as the story goes on (info dump).\n\nDid MC have to stay longer in the hospital to be in the study, thus driving her hospital bills up? Why would she do that? (*Note Im not American but this just struck me as odd*)\n\nBernices hair is not eternally blonde at 70 - its dyed blonde\n\nBrackets in dialog?\n\nMabel shook her head and shrugged her shoulders. That or they just lump me in with every other caretaker. I dont mean to leave so quick Bernice, but I have to go so that I can be prepared for tomorrow. Thank you though.  not a big fan of our MC blowing off the person whos trying to help her here",
            "Title: Soulbound\n\nGenre: Epic Fantasy\n\nWord count: 529 (First page)\n\nFeedback request: I'd like to know how engaging this opening page is. I'd also like to hear impressions of the characters and world.\n\nAs the storm-tossed sky loomed above, the gate of Duradan stood defiantly against tempestuous winds. Its twin towers, ancient sentinels of stone weathered by centuries, bore banners that snapped like writhing beasts. The silver star on a field of green whipped alongside the city standard, a white tower on blue. Misty rain blew in sideways, finding every gap in Caelans wool coat.\n\nThe bustling crowd surged toward the city in a chaotic tide of bodies. Wagons creaked and groaned, their wheels churning through the mud. Mounted men and women trudged alongside, their steeds plodding wearily.\n\nAmidst the throng, a man on horseback flung a curse at Caelan as he brushed past, but the words were lost in the cacophony. Caelan stared eagerly at the gate, a grin on his angular face. A city, he whispered. He turned to see Gothras normally curly black hair plastered flat against his face, water beading down his round cheeks. Were actually here! he shouted to his friend.\n\nYou think theres gonna be anyone jugglin fire in all this? Gothra asked, his voice half lost in the crowd.\n\nCaelans laughter bubbled up despite the elements. No, he replied, but the taverns hearth will be crowded, I bet. And dont forget about the ale, theres no Mrs. Warben to lecture us here.\n\nI wont complain about a mug of ale, or two. Gothra grinned.\n\nFifth bell tolled, the aged belfry straining to be heard over the howling wind. The tempest above responded with a booming crack of thunder, tearing the sky with lightning. Conversation would have to wait.\n\nA scowling guardsman studied Caelan as they approached but waved them through no less. As they passed under the ancient stone archway, the earth trembled. Stoneworks groaned stubbornly as the ground shook. The belfry spat granite chips onto the crowd. Caelan held his breath.\n\nPandemonium erupted in moments. Women and children screamed. Caelan heard siege as often as he did earthquake. Those who fled one way were met by a dozen others going the opposite direction. Quickly people were being trampled, pushed down relentlessly as they struggled to get back to their feet. They looked like fish in a barrel.\n\nCaelan grabbed Gothra by the cuff and pulled him to the edge of the crowd before they too could be trapped in the chaos. The earth steadied beneath them, but the thundering of a thousand footsteps and the shrill cries of panic echoed through the city, joining the storm.\n\nWhos that? Gothra yelled, pointing deeper into the throng.\n\nCaelan height let his eyes pass unobstructed over the crowd, settling on a tall figure in a colourful patchwork cloak. A man by his height, he was plucking some sort of instrument, strolling through the crowd.\n\nA minstrel, or maybe a bard, Caelan said, leaning down to speak into Gothras ear, but there was no need.\n\nAn expectant hush fell over the crowd, broken only by a single, soothing sounda warm, ethereal tone that gently drifted across the square. Overhead, the storm held its breath, waiting.\n\nRight, lets go see, then. Wonder if he knows Bardens Cloak, or Daisy for a Maiden. Gothra said, pulling Caelan toward the crowd.",

I know the scene has its issues for sure (still in the editing process), but I'd nonetheless love to get some external eyes on it. While any and all feedback is super appreciated, my primary concerns are\n\n1. Sensitivity--Sera (the narrator) isn't particularly emotionally intelligent, which we see in the conversation, but I don't want her to come off as homophobic at all. I also don't want to be accidentally homophobic with anything, so please call me out if something might be problematic.\n\n2. Flow of dialogue--is there too much dialogue?

Do you like how its set up now, or would you rather have read the character experiencing it in real time? Also general readability and prose. I hear I have very clunky prose at times.\n\nBlurb: A young woman enters the field of nursing in a position that is given little love: the nurses assistant. The story follows her journey from student to professional and seeks to be a reflection on our views of the elderly, how society has progressed, how our attitudes have changed over time, and their effects through from the perspective the up and coming generation. Also explores abuse of the elderly within the context of the care their receive.\n\n[Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13tSN9ddNntzf9RPUTsw5jZf_cq4yj-Ga4Mhi4e5JAeM/edit)\n\nThank you for taking time to read this!",

I was writing the stories I thought others would enjoy, what I thought would be more marketable. I was letting others opinions, tastes, trends and tropes, trickle from my eyes back into my mind, and tainting the words down to the tips of my fingers, turning my busy fingers idle.

            "100 percent\n\nWhen writing heavy scenes I tend to be incredibly tense, even though I enjoy it. You're crawling into these characters' headspace... If it's draining for them, it'll be draining for you",
            "I do it, the answer is yes. You need to take care of yourself. Touch grass. Remember to distance yourself from your character's emotions.",
            "It just depends on the author. Writing a piece of pure romance would be draining for me. I never write stuff like that, so I would have to focus especially hard on getting it right.",
            "Yes. I cried almost an hour after I wrote how my main character was SA. Still can't reread this",
            "I find it quite entertaining. I don't write my characters as friends or people I know, and I am indifferent to what happens to them to some extent; it is all about where the story goes, and if it goes that way, then so be it. I only find it draining if I am fighting against the logic or flow of the story. The violence or darkness has to mesh with the world I have created, and if it is gratuitous or forced, then I find it tiring.",
            "Yes Ive noticed it, I write like that most days and somedays I am just so spent after it and I wonder if perhaps my depression later on happens because my story triggered it again. Cause some days Im good and than it just comes out of nowhere and on some of those days Ive written  so it makes me wonder honestly. \n\nIve also had moments where I was crying writing out scenes, sometimes so badly I had to stop writing as I couldnt see anything anyways."
