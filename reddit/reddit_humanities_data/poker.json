            "Watched the rise and fall of a man\u2019s ego on Saturday.\n\nGuy sits down with 300. Stacks a guy who 3bet jammed the turn with the nut straight. He snapped and hit his flush on the river. He makes a smart ass comment and they both argue until the dealer tells him to calm down.\n\nHe\u2019s the BMOC and runs hot up to about 1300.\n\nI stack him for about +350 and that\u2019s when he starts tilting, but thankfully not at me.\n\nHe calls an 81 year old man an angler because he raised to 80, but didn\u2019t verbalize until chips were over and said \u201c75\u201d. Dealer made him put the extra 5 back. Young guy says something and the 81 year old say \u201cI\u2019m 81 years old! I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re young, I never lost a match in my life! I was undefeated in (state college!!)\u201d dealer calms everyone down and 81 year old immediately racks up.\n\nYoung guy bluffs his stack down to about 500. He bet about 200 on the river and a guy called. He turns over the 2nd nuts and a old man takes like 1 second to flip over the nuts. Young guy flips out because of a \u201cslow roll\u201d. They argue until the dealer calms down. Old man immediately leaves.\n\nHe loses his stack on some hand I don\u2019t remember and says \u201cNice. A dick, an angler, and a slow roller all in one night. Nice fucking table here\u201d and leaves with nothing.\n\nOn the flip side, I left +150 in 4 hours. Modest but a win.",
            "Played for four hours yesterday at the club. Made $300. Went to the parking lot and car was hit and run. Deductible is $500 so I guess I\u2019m down $200 to start.",
            "Thanks to this poker subreddit i have beasted it up tonight +$800 overall in 1/3. Got alot of good hands, but most notable is stacks effective 600 AhAd in SB , 15 raise and i 3 bet to 65, 2 callers. flop comes Kh Qh 6h , i bet 150, both call. Turn: 7c, checks around, river: 2d, i check to LP who bets 100, i call other fold. LP shows AsKc",
            "Sat down for 1/3 NL at 7pm. Was absolutely stuck for 9 hours. Getting it in good but getting sucked out on seemingly every good hand. Running into AA or KK with QQ. Getting my own Aces cracked twice - even after making a set. Stack dwindled from $500 to about $150 during that time. At one point I triple barreled with AK and this guy calls me off with low pair, no blockers just a lunatic call.. Almost tilted me but I stayed disciplined and held out hope things would swing back my way eventually.   \n  \n4 AM rolls around and I end up chucking my stack in with an open ender in a 3 bet pot (my only move there, or fold). Caught my straight, doubled up and then some. Few hands later took down a $200 pot. 3 or 4 hands later I flop the nut straight and a guy with about $500 raises all in after I raise him on the flop. I covered him at that point. Had 2 more decent size pots in the next 20 mins or so... Walked out at about 5 up about $800 - that was the hardest test of my patience in a long time. What a finish.",
            "Saturday of Memorial Day weekend: down $3,000.  Monday of Memorial Day weekend: up $3,000.  Variance is crazy.  \n\n3-way all in pre-flop.  I have QQ vs JJ and 44.  Flop is KJ4.  Turn is K, river K and I scoop.  $1,600 pot or so.",
            "Visiting my hometown and went to one of the donkaments where I originally learned to play for the first time in several years. Early in the tournament, the blinds are 100/200. I'm in the big blind with JJ. There's an absolute maniac on the button-raising very aggressively with hands like 92dd even when only making middle pair. She'd also shown down 32o for a flopped straight (4-5-6) in a raised pot. She clearly had a reputation with the regulars. Everyone either limps or folds to her. She raises to 3000. Small blind folds and I snap shove looking for an easy double up. She calls out of turn (the cutoff hadn't announced his action yet). She turns up KJo and flops a K to stack me. Not sure I did anything wrong here, but super frustrating to get eliminated early on when I expected to be there for a while. Even more so when I got the money in good. I'll have several opportunities over the next week or so, and I had a top 5 finish just yesterday, but still sucks.",
