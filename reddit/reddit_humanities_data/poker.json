            "Played for four hours yesterday at the club. Made $300. Went to the parking lot and car was hit and run. Deductible is $500 so I guess Im down $200 to start.",
            "Thanks to this poker subreddit i have beasted it up tonight +$800 overall in 1/3. Got alot of good hands, but most notable is stacks effective 600 AhAd in SB , 15 raise and i 3 bet to 65, 2 callers. flop comes Kh Qh 6h , i bet 150, both call. Turn: 7c, checks around, river: 2d, i check to LP who bets 100, i call other fold. LP shows AsKc",
            "Sat down for 1/3 NL at 7pm. Was absolutely stuck for 9 hours. Getting it in good but getting sucked out on seemingly every good hand. Running into AA or KK with QQ. Getting my own Aces cracked twice - even after making a set. Stack dwindled from $500 to about $150 during that time. At one point I triple barreled with AK and this guy calls me off with low pair, no blockers just a lunatic call.. Almost tilted me but I stayed disciplined and held out hope things would swing back my way eventually.   \n  \n4 AM rolls around and I end up chucking my stack in with an open ender in a 3 bet pot (my only move there, or fold). Caught my straight, doubled up and then some. Few hands later took down a $200 pot. 3 or 4 hands later I flop the nut straight and a guy with about $500 raises all in after I raise him on the flop. I covered him at that point. Had 2 more decent size pots in the next 20 mins or so... Walked out at about 5 up about $800 - that was the hardest test of my patience in a long time. What a finish.",
            "Saturday of Memorial Day weekend: down $3,000.  Monday of Memorial Day weekend: up $3,000.  Variance is crazy.  \n\n3-way all in pre-flop.  I have QQ vs JJ and 44.  Flop is KJ4.  Turn is K, river K and I scoop.  $1,600 pot or so.",
            "Visiting my hometown and went to one of the donkaments where I originally learned to play for the first time in several years. Early in the tournament, the blinds are 100/200. I'm in the big blind with JJ. There's an absolute maniac on the button-raising very aggressively with hands like 92dd even when only making middle pair. She'd also shown down 32o for a flopped straight (4-5-6) in a raised pot. She clearly had a reputation with the regulars. Everyone either limps or folds to her. She raises to 3000. Small blind folds and I snap shove looking for an easy double up. She calls out of turn (the cutoff hadn't announced his action yet). She turns up KJo and flops a K to stack me. Not sure I did anything wrong here, but super frustrating to get eliminated early on when I expected to be there for a while. Even more so when I got the money in good. I'll have several opportunities over the next week or so, and I had a top 5 finish just yesterday, but still sucks.",
            "Up 3k in poker. Down 15k gambling.",
            "I met Phil hellmuth last night. He was really nice.",
            "I need three Twitter friends to tag to enter Jamie Golds WSOP giveaway. Anyone wanna help me out?",
            "In just 3 sessions I have ran QQ into KK 7 times, AK into AA 4 times, have my KK/AA cracked 4 times, straight into a rivered boat. Set over set two times, 4x triple barrel all ins on Broadway board called by pocket 7s or under and still only managed to be down 10 buy ins or so. Every time I had a monster I couldn't even get a Cbet called, constantly would run into top of ranges with decent hands. I've clocked about 15k hands in 3 days and it doesn't seem to be stopping anytime soon and I'm starting to feel frustrated.",

            "I think it was Dnegs said it recently most of the pros on there tried to play all fancy and make plays because it was TV and Doyle just played pretty tight and standard and exploited the fuck out of them.  He was just there to make money.",

But really how many hours/hands is this sample? That one pot against Guy Laliberte accounts for half of this graph\n\nI dont mean to diminish any of his achievements because he is a legit OG and is probably in most peoples top 5 favourite players of all time, but him winning over the course of the HSP series means sweet fuck all.",
            "Thats my GOAT right there",
            "That's because he is Doyle Brunson. He's allowed to give the least amount of action and nit it up and not be shamed for it. And will be invited back. \n\nWhereas if a Galfond or something nits up and wins, he's not invited back",

This kind of thing doesn't surprise me. \n\nThe poker world is full of scumbags so if being a bit out of touch and a bumhunter is the worst thing people can say about you, then you're probably still doing alright.",

            ">I know Galfond is one of the least problematic players in the game\n\nLOL Galfond is one of the biggest douches in poker. Tries to act way too nice despite his career literally being bumhunting recs and badregs, writes a hitpiece on Doug Polk pretending not to take sides while comparing him to slavery and the holocaust (I'm not even being hyperbolic, he actually does this in the piece), and gives awful advice to up and coming poker players (probably to delude them into taking his course)."
