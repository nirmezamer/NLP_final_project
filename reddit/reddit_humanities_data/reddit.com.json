            "Here's the judge's decision via Wired: [ACLU v. Dept. of Defense (S.D. N.Y. Oct. 5, 2011)](http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2011/10/cianocontempt.pdf). One particularly intriguing/appalling excerpt regarding the destruction of the tapes:\n\n\n\"The email suggests that the CIA's General Counsel, John Rizzo, had not received advance notice of the videotapes' destruction: \"Rizzo found out today this had occurred as [sic] was upset - apparently because he had not been consulted - not sure if there was another reason. He raised at DO update but was 'calmed' (only slightly) when told [redacted] had approved.\" ld. **The email explains that, later in the day, Jose Rodriguez had approached CIA Director Porter Goss, the email's sender, and someone else whose identity also was redacted, to explain[] that he [Jose] felt it was extremely important to destroy the tapes.\" Id. Rodriguez allegedly said \"that if there was any heat he would take it,\" at which Goss purportedly \"laughed and said that actually, it would be he, [Goss], who would take the heat,\" but Goss said that he \"agreed with the decision\" nonetheless. Id. Rodriguez then allegedly said that \"heat from destroying is nothing compared to what it would be if the tapes ever got into public domain - be said that out of context, they would make us look terrible; it would be 'devastating' to us,\" a sentiment with which \"[a]ll in the room agreed.\"** Id\"",

            "well if the CIA can deal coke and heroin and kill people at will, who are the courts to say anything?",
            "Here's a [less crazy source](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/10/cia-dodges-contempt/). It would seem that producing the tapes is moot since the CIA admitted that they were videos of waterboarding.",
            "Obviously the videos were so horrific that the CIA decided it would be better to take the hit for destroying the evidence rather than let people actually see what was recorded.\n\n... and they got away with it.\n\nI've seen the future and that's why my wife and I skipped having kids.",
            "Government is a sham....we are being ruled by a plutocracy....",
            "It's like reddit commentators live in another world. One in which cliche and absolutism are apparently common place.",
            "The CIA hasn't been a part of the US government for a good while now.  Sure, there's a tiny little fraction of the organization that still has government oversight, but MOST of the organization is an international crime syndicate which uses the grey areas of international law to murder and steal.  We found this out when Oliver North was put on trial and his superiors testified in Congress in the 80s.  It's on YouTube, you can watch the dudes lay it all out.  They maintain their own army, navy, and air force.  They deal drugs and arms to raise money for their operations.  And it is entirely a 'black' organization, with absolutely no legal oversight whatsoever.\n\nThe worst thing about it is that the US government is too afraid to come out and excommunicate the CIA, shut down the tiny piece still attached to the government, and help hunt down and kill all of the CIA agents around the world breaking international law on a daily basis.  Most of what they do is secret, but we know enough to make one thing conclusively clear - they are the single most widespread and active enemy of democracy on the planet.  They rigged the elections in Afghanistan so poorly that the whole thing had to be thrown out, just so they could get Karzai in there so they could manipulate him through his brother, and retain control over the opium trade.  They rigged elections in Iraq.  They rigged elections in Haiti.  They kill candidates they don't think will serve US interests.  Killing everyone so that every nation in the world ends up with a pro-US leader is NOT democracy.  It is the most cynical rejection of democracy.  It is saying 'we know democracy can never work.  We know democracy is a joke.  The only way to get ahead is stomping on babies and robbing the innocent.\n\nThe real sick part is that most of the public inherently agrees.  They think the idea of a government controlled by the general public is patently insane.  They think everyone is so stupid that it would be guaranteed to collapse into utter chaos, and thinking it could work is a ridiculously naive pipe dream.  They think it's all a nice illusion that is only maintained by men in the shadows \"making the hard choices\" and feeding puppies into paper shredders to make the illusion of civility possible.  These are some of the most dangerous views in the world today.\n\nOh, and the CIA admitted a few years ago that all of Vietnam was their fault.  They wanted America to go to war in Vietnam, so they made up the Gulf of Tonkin incident, lied about it to the world, and tricked the politicians into going to war.  This is supposed to be a fucking intelligence agency, providing information to politicians.  Instead, they manipulate politicians like some kind of psychotic James Bond villains.",
            "Serious question: How would one hold a government agency in contempt?  What would the consequences be?",

            "Why does that thing even exist? It seems very pointless to me.",
            "In grade school, we had these two ornate free standing drinking fountains on the playground, about 10 feet apart. I think it was kind of a showcase feature at the time the school was built. \n\nAt recess, a couple groups of kids would build \"volcanoes\" in the silty sand on the playground. They'd heap up the dirt, and meanwhile, a chain of kids would go to the fountains, take a mouthful of water, and then run over to the \"volcano\" and spit/dribble the water on it, while the other kids -- always just two -- built up the mountain on moistened dirt. \n\nThis would continue, and the industry of it all is an impressive memory in my mind. It was a constant line of water-spitters, racing back and forth from the volcano to the drinking fountains. \n\nAfter the thing got yay high, they'd start concentrating on the peak, forming a crater, while the two builders would start tunneling at the base, toward the center. \n\nEventually, their hands would meet, and the crater would reach the tunnel. \n\nAt that point, they would shake hands in a solemn ceremony, followed by much cheering and back slapping on the part of the water-spitters. The feeling of accomplishment was intense. \n\nAfter that, all the water-spitters got to take their turn reaching in and shaking hands with one another. \n\nThere was no class distinction between the builders and the water-spitters. Nobody was better than anyone else. The ones who were the builders were just the ones who got a good start, attracting the most water-spitters. \n\nAt the beginning of recess, maybe half a dozen volcanoes were started, and it was up to the water-spitters to choose whichever ones to add their efforts to. After a few minutes, a \"shakeout\" whittled the number of volcanoes down to two, as the builders who were unsuccessful at attracting water-spitters gave up and became water-spitters themselves. \n\nWhen the bell rang, we kicked and destroyed the volcanoes. By next recess, the dirt was dry enough to begin. \n\n",

I remember drinking the fucking water straight from the basin several times in this public park where homeless people frequented. Makes me gag just thinking about it. \n\nAlternatively, I have a fairly strong immune system to this day. I think of it along the lines of George Carlin's \"Never got Polio as a kid\" sketch.",
