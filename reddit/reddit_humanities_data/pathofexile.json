            "to save you another 130 divines - use Hinekora's lock beasts to craft eldritch implicits before crafting the item (on a blue item)",
            "You do know that eldritch implicits with orb of conflicts always have a higher chance of upgrading the lower tier modifier right? And the further apart the tiers are the more like it is to upgrade the lower one. so you always alternate between spamming the exceptionals of the opposite color and conflicts. Like sure it can happen to be this unlucky just wanted to make sure you knew. Personally never spend over like 20-25 div on getting the perfect implicit on many many crafts, but i did fail 21 fracturing orbs in a row the other day so i know rng can be bitch.",
            "Good idea, however that would have stopped me from using eldritch annul for this specific build since I wanted eater perfect.",
            "I crafted this to use with Formless Flame as a \"discount\" double overcapped setup.\n\nStep 1: Graveyard crafted fractured overcapped cold resistance, Grasping mail, -3 explicit, 100% chance to fracture, +2000-3000% defense chance. Took about 10 tries costing around 20 divine but the \"failures\" sold for around 80 divine.\n\nStep 2: 30% quality with Perfect fossil.\n\nStep 3: Spam Deafening Essence of Hatred (any +resist would work, since you fix with harvest afterwards), trying to a 2nd T1 resist, holy shit also hit T1 Supress. Not what I originally planned for but I'll take it! Took around 500 essences.\n\nStep 4: Prefix filled aswell so added searing dominance to clear prefix with eldritch annul.\n\nStep 5: Used Cold to Fire resist and Lightning to Cold resist harvest crafts to get 48 on both resists (cheaper than divine spamming since I alreayd had max on suppress).\n\nStep 6: Add Suffix can't be changed with Wild bristle matron and reforge defense until I hit T1 %defense, would have prefered flat ES but this was best result after about 15 reforge and I was happy enough to stop there.\n\nStep 7: Tailoring orb for resist magnitures, would have prefered 12% + 100% requirements, but hit this after 8 orbs and settled there.\n\nStep 8: Crafted Phys taken as.\n\nStep 9: Used 130 divines trying to get perfect implicits and failed.\n\nStep 10: 6 link and use blanching for 4 white (making an easy swap between Smite and Molten Strike as needed).",
            "i mean, i guess if you're *really* trying to maximize grace it's better to max eater, but in general it's better to max the exarch mod when you're going double aura implicits. Especially since you're probably using determination too.\n\nIf the eventual goal is T4 of one and T6 of the other, maxing eater results in grace effect being only 2% higher than the maxing exarch, while maxing exarch results in every other aura you're running being 4% higher than it would be maxing eater.\n\nOr if you keep it cheaper and go T3 of one T6 for the other the difference is 3% higher for grace vs 6% higher for all others.",
