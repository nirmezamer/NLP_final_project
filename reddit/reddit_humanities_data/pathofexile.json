            "Got my first level 100 and did 38/40 challenges with this build. All of the t17 maps I did were mirrored so I just ran them as they were and only failed 2. I made the character for vaal temple farming, so it can run all mods. That being said, Death's Oath is still in a terrible spot right now and it took 400-500 divs to get it to this point. All of the rare gear was self crafted except for jewels.\n\nPros: 35k armor, 25k evasion, 100% suppress, ailment curse crit immune, pop chaining via occultist + herald of ash, 0 button build\n\nCons: Extremely squishy to DoTs, super difficult to scale, 5m dps\n\nOn The Adorned: I refuse because I'm lazy and it feels boring.\n\nPOB: [https://pobb.in/J-r5OUmV\\_vQO](https://pobb.in/J-r5OUmV_vQO)",

However I believe there is a point to be made to drop grace, pick up either purity of elements or haste, drop the jade (and bismuth if you pick up purity of elements). Pick up a basalt (and a sulphur if dropping bismuth).\n\nAlso you can slap in one of those perandus jewels for another big chaos dam increase.",

            "That's a nice catch lmao. I wonder if it was one that I alt spammed or bought without double checking.\nWith regards to dropping all evasion, it is possible, but I felt like most of my deaths were to one shots anyways (max phys hit is only like 25k). I know basalt would help that a bit but with phys hits that big I feel like avoiding or convert is way better than some more armor. I also wouldn't be able to swap out for vaal haste for speed on easy maps. I already swap out jade for onslaught for the same purpose.\nI did have a perandus jewel, but I ended up switching in the massive thread of hope there to squeeze in the auras. I could put it where my watchers eye is and remove one of the rare jewels though.",
            "I definitely got the heist challenge out of the way quickly with it. The downside is that you won't have the regen to tank lasers or mines. Righteous fire probably does a similar job but with more tankiness and for a heck of a lot cheaper!"
