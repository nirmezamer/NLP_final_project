You pick two characters, present your case why they win against your opponent's team, and a panel of judges determine who made the most persuasive argument to crown the victor. [See the hypepost here for more information.](https://redd.it/1daeesp)\n\n---\n#Signups:\n\nTo 'sign up', one need merely comment below with a team of fictional (or real, hell who knows!) characters that fit the guidelines stipulated hereafter.\n\nAll characters submitted must have a linked \"Respect Thread\" including all the scans/feats you intend to use in the debate. The [Respectthreads](https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/wiki/index) forum has a large pre-existing list of these, but you may draw from any comprehensive equivalent or create one yourself. Vs Battles Wiki pages are not permissible substitutes.\n\nIf you intend to use scaling to other characters, you ought to also link the threads for them.\n\n**Characters submitted who are found to have misleading RTs that leave out too much without disclosing may be disqualified.**\n\nSimilarly, introducing too many new transformative feats not present in your linked signup will also be penalised. It's okay if you go and grab new supplemental stuff for ability interactions, etc. mid-tourney, but you shouldn't be presenting brand new feats that radically alter perception of your character's strength.\n\nNote: the death of the hosting website Gfycat has taken some popular RTs offline. I have personally backed up many of them and am in the process of reuploading them to alternate hosts. If there's a broken thread you'd like to use, just ask. Failing that, try the links in wayback machine.\n\n##Formatting:\n\n***AN IMPORTANT NOTE***\n\nTo sign-up, I will be requiring people submit their characters in the following format:\n\nCharacter | Series | Tier | Match-Up | Stipulations\n---|---|---|---|---\nCharacter | Series | Tier | Match Up | Stips\nCharacter | Series | Tier | Match Up | Stips\n\nFor non-RES users (cringe!) out there, this is the formatting:\n\n>Character | Tier | Series | Match-Up | Stipulations  \n\\---|---|---|---|---  \n|||||  \n|||||  \n\nSimply copy-paste the formatting above and submit your entrants in this format so I can save myself several hours of formatting everybody's stuff uniformly.\n\n##Tier:\n\nThe **Tier** category delineates whether the character is being submitted to [Cable or Deadpool tier.](https://redd.it/1bzkuxk) **You must submit one and only one character to each tier.**\n\n* Cable is a brawler armed with a rapid fire, long ranged heavy weapon that tears apart his enemies' bodies. He supplements his ability to provide fire support, [telekinetic ballistic shields](https://imgur.com/35wELW3) as cover, and intuitive telepathic tracking of his opponents.\n\n* Deadpool is an agile assassin who fights with unpredictable acrobatics wielding a blade that can [cleave through moderate amounts of metal.](https://imgur.com/oHIbjJl) He has a potent healing factor which allows him to fight recklessly through injuries, and [a long ranged teleporter that lets him scout the battlefield and freely reposition with his ally.](https://imgur.com/a/xG1wLab)\n\nThis tier is designed for characters who can [react to bullet](https://imgur.com/a/M94bZZ0) to [arrow-speed projectiles](https://imgur.com/a/mG363OE), bust [sizable holes through concrete with exertion](https://imgur.com/a/dJFMGFW), and endure similar impacts.\n\nMore than that, this tier is designed for teams that synergize well together in creative, effective, and unpredictable ways.\n\nThe two tiers are deliberately asymmetrical, with Deadpool as the more dangerous and mobile melee combatant while Cable is slower and less durable, but offers ranged support and telepathic tracking to enhance Deadpool's effectiveness. This dynamic should be reflective in team composition, with mixed support and offence taken into account.\n\n##Matchups:\n\nThe **Match-Up** category is where you delineate whether the character scores a Likely Victory, Unlikely Victory, or Draw in a fight against the chosen tiersetter.\n\n *  **Unlikely victory** means your character is definitely outgunned but can absolutely set up a victory through superior skill, tactics, or a hidden manoeuvre that is draining. Bullseye versus Daredevil is an unlikely victory for Bullseye, and Kanoh Agito vs Kuroki Gensai would be an unlikely victory for Kanoh that relies on the Dragonshot landing.\n\n *  **Draw** is self explanatory, 50/50. Captain America versus Batman with no gadgets, or Luffy versus Rob Lucci are good examples.\n\n *  **Likely victory** means your character is superior in most if not all aspects and can readily use those to win after a slightly extended fight. Superman versus Hal Jordan in-character is a likely victory for Supes, as would be Kenpachi Zaraki versus Ichigo Kurosaki in their first meeting after Ichigo learns to cut Kenpachi.\n\n**In addition to declaring your characters\u2019 matchup vs the tiersetter, you will also need to briefly justify it in a few sentences.**\n\nFor example, a justification of a Draw for Captain America in Batman Tier could be \u201cBatman is slightly weaker in physical categories, but a more agile and technical fighter. Captain America is slightly stronger, more durable, and has a powerful defensive tool with the shield, but Batman can get around it using his speed and skill.\u201d\n\n**For this tournament you must not only provide a justification of your individual characters vs tiersetters in a 1v1, but a justification of your team against both tiersetters in a 2v2 match.**\n\nEx: \"My team of Captain America and Batman are a 50/50 **Draw** vs Cable and Deadpool, as both are comparable in strength, durability, and speed to the tiersetters. Cap's shield counters the tiersetters' guns, but is countered by Deadpool's teleportation. Batman's stealth lets him outmanoeuvre both the enemy team, but is countered by Cable's telepathy.\"\n\nFor the purposes of a default tiersetter match, assume the arena is [Waterton Lakes.](https://www.reddit.com/user/Proletlariet/comments/1bzkuxk/teleasshole_wip/l6nrq41/) Tiersetters start at Spawn A.\n\n**HOWEVER, note that OOT judgements will be determined on a case by case basis for the arena of the current match taking place.**\n\nDon\u2019t think you can get away with arguing your Avatar Earthbender insta wins by causing a mass cave in on Metro just because the default match is an open air forest.\n\n##Stipulations:\n\nThe **Stipulations** category is for minor alterations to your character. This could include changes to their gear, powers, mindset, scaling, or sources used. The following are examples of reasonable stips:\n\n* The T-800, wielding a minigun.\n\n* Mace Windu, cannot use force-crush on opponents.\n\n* X-23, brainwashed and bloodlusted by Trigger 42.\n\n* Post-Crisis Batman, only feats from Year One.\n\nCertain conditional stipulations are also permissible to allow a character's environmentally limited abilities to function:\n\n* Firelord Ozai, Sozin's Comet is in the sky\n\nStipulations **CAN NOT** alter a characters\u2019 stats directly (IE \u201cNerf strength to tier\u201d) or change them or their loadout in ways that is not reflective of them in their source media (no giving Batman a lightsaber, no arbitrary 'Morals Off' stips without canonical basis).\n\nComposites are an allowable stip on a case by case basis. As a general rule of thumb, the most kosher composites will be versions of a character with the fewest debate-relevant contradictions to account for. IE: Compositing Anime & Manga versions of Goku is perfectly fine because they are essentially the same character, but compositing Paper Mario & Platformer Mario is not---the question of what a hybrid paper/meat body would be like is too messy.\n\n##DUPLICATE BAN:\n\nNo duplicates of the same character may be run. The exact definition of a duplicate may have to be determined on a case by case basis, but suffice to say any small alterations or simply different arcs for characters is not acceptable. You can run \"Savage Hulk\" and \"Grey Hulk\", or \"Post Crisis Superman\" and \"Pre-Crisis Superman,\" but not Saiyan Saga Goku and Namek Goku, or MCU Thanos from Endgame and MCU Thanos from Infinity War.\n\nThe person who made the feat thread for the character gets first dibs on claiming them **for the first 5 days** of signups.\n\n##OC BAN:\n\n***NO OC CHARACTERS CAN BE RAN BY THE PERSON WHO CREATED THEM! YOU MUST RUN CHARACTERS WHOSE CANON PORTRAYAL YOU YOURSELF CANNOT INFLUENCE DIRECTLY.***\n\n##SPECIAL RULE: Primary Combatants\n\nCombatants with summons, multiple bodies, mounts, riders, pets, etc. must have **one individual identified as the Primary Combatant in their signup post.** If the Primary Combatant is defeated, all entities submitted under the same slot vanish.\n\n##SPECIAL RULE: No Backups\n\n**THERE ARE** ***NO*** **BACKUP CHARACTERS FOR THIS TOURNEY. IF YOU GET OOT\u2019D, TOO BAD.**\n\n##Example Characters:\n\n[Here are some example picks for the tier, including links to repositories of their feats.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ReDKxmZoA9AkDEocT0B9aAipjpYCJXo2ntBz2N-rnBo/edit?usp=sharing) \n\n#Rules:\n\n##Battle Rules:\n\n* Speed is not to be equalised in any respect for this tournament. A character's provable speed feats are what they will be entered and argued as.\n\n* Combatants spawn in aware that there are two opponents somewhere in the arena that they and their ally must defeat in order to progress.\n\n* All combatants are aware of the basics of their allies' combat abilities and may choose to communicate them in greater detail during the match, but are in the blind to that of their opponents (unless they have canon knowledge of them).\n\n* Combatants with minions, multiple bodies, mounts, riders, pets, etc. must have **one individual identified as the Primary Combatant in their signup post.** If the Primary Combatant is defeated, all entities submitted under the same slot vanish.\n\n* Victory is by either permanent death or incapacitation. Incapacitation is defined by an inability to continue fighting, whether unconscious, bound, immobilised, or too injured/exhausted to fight back. This condition must last for more than 12 full seconds without conscious maintenance from an opponent (so maintaining a wrestling hold for 12 seconds would not count as incap if the opponent could keep fighting if let go.) Voluntarily going to sleep doesn't count as an incap assuming a match is argued to last long enough for sleep to be necessary. Incapacitated opponents vanish from the arena. Corpses do not. **Combatants are aware of rules around victory conditions.**\n\n##General Map Rules:\n\n**Map Selection:**\n\nDefault round maps will be on a random elimination rotation, meaning Round 1\u2019s map will be randomly selected between all seven, Round 2 will be rolled from the remaining six, and so on.\n\n**Map Vetoes:**\n\nAlternatively, instead of debating on the default map for the round, if both opponents agree, they may instead veto one map each and roll from the remaining options.\n\nVetoes may ONLY occur if both opponents agree to them.\n\n**Gentlemanning:**\n\nBoth opponents may unanimously agree to pick a specific map to debate on.\n\n#Veto or Gentleman map switches must be agreed upon and announced to judges prior to the debate's first posted response.\n\n**Map Features:**\n\n* Each team is given two physical maps of the current battlefield. The maps indicate a team\u2019s own spawn location and include a compass along with instructions on how to use it. All text appears to the reader to be written in whatever their first language is a la Doctor Who \"Psychic Paper.\" Characters who cannot read, perceive, or understand the map (illiterate, blind, nonsentient, etc.) are instead implanted with a rough directional memory of where major landmarks are in relation to each other.\n\n* All maps are devoid of human beings but still populated by their usual wildlife unless otherwise specified.\n\n* As a general rule of thumb, maps include all objects you might reasonably expect to find in a given location. IE; in a [Vice City gun store](https://i.imgur.com/SrdwYMF.png) there are firearms and boxes of ammunition.\n\n* The exception to this are operational ground vehicles (cars, bikes, motorcycles, trains), all of which are absent. Non-functional vehicles such as [broken down trains](https://imgur.com/a/fwzqLkc) or [wrecked cars](https://i.imgur.com/R5ymzwt.png) are still present.\n\n* All sunlight present on the map will not inhibit vampires or other characters with an inherent weakness to the sun. It is as warm and bright as normal sunlight.\n\n* Whowouldwinium is a immovable, indestructible material that otherwise functions as the equivalent of whatever material it is replacing (EX concrete & steel lining in Metro tunnels). Abilities like ATLA Earthbending cannot reshape whowouldwinnium, but can generate [projectiles or protrusions from them as normal.](https://i.imgur.com/nOohUo7.mp4) Intangible/teleporting characters may pass through whowouldwinnium barriers **by themselves** (without passengers, willing or unwilling), but will be automatically disqualified by BFR if they do not return to the normally accessible part of the arena within 12 seconds.\n\n* All combatants are aware of the above conditions, as well as all map-specific information outlined below **EXCEPT FOR** the spawn locations of their opponents.\n\n##Map Specific Rules:\n\n* [Vice City, Florida](https://www.reddit.com/user/Proletlariet/comments/1bzkuxk/teleasshole_wip/l6nritq/)\n\n* [Waterton Lakes National Park](https://www.reddit.com/user/Proletlariet/comments/1bzkuxk/teleasshole_wip/l6nrq41/) \n\n* [Moscow Metro, Circa 2033](https://www.reddit.com/user/Proletlariet/comments/1bzkuxk/teleasshole_wip/l6nrqun/)\n\n* [Mal\u00e9, Maldives](https://www.reddit.com/user/Proletlariet/comments/1bzkuxk/teleasshole_wip/l6k1oqk/)\n\n* [Pearl Skyscraper, Hong Kong](https://www.reddit.com/user/Proletlariet/comments/1bzkuxk/teleasshole_wip/l6npdfy/)\n\n* [Isla Nublar, Costa Rica](https://www.reddit.com/user/Proletlariet/comments/1bzkuxk/teleasshole_wip/l6npdyk/)\n\n* [Mystery Flesh Pit National Park](https://www.reddit.com/user/Proletlariet/comments/1bzkuxk/teleasshole_wip/l6eaw24/)\n\n##Debate Rules:\n\n* Rounds will last roughly 5 and a half days, hopefully from Monday until Saturday at noon of each week of the tourney; there is a 48 hour time limit both on starting (we do not care who starts, you and your opponent can figure that out) AND on responses, ***AND ADDITIONALLY*** each user MUST get in two responses or else be disqualified. If one user waits until the very last minute to force this rule to DQ their opponent without any forewarning to their opponents or the tournament supervisors, they will be removed from this tournament, no exceptions. If you need an extension, notify judges ahead of time.\n\n* Format for each round: the one to go first gets an Intro + 1st Response, their opponent replies in kind, then both get a 2nd response, then a 3rd response in a back-and-forth style, and a closing statement individual of one another that can be posted any time after both 3rd responses are complete. Each reponse has a 20k character limit, or two maximum length Reddit comments.\n\n * Intro posts cannot make any arguments comparing the poster\u2019s team with the opponents\u2019 characters. They are for outlining your characters\u2019 feats, fighting styles, and tactics.\n\n * Closing statements cannot make any new arguments or bring up any feats or details not already mentioned in the debate. They are for summarising your points in the debate.\n\n* A character can be disqualified mid tourney if the opposing debater calls for an Out Of Tier (OOT) request.\n\n * OOT requests works by pinging the head judge (me) and explaining why the character has been **argued** as Out Of Tier by the opponent---meaning their odds against the tiersetter with presented interpretations of their feats are greater than a Likely Victory and it unreasonable to expect the TS to be able to score a win.\n\n * Each participant gets 2 OOT requests for the whole tournament. An OOT request is lost if they make a request and it fails to go through.\n\n* OOTs may be made against an individual character (EX: declaring that the Incredible Hulk is Out Of Tier in a 1v1 tiersetter fight against Cable) or against an entire team (EX: declaring that the combination of two characters\u2019 abilities is too broken for the TS duo to combat, even if they are individually beatable.)\n\n* **All rounds for this tournament will be 2v2 team fights.**\n\nVictory in a debate will be determined by a majority vote of at least 2 out of 3 judges, though more may be brought in to decide a particularly contentious match.\n\nYour Judges Are:\n\n* /u/nkonrad\n\n* /u/joseph_stalin_\n\n* /u/British_Tea_Company\n\n* dargoo_faust\n * [SB](https://forums.spacebattles.com/members/dargoo-faust.406822/)\n * [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/u/dargoo_faust)\n\n* Qawsedf234\n * [SB](https://forums.spacebattles.com/members/qawsedf234.410176/) \n * [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/u/qawsedf234) \n\n* AbeLincoln1865\n * [SB](https://forums.spacebattles.com/members/abelincoln1865.514007/)\n * [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Analypiss)\n\n* [Guderian2nd](https://forums.spacebattles.com/members/guderian2nd.116487/) \n\n* And myself\n\n---\n\n#~~SIGNUPS END MONDAY JUNE 24.
