Did the flood command one of the crashed pelicans?\n\nSaying the marines just failed to defend it and surmising the story of Halo 2 isn't really a useful answer.

And it being experimental makes sense, it may not necessarily see action. What I don't like is the lack of any information on the base ship, we don't even have a name. In the context of the universe this really adds nothing, we know that maybe there was a cargo ship between the heron and albatross but we don't know what it was called, what it did, and really we don't know if it saw any use.\n\n\nAs for the infinity, it pulled an enormous amount of the UNSC navy and ONI budget. Cutting a single experimental ship seems minor, and it probably was, but it would just be the tip of the iceberg. There are countless projects well never hear about that we're abandoned for the infinity.\u00a0",

            "Most of NOBLE Team besides Jorge are Spartan-IIIs, created by Colonel Ackerson. The Spartan-IIIs were divided into three companies; Alpha, Beta, and Gamma, with letters designating their assigned company coming before their service number.\n\nMost of NOBLE Team are apart of a secret subdivision in the Spartan-III program called \"CAT-2\" (Category 2). Spartans-IIIs classified into CAT-2 were deemed too important or \"useful\" to be sent on the suicide missions Spartan-IIIs were usually sent on, and so they were pulled out of the companies and given different, typically top-secret assignments.",

            "As others have mentioned, most of Noble Team were Spartan IIIs \n\nWhile the Spartan II program only yielded a single graduating class before the onset of the Covenant War - and wouldn't be greenlit for continued production due to economic and logistical concerns related to that war, as well as various political and legal/ethical concerns - the (much cheaper) Spartan III program yielded *three*; designated Alpha Company, Beta Company, and Gamma Company.\n\nThe Spartan IIIs were created to be expendable super-soldiers, and most of Alpha and Beta Companies were KIA on their very first missions; deployed en-masse to take out high-value Covenant targets.\n\nCertain specialists and otherwise-distinguished operators were excluded from the bulk-suicide runs, however. Many if not most of these exceptions were used for deployed alone or in pairs as \"Headhunters\" to sew chaos behind enemy lines, but others - like Noble Team - were strapped into MJOLNIR and moved up to the front lines for regular combat duty; shoring up numbers as the very-limited supply of Spartan IIs began to dwindle.",
            "They're not Spartan II dude.",
            "So, there may be other comments that explaining this. But I like to talk bout halo so I\u2019m just gonna do a whole bit explanation right now.\n\nThere were the Spartan IIs chosen by Halsey which initially was made up of 150; except the funding for the Spartan project got reduced and so the candidates had to be cut in half - so now it\u2019s down to 75. These 75 are abducted and replaced by flash clones which die of \u2018natural causes\u2019 shortly after being replaced; thereafter the 75 are put under training (at age of 6) and are assigned their designations (John-117 for example - 117 because that was the 117th candidate inspected by Halsey). All of these had to pass rigorous screening to prove they were genetically in the top 1% of humanity.\n\nSometimes these designations don\u2019t include the name and instead begin with S otherwise stated as Sierra (whole phonetic military thing - you know like assigning an easily recognisable word to each letter so that letters don\u2019t get confused over radio communications) and therefore is sometimes S-117 (or Sierra 117)\n\nUnfortunately only 34 survived augmentations. These are the Spartan IIs and they fight in the entirety of the Human Covenant War.\n\nThe Spartan IIIs however (everyone in Noble Team except Jorge) are \u2018recruited\u2019 (read kidnapped at ages from 4 to 6, they have a slightly relaxed genetic screening - still likely in the top 10% or whatever but not as strict as needing to be top 1%) from orphanages after the Covenant murder their families and glass their home planets. These Spartans are split into 3 companies - Alpha, Beta and Gamma, each company having at least 300 Spartans post augmentations (which are identical to Spartan II augmentations except chemical rather than the incredibly invasive and dangerous surgical ones of the IIs, the sole exception is the IIs are given a thyroid implant which kick start their puberty early and causes them to be taller and larger than the average human - resulting in Chief being 6\u201910\u201d out of armour and 7\u2019 in armour). \n\nTherefore the Spartan IIIs have designations like Noble six of B-312 - Beta company Spartan and the 312th Spartan to be \u2018recruited\u2019 (read kidnapped because their average age was between 4 and 6, except Carter he was somehow 10) post augmentations the mean age of all three companies is 12 and they are assigned SPI (Semi-Powered infiltration) armour - better than ODST armour but worse than Mjolnir, plus no energy shielding at all - and are sent on high profile missions, undergoing a few before their suicide mission. After Alpha companies suicide mission (all 300 dead) Beta company is undergoing training. After Beta\u2019s suicide mission (operation TORPEDO) Gamma company is undergoing training. \n\nThere are however standout Spartans from these companies - the ones who are pulled out straight after augmentations for Headhunter work (teams of 2 dropped deep behind enemy lines to assassinate and destroy high profile targets) and then there are the CAT 2 Spartan IIIs - these are your noble team members like Kat and Thom (who was Noble Six before Six - B312 - joined Noble team at the start of Reach). \n\nThe Headhunters sometimes get Mjolnir armour (best armour available) and sometimes gets SPI armour (greater stealth but less durability and no strength+speed enhancement compared to Mjolnir\u2019s 2x strength and speed, for mark 5 (Reach and CE armour) Mark 6 is 5x (armour Chief gets at start of Halo 2)\n\nIt is not confirmed but speculated that Noble Six (B-312 that is) was a headhunter before joining Noble team.\n\nGamma company isn\u2019t seen in any games but is featured in halo book ghost of Onyx and they have the majority of their company still alive (unless killed off screen) but haven\u2019t been seen canonically since the end of Onyx, which is closing months of the War.\n\nSo Yh, the reason for different designations is due to different class of Spartan (the IIs either have no letter before the numbers or they have an S, standing for Spartan, and the IIIs have their company letter A,B, or G before their letters). \n\nSorry this was a bit long winded - I love talking bout lore, any more questions and I am happy to answer. \ud83d\udc4d",
            "As others have pointed out, the majority of NOBLE Team (save for Jorge), are Spartan IIIs pulled from their respective S-III companies after training\n\nAssuming that the number ID is reused between companies, it's likely they added the letters for the S-IIIs to help distinguish individual S-III operators from their respective companies. Example, Spartan 259 could refer to Carter from Alpha or a completely different S-III from Beta or Gamma Company. Adding the alphabet prefix before the number ID helps to provide a distinguishing factor, so anyone who needed to do a search can be sure to find the right Spartan as long as they know the company and Spartan ID number\n\nThis arrangement really only makes sense for the S-IIIs. The S-IIs were smaller in number and only had one completed batch, meaning that every number ID issued to them would belong to the same group. S-IVs ditched the number IDs completely and go by either 'Spartan' or rank, followed by surname. They might remember their training company/batch number, but it would kind of be something talked about over casual conversation rather than a formal identifier",
            "They\u2019re the different Spartan companies as others have said. With the Spartan 2s there\u2019s only the one being S tag which is Sierra, which is why Chief is sometimes called S-117 and Jorge is S-052. Then there\u2019s 3 Spartan 3 training companies being A (Alpha), B (Beta) and G (Gamma)"

I'm not sure when the prologue of Halo 4 is, the whole Covenant cruiser above a city with elites slaughtering civilians while Spartan's jump down to protect them as another instance.

Even putting aside the UNSC's comparatively limited authority during the early days of the Insurrection, most of the things the Insurrectionists were revolting over had nothing to do with ONI. As far as we've been shown, the first major black mark on ONI's reputation is the Spartan Program.\n\nIn general, ONI's immorality is somewhat exaggerated compared to actual intelligence organizations. For as much as people like to compare them to the CIA, the actual CIA is much worse. \n\n> \"look at these super soldiers defending humanity! Don't worry about why they existed or what they did beforehand.\" \n\nI mean the Spartans were given a cover backstory, that was the whole inciting incident for Hunt the Truth.

        "content": "Hear me out, what do I mean by this? I think that the next game should be where the story of Master Chief ends. As a character, he isn't as popular as he once was, kinda like a washed-up old man and that stigma will stick around in the minds of many for as long as he is remembered. 343 can remake his character all they want, but it wouldn't help.\n\nSo how could the Halo universe move on? Here are my raised fist, shouts at nothing ramblings.\n\nFirst, I'm not saying we should erase 20+ years of history and forget about everything. I would be very angry if that happens, I wouldn't know what to do with my collection of every Halo games and books.\n\nFor the overall lore, I think there should be a timeskip, decades or centuries into the future. A way for the universe to get a fresh start while also recognizing the existence of past works. A real reboot, not those half-assed ones where they left behind more questions than answers.\n\nI think the Arbiter's proposal of the Concert of Worlds should happen, but also come to include Humanity and maybe all former Covenant species are given a chance to join. It is a military alliance, this will give everyone time to rebuild from the wars and lessen conflict with each other.\n\nI also think that the Forerunners and all the tech they left behind should be nerfed hard. Maybe in order to prevent misuse of such technologies, say that someone put out a protocol where every Forerunner installation has orders to hide as best they can, even to Reclaimers. If discovered, they'll either fight off any invaders or self destruct everything. They'll still be around, with many artifacts left behind, but they wouldn't be a huge focus.\n\nWhy am I saying this? I think it's time to put the military in military science fiction in Halo again. The Forerunners must have reseeded many more species around the galaxy and it is a BIG galaxy. Some of them could have started their own interstellar Empires with their own objectives and reason for war.\n\nThis provides huge benefits to world building meaning more space to create stories and characters. \n\nThere's opportunity to fill in gap between the end of the Master Chief's story and a new Halo game. Plenty of lore to be written about Humanity, the former Covenant species, and new alien empires. New factions and their goals to talk about. Bring back space battles. From periods of war and peace to a revolving door of new friends and new foes. More freedom to create new things to kill things with. Maybe even extragalactic invaders. Huge potential for the franchise.\n\nThe name Halo should also still make sense. Whether it has something to do with the remaining Halo Rings or that someone created something very important in the shape of a Halo. The Halos have always been MacGuffins anyway.\n\nI guess the TLDR would be: End the Master Chief's story, do a long timeskip in the lore, and that there could be a galaxy full of potential enemies to fight.\n\nThoughts?",

So far the entire storyline of halo starting from the first game to infinite has been I think less than 10 years of time.  I know there is tons of lore that takes place hundreds of thousands of years in the past and the war with the covenant has been going on for over 25 years but in terms of the storyline involving master chief I think it\u2019s been over the course of less than 10 years starting from the event of Halo one.  \n\nI don\u2019t want master chief to have a finite story because he\u2019s one of those video game characters that deserves to have many many entries and just keep on going like doom or Metroid or Zelda or Mario , but I just don\u2019t know how you actually make that work without having to had to play the previous games to be caught up on what\u2019s going.
