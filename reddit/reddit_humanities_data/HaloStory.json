            "For the same reason that despite having the industrial capacity to produce thousands of capital-class ships and having a spread out and diverse industrial base, Covenant-era ships larger than a Spirit are seemingly at a premium. If we accept that the Covenant armadas were so thoroughly destroyed in the Great Schism, then we must also accept that the Covenant's devastation of the Inner and Outer Colonies (alongside with running the existing UNSC fleet) would force the UNSC/ONI to choose whether or not to dedicate most of their surviving resources to one project or produce more smaller ships.",
            "Probably all resources were directed to the Infinity.",
            "The more i think this over since i read it this morning, the infinity is a death star, not because its effective, or because its weak but because its a giant fucking boondoggle. and amalgamation of new tech and heavy engineering originally intended to serve as an ark (ONI's ark so im SURE that lottery system is full of upstanding and morally rigid citizens /s) when instead mass producing a shitload of small ships and scattering them and turning them into a flotilla would have had more escape and force utility than one super expensive mega ship. \n\nIf an entire destroyer or frigate can be purchased for the price of one MJONIR then how fucking expensive was the ship that just make more of that super expensive armor on the fly.

The Spartan-IIIs were divided into three companies; Alpha, Beta, and Gamma, with letters designating their assigned company coming before their service number.\n\nMost of NOBLE Team are apart of a secret subdivision in the Spartan-III program called \"CAT-2\" (Category 2). Spartans-IIIs classified into CAT-2 were deemed too important or \"useful\" to be sent on the suicide missions Spartan-IIIs were usually sent on, and so they were pulled out of the companies and given different, typically top-secret assignments.",

            "The Spartans went public in 2547 although the UNSC had begun disseminating information about them as early as 2531. In practice, the Spartans were an open secret, with Spartans being deployed to civilian evacuation operations as early as 2531. \n\nAs far as the actual public pr campaign goes, presumably it was just a matter of morale not being so low as to warrant it until 2547. The Spartans were a booster shot to the UNSC's morale, prior to 2547, it's likely it just wasn't necessary.",
            "The whole child abductions and switcheroos with slowly disintegrating clones was seen as a teeny bit problematic",

Yeah the insurrectionists were bad but at their core they had legitimate points of contention with UEG, and ONI was objectively evil.\n\nIt was a miracle of a PR move for the UNSC, \"look at these super soldiers defending humanity! Don't worry about why they existed or what they did beforehand.\"",
            "Spartans weren't supposed to be revealed at all. All the officers in the white room said it was a bad idea, especially if they found out that Spartans, who are supposed to be invincible super soldiers, die all the time. I can't exactly remember why, but the reveal of the Spartans only happened because the UNSC suffered a massive loss and they believed revealing these super soldiers that don't die would be the only thing that would boost morale.",
            "See that will always be interesting to me how ONI and the UNSC kept the Spartan's so black towards the public, when the Covenant knew about them so well. Especially considering we do see Red Team help evacuations on Cadia, and i'm sure there's many other instances of Spartan's clearly in public. I'm not sure when the prologue of Halo 4 is, the whole Covenant cruiser above a city with elites slaughtering civilians while Spartan's jump down to protect them as another instance. I understand originally that they were extremely black ops because they were created to stop insurrectionists so that would be a huge negative public image thing.",

The UNSC/humanity had no interstellar communications except via physical ships. It\u2019s not like Ukraine today where we can get footage of a battle in under 2/3 hours via go pros and etc. pretty well all anyone would have to go on were rumours from people who were there.",

        "content": "Hear me out, what do I mean by this? I think that the next game should be where the story of Master Chief ends. As a character, he isn't as popular as he once was, kinda like a washed-up old man and that stigma will stick around in the minds of many for as long as he is remembered. 343 can remake his character all they want, but it wouldn't help.\n\nSo how could the Halo universe move on? Here are my raised fist, shouts at nothing ramblings.\n\nFirst, I'm not saying we should erase 20+ years of history and forget about everything. I would be very angry if that happens, I wouldn't know what to do with my collection of every Halo games and books.\n\nFor the overall lore, I think there should be a timeskip, decades or centuries into the future. A way for the universe to get a fresh start while also recognizing the existence of past works. A real reboot, not those half-assed ones where they left behind more questions than answers.\n\nI think the Arbiter's proposal of the Concert of Worlds should happen, but also come to include Humanity and maybe all former Covenant species are given a chance to join. It is a military alliance, this will give everyone time to rebuild from the wars and lessen conflict with each other.\n\nI also think that the Forerunners and all the tech they left behind should be nerfed hard. Maybe in order to prevent misuse of such technologies, say that someone put out a protocol where every Forerunner installation has orders to hide as best they can, even to Reclaimers. If discovered, they'll either fight off any invaders or self destruct everything. They'll still be around, with many artifacts left behind, but they wouldn't be a huge focus.\n\nWhy am I saying this? I think it's time to put the military in military science fiction in Halo again. The Forerunners must have reseeded many more species around the galaxy and it is a BIG galaxy. Some of them could have started their own interstellar Empires with their own objectives and reason for war.\n\nThis provides huge benefits to world building meaning more space to create stories and characters. \n\nThere's opportunity to fill in gap between the end of the Master Chief's story and a new Halo game. Plenty of lore to be written about Humanity, the former Covenant species, and new alien empires. New factions and their goals to talk about. Bring back space battles. From periods of war and peace to a revolving door of new friends and new foes. More freedom to create new things to kill things with. Maybe even extragalactic invaders. Huge potential for the franchise.\n\nThe name Halo should also still make sense. Whether it has something to do with the remaining Halo Rings or that someone created something very important in the shape of a Halo. The Halos have always been MacGuffins anyway.\n\nI guess the TLDR would be: End the Master Chief's story, do a long timeskip in the lore, and that there could be a galaxy full of potential enemies to fight.\n\nThoughts?",

            "As previously suggested, we need more spin-offs that explore the game from the perspectives of different characters to address unresolved questions from the main storyline. The latest Halo book, \"Epitaph,\" which concluded Didact's story, was excellent and would have made a great game adaptation. While Chief can remain the main star of the series, it's crucial to develop other significant characters who have received little attention to accommodate Chief's heroics.\n\nIn my opinion, that's what is slowly killing the game.",

            "It should move on, but not by doing a timeskip or going back to before the HCW, it should just stop altogether. No franchise can be milked forever without it turning into something it was never supposed to be, though 343\u00a0has been trying to take Halo down that path for a good while now. The series just needs to end"
