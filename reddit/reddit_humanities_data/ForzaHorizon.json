            "this week championship, the dodging demons are crazy hard, S1 900 is too fast for those tracks, took me 3 tries with a friend clearing this, definitely not fun since all my attention are glued to the track and one mishap will cost you dearly..",

            "Hello, just got the game from the sale. I feel like I'm overlooking or misunderstanding something. I'm working my way through the playlist but for the Bugatti event it wants me to spend 2 mil on a car just to participate. That seems completely absurd.",

            "I didn't realise they've still been running series for FH4. Great news about making all previously exclusive cars forever available."

Shout out to Gamepass for making it all possible. I do miss FH4s map, Mexico in FH5 is played out. I've had enough of this map at this point, I'm ready for FH6, I was really hoping they'd announce the new Horizon at their games event this year.",
