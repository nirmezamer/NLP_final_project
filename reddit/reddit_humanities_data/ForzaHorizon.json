            "Super cool that they're giving Gamepass players (who bought a DLC) a [free code](https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-4-delisting) for the standard version. They also did this for FM7 as well back in the day.",

            "I work in video game licensing so always find the comments interesting on this. Alot of people seem to think publishers dictate the terms of licensing agreements. It\u2019s the other way around. Brands are often represented by third party agencies and have licensing revenue targets to hit and will be firm with their term lengths. \n\nI think as consumers we need to put more pressure on brands to stop limited time licenses in video games as it\u2019s creating lost media. \n\nThis digital age means that brands have the power to require publishers to maintain contracts or delist/patch out content on expiration.",

            "personally i loved the fh4 game and map as a whole as someone in the uk it helped kinda fill the dream of seeing what it would be like driving a car id never own around somewhere thats my home",
            "This is definitely a hot take, but I loved FH4\u2019s map. Sure, it wasn\u2019t the most biodiverse, but it sure as hell made up for it with all the small towns, the highway, Edinburgh, and the complex rail network! Only other map that is on par with it is Horizon 2.",
            "People just can\u2019t decide wether they love or hate the game. It will always be my favorite because I played it all the way through covid and became very attached to it considering the lego and fortune island dlcs.",
            "Agreed.",
            "i hate the servers but its an impressive map design\n\nThe loading times is what hurts FH4",

            "I\u2019ve only played 4 and 5 and this one is definitely my favourite out of the two. The map design is beautiful. Way prettier than Mexico in my opinion. The roads are great too and it just looks more colourful than FH5.",
            "I really liked FH4 but for me personally, seasons killed it. \n\nAnytime it was winter, I could tolerate it for a day or so, then not want to play the game until it was over.\n\nIf they added an ability to play offline, and change seasons to whatever you wanted, I would love it.\n\nAs it stands right now though, FH 2 is still my favorite in the series.",

            "I liked the FH4 way more than the FH5 personally. I just much preferred the geography and beauty of the castles to Mexico. Mexico was perfect for off-roading, but for pure racing, England is better."
