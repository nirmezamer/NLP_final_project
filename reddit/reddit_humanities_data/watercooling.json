        "content": "Sup folks. So, finding compatible blocks has always been a royal pain, especially for newbies. Lots of different manufacturers, many of whom are unfamiliar to folks who aren't already watercooling and they don't all make blocks for every GPU model. \n\nFear not. iln (one of the Discord mod crew) has been working tirelessly to put together [this new tool](https://watercooled.net/finder/) to help you find what you're looking for and assemble a loop list. You can even import your list from PCPartPicker.",

            "As someone who\u2019s been planning their first loop this is so amazing.  Just being able to check all retailers for stock and prices is a god send because I really don\u2019t know all the websites (although I\u2019ve learned a few so far)",
            "Wow, I just took a quick look and it looks nice! It even finds aquacomputer's gigant and Watercool's Mora3! Now it comes the tricky part - force people to use it ;) And since some still will not google I'm not sure about this project but good luck, it is very nice!",
            "Wow. This is amazing! Kudos to whoever built and populated this site!",
            "Awesome, that's certainly handy. It does get confusing with brands like Galax and KFA2 being the same but only offered in certain regions of the world.\n\nA small note, some of the Inno3D 4090s aren't compatible with the Alphacool ES waterblock. There was a revision on some of the later serial numbers.",
            "I don't see anything related RTX 3090 series on the new tool.",
            "Hi, just a heads-up, the website links an EKWB waterblock for the Gigabyte Aero 4080 SUPER GPU however on the EKWB website they don\u2019t list this GPU as compatible. The block referenced seems to only be compatible with the non-SUPER 4080.",
            "Got anything for a power color radeon 6900 xt?",
            "Please add just the RTX 3090.  This is \\*the\\* most popular card for AI, for example see LocalLlama subreddit.  Understand that all last gen cards would be too much to ask, but aftermarket 3090's are the go to card because of 24Gb VRam and cost.",

        "content": "Dear fellow watercoolers, air whirlers, enthusiasts, casuals, all of the above or neither, it's been a while since we've seen a real event on /r/watercooling but this is now about to change. Corsair has approached us and asked if we are interested in a build-off. They are willing to give away a Corsair upgrade kit to 3 participants, who will then turn that Kit into their Corsair Build-Off Entry. The /r/watercooling and /r/corsair communities will then vote on who did best and determine the winner.\n\n**The Upgrade Kit:**\n\n* Corsair 6500d or Corsair 6500x Case\n* full iCue LINK Fan Set\n* full Hydro X Watercooling Set\n\n\n**Sounds like it's right up your alley? Great! Here are the rules:**\n\n* To be eligible for selection you need to have a completed build posted on either /r/watercooling or on /r/corsair dated before this post has gone up.\n* The competition, as well as the final community voting is open to anyone over the age of 18, or with written guardian approval. \n* To enter you must be located in a country CORSAIR ships to - [list of countries CORSAIR ships to] (https://help.corsair.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036286771-Customer-Service-What-addresses-can-Corsair-ship-to)\n\n\nTo enter, simply sign up via [this signup sheet](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/b35ffb4bf04e4a9d86fcdd6b08287e32) with a link to your post, what you are planning to do with the upgrade kit and what parts you would need. Signup will close on Friday 22nd March 9PM GMT.\n\nThe participants will be selected by the Mods of /r/Watercooling and a Corsair representative.\n\n**What you need to do:**\n\n\n* The Build-Off will give you 4 weeks of time from the arrival of your Upgrade Kit. (So, if shipping takes a bit longer do not fret.)\n* You'll be expected to post at least 1 update post on /r/watercooling and /r/corsair every week (crossposting is allowed)\n* Your final post after the 4 weeks is done is what will be put up to the community to vote for. Make sure to put your best effort forward in your final post!\n\nFurthermore everyone is invited to join the [/r/watercooling Discord server]( https://discord.gg/watercooling). If you are an active contestant, you can post your build progress in a dedicated contest channel or socialize and chat with others if you are just following along the build-off.\n\n**Final voting and giveaway:**\n\nOnce the final posts have been put up, we will put a thread up for the community to vote on their favorite build. Anyone who votes will enter the raffle to win a [Hydro X Series iCUE LINK XH405i RGB Custom Cooling Kit](https://www.corsair.com/p/custom-liquid-cooling/CX-9070016-WW/hydro-x-series-icue-link-xh405i-rgb-custom-cooling-kit-stealth-gray-cx-9070016-ww) in their choice of color.\nThe contestant who receives the most votes will be featured on Corsairs social media and internet presence.\n\n**FAQ:**\n\n**Q:** When does signup close?\n**A:** 22nd March 9PM GMT\n\n**Q:** Can I enter if I am under the age of 18?\n**A:** Yes, with signed approval from your parent/guardian\n\n**Q:** Am I limited to a specific type/number of fans/watercooling parts?\n**A:** No, we will ship you what you need to complete your proposed build\n\n**Q:** Will I have to return the parts after the competition?\n**A:** No, all three contestants will get to keep the parts, even if they do not win the final voting\n\n**Q:** Can I use another case than the 6500 and still enter?\n**A:** No, you will have to use a variation of the 6500 series\n\n**Q:** Can I order the case with one of the accessory panel kits, or vertical GPU mount kits?\n**A:** Yes\n\n**Q:** Can I mix parts from Corsair with existing water cooling parts in my current build?\n**A:** No, all fans and watercooling components should be Corsair parts. Distro plates can be exempt from this rule.\n\n**Q:** I am not sure if Corsair makes a water block for my graphics card\n**A:** Please use the [GPU compatibility](https://www.corsair.com/custom-cooling-configurator/gpu-search) check to see if there is a block available for your card.\n\n Best of luck from the Modteam to all of you and get building!\n\n -/r/watercooling mod-team",

You know how it goes. :P\n\nWithout further ado, here are the chosen participants!\n\n/u/Potential-Grass6308\n\n/u/HoodRat79\n\n/u/AMP_US\n\nCongratulations to you!

            "Intel cooled looks to either have corroded or eaten the insides of the tubing. I would personally not use either of these, especially the one with torn screws.",
            "Good luck. If you work out what your materials are, you can work out what sort of coolant will work. The pump may struggle to pump compared to before, if you give it something more viscous, but the pwm should compensate. \n\nI\u2019m also trying to repair a aio at the moment. Nightmare - broken spool wires!",
            "The oily liquid is in most cases a special liquid to prevent galvanic corrosion between the aluminum radiator and the cooper plate. Those liquids have a lifetime greater than the warranty, but will fail and in your case get brown from the corrosion.\n\nI would not use it, even after changing the liquid, as those small AIOs will lose in comparison to good air coolers."

On my last prep I decided to go clear since the prep was too time consuming since I\u2019m a family man. Since my system was down I decided to use mayhems blitz part 1 and 2 to finally clean out my radiators after using vue. These are the results. I think personally for a 9$ bottle system reboot does it\u2019s job pretty good. Obviously the acid from mayhems is completely better but you can definitely get away with just using system reboot.",
