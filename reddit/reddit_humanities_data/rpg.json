I have no money for minis, let alone maps or anything. But I'd love to find some decent Mecha RPGs. I've tried to look some up on DriveThruRPG, but aside from Mekton, I'm not sure which of the ones there are any good since the previews never give me that much detail to work with. So I have no idea which ones are decent in terms of rules and which are so complicated they might make Mekton stare at them sideways.\n\n  \nAlso on the subject, did they stop selling the BESM d20 version? I honestly was under the impression that might have been my best shot at making some Mecha stuff for my players if it came down to it since they already know how to deal with a D20 based game system.

            "I've only had experience with Lancer, but I liked it. It has a lot of customizability to affect your playstyle.\n\nIts one quirk (feature?) is that they have a companion website (compcon.app) - I think the website is a great way of keeping the volume of data organized and it even gives you an interactive and dynamic character sheet to use during combat, but I personally prefer to play TTRPGs analogue if possible. It's a little difficult when everyone around the table has their laptops in front of them.",

        "content": "When I was little, one of the first book series I read was \"Ranger's Apprentice\", and although I've still not finished reading all the books, the archetype of the Ranger lives rent free in my head, also thanks to Lord of the Rings and its Rangers after I saw the movies a few years later. And although quite different, the Monster Hunter videogames also brought to me a similar vibe to the Ranger that I can't really explain.\n\nWhen I discovered that D&D had Rangers as a core class, I jumped right into the book to look at its abilities and felt... unfulfilled. I can't put my finger into why is that, but different from other classes like Paladins, Bararians and Sorcerers, I wasn't getting what I desire in a Ranger, even if later on after learning more of the rules I found they can kinda do what I want.\n\nThen today when WotC revealed the changes they made on the Ranger for the PHB 2024, I just felt sad, but also started thinking that maybe its not only the Class itself, but the fact that travel isn't that fun in D&D and travel & exploration is a big part of the Ranger fantasy.\n\n  \nWhen I look to fulfill an itch for the Ranger, I mainly look to be:\n\n* A **Wanderer** of the world\n* A **Guardian** of civilization from outside threats (be it beastial, monstrous, magical or humanoid)\n* A **Scout** and **Spy**\n* An **Inquisitive Mind** to information that can get him the upper hand\n* A **Survivalist**, capable of being resourceful with anything, anywhere\n* A **Living Shadow** with a presence invisible or terrifying to the normal person\n* Someone **good with animals**, be it as trusty mounts, combat buddies or assistants of all sorts\n* A **Hunter** of beasts and monsters, with knowledge of all its weaknesses\n* **OPTIONAL:** A Capable Spellcaster, but only because I like magic, but it isn't necessary to me in a Ranger",

It\u2019s a heavily text based simple rpg where you take on the role of a Roadwarden, a person who braves the wild and dangerous roads of a monster-ridden world to act as a lifeline between isolated communities and villages, putting down threats like beasts and undead, learning the ways of the wilds and how to survive them better. Very down to earth classic old school worldbuilding and simple systems that function very well together. It\u2019s also currently on sale for like 5 bucks if that sways you.",

How much do I have to follow the procedures?\n\nIf all I have to worry about is running the world and adjudicating actions that we have questions about in the fiction, with very little, if any, reference to a rulebook or a cheat sheet, then it's a rules-light game by my definition.",
            "I don't think there is a common consensus as much as it's a matter of \"I know it when I see it\". Obviously you'll have games like Lasers and Feelings or Knave that can't really be described as anything *but* rules-lite, but past that it gets murky. Personally I find OSE/ D&D B/X to be rules light, but I don't know if anyone else would.\n\nEdit: To address the last bit of your post, *no.* Game speed isn't super important to me, because I generally enjoy interacting with the mechanical system aspects of a game even if it takes an extra minute or two. What I do have limited patience for is players who take forever to decide on what they wanna do because they're unwilling to accept even a tiny bit of risk.",
