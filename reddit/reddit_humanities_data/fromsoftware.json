        "content": "Hey all, just a brief post about how spoilers will be handled concerning Shadow of the Erdtree.\n\nFor the first month of the DLC's release, in other words, until July 21st 2024, any information about bosses, areas, quests, characters, story, secrets, etc... that have not been shown in official trailers will be considered spoilers.\n\n**Concerning posts :**\n\nPosts about spoilers must be appropriately spoiler tagged. Under no circumstance may you put spoilers in the title of your post.\n\nExample : \"That \\[insert boss name\\] fight was amazing\" is not a suitable title, even if spoiler tagged. \n\nHowever, something like \"That final boss was amazing\", with a spoiler tag, is fine.\n\n**Concerning comments :**\n\nIf a post has been spoiler tagged, then you may discuss spoilers freely in the comments of that post without using spoiler tags.\n\nHowever, comments on posts unrelated to the DLC must be spoiler tagged if they contain DLC spoilers.\n\nFor example, if there is a post about people's favorite boss music, and you wish to mention a boss from the DLC, please spoiler tag your comment. \n\nOf course, if the post itself is a spoiler tagged post about DLC music specifically, then within that post, your comments do not require spoiler tags.\n\nThese rules are being enforced in order to ensure that everyone can enjoy the DLC to the fullest. I know 30 days may seem long, but given the apparent scale of this DLC, we want to make sure as many people as possible can enjoy it while still using the subreddit.\n\nIf the DLC turns out to be considerably shorter than expected, then the 30 day period may be reduced. But expect it to be at least 2 weeks in any case. Thank you all for your understanding!",

            "Sekiro is peak boss design; however, it has an incredible advantage over all the others in the form of having one weapon (outside of the prosthetics) because every fight can be tailored to a far more limited moveset. Every fight feels like an engagement and every victory feels earned versus just seeking that relief when it's over. \n\nThe fights that are low in Sekiro are quite low - Folding Screen Monkeys, Demon of Hatred, Headless (x5), the Bulls - but when they are at their highs - Genichiro, True Corrupted Monk, Owl & Owl Father, Emma, Isshin & the Sword Saint - it's so good I crave it between frustration in other games.",
            "Elden Ring has the most great bosses. But it's got one of the worst ratios. \n\nBest consistently good bosses would be either DS3 or Sekiro",

            "Best in any game i played. Even the gimmick bosses are not bad. And also it has the best final bosses for base and the 2 dlcs.",
            "Yes. Elden Ring has great bosses but so many bad ones",
            "I\u2019m not really sure what \u201cfairness\u201d has to do with any of this. Like comments saying that ER was in development for 5 years longer, or ER learned from DS3, Bloodborne, etc. I don\u2019t really think that has anything to do with the question. Is the boss roster for ER better? I think the answer is obviously yes, especially with Shadow of the Erdtree. And you could make the argument that it SHOULD be, given the size, development time, lessons learned, etc. But the \u201cfairness\u201d thing just doesn\u2019t make sense to me, especially if we are not going to say that DS3 isn\u2019t fair because it was made after lessons learned from Ds 1 and 2 and Bloodborne, and it\u2019s also not fair to DS 2 because it was directed by Miyazaki and DS2 wasn\u2019t. There are over 200 bosses in Elden Ring now, with..what, 25 remembrance bosses, with none of the DLC bosses having achievements, but 30 bosses in the base game having achievements.",
            "No. Sekiro does. Genichiro, Lady Butterfly, Emma & Isshin, Owl, Corrupt Monk, Guardian Ape and Sword Saint are all incredible bosses. It also has the single best gimmick fight in the series with Divine Dragon, the spectacle and music in that fight is unmatched\n\nUnless were counting the bull mini bosses, it only has 1 bad boss too in headless ape"
