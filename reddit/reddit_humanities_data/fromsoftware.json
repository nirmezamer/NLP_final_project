        "content": "Hey all, just a brief post about how spoilers will be handled concerning Shadow of the Erdtree.\n\nFor the first month of the DLC's release, in other words, until July 21st 2024, any information about bosses, areas, quests, characters, story, secrets, etc... that have not been shown in official trailers will be considered spoilers.\n\n**Concerning posts :**\n\nPosts about spoilers must be appropriately spoiler tagged. Under no circumstance may you put spoilers in the title of your post.\n\nExample : \"That \\[insert boss name\\] fight was amazing\" is not a suitable title, even if spoiler tagged. \n\nHowever, something like \"That final boss was amazing\", with a spoiler tag, is fine.\n\n**Concerning comments :**\n\nIf a post has been spoiler tagged, then you may discuss spoilers freely in the comments of that post without using spoiler tags.\n\nHowever, comments on posts unrelated to the DLC must be spoiler tagged if they contain DLC spoilers.\n\nFor example, if there is a post about people's favorite boss music, and you wish to mention a boss from the DLC, please spoiler tag your comment. \n\nOf course, if the post itself is a spoiler tagged post about DLC music specifically, then within that post, your comments do not require spoiler tags.\n\nThese rules are being enforced in order to ensure that everyone can enjoy the DLC to the fullest. I know 30 days may seem long, but given the apparent scale of this DLC, we want to make sure as many people as possible can enjoy it while still using the subreddit.\n\nIf the DLC turns out to be considerably shorter than expected, then the 30 day period may be reduced. But expect it to be at least 2 weeks in any case. Thank you all for your understanding!",
