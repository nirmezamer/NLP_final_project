        "content": "This is a generic post, however it relates (in my experience) to supporting security and networking environments.  Some might find this post patronizing but that's not the intention - it's to talk openly about the issue and offer solutions ...\n\nThe single biggest factor (and frustration) for anyone offering support is the quality of a support query. This refers to both end-users and technical folk. No offense to anyone but IT engineers can be particularly bad at this.\n\nTo a degree, you can expect low quality queries from end-users, but it's often the case that IT folk themselves (as comes out in the wash and many posts here) ask low quality questions leading to more generic answers, or a difficulty in narrowing down on solutions.\n\nWe can ask the question why ...\n\n* you're in the heat of the moment, maybe panicked and don't take/have the time to formulate a question properly\n* maybe you genuinely don't know how to ask a question\n* you haven't done your homework in preparing to ask a question\n* you're just lazy and want someone else to do the hard work\n* etc.\n\nI'll add one last/special item to the list:\n\nThere's very few courses IT folk can do on how to support a variety of technical environments that includes both literate and \"non-literate\" users (by non-literate I mean an end-user that is not trained in a specific IT discipline and therefore can't be expected to provide technically-oriented supporting info). I'm talking about the process of supporting an environment, not the technical details themselves. ITIL probably comes closest but how many have completed this?\n\nAnd the % of IT folk who have done some form of customer service or formal operational support training is very low. This has a huge impact on the efficiency of resolving technical queries.\n\nAnyone requesting support needs to remember that the provider can (generally) only support the requester based on what information is given to them. A low quality query will lead to extended resolution times, and sometimes no resolution at all. It's a waste of both the requester's and provider's time, and can lead to frustration on both sides. Note I'm not assigning fault here, it's simply fact.\n\nBoth the asking for and resolving of technical support is an art, and requires a logical state-based step-by-step approach. You need to move from A through to Z otherwise you could miss an important factor relating to the issue. You need to be patient.  You need to be methodical. There's also a component of teasing certain information out of the requester, an option that assists in the troubleshooting process.\n\nNot everyone is made or in a position to provide good quality queries or responses. And sometimes through no fault of their own. So there's also an aspect of patience needed in cases like this.\n\nHow do we resolve this? I don't think there's a one stop methodology that fits everyone, and one that will give you a 100% or even high success rate. But putting some processes in place can improve the situation.\n\n* both sides need to be patient\n* be methodical and don't skip troubleshooting steps\n* taking more time upfront could result in a speedier resolution\n* understand as a requester that the more info you give up front, the easier it is to support your query\n* as a supporter, learn to ask leading questions that give you the info you need\n* make sure you have documentation\n* put in place, and enforce, a technical support policy\n* have change control, ticketing, infra design, etc. in place\n* and so on\n\nThe no. 10 rule of this forum talks specifically to this issue. Yes it's last on the list - maybe it should be higher, although all the others arguably have equal or more importance. But the fact is that a good percentage of questions asked here (and on other forums) are low quality, and this is indicative of the state of support in orgs. Folk post questions here in the same fashion as done internally in their orgs.\n\nIf both sides of the fence make more effort, both camps will benefit.\n\nA ramble ...",

It often happens that CSRs verbal promises to do something, only to never follow through, and then later feign ignorance of even making the assurance. Even for simple callbacks. \n\nThat's where written communication keeps an audit trail. Which, sometimes, is also a corporate requirement.\n\n>Phone calls are always prioritized over ticket entries and emails.\n\nI hope not. Issues should be assigned a priority depending on the criticality, no matter how they are reported, and dealt with according to this assigned priority.",
            "Let me tell you something from experience, the majority of \"IT engineers\" calling on a hotline, are the worst from the OP lists e.g. the ones that are too lazy or under qualified or both and wants someone else to do the hard work (have you heard the term \"do the needful\" ?). Not all, but the majority!  \n  \nThe problem with this calls is, just ask yourself a question: Would a really expert engineer in any field accept a job where he sits there and waits for random phone calls e.g. like call center ? Knowing that the majority of those calls are almost scam and waste of skills and time ? \n\nLet me answer it for you - No! Skilled engineers does not work on a phone hot line. \n\nThe chance to get someone experienced by calling on the phone is slim, and the chance to get someone experienced in the specific topic you have issue with is even smaller.\n\nThe minority of the calls which are really reasonable, for real P1 situations, suffer the most from this, because vendors cannot afford to put enough skilled engineers which would answer the high amount of scam calls and maintain reasonable price for the service at the same time.\n\nOn the other side, if you report your query properly and point to the issue with the corresponding logs and information, the chance to get someone more experienced in that field is much higher.\n\nAlso adjust your expectations according to the SLAs in the contract you have signed, it should also list the specific conditions required for ticket prioritization.",

        "content": "SOLVED - Issue wasn't with Fortigate-VM. Needed to turn on Port Mirroring for the Virtual Switch in Hyper-V. Thanks all for your help.\n\nRecently got 2 Fortigate-VM 7.4 to practice on and wanted to activate HA.  This is the setup prior to enabling HA.\n\nFW-Primary: [192.168.1.39/24](http://192.168.1.39/24)\n\nFW-Secondary: [192.168.1.40/24](http://192.168.1.40/24)\n\nAt this stage, I can access both FW like normal through the browser and SSH. However, once I configure HA and click on Save, as per below config:\n\n**FW-Primary**\n\n    config system ha\n      set group-id 1\n      set group-name \"TEST-CLUSTER\"\n      set mode a-p\n      set password <omited>\n      set hbdev \"port2\" 0\n      set priority 255\n      set monitor \"port1\"\n\n**FW-Secondary**\n\n    config system ha\n      set group-id 1\n      set group-name \"TEST-CLUSTER\"\n      set mode a-p\n      set password <omited>\n      set hbdev \"port2\" 0\n      set priority 129\n      set monitor \"port1\"\n\nI immediately lose access and cannot ping or connect to the FW-Primary anymore. Even after clearing the ARP-Cache on the switch multiple times, I still cannot access the the FW-Primary and it just shows ping unreachable.\n\nIf I console into FW-Primary and ping itself (192.168.1.39) then it succeeds but I cannot ping the gateway.\n\nIf I console into FW-Secondary, I can see it syncing with FW-Primary and the configuration is duplicated over.\n\nOnce I console into FW-Primary and change the HA mode back to standalone, then I regain access. I'm not sure if I'm missing anything and would appreciate some help and guidance.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j70tfsn4sh9d1.png?width=567&format=png&auto=webp&s=b727c40aa3bb66314a94ad7de9984fb67b255d35",

As said you need to make dedicated management interfaces if you want to access the GUI of both at the same time. Once in HA, the firewall with the longest uptime and lowest serial number will become the HA primary. You have also set the secondary with the lower priority number. Meaning it is the preferred device. \n\nOnce done you will only see the primary IP as the IP of the cluster. The second IP is gone. They will fail over and take over the use of that one primary IP. \n\nYou can force failovers by resetting the HA uptime through the cli of the primary firewall at the time. What your finding is normal operation in other words.\n\n\nEdit: deleted link as I posted the wrong one.",

You will only ever see 1 IP after Ha is turned on. The secondary unit mirrors the primary. In active-passive mode one unit is in essentially standby mode. In active active you hand over sessions for processing but still only ever see one unit and again only ever see one IP.",
