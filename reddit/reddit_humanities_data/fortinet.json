        "content": "This is a generic post, however it relates (in my experience) to supporting security and networking environments.  Some might find this post patronizing but that's not the intention - it's to talk openly about the issue and offer solutions ...\n\nThe single biggest factor (and frustration) for anyone offering support is the quality of a support query. This refers to both end-users and technical folk. No offense to anyone but IT engineers can be particularly bad at this.\n\nTo a degree, you can expect low quality queries from end-users, but it's often the case that IT folk themselves (as comes out in the wash and many posts here) ask low quality questions leading to more generic answers, or a difficulty in narrowing down on solutions.\n\nWe can ask the question why ...\n\n* you're in the heat of the moment, maybe panicked and don't take/have the time to formulate a question properly\n* maybe you genuinely don't know how to ask a question\n* you haven't done your homework in preparing to ask a question\n* you're just lazy and want someone else to do the hard work\n* etc.\n\nI'll add one last/special item to the list:\n\nThere's very few courses IT folk can do on how to support a variety of technical environments that includes both literate and \"non-literate\" users (by non-literate I mean an end-user that is not trained in a specific IT discipline and therefore can't be expected to provide technically-oriented supporting info). I'm talking about the process of supporting an environment, not the technical details themselves. ITIL probably comes closest but how many have completed this?\n\nAnd the % of IT folk who have done some form of customer service or formal operational support training is very low. This has a huge impact on the efficiency of resolving technical queries.\n\nAnyone requesting support needs to remember that the provider can (generally) only support the requester based on what information is given to them. A low quality query will lead to extended resolution times, and sometimes no resolution at all. It's a waste of both the requester's and provider's time, and can lead to frustration on both sides. Note I'm not assigning fault here, it's simply fact.\n\nBoth the asking for and resolving of technical support is an art, and requires a logical state-based step-by-step approach. You need to move from A through to Z otherwise you could miss an important factor relating to the issue. You need to be patient.  You need to be methodical. There's also a component of teasing certain information out of the requester, an option that assists in the troubleshooting process.\n\nNot everyone is made or in a position to provide good quality queries or responses. And sometimes through no fault of their own. So there's also an aspect of patience needed in cases like this.\n\nHow do we resolve this? I don't think there's a one stop methodology that fits everyone, and one that will give you a 100% or even high success rate. But putting some processes in place can improve the situation.\n\n* both sides need to be patient\n* be methodical and don't skip troubleshooting steps\n* taking more time upfront could result in a speedier resolution\n* understand as a requester that the more info you give up front, the easier it is to support your query\n* as a supporter, learn to ask leading questions that give you the info you need\n* make sure you have documentation\n* put in place, and enforce, a technical support policy\n* have change control, ticketing, infra design, etc. in place\n* and so on\n\nThe no. 10 rule of this forum talks specifically to this issue. Yes it's last on the list - maybe it should be higher, although all the others arguably have equal or more importance. But the fact is that a good percentage of questions asked here (and on other forums) are low quality, and this is indicative of the state of support in orgs. Folk post questions here in the same fashion as done internally in their orgs.\n\nIf both sides of the fence make more effort, both camps will benefit.\n\nA ramble ...",

Phone calls are always prioritized over ticket entries and emails.\n\nTo the support provider: I cannot overstate the importance of u/rpedrica\u2019s statement on asking leading questions. Ask how it\u2019s supposed to work, ask why they feel it\u2019s not working (even caveat with \u201cI\u2019m not familiar with how you use it, so help me see it from your eyes\u201d), ask if anything has changed, and while this is not your fault, show empathy, I\u2019m not saying apologize, but do acknowledge the frustration, after all you\u2019re their last life line, they would have taken all steps (as few/many as those were) before calling you.",
            "Having read numerous support tickets with only the statement *X doesn't work* I couldn't agree more on this.   \nI tell all customers and partners to be very specific with what the perceived issue is, when did it happen, was something changed before the issue happened, what troubleshooting steps has been taken, etc. The more relevant information you provide, the better the answer from TAC will be. \n\nRespone times is another thing I often see people having opinions about. Mostly it comes down to people not knowing the SLA and the terms in the support contract. Be sure to know what to expect when you register a ticket with a certain priority level.",
            "Thanks for the reply - I agree with you to an extent although I don't think it's that simple. My post assumes a minimum level of capability on the engineer's side. If we don't have that, then yes, it's a crapshoot.",

            ">To the requester: If it\u2019s important, or you\u2019re not getting the response you need in the time you need it, pick up the phone and call.\n\nBad idea. It often happens that CSRs verbal promises to do something, only to never follow through, and then later feign ignorance of even making the assurance. Even for simple callbacks. \n\nThat's where written communication keeps an audit trail. Which, sometimes, is also a corporate requirement.\n\n>Phone calls are always prioritized over ticket entries and emails.\n\nI hope not. Issues should be assigned a priority depending on the criticality, no matter how they are reported, and dealt with according to this assigned priority.",
            "Thanks for the expansion u/ultimattt. It's great to see discussion on this topic.\n\nI'll add another from my side: never make assumptions ... always confirm each piece of information as fact before acting on it (of course if possible, sometimes there is no choice). I've been down the rabbit hole many times before realising that it's the wrong rabbit hole.",
