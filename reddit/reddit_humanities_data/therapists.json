            "I was told yesterday at group supervision by one of my peers that I\u2019m bad for morale.  They were talking about how we need to help and support our boss who was advocating for us, as we are super busy now, and not getting any relief or support from the decision-makers at our company.  I stated I appreciated the boss\u2019s effort but in my experience in this field, decision makers are going to decision make and it\u2019s in our best interest to accept that reality whether we like it or not and not to get caught up in building hope or unreasonable expectations for sweeping change beyond our own attitudes and efforts.  Then I\u2019m told I\u2019m bad for morale.  \n\nThis is just another case in a long line of being on the outside looking in with my coworkers.  They do stuff together, hobnob together, the boss gets insight from everyone else except me, last year my office was posted up in the basement during a demolition and renovation project, my supervisor skipped supervisions with me in favor of other colleagues\u2026 just a long cascade of bullshit where I\u2019ve felt targeted, unheard, misunderstood.  \n\nI can appreciate the fact my boss put an effort in to get us help that was unmet further up the food chain, but that\u2019s what a good boss should do, right?  So forgive me if I\u2019m not singing their praises as loud as others\u2026 it almost feels like a cult.  \n\nI don\u2019t know.

            "Hi everyone! I am so happy I found this post. I apologize for the long post ahead of time. :)\n\nI'm a clinical mental health counselor with master's degree, and currently in my 2nd year of a clinical psych doctoral program specializing in existential humanistic psychology. I also own a private practice with my husband where my specialty is trauma, ptsd/cptsd, and dissociative disorders. To say I am burnt out/overwhelmed is an understatement.\n\nBecause I am a full time doctoral student,  I have a small caseload of 5 clients at my private practice. Because I specialize in dissociation/dissociative disorders and there aren't many therapists in my area that are comfortable working with DDs, the clients I have tend to be much more complex, and less straightforward with treatment. I knew this when I decided to specialize in this population. I absolutely love the work I do. It is one of the most rewarding feelings I  get when I see one of these clients kicking ass and healing. But it takes a *lot* of work, patience, research, and time to ensure I am providing the most up to date guidance to the best of my ability. I have an amazing supervisor who also specializes in DDs, so I feel very supported in that area.\n\nAs a doctoral student, it took a couple semesters to figure out the amount of hours I could do without having a mental breakdown. My first two semesters were difficult, but was doable and never led to burnout. This past spring semester was my breaking point however. I took 4 classes while seeing my clients...And I did it successfully...but by February I was so burnout that I was scaring myself with how apathetic I was becoming. I still managed to get all As in the classes, while also making significant progress with some of my clients. But I was a zombie. When I did find myself having free time, I was dissociating & mindlessly scrolling TikTok. By April, I was finally coming out of my burnout and starting to feel human again.\n\nAnd while the burn out is mostly gone, it is still lingering which keeps me on edge. Which leads me to what was calling me to share my story.\n\nThe most surprising thing coming out of my doctoral journey is that.I discovered I *love* research. Working with my DD clients has taught me so much, one being the prevalence of DDs being misdiagnosed for years. And I am slowly coming to the realization that once I graduate with my phd and become licensed, I think I want to focus more on researching DDs to maybe help create a change in the field on a macro level. I love working with my clients, but there is something about me realizing that I don't want a huge caseload of clients...The more I think about the research ideas I have and get more into my dissertation, the more I find myself thinking \"I don't even want to have clients once I am out of school.\" And I feel guilty for having that realization. I want to contribute to our field in a different way than I originally thought and it has thrown me for a loop. \n\nAnyways- if you made it this far, thanks for sticking around and listening to my rambling. Growing in your career can be hard. Blah.",

Sorry in advance for the long, vent-y post. \n\nI was working at an inpatient facility from Sept-March and then had sudden onset of a chronic illness (still trying to get an actual diagnosis, we love spread out doctor\u2019s appointments) and in the process of me being unable to work due to symptoms, and going to the hospital and doctor\u2019s appointments\u2014 I transitioned to PRN with work and then my job essentially forced me out.

I\u2019ve decided to try to get contracted with another group practice, only to find out a majority only want fully licensed clinicians, or only work with LPCs or LPC-As (which you all are lovely people and do great work, but it\u2019s frustrating and discouraging all the same).\n\nThat is my little rant/burn out thing.

Funny thing is they can\u2019t even fill the three days that I come in. I am so sick of the expectations of others and believe that it is because I am in a profession with blurred lines.

            "I am feeling the urge to reply here. I once was that client. I have never thought about my therapist having \\*feelings\\* about what happened for me. That's a curious perspective!   \n  \nI was that client making progress in trusting my therapist and setting boundaries with my highly abusive parents. Then that terminal illness came around and I buckled under the pressure and emotional manipulation to be the carer. (I didn't have to move in with them, thank goodness, but at times it still meant daily contact and support).   \nAdmittedly not much progress happened in therapy during that time. But, a lot of progress still happened internally. Many shifts and breakthrough moments happened in my thinking and understanding of the situation, the family dynamics, their past abuse of me and my siblings, their emotional manipulation, and of my enmeshment with them. It was definitely a learning time for me.   \n  \nDo you know what happened next? He DIED! Ha! I was the last human to see him when he was actively dying, and I walked out on him and left him to die on his own. (No regrets!) I was in a place to act on that power without self-blame or guilt. He deserved to die unloved and alone.   \n  \nThere was a whole other saga with the mother left behind, who it turned out had undiagnosed dementia, but that is sorted now. She is safely ensconced in a nursing home and I can see her or not see her as I please. \n\nAnd now we are making *immense* progress in therapy. There was a (major) hiccup for the years before and after his death, but now he is dead and gone and I am finally free. I can now focus on my own healing. And I am. \n\nMaybe that client of yours will get through this okay. I hope you can be there for them while they do the job of getting through, just like mine was for me. I never before even thought that that might have been hard for her.   \n  \nA curious perspective indeed."

            "For context, my CMH last site (not current), accepted all clients without ANY screening. The responsibility fell on ME as the clinician, only a year into the job, to take all clients with no oversight or additional training or pay. We would also be on call 24/7 with an on call phone and no instructions or extra pay. *I was forced to practice outside my scope constantly.* this was super unethical and unfair to me and to the other clinicians. \n\n**I understand how it feels unethical to reject a client, but if it\u2019s not a good placement for them, that\u2019s not fair or ethical for them either.**\n\nMy current site is also outpatient and screens out high acuity or active suicidality with a plan and intent. Because that\u2019s not appropriate for outpatient, weekly therapy.",
            "I refer out for active or chronic suicidality especially if there were attempts in the client's history. I am a solo practitioner and I only provide therapy over telehealth. My website and PT profiles are both very clear about what I treat and don't treat, and I explain why active suicidality, high acuity, or high risk clients are best served in person.\n\nThis is also the stance of the APA.",
            "Maybe a controversial take, but aside from community mental health settings that are meant to be a safety net for everybody (and even there, there are limits), I don\u2019t think individual practitioners should ever be obligated to treat anything they\u2019re not comfortable treating, even if it\u2019s just because they don\u2019t enjoy that type of work. Some people work better with clients who have more tangible symptoms to work with like suicidality, self neglect, and non-suicidal self injury. Others prefer to do the type of depth work that is difficult if not impossible to do with someone who is frequently in an acute mental health crisis. Others like to teach those with neurodevelopmental conditions like autism and ADHD skills for functioning in a world that isn\u2019t made for them. I think we made a big mistake when we started lumping all mental health providers into one category and telling people just to \u201cgo see a therapist\u201d as if anyone who pops up on Google should be able to handle their presenting concerns.",
            "I can not take on someone who is in the throes of seriously contemplating suicide. Ideation with no history of attempts or plan is one thing. Having a plan and increasing intent is another. I am a solo provider. I do not have a crisis line, groups, social workers or the ability to offer the intensive care someone in this situation needs. \nIt is going to be harmful to both the client and me to take someone on I can not provide competent care for.\n\nThis is a failure of our health care system, not issues with practitioners acknowledging the limits of their practice.",
            "I'm not a crisis therapist. My work phone doesn't come home with me, my schedule isn't flexible. If a client is in crisis, I'm not able to accomodate and support them during it. \n\nIf someone is looking for me to help support them through crisis, I'm not the one to work with them. My specialities and niches are valuable for what I specialize in and I provide a service that's in high demand. \n\nThere's other therapists and services that specialize in other things and I work with them at what they specialize in. Not every client is suited for every therapist and not every therapist is suited for every client.",
            "Those are really good in depth questions! I have seen private practices that refer out any level of SI experienced at any point in a life time. There needs to be more nuance to assessment than that. I think that reenforces shame and stigma and also pushes some clients to lie in order to access services. \n\nI know my grad program had literally nothing I can recall about assessing for or work with clients experiencing SI of any level. I think we do a disservice to therapists in training but not having that be a core part of education in many programs. I feel similarly about disordered eating. There needs to be some baseline of competency to meet the reality of the society we live in.\n\nEdited to add - I worked in CMH on the Mobile crisis outreach team so I\u2019m passionate about this issue after my experiences. A lot of clients ended up in crisis because they couldn\u2019t access lower level services sooner or couldn\u2019t find appropriate outpatient options after dc from inpatient, PHP or IOP and acuity was lowered.",
            "Sounds like criteria for screening out severe mental illness and anyone more than moderate. They are likely asserting a moderate to low level of care and screening out liability and clients who require a higher level of care. Sounds like outpatient mental health vs crisis or inpatient. You\u2019ll find that most practices do this even if they aren\u2019t forward about it and that non profits and hospitals with inpatient have grants specifically for this.",
            "unless you're willing to be on call 24/7 i don't think screening out certain clients is out of line at all. realistically certain dx are going to take more looking after and require crisis interventions.\n\nas far as passive SI/active SI i can see it being a liability issue if they 'made the wrong call' in whether it's passive or active then had to shuffle to refer out afterwards. depending on the clientele the practice advertises to serve i don't think it's a red flag.\n\nalso telehealth has not been advised for people with SI, so that's another thing if relevant.",
            "The service I work for screens out clients who are above a certain risk level. For suicide we have risk levels 1-4. 1 is low risk, 2 is medium, 3 is high, and 4 is immediate risk (as in we've had to call emergency services). We have a pretty indepth risk guidance policy so there's rarely any guessing as to what level risk someone is. Anything over a risk 2 is almost always referred out. There are occasionally exceptions but not very often.\n\nMy service only provides short-term therapy. The maximum amount of sessions clients can get is 15, but the average is 6-8. It would be unethical for us *not* to refer out high risk clients when we know that we can't provide them with the longer term support that they probably need. There's a decent chance we'd end up making things worse for someone.\n\nIf a service screened out clients with any suicidal ideation, then I'd say they're being way too cautious. SI is extremely common. Most of us will have a thought of \"I wish I wasn't here\" at least once, especially when we're going through something difficult. Someone having passive thoughts of wishing they were dead doesn't mean they're going to find the nearest bridge and fling themselves off it."

            "This is normal in my region. I started out at $37,500 at a CMHC with a master\u2019s degree and they had us \u201cpaying back\u201d time for licensure supervision each week. Outrageous!\u00a0",

            "It's ridiculous.  I think licensed folks need to take some training on the billing/business side of things so they can understand the payout rates for insurances.  This would be great information for us coming into the field.  I also think companies tend to prey on the self-sacrificing and overly passive demeanor a lot of providers have.  I understand this field attracts folks that have their own struggles and want to help others through theirs, and the idea of being assertive and better business-minded tends to feel antagonistic to being a therapist.",

            "I don\u2019t know that job market but given that the ad mentions clinical licensure supervision being provided it doesn\u2019t read like they\u2019re actually looking for fully licensed clinicians."
