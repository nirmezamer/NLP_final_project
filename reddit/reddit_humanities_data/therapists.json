            "MFT vs. an LPC program. I was certain I wanted to go into an LPC program after undergrad. I am finishing up an undergraduate internship in an MFT program, and I really love the systemic modality they use. So now I am doubting myself. I know I mainly want to work with individuals, the queer community, and college students. I know that environment and outside factors can have a significant impact on one's mental health, and I was wondering. How do MFT and LPC programs compare and contrast the therapy modalities they teach?",
            "I am currently working on my Masters in Mental Health Counseling and am taking a Community Mental Health course. This class is requiring me to do a brief interview with a LMHC or a registered intern who worked/works at a community agency. It\u2019s very brief and I only need a little bit of your time.\n\nThank you in advance!",
            "I'm a 27-year-old based in Greece and currently studying counseling. I'm eager to level up my skills inside the therapy room and would love some advice from experienced therapists or anyone knowledgeable in the field. Whether it's techniques for building rapport with clients, effective communication strategies, or ways to navigate challenging sessions. Recommendations for books, online courses, or practical exercises would be incredibly helpful. Thank you in advance!",

            "Sometimes you choose your theoretical orientation and sometimes the theoretical orientation chooses you.\u00a0\n\nA common way is that once you start getting hands on experience and being supervised by different people, you\u2019ll naturally find some orientations/modalities that you gravitate towards and are excited to learn more about and try it implement on your own.\u00a0\n\nAnd you\u2019ll also find some orientations/modalities that appear to be a poor fit.\u00a0",

I also work for a practice that has determined that I am \u201cpart-time\u201d simply because I work three 10 hour days instead of coming in 5 days a week. Funny thing is they can\u2019t even fill the three days that I come in. I am so sick of the expectations of others and believe that it is because I am in a profession with blurred lines. I work with a lot of LCSW. Funny how they can fill counseling positions yet I can\u2019t fill social work positions.\u00a0\n\nI love being an LMFT \u201cSystemic Therapist \u201c . What I don\u2019t like is competing with for relational hours, especially when I need them! Before signing my co tract I was told that no one there wanted to do couples and families.

I'm sorry if it sounds like I'm complaining and \"idk how good I have it\". But I'm up late every night, the discussion boards and papers and projects are overwhelming, and I'm really struggling to get this done.

I live in a small town in southern OH, so the opportunities for me to do something else aren\u2019t very extensive. I need some help in getting out of this cycle, so please let me know if any of yall have made a transition out of therapy and into some other type of work?? I have experience with CPS, I have been a bartender and worked in retail and restaurants as well. My experience is vast but my education is super specific. I also have a cert in trauma therapy and use that as well. I\u2019d love to do some education for people, or training. But I don\u2019t know where to start or if I have any other options. I need to have a flexible schedule since I\u2019m a single mom, and I don\u2019t have the $$ to start a private practice.

Luckily my LCSW-S was willing to bring me on to her telehealth group practice, but I have been absolutely struggling to market myself and bring in clients and I\u2019m burnt out trying. I\u2019ve decided to try to get contracted with another group practice, only to find out a majority only want fully licensed clinicians, or only work with LPCs or LPC-As (which you all are lovely people and do great work, but it\u2019s frustrating and discouraging all the same).\n\nThat is my little rant/burn out thing.

One thing that I've been implementing lately is growing apathetic to my clients' outcomes-- not to mean that I've stopped caring or have become numb to their struggles, but mostly in a way where *I* don't become dysregulated as a result of *their* struggles and feelings.  \n\nI've noticed, especially about a month ago, where some clients would come to me and we'd brainstorm on possible solutions or ways to take care of ourselves, and it would be roadblock after roadblock. It seemed like nothing we explored could be helpful or beneficial, and I was struggling with some awful imposter syndrome (I'm only 2 years into the field). It wasn't until I read some great advice on here (can't remember specifically) that I've learned to let go of the responsibility of my clients' actions--they either 1) come back to me and we explore why they didn't implement strategies or 2) come back to me and we explore ways to maintain what they are doing. Either way, I'll be here to help",
            "A couple of thoughts:\n\n1. You wrote, \"Struggling with wanting to save them and just feeling like I\u2019m losing all our progress.\" The client is not yours to save, and their progress is not yours to lose. You are their therapist, not their avatar.\n2. Life does not \"throw them back.\" Life challenges them and they choose how to respond. Sometimes those choices are forward moving, and most of the time they are not.\n\nI get the impulse to feel exactly how you are feeling. We have all been there. However, you are feeling this way about choices and a life that is not yours to live.",

Something\u2019s I\u2019ve been encouraged to ask is \u201chow has this (behavior,coping strategy, reaction etc) been helpful to you in your life?\u201d, observe/affirm how it\u2019s been helpful before and in some way helped keep them safe (in some capacity), then encourage client to consider if it still feels helpful now. If it\u2019s no longer a helpful coping strategy but causes more issues than you can ask something like \u201cif you could respond differently in these moments, would you want to?\u201d. I also usually provide psychoeducation on the brain\u2019s neuro plasticity. In a lot of these cases, even if they feel the behavior isn\u2019t helpful or okay, they may not feel they are able to change if they consider it a character trait. I often say to my clients, \u201cif it was learned, then it can be unlearned\u201d or \u201ceverything is figureoutable\u201d.
