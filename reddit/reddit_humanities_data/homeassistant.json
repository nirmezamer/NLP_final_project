            "Hey, just wanted to mention I love the new look - so much more suited for HA!  Nice work!",
            "Hey I'm new here and just starting to dive into smart led lights and light bulbs...\n\nProbably a stupid question but  are smart lights  only going to work on the app they recommend?\n\nIs there a better app to few to choose from rather than using generic (my first 2 bulbs are Jinvoo) one the product recommends.\n\nIf I want to build \"scenes\" (I think that's what they are called according to my all) where would be a good place to start. Would love to have green/red combo for xmas, but not sure if I can teach myself by then\n\nThanks for any and all suggestions, going to go browse the sub now and try not to be jealous lol",
            "I have been using Home Assistant for about 8 years, off and on. I was attracted to it initially since it was the only HA system that didn't use Java. I'm a Python veteran and have been using Linux since Redhat version 1.\n\nI am becoming increasingly frustrated with Home Assistant since the developers have decided that Docker is the only way to implement additions. I really hate Docker for several reasons, but mostly because so much of it is tied to \"magic\" and the Docker cloud. One of the major selling points of Home Assistant is the independence provided since you don't need any \"cloud\" providers to get the job done.\n\nI currently use Proxmox on a rather large server and have little need for SBCs to run things like HA. With a substantial UPS, my system can weather several hours of failed commercial power. I find it much easier to just spin up a Proxmox container than to fiddle around with a Docker container. \n\nI realize that most HA users are not Linux experts and that the \"plug-and-play\" installation on an RPI or other SBC is attractive, but for those of us who really like to tinker, that is not much fun. \n\nBeing a dinosaur is such a challenge.",

            "Hey u/Frenck_nl (I am only really tagging you as I have seen you active here a bit in the past) is it possible to take at look at github pull for gotify notifications? [https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/53050](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/53050)\n\nIts been basically ready for a while now and pings to the reviewers has done nothing to assist in getting this merged.\n\nBeing on a degoogled platform I am unable to use FCM and i would like to have notifications back working. Gotify is fairly useful in that regard for other self hosted apps/services so wouldn't mind this being included",
            "Finally bit the bullet and started setting HA up, working through the docs to get various things integrated.\n\nI have noticed some odd behaviour, with HA running some.of my hue lights appear to be changing to white.\n\nI have no automation or anything running yet, just hue integrated.\n\nI turned the HA VM off and this has stopped happening.\n\nHas anyone encountered this before?",
            "Does anybody know of a good Bluetooth adapter I can use with home assistant so I can discover switchbot devices.  I have home assistant installed on an Intel nuc via the official nuc installer",
            "Anybody else having issues with ios app needing to be closed and restarted before it works again after not using it for a while?",
            "I started with home assistant new and try to implement and Tuya switch for a door. But I can only integrate the switch for the door to send the signals or the sensor to get the current status.\nI don't know how I can integrate both functionalities with local tuya.",

            "> There are already some good hardware choices to start using voice, but we\u2019re exploring building our voice satellite hardware to create a more plug-and-play experience.\n\nNow thats what is needed to actually get people to convert to Assist. I love being a power user and using Rpis, but man I wish I could just buy something (even if its more expensive) to replace the ease of google home, and have it in stock.\n\nGet the hardware down, add timers and the ability for assist devices to play music on spotify (or wherever) and I am switching no question.",
            "Just chiming in to say that I'm always so impressed with the HA team's ability to consistently deliver, innovate and improve the \"product\". I have not seen a project that goes \"we are going to do x\" and then easily, measurably, consistently does so.  \nI religiously check for the latest version and am always excited by what's new. Thank you for making such a brilliant and open-standard product!",
            "It\u2019s been a few months since I last played with it, but when it comes to Assist I found it struggled with my households New Zealand accent and at the time, I couldn\u2019t find anything to make that better. Things like asking it to \u201cturn off the hall light\u201d was interpreted as \u201cturn off the whole light\u201d. \n\nIn regards to point on security, I hope that means they\u2019re interested in adding support for IdM\u2019s like Entra so external logins can be protected by conditional access policies",
            "definitely want to +1 for the dashboards to have definable permissions for users and guests. I'd really like visitors to my home to have a landing page when they connect to the wifi that tells them how to adjust stuff in their room and see temperatures and things. It should be a customized dashboard that I've made just for guests and they shouldn't be able to get to anything else. Also, this would be even more important for people have short-term rentals like airbnb homes - when a guest comes into the home and connects to wifi, they could be shown a customized dashboard with all the things they need, including the checkout instructions, and not be able to get to anything else in home assistant. And lastly, I think it would be very useful to give kids a dashboard for their controls without them having the ability to get to anything else other than what is on their dashboard. Just some basic permissions settings on dashboard pages would allow for all of these use cases and people could get really creative with them. Thanks HA!",

            "It would be great to have a strategy built into automations for validation. As you start to scale up, it becomes difficult to know when a device failed to update within an automation, unless you experience it firsthand.",
            "That's not really much of a roadmap, is it",
            "For me this is total irrelevance, I need better things like **global variables that will work on trigger conditions and actions and variables that don't have local scope** so we can create better automation's but ya I understand flashy things like AI, Assistants and Dashboard drag and drop can be flashy for the beginners eye and attract more ppl."

We can just go back to our offices and we will get notified when the dogs are at the back door. Works well when Im in the gym.

So far I'm reasonably happy with them, and no back to back server/security issues like Wyze has with it's cheap cameras. For anything security related though I would at least do Amcrest and something with a proper webui."

Of all the technology\u2019s I\u2019m using, I like my 433mhz devices the most because they are so cheap, battery life is amazing, the range is extremely long. They don\u2019t report state so I use zigbee where that matters on things such as windows that never get opened so I know the battery life.\n\nEdit: the link points to the docker version because the add-on is no longer maintained but I\u2019m using the old add-on version.",

Even 20 years later I'm proud of the work we did on that project\n\nWe lost the prize (they awarded a prize to the best project in addition to, you know, your degree) to a team that made a \"smart house\" by hooking up a bunch of X10 devices to a doll house. \n\nI will never see X10 and not think of that.",
