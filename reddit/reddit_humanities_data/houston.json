        "content": "Hey everyone! I\u2019m so sorry if this is against the reddiquette \u2014 if so let me know and I\u2019ll take this down. \n\nIt\u2019s a hell of a long shot, but I had my backpack stolen yesterday while at dinner \u2014 it was a car break-in. For some reason my air tag shows the backpack is somewhere on Allen Parkway \u2014 near-ish to Elenor Tinsley. I do know the thief did ditch other stolen bags from my vehicle in different parts of Houston. \n\nI looked for a couple hours earlier this morning and had no luck. If someone on here sees it, and could get it for me I\u2019d be so grateful. \n\nLook, I know some of my stuff is probably gone, but my hope is some of the clothes and other personal items of low value may be in the bag so I don\u2019t have to buy everything again from scratch. \n\nIf you see a black backpack (sadly idk what brand) with t-shirts, clothes, retainers, portable chargers, business cards \u2014 somewhere near Sabine Park/E\u014ds Fitness area, could you please let me know? I\u2019d be so grateful. If you do check while there, I still greatly appreciate it. ",

            "I think Air Tags work by using proximity of Apple phones. Sadly when I was looking it was 2am at the park. I would have to be near it and not a ton of people were out in that part.",
            "Might want to check the visitors center, they have a lost and found there. Just across sabine bridge near the skate park.",
            "Ah, how unfortunate that there are still people who have never seen any of the thousands of \"my bag got stolen out of my car\" posts here in /r/houston .\n\nGet ready, humble muskrat, you're going to be told a couple/few times that you can't leave anything valuable in a car parked in Houston.  Same with any big city.",
            "Hey I appreciate the update. Tbh it\u2019s quite possible that could have been it. It\u2019s a little north of the AirTag but I know it stopped tracking at 10pm and it\u2019s not 100% accurate. Thank you for sharing the info!\n\nI will see what I can do on that.",
            "Huh. That\u2019s a great idea! Didn\u2019t consider that. Thank you for the recommendation. I\u2019ll do that asap.",
            "Yeah. Fair point. Not expecting much but hey, if someone sees it at the park and cares, beats not trying at all. But agreed.",
            "Yep. You aren\u2019t safe anywhere in Houston. Even the parking garages of \u201cluxury\u201d apartments constantly have people posting videos of their tires stolen. Sometimes I wonder if I should just leave my windows rolled down. \ud83d\ude02",
            "What restaurant were you at/where was car parked when the break in happened?",
            "Gus\u2019s World Famous Fried Chicken. Guess some guy has been robbing cars there several times in the past week. \n\nAlso, what time was your run? If I may ask",
            "Aw that sucks. I eat there regularly. How'd it end up over at Eleanor Tinsley? Not particularly close if you're by foot. And by car you can toss it anywhere. Unless the Airtag just happened to ping while they were driving across the Sabine St Bridge."

I drop it down to 68 at night and it gets there by probably 4am. By noon it's back up to 73, and 4pm it's at 77. Rinse repeat. \n\nThis is a shit climate city."

Is that associated with Critical Mass also?",

            "I would wear a second suit on top of your first to be safe",

            "Na, bathing suits and margaritas in the conference room.",
            "I'm in an executive position and interview several people per month for many roles. I'm honestly ok for dressing a step above the role you're applying for. I'm pretty surprised at how often people interview in a suit and are dressed well above the position. However, that is significantly better than being underdressed. I've never docked points for someone dressed in a suit, unless it was a really terrible suit and I still don't think I docked any points. I just told myself this guy probably borrowed his dad's suit and at least he was trying. \n\nSo, dress above the role you're applying for. Be comfortable in your dress and confident in your discussion and you'll be fine.",
            "I\u2019ve never worn a suit to a job interview\u2026but I do work in lab environments so a suit is not practical in my situation. If I was an executive level employee that would be different. I would say it depends on the job said man is going after.",
            "Depends on the job. You might be able to get away with a sport coat and khakis.",
            "Depends on the job but always good to overdress than to underdress. If it\u2019s an office job where business attire is ok and business casual is the norm then for a job interview wear the suit to make sure. Then when you start the job you can dress down to business casual if that\u2019s the norm. AC from your car to AC in the office. But there\u2019s comfortable suits that aren\u2019t as heavy for summer.",
            "Generally you dress professionally for an interview. For the people in the thread questioning if anyone wears a suit anymore: if you work a corporate role, of course business casual is generally the way companies will request you dress, but you\u2019ll probably have a few situations requiring a suit as well.",
