I'm pretty surprised at how often people interview in a suit and are dressed well above the position. However, that is significantly better than being underdressed. I've never docked points for someone dressed in a suit, unless it was a really terrible suit and I still don't think I docked any points. I just told myself this guy probably borrowed his dad's suit and at least he was trying. \n\nSo, dress above the role you're applying for. Be comfortable in your dress and confident in your discussion and you'll be fine.",
            "Are you having your interview outside at noon? \n\n  \nDoes your car not have AC? Pretty sure the office will have AC.\n\nWear a suit and man up. \n\n  \nSource: I am a native Houstonian.",

            "Depends on the job but always good to overdress than to underdress. If it\u2019s an office job where business attire is ok and business casual is the norm then for a job interview wear the suit to make sure. Then when you start the job you can dress down to business casual if that\u2019s the norm. AC from your car to AC in the office. But there\u2019s comfortable suits that aren\u2019t as heavy for summer.",
            "Generally you dress professionally for an interview. For the people in the thread questioning if anyone wears a suit anymore: if you work a corporate role, of course business casual is generally the way companies will request you dress, but you\u2019ll probably have a few situations requiring a suit as well."

Busses and drivers cost money.",

As a teen in Houston I walked over a mile home from high school because I was the last house on my bus route and it was a 30 minute walk to be home by 3:00 or ride the bus and get home at 4:00. The thing is, very few areas in Houston are designed with pedestrians in mind. Even though I wasn't at great risk of getting hit by a car it was miserably hot as hell on many of those walks because there was no shade for most of it.\n\nWhen our kid is old enough to head to elementary school I'll have him ride his bike and I'll look at starting up a bike bus program in the neighborhood with other adults.",

What's been bugging me for years is seeing new schools getting constructed alongside high-speed thoroughfares while we simultaneously slacked off on sidewalks and bike paths. That won't combine well with this \"new\" policy. Schools need to be sited in low-speed neighborhoods and reachable by biking and walking. Then let (fewer) bus drivers focus on transporting the students that aren't capable of navigating there on their own.",
