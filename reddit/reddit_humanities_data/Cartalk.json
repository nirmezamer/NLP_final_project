        "content": "Now i know for a fact that it is deflated, cz the barometer says 36psi and the door of the car says 42psi. But my dad thinks otherwise despite the barometer, the sticker and online search results. He said something along the lines of all cars he drove were/should/must be 25-6psi which i witnessed on the other two vw cars he had but both were 265/65 i guess. This one here is 205/50 R17. Is this the reason? Slimmer tires are more pressured? Like physically i think less volume means more pressure to preserve the same amount of air? but idk.. you guys know your stuff very well, any help is appreciated :)\n\nOh this car is a vw caddy 2020 all track\nThe others were both a 2010 vw passat b6 and vw tiguan. Ik lot of vw hehe..",
