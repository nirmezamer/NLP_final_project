He lives way out in the country outside of a rural town. With it getting hotter it is their first summer together and he mentioned he should get some sort of alarm in his Silverado (2015ish) because I guess the dog is totally silent in the vehicle at all times even though she's a fan of car rides. I don't think he would ever leave her in the truck but he is an overly cautious person and has been an empty nester for over a decade. \n\nIs there somethibg I could wire to the battery or maybe the stereo board that would say something like \"dog in the back\" or whatever when the door chimes start dinging or when the car is shut off just for piece of mind? \nI'm pretty handy with electrical and could also have something professionally installed.

            "I don't see why it would be impossible but I doubt something is commercially available. Basically an RFID transmitter on the dog that sets an alarm on the receiver whenever the receiver doesn't get an ignition signal of 12v. Could be done with most rfid door open alarms and some relays. He'd just have to unclip the window alarm and put it to the other end when he took the dog out, and use relays to flip it so it's off when the car is on.\n\nOk, Google says they make them for babies and pets... I'm underestimating peoples forgetfulness.",

I change my oil every 10k km and inuse Mobil oil. I go 8k km if i go with a cheaper oil. Oil change is cheap. Don't save money on that!",
