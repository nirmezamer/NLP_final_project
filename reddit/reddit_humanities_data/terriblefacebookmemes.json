        "content": "Hello everyone,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOriginally this subreddit was about \\*Boomer memes\\*. It was about memes so painfully unfunny and out of touch that you would choke on a minion if you had to endure one more cry-laughing emoji on a sad post.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/db2c8xfg2yqa1.jpg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d43ee1e3dc8d6a5e567363048eb9a13650e92344\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOver time we have slowly mutated into some kind of unholy abomination where today most of the posts made to this subreddit are just outright racism or transphobia. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlright, we said, ok, but the point is to make fun of sad little memes that these people think are so profoundly common-sensical so our mandate is preserved. This place exists to showcase bad memes for purpose of education and entertainment. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately we spend an inordinate amount of time banning people who \\*agree with the racism\\*.  \"This is based!\" they will gurgle, \"This isn't bad at all\" we hear fartily from the wings. \"But this is just true. It's not fair! This racism is just true!\" cries a third. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis will not do. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSomewhere in Febuary a smarter than average subscriber in modmail alerted us to the fact that reddit has a terms of service and today we alert you to that too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[These are the rules we all agreed to follow when we made an account](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement-september-12-2021)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, apparently, subreddits can get banned and users can get sitewide suspended for the shit we feature here. Even if it is meant to laugh at. Even if we explicitly say that agreeing with the bad memes is forbidden.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor some bizarre, unfathomable reason we do actually like this place. We want to keep it. We want to see it prosper.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo we need to go back to our roots.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nruh6xc52yqa1.jpg?width=1590&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98ac4e3ef9ed6d32929173daa85b0cd3944565aa\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo more racism. No more transphobia. No more homophobia. No more making fun of my mom. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom now on all posts have to follow the site-wide rules. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom now on we will be about Boomer memes again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you everyone and happy minioning!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/efzmd36x1yqa1.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0f87b658a9ef749d1550956537f3b20775cc6b7",
