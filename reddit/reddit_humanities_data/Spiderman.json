            "Latest update shows they still need to raise about 2230 thousand more to pay for Dialysis sessions:                                                    \n\n> The MaGiC donut-hole\n\n> (Imagine Doug Henning said it, If you don\u2019t know Doug Henning, you are missing out on an amazing magician)\n\n> Peter is now over two months without a re-infection. This is very good news. He is working hard to recover what he has lost.\n\n> That is the end of my good news.\n\n> Apparently as of January 1, 2024, We have to pay out of pocket for Peter\u2019s Dialysis which he need to live.\n\n> It is an insurance morass that I am climbing through trying to get insurance to pick up the ball.\n\n> Just for a break down on the expense. One session is $743 (USD) and he needs three a week making it 2229 or say 2230 because it is easier for me to wrap my head around. I have been paying for it because I want Peter to live. But the well is dry and I haven\u2019t has much luck with the collectables recently.\n\n> I am coming to you and asking for your help which you have so graciously given us during the last year and three months.\n\n> Please give the Go Fund Me another blast you can say this is to pay for Peter\u2019s dialysis.\n\n> I will put another update and edit this one once I get everything back in hand.\n\n> I really didn\u2019t need this but here it is Happy New Year.\n\n> On a lighter note, Peter and I have been watching all the programs we like to watch together. He\u2019s not much for Project Runway or Ink Master and I am uninterested in beach volleyball and some procedural shows.\n\n> We have been enjoying \u201cAfter Midnight\u201d which airs after Colbert. It\u2019s a game show with comedians and a talk show with a game sort of kinda. But we have both laughed hard than we have in a very long time. He is caught up with Loki. We are working our way through \u201cWhat If-\u201cand the fourth season of \u201cMiss Scarlett and the Duke\u201d. \u201cCriminal Record\u201d is next.\n\n> We talk about conventions and fans. He is so very humbled and grateful for all you have done. You must understand that Peter came from the other side of the table. He was a fan before he was a pro. He would meet people he admired and told them so. He has autographs from that time. Overtime a number of those people have become his friends and admire his work as well.\n\n> He has been catching up on his comic book reading too.\nWe have been bouncing writing ideas between us.\n\n> It almost feels like we are back to the old normal but this is the new normal and I have a lot of muck to get through so I can stabilize the household",
            "How can someone like Peter David, who is responsible for so many iconic storylines and characters that both Marvel and DC have made hundreds of millions of dollars off of not afford something like this? The big two should be ashamed of what they've done to their creators.",
            "Hey everyone if you could help Peter and his family out please donate what you can. If you're unable to donate please help share and spread this among other communities!",
            "Man, why are all these talented people working for marvel always asking for money? Not saying this isn't a good cause, but I just see posts from then struggling with money too often.",
            "You know, ever since George Perez passed away it's been getting to me how little we hear about creators until their death, then Marvel and DC decide to post spreads \"honoring\" them, you'd think they'd attempt to raise money or just straight up pay for their medical needs instead of wait until they're gone to acknowledge their work. \n\nEvery single time I'm reading through issues I've been noticing more and more tributes, and sure some are of old age from natural causes, but others are younger who went far too soon.",
            "Wheres Marvel's take on this?",
            "Am very confused. Medicare guarantees payment for dialysis for this very reason. There was a specific law passed in the 1970s about this, because access to dialysis should not depend on ability to pay in the US. The hospital bills from his hospitalizations must be substantial however. Wishing him good health and best of luck.",
            "He somehow wrote a new 2099 book which starts next week so pick it up to support him!\u00a0",
            "Maybe this is when a massive company (Disney and marvel) can step in WITH fans and assist. The guy helped to create a super icon in 2099.",
            "Okay wtf? This guy is known for being the Best Hulk writer and one of the best Spider-Man writers. Marvel needs to acknowledge that their only iconic/important writer isnt Stan Lee or Jack Kirby."

            "This was extremely painful to read to say the least for 52.",
            "Not here to shit on the book or dunk on the artists, because there have been bad arcs in comics before and there will certainly be bad arcs again. I can confidently say that the Wells run won't be remembered fondly, but won't go down in history as reviled as the One More Day arc or Clone Saga. But, despite trying to stay open-minded and optimistic about his run, it just doesn't really work for me.\n\nYes, there are the obvious storytelling and character choices that I don't like (MJ getting powers, Ben and Janine becoming weird Halloween-themed antiheroes, the very existence of RekRap), but ideas that often sound silly on paper often actually work really well work in a Spider-Man comic- Spider-Man goes to space to fight a battle to sell toys and somehow winds up coming back to earth with a magic costume made of alien goo, and now the goo is made at him because Peter decided to dump it for spandex again, and we're supposed to believe this is one of his scariest villains? Spider-Man decides to work for Tony Stark and eventually decides to reveal his identity and fights against Captain America? Spidey tells JJJ his identity? All of these ideas sound really dumb, but they ended up working (hell, the very premise of Superior Spider-Man rubbed me the wrong way at first, but it was done so well that it is now one of my favorite Spider-Man arcs ever). So I can forgive a writer for wanting to try something off the wall. But, with all that being said, the Wells run really doesn't work for me, and I think I've figured out why: tone.\n\nYou want to have Peter put his values to the test to see if he can truly learn to forgive his greatest foe and help him on a path to redemption, only to have that good faith be betrayed, forcing Peter to grapple with everything he stands for and come to terms with the darkness within himself? Great, that sounds like a really cool story! You want to do a silly goofy Halloween special where there's a Bizarro Spider-Man who doesn't quite understand the point of being hero, but is completely delusional and oblivious? Okay, that sounds kind of fun, I'm sure the kids will like it. You want to do a reset of the Ben Reilly character to recontextualize him outside of his relationship with Peter? Okay, sure, I guess that makes sense for the character and you could do some interesting things with that. You want to give MJ powers, giving her and Peter a new perspective on their relationship, both past and current? Fine, I don't really like the idea of MJ being a superhero, but why not? But why, why, WHY would you want to do all of these stories at THE SAME TIME?\n\nZeb Wells does not know how to balance the tone of his stories. He wants to tell these big, fantastical, mythological fantasy stories with these characters, but he ALSO wants deep and mature character drama, moral conflict, and shades of grey, while ALSO ALSO wanting to have silly jokes and cartoony moments like the Living Brain and Spider-Goblin's appearance magically changing. But rather than choosing one or two of these elements to focus really hard on and do very well, he tries to do all of them simultaneously and they all come out mediocre at best. It's a bummer, because I think there are some interesting ideas out there, but the way they have been executed, they just don't work. Not every swing has been a miss, but there also haven't really been any home runs. I don't know that it's fair to call his run on ASM \"garbage\" (as some of the comments on here will frequently assert, but I also don't know if anyone will even remember the name Zeb Wells when talking about Spider-Man."
