I\u2019m looking at used mustangs but really am pretty I knowledgeable when it comes to years and stuff. I want a V8 before they go the way of the dodo. \n\nUltimately what I want in a car is something enjoyable to drive on American highways, not too big for city driving, and is something that won\u2019t be in the shop all the time due to issues. The mustang is interesting to me due to being able to get some higher trims used with under 30k miles for around 30k. Im just wondering what my options are if I want to stay under 35k but have a car that will be fun and last me 7 years or so.",
