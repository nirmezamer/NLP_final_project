            "I've not heard anything good about the standard Cross. But the hybrid version accelerates better, is quieter, has plenty of power, and since it basically has the same hybrid system as the new Prius, probably will be more reliable as well. Set it to EV mode and will default to electric power until you ask for more power, or until the traction battery needs charging. \n The AWD system consists of a separate electric motor for the rear axle and turns on in slippery conditions or if hard acceleration is asked for. It is so seamless, I had to turn on the hybrid status screen to tell when it was in use.\n I love my Corolla Cross Hybrid and am very pleased I bought it. Plus, my dealer sold it basically at MSR plus tag and title.",

            "I heard that apparently gig work like doordash and lyft are absolutely \u201chorrible\u201d for cars just absolutely eats them up? I feel like i disagree with this but at the same time i don\u2019t know enough about cars to make that conclusion. To me If you take care of it and make sure you\u2019re never without important fluids and do all maintenance then wouldn\u2019t the car run as just as many miles as it would if you\u2019re not gig working? \n\nLike if we take two of the same Toyota Prius and one of them has 100k miles from gig work and general use and the other has 100k miles from your commute to work and general use would it be the same amount of wear? I dont know if thats a good comparison but i think its a little out there to just say a statement like \u201cgig work is horrible for cars\u201d because in what sense? Like sure the car is going to depreciate faster because you\u2019re using it more but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll get less out of it? You\u2019ll just reach that 100k miles mark faster? Am i full on smooth brain? I appreciate the help! Thanks!",

            "I\u2019m looking to get a sports car this summer and did some test driving today, to include a C7 z06. The salesman told me the \u201ctire pressure max said 52 so I inflated them to about 45\u201d. I was excited to test drive so I just went with it, but 45 sounded awfully high to me. The car felt borderline unusable, every blip of throttle the rear was fishtailing. I looked into it when I got home and the recommended tire pressure on c7z\u2019s is like 30-32 psi. I know lower tire pressure = more grip, and being FIFTEEN psi over recommend is nuts. But I also have seen a lot of people say the c7z is super tail happy in general just due to the power.  \n  \nObviously a car like that is going to be able to break the rear tires loose pretty easily, but I\u2019m curious how big of a difference you guys think that tire pressure made? Obviously it made a difference, but would 15 psi make the car feel almost unusable? Or is it just THAT much of a monster?\u00a0"

        "content": "This isn't a clickbait post. For the last 3 years I've driven my 1924 Ford Model T for probably 70% of my driving. There are of course three caveats; I don't have a work commute, I have a winter beater and my wife has a normal car.\n\nFor the first couple years after college I only had a motorcycle and my wife had a car. When we had our son I decided to sell the bike and get a 'Family' car. Now of course nobody in their right mind would buy a Model T for this purpose, and I didn't, I bought a Mirage...A cheap, reliable and boring car. \n\nThe problem was that both of our families are old car people, we had an empty garage bay and wouldn't you know it a family friend had a car that needed a new home.\n\nSo I bought a 1924 Model T when I was 30, our son was born and when he turned two a car seat appeared in the T. He loves it, other kids love it and old people love it.\n\nIts no trailer queen show car, I don't even own a trailer, but I put about 2k miles a year on it and its only left me stranded once. The gas mileage is not great at 20mpg, but at least it runs on regular ethanol with no lead additive. I've had it up to 45mph but it starts getting sketchy. It will cruise at 40mph with the top down, but 35mph with the top up. (It acts like a drag chute.) The furthest I've driven it in one go was 70 miles,\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/LPRFDBZ](https://imgur.com/a/LPRFDBZ)\n\n\\*Now of course is this safe, well no obviously, and I'm not recommending others do this either. We live in a very small town in New England with minimal traffic and many back roads to avoid anything 50mph and over. I have a normal back-up car as needed and for winter. I don't take my kid in it if its over 10 miles away. I also put Wilwood disc brakes on the rear as the stock brake is terrible.\n\n",
