            "They agreed on almost every point including the need for a hard number for the age of consent. What Destiny was saying was that that number, while absolutely needed as a precaution, does not dictate the mental maturity or motives of a person, which is true. x kept interpreting this point as Destiny saying the age of consent doesn't matter. Though I get it, Destiny has nothing to lose, it's his brand to speak freely and take the conversation there with sus ass hypotheticals, even if x agreed with the nuance, he's not gonna say that, he'd be clipped and labeled a pedo sympathizer and it'd be yet another L for him and Kick.",

            "that could have happened, but I think xqc was just too egotistical to give up on his stance that he didn't put much thought through. nearing the end of their conversation, he backpedals and immediately says it was not backpedaling but instead him \"expanding\" his principles.",

            "A slot tournament is a timeframe where people have an opportunity to get points on a leaderboard.\n\nDepends on the tourney- but there can be rules such as only this game companies machines give points towards the tourney.\n\nThe goal is to get as many points as youre comfortable getting in the timeframe without losing what youre comfortable losing. If you dont know how points work- the most common rewards systems give 1 point per $1 wagered. (If i do a $5 spin i get 5 points)\n\nThis is great marketing. If someone goes in and hits a jackpot during these tournies- the player will assume they have x amount of money to lose putting towards the slot tournament- which they end up losing."
