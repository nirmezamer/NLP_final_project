If you\u2019re not well off hidden fees could be the difference between whether you can afford to go out at all, and not being upfront about how much a meal costs is just fraud. It\u2019s so completely stupid and such an easy political win to ban them. It makes no sense to let restaurants do this.\u00a0",
