            "They had to euthanize a coyote at the botanical gardens a few years ago. A gardener there said someone was leaving trays of raw meat. Anytime humans feed them, they lose fear of humans.",
            "A few years ago, I saw one there sneaking up on a father and son who were standing at the edge of that big pond. It looked like it was about to grab the kid when everyone screamed which scared it off. Was surprised as there were a lot of people around that day.",
            "Omg. My child and another baby were attacked in 2020 in the Botanical Garden and it ended up in the chronicle. It didn\u2019t bite our kids but got very close and basically stalked us. They put down the coyote offender after it attacked a set of twins a few months later. I kid you not- the parks agent that came to the scene told us, multiple times, that coyotes don\u2019t attack people and basically gaslit us. The other parent called the chronicle after the city and park staff didn\u2019t act on it. We were terrified the coyote would attack again- and it did. Insanity.",

In the last two weeks, while I've been biking through the park, I've yelled at three separate coyotes as they were stalking small dogs being led on leashes.\n\nSo sorry that your daughter was attacked.  Glad that she is doing better.",

A woman with one of the dogs got bitten, too. I wonder if it's the same one? Unfortunately, they didn't swab for DNA though.",
