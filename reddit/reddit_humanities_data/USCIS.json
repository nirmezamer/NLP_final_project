        "content": "# /r/USCIS FAQs\n\nThis post will get updated over time. Come back every now and then.\n\n*Please listen carefully as our menu options have recently changed.*\n\n## First: **VERY** frequent questions\n\nPlease review [this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/USCIS/wiki/index/vfaq) before creating a new post to see if it answers your question. We hope this will lower the number of posts asking the same questions over and over. If you create a post to ask a question already covered here, your post may be deleted. \n\nThe list may change over time, so please check back every so often.\n\n## Read the wiki!\n\nYes, we have a wiki: https://www.reddit.com/r/USCIS/wiki/index\n\nIt doesn't hold answers to everything. But go through it and see if it helps with your question. If yes, great! And if you need more info, read on.\n\nThe wiki is intended to be updated every now and then, too. Your post may be deleted and you may be pointed at wiki resources if your question doesn't extend beyond what the wiki already covers.\n\n## Megathreads\n\nMegathreads are used to centralize discussions and knowledge about a given subject and to avoid creating redundant posts. \n\nSee [this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/USCIS/wiki/index/megathreads) for the list of active megathreads.\n\nIf your question relates to one of these subjects, there's a good chance it was already answered, but either way, you should ask it there rather than create a new post.\n\nAgain, the list may change over time, so please check back every so often.\n\n## We have rules\n\nMany Reddit communities have rules, and that includes r/USCIS. Please review the link below if you haven't already, or take another look every now and then to refresh your memory.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/uscis/about/rules\n\nOn a desktop or laptop, you can always find them in the sidebar on the right.\n\n## Last but not least\n\nIf you don't find the info you're looking for in one of the resources above, then don't hesitate to create a new post and ask the community! We do encourage you to first do some research on your own, so you can post semi-educated questions rather than super basic/lazy ones like \"how do I apply for citizenship\". Doing a bit of homework can go a long way toward empowering you in your immigration proceedings. Use your best judgment and be considerate of everyone's time.",

Eligibility requirements from DHS released yesterday:\n\nhttps://www.dhs.gov/news/2024/06/17/fact-sheet-dhs-announces-new-process-promote-unity-and-stability-families\n\n\u201cEligibility and Process\n\nTo be considered on a case-by-case basis for this process, an individual must:   \n\nBe present in the United States without admission or parole; \nHave been continuously present in the United States for at least 10 years as of June 17, 2024; and \nHave a legally valid marriage to a U.S. citizen as of June 17, 2024.  \u201c\n\nIt looks like it would only benefit people that came in without a visa. Essentially if you came in with your i94 and visa you wouldn\u2019t qualify from the looks of it. Very limited program.  It looks like the main goal is to grant \u201cadmission\u201d to people so they don\u2019t have to leave the country.  For people that don\u2019t have to leave but are scared to apply for green card they\u2019re out of luck apparently.\n\n",

            "So basically this program will just provide an I94 so this category of immigrants will be able to adjust their status",
            "> For people that don\u2019t have to leave but are scared to apply for green card they\u2019re out of luck apparently.\n\nYes people who already don't have to leave the country don't benefit from a program that changes things so you don't have to leave the country. Not sure why anyone who is already eligible for a green card would be \"scared\".",
            "A relative of mine left the country in March to serve his 10 year ban. His wife is a US citizen. Would this possibly benifit him? He was here for over 10 years.",
            "What about the DACA recipients who have been working over 10 years, paying taxes, and have a clean record? Those rules and cut off dates are not fair to them.",
            "As someone whose spouse has DACA and has been vetted by USCIS every two years for a decade, not having to go to Juarez to finish the green card process is an extremely beneficial and tangible benefit for us. To dismiss this as pandering ignores other people who benefit and is crabs in a bucket mentality from fellow prospective immigrants.",
            "I'm the type of person this program would benefit immensely. What I am worried about is that I am not married as of June 17, 2024. I've been engaged to my US citizen fianc\u00e9 for a couple years. We were going to get married this year. I'm happy for all the people this program will benefit.",
            "This is a good thing, because these people can already get waivers (which as spouses are usually approved) and leave and get visas and come back, but it costs a lot of money for lawyers and stress and time for USCIS in litigation and review. This simplifies the process for people who would basically get the same result with more headache for everyone.",

Nothing changed for the I-130. Didn't think too much about it though, as I had read in many cases that this is pretty common. Then yesterday, all of the sudden, the I-130 changed to \"actively being reviewed\". My husband was through the roof, saying that this means things are moving along and they're working on our case right now. Me being me, I disregarded allllll of it (\ud83d\ude02) after lurking on this subreddit for way too long, saying that this notification doesn't mean anything and we won't hear anything else until at least the end of the year.\n\nThen, about 24 hours later today, I received the notification that our case has been approved!!! \ud83e\udd79 I did not have to attend an interview.\n\nI was convinced I wouldn't be able to see my family in Germany for Christmas, but I am BEYOND thankful that this is now possible.\n\nSENDING GOOD VIBES TO EVERYONE OUT THERE!!!

USCIS states on their website somewhere that direct spouses of US Citizens are able to do that, but I'd have to look for that again."
