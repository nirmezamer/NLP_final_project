            "Should I got with the OnePlus 12R around 800 AUD or ZTE nubia Z60 Ultra which is 870$ or are there any alternatives within the price range of 700 to 800 AUD ?",
            "I've got a Redmi Note 10 5G. Would it be worth upgrading to the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite? (Sale + discount means I can get it for ~\u00a3160 instead of full price). \n\nNord CE 4 Lite is just outside my budget (\u00a3200).",

            "I have settle with the xiaomi 13 ultra lol",
            "Well I can from the 8T. It is an expensive side-grade. I don't do a lot of RAM intensive stuff so I don't notice any sort of speed or performance boost and the camera is worse. I did not think I would dislike the curved screen but I do. \n\nThe dimensions are so freaking similar but something about the phone (maybe it's the case?) makes typing, especially when holding with one hand very inaccurate.\n\nJust my personal experience",
            "I see so many reports of older oneplus models being better than the new ones, makes me wonder if that's what I should buy. For an upgrade from my 6 year old phone I wouldn't bother looking at any 2+ year old Samsungs but it seems that doesn't apply to oneplus."

            "No clue about the 12R but the 12 is a beast and lasts all day, into the next. And the best part is the 30 minute charging from 0 to 100.",

            "I went for 12r. I know 12 is better in many ways but I got a good deal with the edu discount and could get 16gb/256gb one for $400. It's been just a week but so far I really like it. Playing Wuthering waves @max 60hz for 2hours and no fps drop was wild. Tried Genshin Impact for an hour and got solid 60fps too. Fast charging is crazy. I have not changed my phone while sleeping at all. Just plugging in the charger about 15-20min in the morning gives me a whole day battery. First 2days phone was pretty hot for most of the time and the battery drained fast but that was android learning/apps not optimized. from day 3 everything got better and feels like it is getting better at this moment too. I would go for 12 if my budget was higher though.",
            "But my question is, does the 12 have the same radios and the Open? \nBought the Open, used it for a week and returned it. \n\nPicked up an unlocked s24 Plus but I'll say the Samsung radios and speed vs the Open, feels much faster. Why's that? Thought the Open had better specs?\n\nI do love the charging speeds of the OP though.",
            "I've got a 12r and the battery lasts me 2-3 days. I mostly do discord, insta and reddit",
            "If you want the latest and greatest from OnePlus with no compromises, wireless charging and better screen/cameras then go for the 12. If you want value, great performance with some compromises then go with the 12R. I plan to keep my phone for more than 2 years so I wanted to spend the money and get everything I want/need.",
            "Go with 12r if the battery is your main concern (I have it, and the battery life is amazing (realistically speaking, got sot 9hrs after decent usage consisting of little games and a lot of browsing)\nGo with 12 if cameras are your main concern I guess (for me it's not, as I use cameras mostly to take pics of the paperwork/ a good scenery here and there... / Selfies every now and then ( selfie cam is not that good, but the primary camera on 12r is decent) I've been missing the periscope camera, but that isn't a thing that I need, it's just a thing that I feel would be a good addition to me \ud83d\ude02)\nI don't think you and me would notice the difference between 8gen 2 and 3 Unless you got ocd for specs lol",

My phone is constantly getting hot, I sit in the car all day for work and sometimes put my phone on the passenger seat for a few minutes and it will bake in the sun. On top of fast charging which im sure doesn't help. Battery Guru will notify me whenever the battery temp reaches about 35c.
