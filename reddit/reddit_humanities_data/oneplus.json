            "Should I got with the OnePlus 12R around 800 AUD or ZTE nubia Z60 Ultra which is 870$ or are there any alternatives within the price range of 700 to 800 AUD ?",
            "I've got a Redmi Note 10 5G. Would it be worth upgrading to the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite? (Sale + discount means I can get it for ~160 instead of full price). \n\nNord CE 4 Lite is just outside my budget (200).",

            "12R is crap. I have it",
            "I have settle with the xiaomi 13 ultra lol",
            "I see so many reports of older oneplus models being better than the new ones, makes me wonder if that's what I should buy. For an upgrade from my 6 year old phone I wouldn't bother looking at any 2+ year old Samsungs but it seems that doesn't apply to oneplus.",
            "Well I can from the 8T. It is an expensive side-grade. I don't do a lot of RAM intensive stuff so I don't notice any sort of speed or performance boost and the camera is worse. I did not think I would dislike the curved screen but I do. \n\nThe dimensions are so freaking similar but something about the phone (maybe it's the case?) makes typing, especially when holding with one hand very inaccurate.\n\nJust my personal experience",

            "Out of those three I would get the 10t, but my priorities would be a flat display, performance and battery life. The 10t has the Snapdragon 8 plus gen 1, which trounces the other two phones in power efficiency. Reasons to avoid  would be no alert slider and only the main camera is really any good.",
            "Easily 10 Pro, out of all the devices mentioned 10 Pro is better in most of the specs!",
            "If OP is gonna buy 10 pro or 10t, might as well just get the 12R for an extra hundo and enjoy the latest release with the SD8gen2.. I wouldn't suggest getting 9 or 10 with the 12R price point being quite affordable",
            "Green line issue was very common on that device. \nGot a 9 pro for 1.5 years then green line happened.",
            "Thanks, never knew there was such issue.\n\nI guess I'm one of the lucky ones, I have it since release and haven't had any issues so far. Other than the battery draining faster since I got the one plus watch 2 a few months ago.",
            "Snapdragon 888 is a battery leaker and runs hot as well as only less than 1 year of updates left\n\nSnapdragon 8 gen 1 in 10 Pro is better but not as good as newer chips, if you like a really capable camera go for 10 Pro.\n\nIf camera is not the most important factor then definitely get the 10T because of snapdragon 8+ gen 1 and better charging speeds and battery life",

            "No clue about the 12R but the 12 is a beast and lasts all day, into the next. And the best part is the 30 minute charging from 0 to 100.",
            "If you don't trust the tests where people literally have both phones then idk how you're gonna be able to trust replies that only have one of the phones. Just check videos from reputable creators.",
            "I went for 12r. I know 12 is better in many ways but I got a good deal with the edu discount and could get 16gb/256gb one for $400. It's been just a week but so far I really like it. Playing Wuthering waves @max 60hz for 2hours and no fps drop was wild. Tried Genshin Impact for an hour and got solid 60fps too. Fast charging is crazy. I have not changed my phone while sleeping at all. Just plugging in the charger about 15-20min in the morning gives me a whole day battery. First 2days phone was pretty hot for most of the time and the battery drained fast but that was android learning/apps not optimized. from day 3 everything got better and feels like it is getting better at this moment too. I would go for 12 if my budget was higher though.",
            "If you want the latest and greatest from OnePlus with no compromises, wireless charging and better screen/cameras then go for the 12. If you want value, great performance with some compromises then go with the 12R. I plan to keep my phone for more than 2 years so I wanted to spend the money and get everything I want/need.",
            "12 user here, battery lasts all day even with heavy usage. I sometimes overcharge my phone (plugged in for longer than I shud after it hit 100%), then I would use it to see that 100% lasts nearly an hour lmao. Higher consumption if u have audio playing thru the speakers and lots of screen swiping. \n\nI once charged my phone overnight, woke up, went to the gym, worked out while listening to music thru my Bluetooth headphones, social media swiping etc. and came back home with 100% remaining  lmao. It's a short 30 min workout session but still.",
            "Go with 12r if the battery is your main concern (I have it, and the battery life is amazing (realistically speaking, got sot 9hrs after decent usage consisting of little games and a lot of browsing)\nGo with 12 if cameras are your main concern I guess (for me it's not, as I use cameras mostly to take pics of the paperwork/ a good scenery here and there... / Selfies every now and then ( selfie cam is not that good, but the primary camera on 12r is decent) I've been missing the periscope camera, but that isn't a thing that I need, it's just a thing that I feel would be a good addition to me )\nI don't think you and me would notice the difference between 8gen 2 and 3 Unless you got ocd for specs lol",
            "12R the \"hey google\" doesn't work for most people. Don't know about the 12.",
            "12 has the better battery life, mainly because the newer SoC is more efficient. The 12r has a slightly larger battery though, at 5500mAH (100mAH more).",
            "You can get a full day np with heavy use... When you turn off all these on top functions that are not necessary IMO you can get 2 days... Full HD res. and 60Hz is enough for a mobile screen... i dont play games so i choose the extra battery for basically something i wont even notice.",
            "I think both phones batteries are very good, you won't see a massive amount of difference between them. It all depends on how you use the phone yourself, but both will easily get you through a full day without any issues."
