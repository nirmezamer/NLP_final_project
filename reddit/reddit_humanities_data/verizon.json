Multiple lines would have the same account number.",

            "I\u2019m honestly just astounded at how poor a handle Verizon had on the communications surrounding this. Did they ever release any actual information about what was going on? Their customer service seemed to be completely in the dark throughout most of it, and when they finally caught on they just kind of shrugged and said \u201cour technical people are looking into it, trust us we are as frustrated as you.\u201d \ud83d\ude10\n\nLike I get that this isn\u2019t a Verizon thing, but shouldn\u2019t they have been able to pinpoint the dependency and communicate that out to customers, along with information about eSIM alternatives?\n\nEven this Syniverse press release is incredibly vague. When such a large outage happens for cloud providers, for example, customers expect detailed technical post mortems with info on what happened and what steps are being taken to prevent it from happening in the future. All we\u2019re getting here is \u201cthing broke, now a little better but still kinda brokey, it\u2019s hard guys, we\u2019re trying we promise.\u201d",
            "I think Verizon didn't release a statement because it was probably their very last suspicion. On top of that the complete outage for me didn't take effect until Thursday morning. I was in and out of service all Wednesday and then I've had nothing since Thursday and still have no service. It's hard to pinpoint something like this when 1. Your company doesn't have a 100% grasp on that area of telecomms and 2. People reporting at first didn't mention they were roaming, but rather they just had no service which is what I assumed at first is that it wasn't Verizon, it was an issue with the cell towers here.\n\nI think Verizon is in the dark or was rather and it's better to stay quiet then release something false \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe while its frustrating it's also not Verizon's fault, entirely. It is good this happened though as hopefully it will coax Verizon into looking into backup plans for the future and also it will HOPEFULLY force the FCC to look into why and how syniverse controls global roaming for the 3 biggest carriers in the US and who knows how many others around the world.",

            "Not a single word to apologize. What an awful company. I hope the fcc fines them for this.",
            "Usual corporate speak.  Says nothing meaningful.",
            "Verizon is always awful with communication. They don't even communicate when there is targeted, scheduled maintenance.",
            "All of the big 3 carriers are experiencing this outage and guess what none of them have come out to make statements because it\u2019s a minuscule problem affecting a small amount of entitled people that won\u2019t shut up on reddit about a problem they have ZERO control over.",
