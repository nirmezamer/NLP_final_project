            "Is there anything I can do to help my zinnias that have been chewed up by earwigs? Should I even keep watering them if all of the leaves are destroyed?",
            "Going through a rough patch the last couple of months and my garden has taken a beating. I've been successful at propagating my 2 types of passion vine (fruiting and non fruiting) my honeysuckle is ok and thriving, my star jasmine looks a little beat up.\n\nHas anyone had success propagating star jasmine in dirt by clipping off a few node lengths and burying it? Any tips would help! I tried searching this sub and there's a lot of different jasmines and not too much interaction. Maybe even clipping and putting in water? That's what has worked the best for passion vine but I know every plant is different.",
            "Yes, keep watering!  Zinnias are excellent at making a comeback",
            "I think the answer depends on whether you plan a vegetable garden or flowers.  I'd be concerned about using unknown source of top soil for a vegetable garden... of course environmental concerns vary greatly based on  where you live.  Assuming a flower garden, you could use it and also buy some organic soil to add to the mix.  If a veggie garden, maybe a soil test would help you decide?",
            "the garden in my home was looking more like dirt and less like soil. so i found someone online giving away TOPSOIL... I apparently have confused it for Black earth top soil.\n\nnow that i realize my mistake i'm planning on using it to create a whole new section of gardening. huzzah. \n\nquestions\n\nit is still useful for me to use the topsoil to add a layer on my existing garden? or should i bite the bullet and buy real compost/whatnot for that?\n\nDo i use the topsoil as a bottom base for my new garden (how confusing) or do i have to  mix in some other medium in the process? or is it realy ment to go 'on top'. if so. what goes under it? \n\n  \ni'll take some suggestions as to what i can do with all this top soil.",
            "I'm having trouble with voles(???) eating my giant allium bulbs, or sometimes they eat right through the stem just above the bulb. Any advice?\n\nI know \"critter resistant\" doesn't mean 100% critter-proof, and certainly they're safer than tulips would be, but I was gobsmacked when my gentle giants started toppling. \n\nThanks!!!",
            "I have about 1/4 acre of land in my backyard where wild brush and weeds grow every year. I have sprayed with glyphosate and cut them with a weedwhacker/brush cutter yearly since buying the property but I'm looking for a more permanent solution to perhaps turn it into a real yard. Any suggestions?

            "Probably measuring how much they need",
            "Not sure when this picture is taken - looks like fall or winter somewhere without snow. It seems as though the bags are holding down a layer of leaf debris? - could be insulation from winter temps and protecting bulbs from curious critters. Certainly an easier solution than wire mesh and approximately 1 billion garden staples, if that is the case. Could also be hoping for some breakdown of the leaves for a natural leaf mulch to form before they put down bark mulch in the spring.",

            "Youre correct.\n\nNeeds to be at least 3 bags thick.",
            "That is the time release version, like prescription pills. Just keeping the tree tummies from getting upset.",
            "Lmao, actually its not a terrible idea. Starve the grass and weeds of light and oxygen, prevents continued germination and growth of the plants, makes it easier to pull up before laying down a barrier then mulching. My grandma would do this for 2 ish weeks before mulching and it was always a breeze.",
            "This is actually a legitimate technique for smothering weeds before putting down mulch.",
