            "Hoping someone might be able to lend some insight into what's going on with this blue salvia. I bought three plants (presumably all the same...) late last summer and planted them in the yard. The existing stems were pretty wimpy and all died/fell off over fall/winter, but they came back surprisingly strong. Now that they're coming in, two look bushy, green, and healthy, while the third is looking pretty sad and wilty. They're all in roughly the same area, probably get the same amount of light, and they all get watered at the same time, more or less the same amount. At first I thought it looked maybe over-watered, so I tried to cut back and kind of watered around it. Didn't really show improvement over a couple days, and I also read that leaves tend to curl up when underwatered, so now I'm watering it again, but it still looks about the same. Soil doesn't seem wet or mushy. Pretty sandy/dry sticking my finger in an inch or so down. So... I dunno.\n\nIs there something more I should be doing? Is it just genetics? Also, the other two salvias have real wide, fat leaves, but this one has narrow, spindly leaves. Genetics again, or maybe I bought a different variety by mistake?\n\nOh, it basically gets full sun and I'm in zone 7b. Low humidity, dry, has been high 80s, low 90s the last couple weeks, brief cold front aside.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o8vthg1y2y7d1.jpeg?width=3072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=15bbd98c034289c5228b8b8c4b3ba870a6e6c151",
            "I'm Minnesota zone 4 with a ton of direct sun, and the plants that seem to thrive best in my yard are native sunflowers, coneflowers, and goldenrod. Any suggestions for plants that might enjoy my conditions but that bloom earlier in the season? I'm basically bloomless until mid-July when everything pops off at once",
            "What do I do about all this (maybe) purslane that's emerged in my raised beds? For context, I moved into this new place less than a month ago, and just barely had time to amend the soil of these raised beds and pull approximately five million weeds before planting in them. It seems that my turning over awoke a dormant seed bank, and now we have what looks like purslane all over. Will this be a problem for the plants, including the basil that I planted from seed? And if so, how should I deal with it so that I don't harm the peppers, beans, tomatoes and tomatillos that are in here? Photo for reference, it's quite dense in this bed especially.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j58kxyn1vy7d1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f6cd8456480ef108400e56611f1daaa241edee8",
            "posted this comment at the tail end of the last thread, will remove it if it counts as spam \n\nRecently moved into an apartment with fairly large back yard and have been wanting to start gardening so I figured this would be great time to start. I already planted some beans as I read they\u2019re a good choice. I probably should\u2019ve thought about this before but I\u2019m worrying if this area is too shady. So I was wondering did I screw up and plant something that won\u2019t survive? And what suggestions would you guys have for new additions that would fit will into this area\n\nPictures were taken at approximately noon\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/yard-photos-jfFpX0f](https://imgur.com/a/yard-photos-jfFpX0f)\n\nI'm in eastern Pennsylvania, zone 7a",

The plant is a river birch and it's located in Southern Maine. They definitely don't look like they're part of the leaf, and there are a ton of them!~~\n\n  \nSolved thanks to u/scotty\\_beams ! \"Those are leaf galls of one of the eriophyid mites (\u2192 Gall and Rust Mites,\u00a0[Family Eriophyidae](https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/55584-Eriophyidae))\"",
            "I\u2019m at my wits end with the critters here (Pennsylvania zone 6b). I suspect squirrels and rabbits. They chew some - not all - my lilies, leaving just a stem. Others they dig in the soil/mulch and just leave holes in the ground. They dig up my creeping thyme and irises - apparently just for the fun of it because they aren\u2019t eating anything. I\u2019ve tried those cayenne pepper sprays and sprinkled red pepper flakes, but it doesn\u2019t keep them at bay for long. Is the anything at all that deters them? They\u2019re such jerks! Do I have to build little chicken wire fences around everything?",
            "Does anyone else here struggle with kneeling to weed/plant/mulch/whatever? I am getting the WORST head rushes, even if I'm only squatting down for a minute. I'm fine while squatting but as soon as I stand back up I get slammed with fuzzy head, vision going dark, face feels flushed, and heart beats like crazy. Then like 30 seconds later I'm fine. I don't have any DX medical conditions (tested for POTS 8 years ago, tilt test negative). If anyone else gets this I'd love to know how you garden around it or if you've ignored it, whether it was fine or got worse. I'm afraid I'm going to pass out \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
            "Can someone help me get a better understanding of different fertilizers? \n\nI recently got all my plants into pots with a raised bed/container mix that came premixed with some nutrients. The bag said N=0.3% P=0.1% K=0.1%. \n\n  \nI've read that in containers fertilizing every 2 weeks or so is a good idea so that was my plan for this weekend. \n\nI've seen recommendations for a few different brands of things but I'm a bit confused by the NPK.\n\nIn one case, Neptunes Harvest Tomato and Veg solution, the NPK is listed as 2-4-2. Then I looked at Miracle-Gro performance organics edibles mix and the NPK is MUCH higher at 9-4-12. Those are the extremes but other mixes have been 5-7-3, 4-4-4, etc. \n\nMy question is why is there such a wide range here? I don't want to go overboard but I also don't want to under fertilize. \n\nAt this point I think I'm supposed to prioritize the nitrogen to encourage plant growth over flowering (I've got tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers) so I'm just trying to figure out what the best thing I should add is and how best to do it. \n\nThanks!",
