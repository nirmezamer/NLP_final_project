        "content": "Here\u2019s a list of common questions posted that usually have the same solution.\n\n**\u201cWhy won\u2019t my Ethernet cable plug into the weird looking Ethernet jack?\u201d or \u201cWhy is this Ethernet jack so skinny?\u201d**\n-UTP cable used for Ethernet transmission is usually terminated with an RJ45 connector. This is an 8 conductor plug in the RJ series of connectors. You\u2019ll find similar looking jacks which are used to plug in a landline phone. These jacks could be an RJ11, RJ14, or RJ25 which are 4 or 6 wire jacks. This will not work with your RJ45 cable for Ethernet. \n\nRefer to these sources to identify the type of jack you have.\n\nhttps://www.digikey.com/en/articles/understanding-and-specifying-modular-connectors\n\nhttps://www.diffen.com/difference/RJ11_vs_RJ45\n\n**\u201cIs this Ethernet?\u201d or \u201ccan I convert this to Ethernet\u201d or \u201cwhat category cable do I need\u201d**\n-Fortunately many homes built in the 21st century use cat 5e cable and use 2 or 3 of the twisted pairs for phone use. (This is where you\u2019d see the 4 or 6 pin RJ connectors). However not every build used 8 conductor so if you have less than 8 conductors and 4 twisted pairs. You will need to look into other methods of getting your lan from A to B. \n\nAs far as choosing the type of cable you need, look into cat 5e, cat 6, or cat 6a. Building your home network you most likely don\u2019t need cat 7 or 8. If you don\u2019t know the exact reason you need cat 7 or 8 you don\u2019t need them because these standard typically aren\u2019t used to access the internet.\n\nInformation for reference for UTP cabling \n\nhttps://stl.tech/blog/what-is-a-utp-cable/#Different_Categories_of_UTP_cable\n\n**I bought this flat cat 8 cable from Amazon but I\u2019m only getting 50 Mbps**\n\n-Sorry but it\u2019s become a common issue of Chinese companies putting out cable that don\u2019t meet its category\u2019s specs. Try to return it and go to your local store that sells computer stuff and get one there. On top of that cat 7 and 8 patch cable will not do you any good you will not get any benefit even if you are paying for the best internet available.\n\n**Helpful resources:**\n\n[Terminating cables](https://www.truecable.com/blogs/cable-academy/how-to-terminate-an-unshielded-pass-through-rj45-connector)\n\n[Understanding internet speeds](https://www.comparitech.com/internet-providers/internet-and-broadband-terms-explained/)\n\n[Home network structure examples](https://lazyadmin.nl/home-network/home-network-diagram/)\n\n[Wired connection alternatives to UTP Ethernet](https://www.techreviewer.com/tech-answers/moca-vs-powerline/)\n\n[Understanding WiFi](https://www.duckware.com/tech/wifi-in-the-us.html)\n\n\nIf anyone has other FAQs to add I can add that to the post.",

            "A FAQ is a good concept, but yours is already long enough that a typical new poster here won't bother reading it.  \n\nEveryone wants personalized attention, not to poke around a huge FAQ with tons of links and reading that feels like homework.  \n\nEveryone also wants personal confirmation that their problem is not some kind of special exception by having a human review it.  \n\nAny FAQ that's like ten pages or more including links will be read as much as those online \"Service Agreement\" terms everyone auto-agrees to without even a glance.  It's just too idealistic to require every new poster to read a huge FAQ before participating.\n\nA real solution could also be a FAQ teaching people how to Search this sub for previously answered questions, of which just about everything has been covered extensively.  It'd be much shorter, where you list the common problems, and just list the key words to search for (\"moca\", \"access point\", \"Tailscale\", etc.) But that will be completely ignored too.  People want to talk about their issues with a human, not an automated response robot.\n\nAlso, it's weird you chose 50 Mbps as the arbitrary number for a low speed test when 96-100 Mbps due to a bad cable or punch down is by far one of the most posted topics on here.",
