I bet that Remnant is the name of a band in the \u201cLore-fi\u201d universe, that we\u2019ll hear some music from when it eventually comes out. The font looks similar to a band\u2019s font, we first see the name on, what looks like, a concert ticket. Finally, Lore-fi girl has it as her computer background.",
