You also need the plug in downloaded but should be prompted when installing the game into joiplay that'll redirect you to the proper site. \n\nAlso 5.1.3.3 isn't workable that I could see so I  downloaded 4.9.2. And it worked fine.",

This is megaman (Tech Manager). I just wanted to quick post about the new App Installer I developed for our game. It can be downloaded here: [Google Doc Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16SFlTtsgPEy-YKCBvuWuffymI6Rl0emyq-jcU9PYB5k/edit#heading=h.b67hha4nbt5i)  \n\n\nThis installer is an All-in-1 solution to installing the game. It also acts like a launcher if you link your game or install the game through it. I also added in features to let you know when an update to the game is available and when new sprites are available to install (even before monthly releases).  \n\n\nI recommend giving the Installer a try and I am available in the #tech-support channel in discord to answer any questions, suggestions, or feedback about the installer or game. \n",
