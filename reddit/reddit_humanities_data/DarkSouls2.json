        "content": "Margaret (u/GreatStarryWisdom), a community member from the dark souls discord server and Blue Acolyte beta-tester, just made this [clutch steam guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3219839402). Please favorite it so it gets more views. I\u2019ll also be pasting the text here.\n\n\n\u201cThere is currently a player force-injecting illegal items into people's inventories, causing the game to crash.\n\nFirst, I would recommend anyone reading this install the \"Blue Acolyte\" mod off of the Nexus page, or the github fork. I will provide a link to the Nexus page at the end of this post. This mod protects you from malicious cheats such as crashes and save bricking. You should *always* be using Blue Acolyte, and you leave your save at risk if you don't.\n\nMAKE SURE YOU ARE OFFLINE BEFORE FOLLOWING THIS GUIDE. This can be done by navigating to the top left of the steam client, clicking \"Steam\" > \"GO OFFLINE\". To go back online, simply repeat these steps.\n\nIt appears that the only way to remove these items currently is to use the public Cheat Engine table, which can be acquired from GitHub which I will also link at the end of this post. I do not recommend downloading tables found through Google searches, as these are most likely to contain malicious code that could damage your system or game files. \n\nMake sure you have the current build of Cheat Engine installed (version 7.4 as of 4/12/2024). To remove the items, launch Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin, and load the affected character. Next, open the Cheat Engine table(DS2_SotFS_Bob_Edition.CT), and it will automatically link to your active instance of Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin. In the lower section, click \"Open - Table v4.7.4\" > \"Scripts\" > \"Misc\" > \"+14 Crash Protection\". Once this is enabled, this will prevent the game from crashing due to the +14 Bleed Daggers in your inventory. From here, you should now be able to go in and remove them. To hasten the process, select one of the items, and hit \"Discard Selected\", and you can mass select the items to be discarded.\n\nIf this does not work, feel free to message me and we can work on another solution.\n\nDS2_SotFS_Bob_Edition.CT GitHub Fork\nhttps://github.com/boblord14/Dark-Souls-2-SotFS-CT-Bob-Edition\n\nBlue Acolyte\nhttps://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls2/mods/998?tab=description\n\nIF YOU ENCOUNTER THIS PLAYER AGAIN, OR ANY PLAYERS COMMITTING SIMILAR ACTS, PLEASE REACH OUT TO ME.\u201d\n\nThe player doing this is now on Blue Acolyte\u2019s global block list.",

            "Had 200 +15 bleed daggers added to my inventory by a guy and when i booted up my game from crashing he joined and gave me another 200. Maybe if im lucky ill get up to 600. Anywho thank you for the post",
            "My gf was watching me and all of a sudden I fly in the air and have 200+ bleeding daggers inserted in my inventory and die by an invader named \u201cTest\u201d. She goes \u201cgood thing you\u2019re running a fist build\u201d\ud83d\ude02",

            "This worked perfectly, and also easy to do. Now I have Blue Acolyte as well because I knew for a fact that a depressing hacker would just invade again, and in fact he did, but now he got kicked immediately, with a huge middle finger, pathetic, but I do have a question, how does the 'kicking' works? Does it affect the soft-ban multiplayer of the game like whenever players disconnect from invasions?",
            "You guys are the best. Thank you.",
            "i was gonna just quit because i'm so unfamiliar with modding, but i gave this a shot and it worked in minutes. thank you :\\]",

            "I think bee lining from building to building is kinda safer?\n\nI killed the reindeers everytime. I think they were a total of 9 or 12 and they stopped respawning until a bonfire usage. (Or maybe they stopped respawning for good since it definitely must've taken me more than 12 tries)\n\nI used Warmth to heal since I was roleplaying as a hexy pyro dexterity pirate.\n\nHaven't done it with Company of Champions though, so Venny (it was Vengarl iirc?) was my summon. We ended up killing the boss.",
            "At least when i make it to the two cats there's a chance I can win, not a chance if I can miss the swipes into cornhole game BoC likes to play",
            "The reason for that is because not many people play this area. It's an optional area in an optional DLC, and we all despise and try to avoid it for the most part lol. You'd be surprised of how many people don't play the DLC of these games. Most seem to just want to \"beat dark souls\" to say that they did and then move on to another game. Bed of Chaos is a mandatory boss unlike this one, so everybody needs to fight that one no matter what. \n\nThis theory also explains why O&S were considered the hardest Fromsoft boss for so long. They are hard but bosses like Manus or Fume Knight are arguably much harder. And I'm not talking about my experience or yours in your first playthrough. Just compare the damage they do, the health pool they have and the complex moveset they have and it's easy to see that those 2 will give more problems to most builds than O&S. But they are in a DLC. Now think how many \"mandatory\" bosses in DS2 are harder than O&S?",
            "I always cheat in this area, and I don't feel bad about it. What were they thinking with these areas? All the dlcs have one of these, 2nd has 2. I understand that they wanted players to summon people to traverse these areas, but solo players have it rough",
            "This was such a nooby runback lol",
            "This argument would be valid if it wasn't for the fact its an optional boss in one of three dlcs. Don't get me wrong I agree entirely, but bed of chaos was a mandatory gimic boss in an unfinished area of the game. In retrospect there are quite a few God awful souls bosses for many different reasons so it's quite hard to pin down the worst with such large and varied types of badness. This is definitely up there tho.",
            "Iron Passage, Cave of the Dead & Frigid Outskirts are designed exclusively for playing in co-op. The summonable NPCs have their hps and defences adjusted if one has to play offline.\n\nAdditionally, these were also intended as a \"trial\" thing for those who had not bought the dlcs.\n\nAlso, Frigid Outskirts is a whole level in itself. DeS, DS1, DS2, BB actually had levels to play in. DS3 is just a glorified boss-rush game with a combat even shallow than DS1, and that entire crowd now always looks for the \"bosses\" instead of the levels.\n\nAlso also, Bed of Chaos has a pretty short runback from the hidden bonfire. But players insist by themselves to always use the Daughters of Chaos bonfire and then complain about the high damage titanite demon and the boring long runback.\n\nAlso also also, co-op is not some abnormal thing to use in a game which provides 2 different soapstones for it. It is people like OP, because of whom people now rarely engage in co-op or pvp, leading to even more thinning of the online activity.",
            "This is the only boss I broke my no summoning rule to beat. One of my runs Manhunter O'Harrah miraculously made it all the way to the fog gate and we beat the boss pretty easily. Before that I had a run where I went in solo, got the last cat to enrage hp threshold, but lost because I started the fight with only four estus flasks. All I can say is, never again.",
            "The main difference is that ds1 was not designed to have shitty runbacks so bad of chaos stood out.\n\nDs2 is known for having shitty runbacks (runback is harder than the boss itself almost with all bosses) so this is just another shitty runback amongy sea of shitty runbacks."
