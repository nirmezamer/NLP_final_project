        "content": "Hello everyone!\n\nA few weeks ago, we\u2019ve updated our ruleset and we\u2019ve realized we haven\u2019t officially announced these changes. So here we go!\n\nWith the series now finished in both manga and anime, we expect this to be the final rule update, unless a new project in this universe is announced somewhere down the line. While the activity will inevitably go down over time, we still want to keep this subreddit active as a place to discuss and enjoy everything surrounding this franchise.\nYou can find our updates rules in the sidebar, as well as our extended rule explanations and information in the [Full Rule Documentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/wiki/rules). \n\nSince the series has concluded, we've removed most of the spoiler rules, revised other miscellaneous ones for an updated definition, and removed any that didn't seem applicable anymore (such as the Fan Ending rule). To summarise the most important changes:\n\n**1. Spoiler Requirements**\n\nAs the series has finally concluded, enforcing spoiler rules would become more tedious and run the risk of killing activity if we removed too many posts due to untagged spoilers. Due to this, we've removed the automatic spoiler tag on most flair, and we also do not require users to tag their spoilers anymore. Users are still free to manually add a spoiler tag to their posts, and we reserve the right to spoiler tag posts with very explicit spoiler images.\n\nThere are two exceptions to this: Rule Number 2, or the 'Spoilers in Title' rule will still remain in effect for the subreddit. This is to prevent first-time watchers and users who view this subreddit randomly recommended from being instantly spoiled on major plot events, characters or deaths later in the series. The second exception is in regards to intentionally sending spoilers to users who have made it clear that they are not caught up. Doing this will still result in an immediate ban.\n\n**2. Content Quality Guidelines**\n\nWith the series over, we\u2019ve relaxed some of our previous minimum content requirements. However, we do not want the subreddit to be dominated by low-effort memes, AI-generated content or circlejerks, so we do still require a minimum amount of effort put into posts. \n\n**3. Conduct Rules**\n\nOur conduct rules remain in place mostly unchanged. We still want this subreddit to be a place for good-faith engagement and constructive discussions. We don\u2019t want it to turn into a battlefield, and we don\u2019t want to embolden users who deliberately want to create drama and a hostile atmosphere.\n\nHave any questions/feedback on our new rules, or the subreddit in general? Ask below, and we\u2019ll try to help!\nShinzou wo Sasageyo!",

Should that still be spoiler tagged if it shows something huge from the final episode? Even if it's part of a meme?",
            "It looks like crossposting isn't allowed, what are your thoughts on enabling that? Or also I could be doing something wrong...but found a good one I wanted to use crossposting for rather than a basic link.",
            "Since those are just one-off releases, we are not going to make any rule changes for them. We'll probably sticky a release thread, but that will be all.",
            "Yes, we prefer them to be spoiler tagged in that case, and as stated above, may manually add a spoiler tag if a post gains traction and is likely to be recommended to users from other subreddits.",
            "Interesting, I myself wasn't aware we had crossposting still disabled. I've turned it on for now, let's see what will come of it.",
            "Looks like it's going pretty well so far. Thanks!"
