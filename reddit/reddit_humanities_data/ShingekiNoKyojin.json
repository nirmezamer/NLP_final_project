        "content": "Hello everyone!\n\nA few weeks ago, we\u2019ve updated our ruleset and we\u2019ve realized we haven\u2019t officially announced these changes. So here we go!\n\nWith the series now finished in both manga and anime, we expect this to be the final rule update, unless a new project in this universe is announced somewhere down the line. While the activity will inevitably go down over time, we still want to keep this subreddit active as a place to discuss and enjoy everything surrounding this franchise.\nYou can find our updates rules in the sidebar, as well as our extended rule explanations and information in the [Full Rule Documentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/wiki/rules). \n\nSince the series has concluded, we've removed most of the spoiler rules, revised other miscellaneous ones for an updated definition, and removed any that didn't seem applicable anymore (such as the Fan Ending rule). To summarise the most important changes:\n\n**1. Spoiler Requirements**\n\nAs the series has finally concluded, enforcing spoiler rules would become more tedious and run the risk of killing activity if we removed too many posts due to untagged spoilers. Due to this, we've removed the automatic spoiler tag on most flair, and we also do not require users to tag their spoilers anymore. Users are still free to manually add a spoiler tag to their posts, and we reserve the right to spoiler tag posts with very explicit spoiler images.\n\nThere are two exceptions to this: Rule Number 2, or the 'Spoilers in Title' rule will still remain in effect for the subreddit. This is to prevent first-time watchers and users who view this subreddit randomly recommended from being instantly spoiled on major plot events, characters or deaths later in the series. The second exception is in regards to intentionally sending spoilers to users who have made it clear that they are not caught up. Doing this will still result in an immediate ban.\n\n**2. Content Quality Guidelines**\n\nWith the series over, we\u2019ve relaxed some of our previous minimum content requirements. However, we do not want the subreddit to be dominated by low-effort memes, AI-generated content or circlejerks, so we do still require a minimum amount of effort put into posts. \n\n**3. Conduct Rules**\n\nOur conduct rules remain in place mostly unchanged. We still want this subreddit to be a place for good-faith engagement and constructive discussions. We don\u2019t want it to turn into a battlefield, and we don\u2019t want to embolden users who deliberately want to create drama and a hostile atmosphere.\n\nHave any questions/feedback on our new rules, or the subreddit in general? Ask below, and we\u2019ll try to help!\nShinzou wo Sasageyo!",

            "Would that include stuff like the new art book and bad boy story?",
            "It looks like crossposting isn't allowed, what are your thoughts on enabling that? Or also I could be doing something wrong...but found a good one I wanted to use crossposting for rather than a basic link.",
            "For some reason when i make a normal post and have a spoiler tag on it my post still get's banned, is that like a rule i didn't see or is it an accident",
            "Since those are just one-off releases, we are not going to make any rule changes for them. We'll probably sticky a release thread, but that will be all.",
            "Yes, we prefer them to be spoiler tagged in that case, and as stated above, may manually add a spoiler tag if a post gains traction and is likely to be recommended to users from other subreddits.",
            "Interesting, I myself wasn't aware we had crossposting still disabled. I've turned it on for now, let's see what will come of it.",
            "Looks like it's going pretty well so far. Thanks!",
            "Thanks man",

Should that still be spoiler tagged if it shows something huge from the final episode? Even if it's part of a meme?",
            "I just made this new account because I cannot change my username on my old account sadly (I hate the autogenerated username so much) and I'm trying to post photos of my Junior High Hange cosplay on two subreddits but the posts keep getting removed. Hopefully I'll try to have luck on this this one."

            "To showcase the might and brutality of the beast titan at the time. So Isayama used the closest analogue to Captain Levi to show to the audience how capable the beast titan is.",
            "For me, it was showing us how no one is invincible, and establishing the new enemies as a greater threat. Miche was just below Levi in terms of skill I believe, and yet all it took was a single moment of surprise for him to be killed by low-grade titans. Who'd be the next character to die by a moment of hesitation: of shock? To be honest, I think its this death that made me fear for my favourites lol. The worst part was that he died alone, in agony, with only a mocking titan to witness his final resolve. He didnt go out in a blaze of glory and skill, but begging for his life, scared and helpless :(( this death made me really sad aaa",
            "people are saying to establish how smart / dangerous the beast titan was and I dont disagree but that was established with or without miche dying in the scene. Honestly when I first saw this my first thoughts were, no way the so called second only to Levi just got did that way. I feel like it was meant to emphasize just how far & away Levi was especially considering what he did to the beast titan later. Basically if literally anyone else was in this situation they wouldve died too.",
            "Everyone trying to protect Eren or his scout regiment were killed by Titans to reinforce Eren's sense of loss that was the tragic result of his decision to listen to his friends and rely on them instead of his own Titan strength.",

            "I remember watching this and thinking why dont they have a cyanide pill, gun with 1 bullet, or something they can take to not die this way",
            "Because they were not normal titans. Or it was a shock and awe to introduce us to aot in its new season after a break of 4 years (aot is a drama anime so it makes sense to introduce the new season with a dramatic death so its all gruesome and fancy with his body being torn apart in the shadow at the end).",
            "I think they knew we were desentized to the gruesome deaths in season 1, so they had to up the ante and make it absolutely brutal. Poor Miche, I got fucking chills when I saw that.",
            "I think that scout being yoyo-ed by the female titan had it worse or that mom being eaten by a regular sized titan"
