            "Absolutely not legitimate, and I'll try to reach out to them for more information. Their social media links are dead, they don't show up in ANY images searches. A dive into their terms of service seems like they've made up a country of legal origin.\n\nDoing a whois website origin search, they are registered to an icelandic country, and using a generic phone number that is defaulted by a lot of scam engine searches.\n\nSo, this appears to be an illegal scam, and everyone should avoid using it. I'll consult with the other mods to see what we can do, and other content creators to see how it should be approached.\n\nThanks for bringing this up!\n\nEdit: Their payment portal is not protected. Under no circumstances should anyone make a payment there, unless you feel like compromising your bank account.",
            "I am looking for suggestions for a map of a temple that once held a divine fountain, but is now overrun by sand. Ideally one I can out in a small dungeon, or which has enough rooms to be a small dungeon. I am happy to subscribe to a patreon of a creater to get necessary variants if the work looks good and fits the concept very well. Hopefully this is a good place to ask! Thanks!",
            "Hi, I have come across ad for mega map bundle. For advertised quality AND quantity it seems too good to be true. Also it's weird that I can't find any mention about that site.\n\n[ekingpacks.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlemaps/comments/1dlyx2x/comment/lagkp7s/?context=3)\n\nIs it legit? Thank you",
            "**Fantasy Map Commissions**  \nIf you're looking to get Fantasy World Maps, Town Maps, or Battle Maps of high quality and Resolution, made within a short span of time, then i'm the one you're looking for. You can commission me to make a map, and depending on how detailed you want it to be and the theme of the map, the price may vary. Each type of map has a Base Price, but the total price may increase depending on amount of detail, requests, etc. Either way, upon receiving payment the map will be finished within 1-3 days, less than 24 hours at my fastest.\n\nI do all of the following maps, however, Region, interior and Battle maps are my specialty, and as such are of higher quality, hence the higher base price. A specialty of mine are also replicas, essentially, a map you wish to be remade with more detail. A Replica map costs as much as the base price of that kind of map, plus an additional 5$ However, unless you choose to pick and Add-on, the price will not change from there on.\n\nAdditionally, if you decide to Commission 4 or more maps at a time, you will be given a minimum discount of 10% off the total price, though depending on your order this Discount might increase.\n\n*Base Prices* (Replica: +5$)  \nWorld Map: 15$  \nRegion Map: 20$  \nTown Map: 10$  \nBattle Map: 20$  \nInterior Map: 20$\n\n**Add-On Prices**  \n*Step-By-Step: 5$*  \nThis option will let you follow along the making of the map, allowing you to get notes on progression and the current look of the map.  \n*6k Resolution: 5$*  \n*8k Resolution: 10$*  \nNormal Maps will be rendered in 4k resolution, but adding either of these options will give you a map in a higher quality.  \n*No Watermark: 5$*  \nAll maps will be made with a watermark of my name, however, using this option will give you the map without the watermark.\n\nPayment is done through PayPal, half of the total cost is paid in advance and the rest is paid once the map has been complete and sent to you. If you're not happy with the map, then you can either pay to have it remade, or keep the other half of your payment, giving you the map for half the original price.\n\nIf you wish to put in a commission or want to see some of my work, then just DM me and we can talk further. I hope to get a message from you!\n\n[All previous maps commissioned from me!](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1djT0Z08g-NkfxeLsxMncKy1wxfro3sou?usp=sharing)",
            "Hey there! So, short and sweet, i got my hands on Dungeon Alchemist, however, i am not too good at using it yet, so i'm taking on cheap commissions to help me improve. The software allows me to work pretty fast, so the commissions will probably get done within one or two days.\n\nI can only do Battle, Dungeon and Building interior maps, not world or town maps! The price for a map is only 10$, cheap, like i said. The cost is paid in advance using Paypal.\n\nIf you're interested, then please DM me!\n\n[Sample mini dungeon](https://i.imgur.com/QQrudLT.jpg)",

We recommend having the dragon perform a Dangerous Maneuver once per turn to try to throw the party off its back.\n* The typical breath attack of any dragon can hit the party; the dragon just needs to use its attack and fly through them.\n* Tying yourselves to the dragon, the Fly spell, and other means to avoid falling will be essential for this battle.\n* The dragon\u2019s membranous wings are its most delicate part. Severely injuring them can cause the creature to crash, bringing the fight back to solid ground.\n* The Dragon\u2019s Lair Dungeon and Dragon Peak maps are perfect for encountering the dragon and as a prelude to this battle.\n\nOkay, we had a LOT of fun designing this map!\nThe dragon is one of the most iconic creatures in fantasy lore, and we thought fighting one right on its back would be an incredibly cool opportunity for those unforgettable sessions you\u2019ll always talk about with friends.\nIt\u2019s impossible not to create epic moments fighting atop a dragon arena xD\n\nWe\u2019ve created a special dragon design, with a back and tail wide and stable enough to \u201crealistically\u201d host a battle, and we hope you find it as cool as we do!\nWhat do you think?\nDo you like this map, and will you use it in your campaigns?\nWe can\u2019t wait to hear your feedback, so feel free to leave a comment and let us know what you think.\n\nAs always, we wish you great adventures and NAT20!\nThe Darkest Maps Team\n\nTo access this and other maps by Darkest Maps you can join our [Patreon](https://patreon.com/DarkestMaps)"
