A very short summary:\n\n-\tAll previous opt-outs and re-entablements of basic authentication are not valid anymore\n-\tIf you want to keep using basic auth in Exchange Online after October 1st, you must explicitly opt-out in September\n-\tBasic auth is getting disabled for any protocols not opted-out during September, starting October 1st\n-\tAll opt-outs (or later re-enablements) expire early January 2023\n\nIf you are still using basic authentication for any of affected protocols, you must take action in September and finish your migration to modern authentication by early January 2023.",

            "So I understand that this will break apps and what not that are using Basic Authentication.  The issue I'm coming across is I now have 5-6 end users that are using 365 desktop apps that are fully updated and it's now prompting them for their password nonstop but not taking it in  a standard Windows Security prompt rather than the MFA looking prompt.  I've tried everything to get it to prompt for the proper MFA prompt (new profile, reinstalling Office, removing credentials from Credential Manager, etc) and nothing has worked beyond creating an entirely new Windows profile.  Then it instantly works.  Anyone have a fix/workaround for this?",
            "I'm going to make billions of dollars with my new basic auth email service.\n\nBILLIONS. OF. DOLLARS.",
            "Feels like this has been delayed 3x",
            "At the risk of asking a dumb question, does this mean that when I go to the M365 Portal > Settings > Org Settings > Modern Authentication (under Services), that all the check boxes under \"Allow access to basic authentication protocols\" should be unchecked?\n\nBecause I just took a peek in my tenant and all those box are still checked. So does that mean I still have Basic authentication enabled?",
            "On Iphones this is easily fixed by Removing the account and readding it by using the sign in button instead of manually adding the credentials.   \nOtherwise let them install the outlook app.",
            "Can you advise if multifactor authentication will be forced when migrating to modern auth for office 365? We are using IMAP with four O365  mailboxes and we just converted to modern auth, however there is a concern that MFA will be forced at the account level for SMTP and IMAP. Thank you. Andrew",
            "Hi- I'm trying to figure out if users will be able to use other authenticator apps going forward",
            "Well wtf do i do now?",
            "I have a number of customers whose imap integration broke today. They were already configured for OAUTH!"

            "I have a user that had their motherboard replaced. Since the replacement their outlook kept asking to login. I've deleted their mail profile and upon rebuilding the profile the prompt for MFA doesn't appear this the account setup fails. Any idea as to the fix for this? I've reinstalled office 365, modified the registry to bypass cached auto discover entries, built a new windows profile on the same machine all without resolving the issue. You can see the setup flash quickly for the MFA window but then it fails to complete. Also, revoked allMFA sessions and reregistered MFA. Office.com login works without issue. Logging in as the same user on a different laptop also works. Anyone else ever experience this? Ty in advance!",
