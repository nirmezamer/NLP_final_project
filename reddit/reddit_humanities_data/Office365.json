A very short summary:\n\n-\tAll previous opt-outs and re-entablements of basic authentication are not valid anymore\n-\tIf you want to keep using basic auth in Exchange Online after October 1st, you must explicitly opt-out in September\n-\tBasic auth is getting disabled for any protocols not opted-out during September, starting October 1st\n-\tAll opt-outs (or later re-enablements) expire early January 2023\n\nIf you are still using basic authentication for any of affected protocols, you must take action in September and finish your migration to modern authentication by early January 2023.",

The issue I'm coming across is I now have 5-6 end users that are using 365 desktop apps that are fully updated and it's now prompting them for their password nonstop but not taking it in  a standard Windows Security prompt rather than the MFA looking prompt.  I've tried everything to get it to prompt for the proper MFA prompt (new profile, reinstalling Office, removing credentials from Credential Manager, etc) and nothing has worked beyond creating an entirely new Windows profile.

They would either crash or just not open at all. After trying to reinstall, I ran into an error where it would not let me reinstall at all.  Error Code: 30175-45 (8).  I tried everything. Most recommendations was to install Office through offline packages and PowerShell. Did not work either with same error code being thrown.  \n\n\n**HERE IS THE FIX:**  \n  \nOffice would not reinstall, because there were corrupted files / registry keys getting in the way. So,  \n- Use Revo Uninstall to uninstall Office, but make sure you choose Advanced Clean. And get rid of ALL the registry keys and files associated with Office. ALL of them. Then restart PC.  \n- Once back in, download SARA (Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant) and select Office, and \"having trouble uninstalling Office\"  \n- Once that is finished, restart PC again, and install Office via OfficeSetup.exe   \n\n\nAfter manyyy hours, this fix finally worked. I quite literally tried everything else before this. ",
