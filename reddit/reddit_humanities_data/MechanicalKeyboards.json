            "I doubt this will get an answer here, but here goes anyway;\n\nI recently bought an Attack Shark M87, it sounds and feels great, and the RGB features are bountiful, however, it seems the board wont turn itself off automatically when not in use? Is there a key combo to set the shutdown time?",
            "Hi I have an Akko PC75b Plus that was purchased like 3 years ago and the volume knob just works right out the box on my android phone, recently I just built on a LMK67 kit and even with the same phone I can't get the volume knob to work, even assigning keys to change volume up/down with VIA doesn't work on my Pixel 5, while everything is perfect on PC, is there any chance I can get volume/media control (either by keys or knob) to work on my phone?",
            "Im definitely new to the keyboard scene here on reddit so hello all. Im a cs student and find myself needing a keyboard to bring on the go (preferably mac and windows). My only issue is that i need something with silent switches as I tend to do my work in the library and cant be using a blue switch. Anything 75% or 80% will do as size isnt major as my backpack is a turtle shell. Thanks!",
            "Hello guys, I would like a budget low-profile keyboard that is more or less adequate in quality. I noticed that quite high-quality keyboards are now being made on the Chinese market, what models could you recommend? Prefer for games, linear switches",
            "Why nobody puts Shift keys next to spacebar? I don't mean 40%, ortholinear or ergo keyboards, just regular staggered QWERTY keyboard. I using keyboard with additional shift keys in the bottom row for five years and found it very convenient. But it still no PCBs, plates and keycaps for this layout. I have to using custom PCB and split spacebar made of 2u keycaps.",
            "Planning on doing my first budget from-scratch build soon. I've seen the Skyloong GK104PRO around aliexpress for a while now and the little screen they have that just plugs into the 6-key area where page up and whatnot would be. Wondering if anyone knows where I could buy that on its own. Wanna add it to my custom build.",
            "anyone know a good low profile 75 keyboard i can get that is customisable and has buttons or knobs for volume and those kind of things?",
            "I have never used an Alice layout keyboard. However, have you considered a split row staggered keyboard like the Keebio Quefrency or Nullbits Snap?",
            "The RGB on Keychron and Monsgeek boards can be toggled on/off.",
            "The RGB can be turned off in every QMK/VIA compatible PCB/keyboard, and it should work perfectly fine out of the box. I used a regular QMK PCB board with my iPad just fine (can't try the phone bc of lightning, yikes, and I'm not buying a cable just for that), so I'm sure Android phones aren't gonna be an issue."
