The temperature is almost never below 23-25 degrees and at the moment it's hitting 30 degrees with 50-60% humidity as well. We have no balcony and have side/roof windows only. \n\nIt's just too hot! Does anyone know if this is something I can address with the building agency? Or is there something I can do otherwise to reduce the heat somehow? We do open the windows when it cools down to allow for airflow but it builds back up again almost immediately after closing them and they don't even have blinds fitted. \n\nThank you in advance for your suggestions and your help!

This should not be in your responsability. Maybe they just forgot and if not, do let them know that the apartment reaches 30 degrees as you cant close out the sun. Its in their interest as well...",

It was a small apartment so I bought a ventilator, placed it in front of the window and opened everything so I had some air circulating because inside it would get almost more hot than outside. \n\nIn the new apartment (2.nd floor) i open everything at night and close in the morning with shades, the temperature remains a good 25\u00b0C",

            "Right now I have 70% humidity and 26-27C.. I am monitoring it and so far, the trick of shutting down blinds/not letting sun in during the day helps as well as a fan to circulate the air. Without that, inside would be hotter than outside. I m still considering a dehumidifier or portable ac.. still need to analyse which makes sense"

            "Ones that haven\u2019t been mentioned yet:\n\nKaffeemacher in Basel - LOVE their coffee. Incredible quality every year.\nBalloon Zurich - small roastery by some ex coffee world champs, pretty new business but loads of experience behind them\nVertical Roasters Zurich - female-owned roastery (quite unusual for the industry) who are very into long distance cycling and have pop-ups and sports-themed going ons\n\n\nI also adore Drip. The owners are really good guys and are conscientious with sourcing. And the coffee is 10/10 they are artists with roasting. Which reminds me to order some more coffee from them. \n\nThe coffee industry can be pretty unethical at times due to asymmetry of information and power between production at origin and roasting in Europe. Roasters often buy direct from importers who buy from producers, and don\u2019t usually have a lot of direct contact or a real relationship with producers. Even when a roaster lists the origin or farm on the package and claims they paid a fair price, the producer may not receive anything close to a fair price, if they went though an importer who may discourage direct contact and take a big cut themselves.\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t necessarily get better with speciality coffee, especially if the roasters don\u2019t buy enough coffee from producers (not enough volumes sold to fill a container) to establish a direct relationship. One example of speciality coffee industry distorting the market, is that a lot of specialty roasters in search for the most ~special coffee will not stay loyal to producers but will always seek out the newest trend and also often leave a producer high and dry after a bad harvest. And sometimes they influence producers into trying new processing methods which may not turn out well and could devalue an entire harvest. The financial risk in those situations tends to be entirely on the side of the producer instead of the roaster.\n\nAll this to say that I\u2019m especially a big fan of all those above for unusually good sourcing practices and being conscientious about their supply chain."
