I still think it is a good overview and I don't endorse other CIS publications that I haven't even read (and which these trolls like to invoke.)\n\nThe department of labor's [rfi](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/02/15/2024-03187/labor-certification-for-permanent-employment-of-foreign-workers-in-the-united-states-modernizing) has more details.\n\nPublic comment can be made [here](https://www.regulations.gov/document/ETA-2023-0006-0001/comment).\n\nThey specifically want comments to be relevant to [this](https://www.regulations.gov/document/ETA-2023-0006-0001) but let them know what you feel. BTW, the analysis there is nonsense. I don't have time to debunk it but anyway...\n\nRepost and share with any subreddits or worker advocacy venues that you can think of (college tech clubs, unions, congressional representatives...)",

            "Been in the same boat.  Given the number of people and your age, you should have 60-days under the WARN act, where you receive a paycheck and benefits from the company.  See if you can reschedule your surgery to take place before that time ends and go on short term disability if you need time off to heal.  You\u2019ll probably have a better outcome taking a serious rest to recover."

They found a sucker to buy it and these whizbangs bought it thinking they were going to make big money. \n\nTheir choice in a CEO was someone who had 0 experience in this type of business and was a buddy of one of the parent owners.  \n\nThe kids got their $ and ran. Then the whizbangs bought one of their competitors thinking they would capture the market but they didnt realize that they were only buying accounts of individuals my spouses company rejected due to prudent previous management measures. \n\nThen the whizbangs changed the product to market because they thought the old product was stuffy and stupid and the product owners were \"antiquated\". They didnt realize the old products were paying 60% of the bills.\n\nHey, lets go buy another competitor but not realize the company was one step next to BK. \n\nLong and short: Up to 150 people were let go in 2 phases. The company is up to $80M in debt and the CEO was on vacation when he had to make a mass call to the other remsining batch and tell them they were being let go.\n\nThings to note: If management is smug to older decision makers and rejects their ideas, run dont walk.

            "In \"the old days\" a CEO grew up on the floor within the company. That way they got to know the company and the product well and often had a heart for the people and the business and planned long term. Besides that they had proven their value over the years. Now, it's just about grabbing a fast buck and make off with it. Maybe they succeed or not in making money, but they certainly don't care one bit about the company nor the people.",
