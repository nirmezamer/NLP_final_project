            "People first \ud83d\ude44.  They all say that.  Very few deliver.  I would be to concerned over the manager not being in the HR ambush meeting.  Often the manager doesn\u2019t find out till it\u2019s happened/happening.  And don\u2019t count on him for anything (referencing see what I can do).  Ultimately,  at this point the severance should have already been agreed and signed off by the c-suite.  Meaning this manager you describe has zero say in the outcome.  \n\nI am a little unclear though.  Is today your last working day?  Meaning they gave you a non-work notice period?  If that\u2019s the case you should be cut off from all network access and you don\u2019t have any obligation to help.  \n\nUltimately, you don\u2019t have to do anything.  The coordination of these events is so secretive and impossible to manage.  Unless you are in a widget producing role, or customer facing every employee had a series of notes, trackers, project plans that will fall to the waste side as a result of the layoff.  \n\nPersonally, when I think of the end of the year bonuses paid out to the senior executives or c-suite I would not be able to take the high rode to help transition the work unless I had an agreement that altered being laid off to a future date.  \n\nI\u2019m genuinely sorry to hear about your situation.  \n\nSome quick pointers:\n1. Find a site that analyzes your resume based on the job description.  Your biggest hurdle will be the ATS (applicant tracking system) and their logic to auto decline candidates.  The site will provide you with two important insights.\n\nA. The hard skills phrases or words to use\nB. The soft skills they are looking for\n\n2. Used LinkedIn to find jobs.  Use your network.  Find out if your company provided any resources.  Example, at one company I worked for, they let employees use our recruiting services to help try to find roles up until we divested their company.  You never know.\n\n3. Apply to everything you can.  Don\u2019t worry about meeting all the requirements in the posting. They use those to help manage the volumes of applicants.  \n\n4. It\u2019s a game of numbers.  Example 40 applications might create 7 initial calls, 3 interviews , 2 second interviews and 1 offer.\n\n5.  Try to manage any guilt or shame you might feel about being laid off or the stigma surrounding it.  Most companies do not equate being laid off to equal poor performance.  \n\n6. Be unapologetic in your efforts to find a new job.  The application process is a game where the ones who can beat the screening logic win.  Not the best employee who\u2019s applied."
