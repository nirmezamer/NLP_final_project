It seems my warning a little after becoming subreddit owner wasn't enough, so I'll properly be taking action.\n\nAny comments past the time this was posted that are in the vein of \"I'd fuck it\" will result in a 7 day ban from the subreddit. If I see it again from the same user, it will be escalated to a ban the length of however long the mod team feels like it depending on how serve it was the the user's previous history with these comments.\n\nCalamity's main userbase is generally around the ages of 13-20. That means most people in the community are probably minors. Be normal and quit being like this in public.\n\nI've also heard of people wanting user flairs. I'd like to see that people don't abuse them in some potential way first. Stop with this stuff for long enough and y'all will get them.",
