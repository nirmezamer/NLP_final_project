It seems my warning a little after becoming subreddit owner wasn't enough, so I'll properly be taking action.\n\nAny comments past the time this was posted that are in the vein of \"I'd fuck it\" will result in a 7 day ban from the subreddit. If I see it again from the same user, it will be escalated to a ban the length of however long the mod team feels like it depending on how serve it was the the user's previous history with these comments.\n\nCalamity's main userbase is generally around the ages of 13-20. That means most people in the community are probably minors. Be normal and quit being like this in public.\n\nI've also heard of people wanting user flairs. I'd like to see that people don't abuse them in some potential way first. Stop with this stuff for long enough and y'all will get them.",

            "I should clarify some more.\n\nIt's not even necessarily about whether they \"add to the conversation\" and it's only in part because of half of the subreddit and a lot of artists not liking them.\n\nLots of people doing this are minors, and minors posting sexual things in public spaces is basically an inevitable magnet for people who want to try to take advantage of that. \n\nI've already had to deal with a few cases of grooming in this community before because of people doing stuff like this. Hell, somebody I once considered a friend some years ago was found out to be was grooming another one of my friends from this community. And that fact still makes me upset and angry to this day. \n\nIsn't isn't just about being annoying, this is about the safety of people in this subreddit and community as a whole. As a developer and somebody very present in the community overall, I feel a responsibility to keep Calamity's community as safe for people as possible.",

        "content": "Whenever I see anything relating to Calamity's bosses I always find somebody complaining about the Exo Mechs. The usual argument is that whoever likes the Exo Mechs fight is a masochist. While that's obviously a joke everyone I have ever asked about the fight they always say that it's super hard and that they fight SCal before them. I've finished Calamity with every class(okay not really but I'm currently halfway finished with my Rogue playthrough) on Master mode revengence and if I'm being honest Exo Mechs is my favourite boss fight. It's super fun and not even that hard imo. I've literally beaten it with Pre-DoG weapons( I mean Phosphorescent Gauntlet deals a shit ton of damage but still). It genuinely never took me more than 2 tries to defeat Exo Mechs, not counting my first ever Calamity playthrough but even then it took me like 12 tries max. I'm relatively new to the Calamity community so maybe I'm missing something.",

            "Most of the time and my complaint about exo mechs is that there's just a whole lot going on on the screen and everything hits like a truck. But if you quickly understand the patterns and how to dodge everything it isn't too bad. The reason the exo mechs take so long for me is cause of a bunch of dumb mistakes and hits. There's just alot of projectiles on screen and it can be hard to keep track of. It's a really fun but difficult fight if you ask me and the visuals and music are amazing.",
            "I forgot to mention I don't play Infernum so maybe people are referring to that version of the fight",
            "My favourite boss in the mod\n\nMaybe people hate the chaotic nature of the fight, but it is really just a matter of finding a pattern, the projectile spam is just for show, most of it can be dodged with very simple movement and watching out for key attacks that you actually are meant to dodge\u00a0",
            "I like Exo Mechs (i swear i'm not a masochist)",
            "I just don\u2019t like the fact that the the fight is made so much easier if you mine your entire world, you need to move too much, you shouldn\u2019t have to move THAT much in the fight.",
            "Not everyone hates them. I think some people summon them for the first time, get to the part where all three are attacking at once, die, then post on social media that the fight is stupid. If you take time to figure it out it really isnt that bad.",
            "My problem is that with every other boss fight, you know the mistake that you made. The bosses' attacks are all difficult, but you understand what they do after a couple tries. Very rarely do you feel like you died because the game fucked you over; it's easy to identify where you went wrong and what you should work to improve.\n\nThis does not apply to the Exo Mechs. It's often incredibly difficult to tell what exactly went wrong when fighting all 4 mechs at once. \"Oh sorry, I wasn't paying attention to Apollo's rockets which already blend into the background because I was busy stopping the mech worm from forcibly crawling its way into my ass.\" Deaths don't feel nearly as fail because, in the moment, it doesn't feel like you even made a mistake: you just died. That not only makes it incredibly frustrating to attempt again and again, but also makes it really hard to adapt and change your strategy, because you don't even know what went wrong!\n\nI know there's ways to essentially cheese the fight, to remove the need to concentrate on all 4 mechs at the same time. This is just a personal thing: preparing massive arenas just to attempt a boss fight is something I absolutely loath when playing. It also just feels like there's no point. Sure, it's an \"easy\" boss, but you have to fight it this specific way otherwise it's nearly impossible. This works for some games, but when Terraria has 4 classes (5 with Calamity), 100s of weapons, accesories, armor sets, traps, and buffs, and is literally advertised as a sandbox game, the last thing a player is looking for is a boss that forces them to use a specific, infallible strategy because all others lead to near inescapable death.\n\nI love what the Calamity Team conceptualized with the Mechs; on paper, it is a wonderful and terrifying concept for a boss fight. A malevolent (?) scientist that has been watching you throughout your entire journey unleashes his magnum opus upon you in one final death gauntlet. But the gameplay... it feels like a significant lapse. I'm 50 attempts into the Mechs on my first full Revengeance run, and I don't even want to bother beating them. DoG was my 2nd-hardest fight, took me ~80 attempts, but at no point did I actually want to just quit. I wanted to beat him more than anything because he was difficult, not in spite of it. I do not feel the same way about the Exo Mechs, and I've opted to just start my Death Mode run instead.",
            "Idk I love em. I\u2019m a sucker for chaotic fights. Like Father Gascoigne from Bloodborne for example",
            "I never understood the complaints about them, I like the fight. Even the first time I fought them wasn't hard, took me at MOST maybe seven attempts? Probably less (I'm not even that good, I still hate Providence).\n\nMy friends hyped it up way too much. Same happened with SCal, except I'm pretty sure it was like the first or second attempt.\n\nThis was all in expert mode, and I had no clue what the fights would be like other than my friends having ptsd from some \"ohio beam.\"",
            "I honestly only dislike one part of the mechs fight and that is just how boring the fight is for me, because all you need to do is move like /\\/\\/\\/ etc and nothing really ever hits you. Thanatos is also really slow and kinda boring to fight, just because it has so much time where it can\u2019t be damaged. But overall I\u2019d say it\u2019s a fun fight where it\u2019s useful to have multiple weapons for each boss, and I like the strategy of which combo you pick to fight."
