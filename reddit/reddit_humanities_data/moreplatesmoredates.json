        "content": "**Why are we making this change:** We are going to experiment with cracking down on body transformation posts due to a high uptick and downward spiral in their quality in recent weeks and months for that matter. This was motivated by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/moreplatesmoredates/comments/17rs1xi/comment/k8nm92j/?context=3) and replies to this comment and internal moderator discussion. We have felt this was the direction to go for a while now but I take the blame here for not doing it sooner. There was a recent podcast where Derek admitted he doesn't look here very often anymore due to post quality/some weird memes around genital size and that's disappointing to us.\n\n**What is changing:** Only enhanced transformations where details about the cycle log are provided are now permitted. (see full details and example template for posting in the sidebar).\n\nIf this change doesn't work out, we will revert it in a months time. We will gather user feedback from a poll and use general sentiment to determine the success of this change.\n\n**Is this the only change?** For now yes. We don't believe this is the only issue with the quality of posts on the subreddit, this might be middle of the pack. But we also have noticed other subreddits become lower in quality over time like r/joerogan and r/HubermanLab and r/Biohackers and so on. There is a perception among young men that taking supplements shilled to them by their favorite influencer will change their life thus people shitpost asking whats the best supplement stack or how to grow 1 inch taller without any regard for health outcomes with NO mention of their current lifestyle, genetic factors or bloodwork and this deeply upsets me.\n\nThank you for participating and maybe stop with the penis sizes :D",

            "Great.  \n\nNow we gonna get guys saying\n\u201cMy 250 a week test results\u201d\nwhen in reality they have been BnC for the last 5 years.\n\n\nWe arent going to get real transformations because people will talk shit and say\n\n\n\u201cYou could have done this natty\u201d\n\nAnd so on.\n Unfortunately we arent going to see 100 percent transparency .",

            "Better rule idea. If you aint atleast normal height and over 200 pounds with visible abs well aint nobody give a fuck about your physique. This would get rid of all these Greg Doucette type wimps who wouldnt stand out in a Planet Fitness in real life and the 160 pound kids who worked out for 5 months and finally saw a visible muscle.\n\nOr just ban transformation posts in general because nobody cares.\n\n\nJust limiting it to gear users is gonna be a whole lot of \"lol.you could have done that natty\" in 99% of the posts. The other 1% will resemble a lotr Orc that was made out of dickskin and acne",
            "I feel strongly that it'd be better to just have only one day of the week where body transformation posts are allowed, I get tired of seeing them all the time too but I also think it's good to have a supportive environment where we can congratulate each either for actually putting effort into physical fitness unlike most people nowadays.",
            "Now let's ban people asking for sources, auto removed their posts/threads etc.\n\nFfs, the Garmin watch (r/Garmin) sub enforces source discussions more strictly than this sub.",
            "Sounds regarded tbh. I get it, cause a lot of the transformations are lackluster or w/e, but more than half the people here are probably natty and either teens or young adults; only showing transformations of dudes enhanced is just going to fuck with people's heads even more. Maybe allow natty transformations if you've been training for a substantial amount of time like 5+ years? Idk, but where's the love for us natty bros?"
