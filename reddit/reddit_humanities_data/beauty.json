        "content": "( sorry if its bulky but I want to include every bit of information if it helps! :') )\n\nMy hair gets greasy overnight. I try not to wash it every day, but every second day it just feels super gross and oily. The youtube videos on \"training your hair\" haven't been helping me at all and I have no idea what to do. Because of this, I just gave up and wash it every day before school when I wake up in the morning.\n\nI use a shampoo for oily hair, and I live in Australia. In Brisbane, the water is relatively hard - so maybe that makes my hair extra oily? I'm 15 (and female), and a lot of websites say that hormones, puberty, periods, etc., can make your hair oily. My hair isn't thick or thin, just kind of medium thickness. I'm mixed (white&chinese) so my hair is pretty straight.\n\nI had a wayyy worse problem in 2020 before I changed to this shampoo that I've been using for 4 years.\n\n[\\(this is the shampoo I use\\)](https://preview.redd.it/953q785wag9d1.png?width=3000&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4572c6bc5e3a8ce324c27cc30706b0f674d4ac6)\n\nThis routine of washing my hair in the morning wouldn't be a problem for me, but our school is hosting a German exchange. Basically the student that's staying over at our house is the student that's going to be hosting me.\n\nIn Germany, I can't be showering, washing, and blow-drying my hair every morning in someone else's home, let alone take up the bathroom for the whole morning when someone else is staying here. I'm just stressed about what I should do.\n\nI've been washing my hair with cold water, making sure I'm cleaning my whole head + double shampooing (I've tried the silicone scrubber things), and making sure that I rinse absolutely everything out. I've also been changing my pillowcases too (silk ones aren't really an option for me), cleaning the combs that I use regularly (I don't use brushes), and staying away from conditioner. When I do use conditioner, I keep it at the ends too.\n\n[\\(my conditioner\\)](https://preview.redd.it/11r6y4nuag9d1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9029b2c703b49ea577386448bf152f8de9cb187)\n\nIf I shower in the morning, my hair stays fine for the whole day - but overnight, it just turns into a greasy mess. Overnight hairstyles like braids don't work because my hair is shoulder length and I don't want the waves and curls from them in the morning. Since my hair is short, tying it up just leaves my hair bent in all different directions (and still greasy nonetheless).\n\nI've been thinking to try a new shampoo, but if that doesn't work I have no idea what to do. Because of the exchange, I've just been worrying and want to figure it out now so I can start a good habit/routine that works for me (plus it would mean I don't need to shower every morning).\n\nDoes anyone have any idea of how I can fix this?\n\nEDIT: I didn\u2019t expect this much advice! Thank you so much for everyone that gave some suggestions!\n\nTomorrow i\u2019m going out with my parents to buy some better quality shampoo, clarifying shampoo, and some dry shampoo to try the before bed suggestion. I read through every comment and quite a few people recommended Batiste, so i\u2019ll try to find some.\n\n(About the clarifying shampoo, would the Ogx Apple Cider Vinegar be good? A lot of people also mentioned an ACV cleanse, and this is the only clarifying shampoo I can find at our local Coles)\n\nAs for a shower filter, my father said that he\u2019ll get one sometime later.\n\nAlso, I didn\u2019t notice before, but I actually do touch my hair quite a bit - i\u2019ll start being conscious of that during the day too.\n\nThank you so much for the help again - I\u2019m sure the comments will also help other oily haired people :,) ",

            "Hair cant be trained. If youre oily, its ok to wash it daily. I love Ouai detox shampoo - Im super oily and get about 3 days before I need to wash, previous to this I needed to wash every 1-2 days. I just have an extremely oily face/scalp due to genetics. Only wash the scalp, massage gently with your finger pads and use conditioner on the ends only. Nothing wrong with this! We are all different.",
            "I use clarifying shampoo a couple times a month. Dont use it too much or it could dry your hair out. I sometimes put a little dry shampoo near my part. I put it in at night and reapply a little in the morning if needed.",
            "I've never been able to \"train my hair and I think the idea is bunk for many if us. For people who have very dry hair, washing less often has value but you don't have dry hair.  Wash your hair as often as it needs to be clean..\n\nI also don't understand why you can't wash your hair daily as an exchange student.  Has the program told you not to expect access to a shower every day?  I don't believe it's unreasonable for a teenager to expect access to a shower daily.",
            "You might just need to wash your hair everyday. Its a myth that you can train your hair to be less oily. Imagine washing your face less - it wouldnt train your face to be less oily.\n\nYou can dry your hair in another room than the bathroom cant you? I would just ask the host family what time they get up and you could plan to wake up earlier to shower before everyone else.",
            "Try not washing with cold water...? Every time I've done that, my hair never felt clean and got greasy as shit. You need at LEAST lukewarm water man. I prefer hot, despite this being \"bad\" for the scalp, but I always take scalding showers anyway. My hair only gets oily after day 3.",
            "I know that Head and Shoulders can be quite drying as they have sulphates, (which I believe then encourage your scalp to produce more oil), so maybe trialling some gentler shampoos would help? Or even just a good cleansing/oil control shampoo but a different brand? As a fellow Aussie, I love the Sukin haircare products, which can be mostly found in coles/woolies but if not chemist warehouse or Priceline. \n\nAdditionally, you could try a silk bonnet instead of a silk pillowcase? I have oily hair and skin and my hair touching my oily face during the night definitely makes my hair worse.",
            "Someone recommended the neutrogena t/sal shampoo and it really helped.",
            "As a fellow oily scalp/ wash every day gal myself I can understand your struggle. Popped in to say that the oiliness could be from a lack of moisture as well. Ive always used a lot of products on my hair and I thought that was good, but I went to a head spa and the esthetician told me I needed to focus on moisturizing products. I use clarifying shampoo 1-2x a week and have incorporated products specifically for moisture into my routine and I feel like its helped! But no matter what, scalp oiliness is mostly hereditary so youre not really going to be able to change it. You can try sleeping with a bonnet and experimenting with hairstyles for second day hair (especially since slicked back hair styles are so in right now). Good luck OP! I know youre trying to be courteous of others, but like others have stated its okay if you have to wash your hair every day."

But I looked around and realized that women of all body types were out there absolutely rocking their bikinis, looking confident and amazing. Nobody really cared what I looked like, except for me. It was such a pivotal moment. If you want to wear the crop top or bikini, wear it and rock your amazing powerful body that literally grew another human being. ",

If you decide to get one make sure you have plenty of help because you wont be able to pick the kids up. \nI would not had the surgery if I didnt have DR. If you are concerned about skin I suggest starting with something mild like micro-needling. \nBut really, if you want to wear a crop top, wear it! You look fine. You have a baby! Also, my skin changed so much 2-3 years after having had a baby. Sometimes all you need a time.",
