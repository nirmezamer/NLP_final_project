            "I just need to know whether the regular post-episode discussion threads are going to be back. Discord is too chaotic and overwhelming. It's thousands of people commenting at once. With (as far as I know) no way to organize the relevant discussions by threads and topics like here on good ole reddit. \n\nThe first thing I do when I get to an episode thread is sort by top comments. I hate that there is no way to do that on Discord. This has always been my favorite world of Ice and Fire subreddit, but I'll definitely be moving on to others that still have actual post-episode discussions if they aren't being held here/moved to Discord. \n\nI'm not trying to be childish or petulant, but I'd be legitimately disappointed if there's no more stickied night-of post-episode threads (preferably with post-episode surveys attached, but that's another thread for another day).",

            "Everything looks bigger and better. I actually really enjoyed the episode, aside from some of Jace's lines at the start, delivery was a little off. B&C being different I thought would annoy me, but I actually don't mind how they showed it here, it was brutal enough not seeing anything.\n\n\nIMO, solid opener, and this is just the nail in the coffin for any sort of peace. Bring on ALL the battles.\u00a0\n\n\nAlso, Mysaria fixed her accent. Sick.\u00a0",

Alicent was into her orgasms for almost the whole episode and lol the irony of she having pleasures while rhaenyra was suffering just made me go insane.\n\nsolid beginning for a season which is yet to blow my mind!"
