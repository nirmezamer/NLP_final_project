Also,  kindly search keywords under this thread as your questions may have  already been answered by other Timekeepers.\n\nCommunity Guides\n\n* [General Community Guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e46cecjsIb1LO3Ybb6urlVUZKUk8R7yrgG9yXZS8-Ho/) (tierlists, teambuilding, puzzle solutions, etc.)\n* [Income/Saving Guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1X9fyml5ldU4fWd4ry1ckIp84J6arImz1m5KqHzmbhr8/htmlview)\n* [Prydwen](https://www.prydwen.gg/re1999/) (tierlists, guides, character info, etc.)\n\nCheat Sheets\n\n* [6-star Psychubes](https://i.imgur.com/8uLPShk.jpg)\n* [5-star Psychubes](https://imgur.com/a/0FTy0DR)\n* [Investment Priority](https://imgur.com/a/toRezTf)\n* [Farming Stages](https://i.imgur.com/tLC7QB5.jpg)\n* [Resonance Builds](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lUzkJvRfV2diLiU0ai6mCrM-kkm0cqwblo1VvCkhYi4/edit#gid=344101610), [Resonance Costs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1js7u2mwQzrfqkYnszURTYT1C6DxX0-qhsjfVQ5CvB_o/htmlview#)\n* [Material Crafting Requirements](https://i.redd.it/otjca601xd2c1.png)\n\nTools\n\n* [Planner & Summon Tracker](https://windbow27.github.io/Kornblume/)\n\nWiki Pages\n\n* [Reverse: 1999 EN Wiki](https://reverse1999.fandom.com/wiki/Reverse:_1999_Wiki)\n* [GameKee CN Wiki](https://reverse1999.gamekee.com/)\n* [HuiJi CN Wiki](https://res1999.huijiwiki.com/wiki/%E8%A7%92%E8%89%B2%E5%88%97%E8%A1%A8)\n* [bilibili CN Wiki](https://wiki.biligame.com/reverse1999/%E9%A6%96%E9%A1%B5)\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ):\n\nQ1. **Should I re-roll?**\n\n* This  depends on how much time you have to dedicate to re-rolling. In  general, all three of the beginner banner characters are great, and you  have options of doing shorter/longer re-rolls, as per [this guide](https://www.prydwen.gg/re1999/guides/reroll).\n\nQ2. **Why is my answer incorrect in for the trail puzzle?**\n\n* Try to answer with proper letter casing - the answers are case-sensitive.\n\nQ3. **When is the daily reset?**\n\n* The game resets at 10:00 UTC, please refer to [this timer](https://cicerakes.github.io/Game-Time-Master/).\n\nQ4. **Does pity transfer over to the next banner?**\n\n* Yes, pity should transfer over to the next banner of the same type.\n\nQ5. **How should I build my team?**\n\n* In *general*,  teams consist of a single damage dealer that get supported by  support-type characters, but there are many variations. We encourage you  to take a look at some of the guides above!\n\nQ6. **Can I re-watch the cut-scenes/story?**\n\n* From  the main screen/lobby, refer to the left icon below the Bank, go to  Atlas, then go to the Story Review. This does not currently apply for  event stories, unfortunately.\n\nQ7. **Are multiple copies of a certain character necessary?**\n\n* This  will depend on a character-by-character basis. In general, however,  there should not be a large importance on getting duplicate copies of a  character.\n\nQ8. **When should I stop leveling characters?**\n\n* Please refer to the investment guide listed above.\n\nQ9. **What should I purchase in the Psychube Shop (*****Thought Elements/Thoughts in Eternity*****)?**\n\n* Do not buy the 5-star psychubes, as we will eventually get enough 6-stars.\n* Prioritization order:\n\n1. LF Polarization\n2. Englighten I\n3. Enlighten II\n\nQ10. **What should I prioritize in the Oneric Shop (*****Oneric Fluid*****)?**\n\n* Prioritization order:\n\n1. Monthy Brief Cacophony\n2. Crystal Casket\n3. Permanent Brief Cacophony (or Moment of Dissonance to craft Brief Cacophony if needed)\n4. Sonorous Knell\n\nMisc Questions\n\nM1. **Are macros and auto-clickers allowed?**\n\n* No. They are against the game's terms of service; any usage will risk the potential of being banned.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Megathread Directory|\n|:-|\n|[Weekly Lounge Megathreads](https://www.reddit.com/r/Reverse1999/search/?q=title%3A%22Reverse%3A1999%20Lounge%22&restrict_sr=1&sr_nsfw=&sort=new) (for minor discussions, gacha pulls, etc.)|\n|[Weekly Friend Request Megathreads](https://www.reddit.com/r/Reverse1999/search/?q=title%3A%22Friend%20Request%20Megathread%22&restrict_sr=1&sr_nsfw=&sort=new) (for sharing friend IDs)|\n|[Technical Issues Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Reverse1999/comments/17g8p0u/reverse_1999_game_launch_technical_issues/) (for sharing any technical difficulties)|\n|[Previous Questions Megathreads](https://www.reddit.com/r/Reverse1999/search/?q=\"Weekly+Questions+Megathread\"+OR+\"Daily+Questions+Megathread\"&sort=new) (for any game-related questions)|\n\n*Please note that the above codes are manually updated!*\n\n*If you have any suggestions or would like to add anything to this post, please* [*contact the moderation team*](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/Reverse1999)*!*",

            "Hey ya'll! I'm just wondering: is Echoes in the Mountain a permanent game mode? I see a counter for 15 days, but I was also shocked to see how many Sentiments you need to collect in order to get all the rewards! Maybe you get more Sentiments on the more difficult routes (I'm still working on route 2). Just curious so I can try to plan how much time I need to carve out to work on it. Thanks ya'll!",

I've been playing for about 3-4 weeks and I'm really low on dust -however, I don't know if it's worth doing the resources farming stage or if I should wait for events.

I know that sounds cynical but that's just a factor in how these things work, right, like I've been fortunate to usually have cool bosses but they still have expectations of me that I have to fulfill.",

This is the same thing that happened with Tooth fairy and Centurion, whose reruns were separate in CN but jointed together for global with no pity carryover.

            "Damn I just wrote yesterday that I hoped they would stop doing this shit. I would\u2019ve minded if they had just changed the order like in Arknights. I don\u2019t want to drop the game but if they keep continuing\u2026 Wonder if they\u2019re going to do the same with 6.",
            "I wanted 37...\n\nHer ultimate is amazing",
            "I'd feel a lot better about these banners if they had their own pity attached. Or guarantee your desired character after two failed ones or so, kinda like how Genshin does it with their weapon banner. I will definitely suggest that idea when the survey comes out.",
