            "First, do you have any idea how attractive you are? With your great bone structure, appealing features and warm complexion, you have a foundation where you can build a lot of options. From your pics, your hair looks healthy, but fine. That means you\u2019re either going to add volume with products and blow drying or work within the restrictions of that hair type. Of the three pics, one is by far the best and just needs some shaping and refining. The hair hanging into your face on the other two images just looks sloppy, and I\u2019m sure you find yourself pushing it out of your eyes often. Shame you don\u2019t wear glasses with a thick black frame. The right pair could be a great accessory for you. The current ones with the thin frame really age you. Seriously, you\u2019re a beautiful guy. You may need to go to a new stylist to optimize your hair potential if your barber is not strong with scissor cuts.",

            "Hey, thanks. Those are very kind words. My friends were telling me to go with the middle part, and I honestly wasn\u2019t so sure and I don\u2019t think I like it. I went with it mostly because I thought my forehead was too big and wanted to hide it. I do wear glasses, I just took them off for the photos because I thought they made me look worse. I am planning on getting new frames though. Thanks for the advice.",
