        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nWe've decided that we're going to be enforcing stricter guidelines against sexual posts. Over the past few weeks we've seen a huge increase in the number of posts describing in detail sexual stories and/or habits. These posts are largely coming from new accounts with no post history. Not so coincidentally, we've had an uptick in modmail from new accounts getting caught in the ban evasion filter. To prevent bait posts, we've increased our content filter so new accounts need their posts manually approved by moderators.\n\nWhile posts asking for advice about sexual topics aren't being banned entirely, posts that describe sexual acts in detail will be removed. This is a subreddit for teenagers, if you truly need to describe in detail what you've done sexually, you're better off seeking sexual health-focused resources than this subreddit. Many of these highly detailed sexual posts have clearly been bait from perverts and in the future they're going to be removed. **In the future, posts seeking advice on sexual topics will need to be as general as possible. Unfortunately we have to deal with banning predators on here often, so this isn't the place detailed sexual questions.**\n\nIf you have any questions, concerns, or feedback, we welcome you to either send us modmail or leave them in the comments of this post.",

        "content": "Over the past few weeks we've gotten numerous reports about predators on this subreddit. **This is a reminder that predators will not be tolerated here and we'll work with Reddit to ensure action is taken against any individual trying to groom minors.**\n\nAdults are allowed to give advice here since banning adults from giving advice altogether would be counterproductive, however predatory behavior or advice will result in your comment being removed, your account permanently banned from this subreddit, and your account will be reported to Reddit's admin team. We also urge any user to report these accounts as well, even if they're not targeting you.\n\n# How to Report Predators:\n\n1. Firstly, report them for breaking our subreddit rules and we'll review it as soon as we can. A new rule has been added called \"Child Predators will not be tolerated\" to help us prioritize these reports.\n2. Secondly, make another report using the report button directly to Reddit. This will allow Reddit admins to look at both the post and the account, and Reddit will take action if they deem it necessary.\n3. If you get direct messaged by a predator, **report it directly to Reddit and screenshot the messages.** Send the messages to us and they'll be permanently banned from here without hesitation.\n   1. Note that *all* messages are stored by Reddit indefinitely. Even deleted messages can be viewed by Reddit's admin team.\n4. **We STRONGLY recommend reporting predators to** [NCMEC's CyberTipline](https://report.cybertip.org/)**. Reports can be made anonymously or you can give your contact information if you want someone from either NCMEC or law enforcement to follow up with you about the report. These reports can be referred to law enforcement on a global scale, you don't have to be from America nor does the predator have to be American for you to report them.**\n   1. In certain situations Reddit will report accounts suspected of crimes against children to NCMEC, including their location info, email, username, messages, etc. in the report.\n   2. Crimes reported to this tipline don't necessarily have to be related to cybercrime. You can report real world situations too.\n\n# Note on Sexual Posts:\n\n* We understand that seeking sexual advice is a normal part of being a teenager, however we don't need a detailed description of everything you did or are thinking of doing. Please try to keep posts as general as possible and don't go into heavy detail about everything that went on. **We're debating heavily limiting sexual posts and more will likely be posted about that soon.**\n* **Sending minors sexual messages online is a crime. It doesn't matter if you're a minor too, it's still a crime and could land you in trouble. Do not, under any circumstances, message or comment sexually with people from this subreddit. We won't tolerate it, we don't care if you're also a minor, you'll be permanently banned and reported to Reddit.**",

If they are purposefully manipulating you, then you need to cut off contact.
