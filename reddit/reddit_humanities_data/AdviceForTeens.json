        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nWe've decided that we're going to be enforcing stricter guidelines against sexual posts. Over the past few weeks we've seen a huge increase in the number of posts describing in detail sexual stories and/or habits. These posts are largely coming from new accounts with no post history. Not so coincidentally, we've had an uptick in modmail from new accounts getting caught in the ban evasion filter. To prevent bait posts, we've increased our content filter so new accounts need their posts manually approved by moderators.\n\nWhile posts asking for advice about sexual topics aren't being banned entirely, posts that describe sexual acts in detail will be removed. This is a subreddit for teenagers, if you truly need to describe in detail what you've done sexually, you're better off seeking sexual health-focused resources than this subreddit. Many of these highly detailed sexual posts have clearly been bait from perverts and in the future they're going to be removed. **In the future, posts seeking advice on sexual topics will need to be as general as possible. Unfortunately we have to deal with banning predators on here often, so this isn't the place detailed sexual questions.**\n\nIf you have any questions, concerns, or feedback, we welcome you to either send us modmail or leave them in the comments of this post.",

            "Hi. I am 30f. Would it be weird for me to be here? I figured I may have some advice as an adult, who  obviously was a teen. I also don't want to look like a predator or perv. I am a mom and I have a natural instinct to help. TIA",

            "Yeah I wouldn't worry to much I am a 25 m father of 2 most of these posts are not up my alley or in my area of expertise if you will. However I do feel as though I van contribute about teens who have questions about their fathers acting in a suspicious fashion. I honestly think I've only commented on one post other than this one and it was about a young woman who was suspicious that her father was \"overly affectionate\" it was a disgusting situation I felt as though what I Said was valuable l am an affectionate father and was still disgusted by the situation described by this young woman. I have often wondered that aswell like should I be here? I only discovered this thread by it popping up randomly actually that exact one I commented on. Personally as an adult I read the first few lines of most of these posts and think nope this is not a post for me to read or respond too and back out of itimmediatley, however I think we are valuable to this thread as on occasion it is valuable to have the advice of an adult/parent. There are certain situations that may seem completely normal to some teens on this thread that some adults with more experience would recognize as something more nefarious. Again I am a 25m of course I feel out of place reading alot of these quite frankly as I read alot of these I think oh boy my wife is more qualified for this question than I am. However I also recognize that I haven't seen alot of adult men in comments to these posts and see that sometimes it may be a benefit for a young woman to see \"hey I'm a 25 year old man and this behavior you are describing of ( significant other,father,brother,teacher or any other male figure) is completely unacceptable and would never be anything I would have considered doing in my life\". And I think your insight as a woman is even more applicable than my limited knowledge. Anyhow all that to say I think k that all the mothers I've seen on this sub have been doing an amazing service to all the young people on here that have general and not so general questions of life keep it up!",

        "content": "Over the past few weeks we've gotten numerous reports about predators on this subreddit. **This is a reminder that predators will not be tolerated here and we'll work with Reddit to ensure action is taken against any individual trying to groom minors.**\n\nAdults are allowed to give advice here since banning adults from giving advice altogether would be counterproductive, however predatory behavior or advice will result in your comment being removed, your account permanently banned from this subreddit, and your account will be reported to Reddit's admin team. We also urge any user to report these accounts as well, even if they're not targeting you.\n\n# How to Report Predators:\n\n1. Firstly, report them for breaking our subreddit rules and we'll review it as soon as we can. A new rule has been added called \"Child Predators will not be tolerated\" to help us prioritize these reports.\n2. Secondly, make another report using the report button directly to Reddit. This will allow Reddit admins to look at both the post and the account, and Reddit will take action if they deem it necessary.\n3. If you get direct messaged by a predator, **report it directly to Reddit and screenshot the messages.** Send the messages to us and they'll be permanently banned from here without hesitation.\n   1. Note that *all* messages are stored by Reddit indefinitely. Even deleted messages can be viewed by Reddit's admin team.\n4. **We STRONGLY recommend reporting predators to** [NCMEC's CyberTipline](https://report.cybertip.org/)**. Reports can be made anonymously or you can give your contact information if you want someone from either NCMEC or law enforcement to follow up with you about the report. These reports can be referred to law enforcement on a global scale, you don't have to be from America nor does the predator have to be American for you to report them.**\n   1. In certain situations Reddit will report accounts suspected of crimes against children to NCMEC, including their location info, email, username, messages, etc. in the report.\n   2. Crimes reported to this tipline don't necessarily have to be related to cybercrime. You can report real world situations too.\n\n# Note on Sexual Posts:\n\n* We understand that seeking sexual advice is a normal part of being a teenager, however we don't need a detailed description of everything you did or are thinking of doing. Please try to keep posts as general as possible and don't go into heavy detail about everything that went on. **We're debating heavily limiting sexual posts and more will likely be posted about that soon.**\n* **Sending minors sexual messages online is a crime. It doesn't matter if you're a minor too, it's still a crime and could land you in trouble. Do not, under any circumstances, message or comment sexually with people from this subreddit. We won't tolerate it, we don't care if you're also a minor, you'll be permanently banned and reported to Reddit.**",

Might have to remind her a few times but she will get the hint. I know a lot of people who are just naturally touchy, it doesn\u2019t always mean they are flirting.

I won't go too much into details, but it got much worse, and i was basically forced into a relationship i didn't want to be in. You don't want to fall into that trap. You have to say something before the situation gets worse, because then it becomes harder. In terms of how to go about it, the fact that you know him in person makes this part more troubling. He could very well be lying about you being his only reason for living, but there's no way to know for sure. Maybe try to convince him to get into therapy if he isn't already. When you talk to him, put things as gently as possible, while still making it very clear what you want, otherwise, it could make things worse if he misunderstands, or ignores your words. It'd be smart to inform a trusted adult before talking with him. Your parents, his parents, a counselor, or whatever. Don't try to deal with this on your own.
