We do allow general discussions of politics here so long as you remain civil and don't attack someone just for having a different opinion. The moment we see things start to derail, we will step in.\n\nPlease use this weekly thread to vent and let loose about personal rants. Got something upsetting or overwhelming that you just need to vent or shout out to the world? You can post those thoughts here. There are many real problems that plague the Millennial generation and we want to allow a space for it here while still keeping the angry and divisive posts quarantined to a more concentrated thread rather than taking up the entire front page.",

From George Washington being a ruthless slave owner, Capitalism is slavery, ownership and control is capitalism. you can tell your boss he doesn't own you but he controls your lively hood and extracts as much value from you as possible without giving you actual stake in the end result.",

Consider the issues that are most important to you and your loved ones, and honestly evaluate whether you believe Trump would improve or worsen these areas for you, your family, and your community.",

Growing up we heard it as them kicking the can for the next administration to fix, and since Bush Jr. there hasn't been ANY talk of fixing social security and it was the same election year we millennials could start voting. I think this issue is a unifying issue for our generation.",

He'll never win a Toastmaster contest.\n\nThe great thing about politics is that if you lose in the US, you can always win again. I wish Trump were a lot more self-assured. He has some great moments. But his fragile ego led him to betray this country.",

Nowadays kids grow up way too fast and they dont have the innocence that kids back in the 80s and 90s had mostly due to the overuse of the internet and smart phones. I believe we were the last generation to ever exist where kids played outside until the street lights came on and didnt spend all day parked in front of a screen. I miss it so much and if I could take my own kids and get into a Time Machine, Id gladly take them back and raise them in the 90s.",

I honestly want to understand bc I even know someone who is bankrupting themselves over this and refuses to actually talk about it. She always just says it's her right to have her own child, but that doesn't make sense and she gets really upset if I ask her to explain how it's a \"right\". I wonder if it's just the word she and others use, but I've never had a convo go that far. \n\nMy isolated community in SE Alaska has lots of children needing homes and plenty more up on the road system. Even though I'm childfree and will soon be on disability, my partner and I have decided to foster teens aging out of the system- the ones everyone ignores. These kids get thrown out on their own with nothing but a trash bag. Sometimes they don't even have birth certificates. And then I see them in the shelter bc they don't even know how to get a bank account or apply for a job. All they need is a little care and guidance to give them a fighting chance. And isn't that what every parent wants- regardless of the child's dna? \n\nEta: Oh my gosh some of these are the best responses I've ever heard! For both sides! I was trying to reply to everyone but I can't keep up! I promise to read everything later. Thanks so much \u2661",

            "Fostering and adopting is nowhere near as easy as people make it out to be.  I used to work in the field. If you want to adopt an infant its damn near impossible.",
            "There was a time when I was considering adoption and to be completely honest, I stumbled into some adults who had been adopted as children/babies who were VERY bitter about the whole thing. There was a lot of discourse about thinking adoption shouldn't even exist, discussion of a book called \"the primal wound\" which from the talk surrounding it sounds to be discussing the deep psychological trauma of being put up for adoption. And ultimately I felt like I would love an adopted child as my own, but that they would never see me as their \"real parent\" and the thought of that rejection was too painful for me to consider. I've since realized children aren't for me period, so I'm probably not the target for this question, but just thought I'd add a perspective from someone who did consider it. Additionally, have to agree about the Additional baggage as well as the immense cost",
            "Foster care isn't a way to have a kid. It's temporary housing for children with a goal of reunification. Furthermore, there is not a long line of babies and little kids waiting to be adopted. It's extremely expensive and you basically have to convince someone to give up their baby, which is ethically concerning.",
            "Its a want...there is an emotional and likely biological drive to have one's own biological offspring. If you want an answer rooted in logic and reason you will not get one.",
            "Why do so many **women**? Bruh, its couples not just women. Ffs stop just blaming women for reproductive decisions. Its not just on us.",
            "Former foster kid here and we are fucked up. Its not for everyone and it takes a literal saint to deal with kids like us.",
            "1.) fostering is not an equitable option, as fostering with the hope of getting to keep someone elses child is not ethical. The goal of fostering should be reunification. Socare for someone elses child and have your own child are not the same thing.\n2.) adopting is not necessarily less expensive than fertility treatment. They can also both be sunk costs, that is, you can invest a lot and not ever achieve the end goal.\n3.) our broken child welfare system is not the responsibility of women with fertility issues to fix. Youll need to take that one up with the government.",
            "Why is this question directed at women only?",
            "I'll bite. Hopefully your question is rooted in sincerity. Do you understand the point of the foster system is reunification with biological family? And that there is a shortage of infants to adopt? We have a child from IVF and a 7 year old child we adopted from foster care. We were in a situation where the mother's rights were terminated after two years of us fostering, which is fairly rare. I can tell you having gone through both IVF and adopting through foster care, the foster care adoption was the more stressful of the two. BY FAR.  It upended two years of our lives. We had a happy ending with our adoption but often families do not.\n\nYou seem very uniformed. Your friend owes you zero explanation of her choice.",
            "Adoption is not a backup plan for infertile people. Its a different thing than having biological children. People who adopt thinking its not different fuck up their kids. And stop interrogating people about their personal family choices."
