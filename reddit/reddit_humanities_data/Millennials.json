        "content": "Outside of these mega-threads, we generally do not allow political posts on the main subreddit because they have often declined into unhinged discussions and mud slinging. We do allow general discussions of politics here so long as you remain civil and don't attack someone just for having a different opinion. The moment we see things start to derail, we will step in.\n\nPlease use this weekly thread to vent and let loose about personal rants. Got something upsetting or overwhelming that you just need to vent or shout out to the world? You can post those thoughts here. There are many real problems that plague the Millennial generation and we want to allow a space for it here while still keeping the angry and divisive posts quarantined to a more concentrated thread rather than taking up the entire front page.",

            "If you are still on the fence about casting a protest ballot in the 2024 election by voting for a third party let's be crystal clear about a few things:\n\n1. A Third party cannot win in the United States, so long as the Electoral College exists.\n2. If a party doesn't get a 50% +1 majority in the EC, the House of representatives picks the president, which mean the party that controls the House picks the president.\n3. If one of the most popular presidents in American history, Theodore Roosevelt, couldn't win a THIRD TERM as a third party candidate, literally no-one can.\n\nSo with those sobering stone-cold facts out of the way here's why a protest vote is shooting off your foot to spite your face: ***The Supreme Court are Lifetime Appointments. AND WILL GOVERN MILLENNIALS POLITICAL LIVES FOR THE REST OF OUR POLITICAL RELEVANCE.***\n\nWhatever issues you care about: Voter Protection. Gun Regulations. Immigrant Protections. Abortion. Universal Basic Income. Workers Rights. Minority Rights. LGBT Rights. Interracial Marriage Rights. Contraception Rights. Fair Tax policy. Whatever it is, will ultimately be decided at the SCOTUS. Period. Fullstop.\n\nThe Scotus is currently occupied by a super majority of Right-Wing, Pro-Corporate, Anti-Progressive activist judges. 6-3. The next presidential term, 2024-2028, it is entirely possible we will see one, if not two, of these justices step down and or die in office. (end of next presidential term)\n\n* ***Justice Thomas, 75 (79)***\n* ***Justice Alito, 73. (77)***\n* Justice Sotomayor, 69. (73)\n* Chief Justice Roberts, 69. (77)\n* Justice Kagan, 63. (67)\n* Justice Kavanaugh, 58. (62)\n* Justice Gorsuch, 56. (60)\n* Justice Jackson, 53. (63)\n\nAll those protest votes against Hillary Clinton (if there were any) in 2016 gave us THREE lifetime appointments of ultra Right-Wing, Pro-Corporate, Anti-Progressive activist judges who will easily be on the court for the next 20+ years.\n\nIf the GOP is allowed to appoint TWO more ultra Right-Wing, Pro-Corporate, Anti-Progressive activist judges, our fate as a generation to enact ANY change is practically over. You could elect Bernie Sanders or AOC in 2028 and it won't matter if you have a supermajority conservative activist judge SCOTUS for the next 20+ years.\n\nTo be frank, this sh\\*t matters. Elections matter. The next two election cycles aren't a time to F\\*ck around with third-party fantasies. Maybe one day we'll achieve a multi-party system that can work for all of us. It ain't gonna happen with a Ultra-Conservative Supermajority SCOTUS.\n\nUtilize your power to vote accordingly; Especially if you are a voter in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, Minnesota or Georgia.",
            "We\u2019re pregnant for the second time after we unfortunately miscarried our first.  And I really am getting exhausted seeing people talk about how great it is Roe was overturned and how it should always be left to the states.  \n\nWe live in a red state and it really struck home when we got the news that they weren\u2019t viable that this might actually happen.  I had to start looking up places out of state while telling my wife everything would be okay even though I didn\u2019t actually know if that were true because if they were ectopic then I had to know where we could go.  It was one of the worst things I\u2019ve ever had to do, especially when it then came to crunching the numbers since obviously our insurance wasn\u2019t going to cover a lot of out of state procedures.  \n\nWe didn\u2019t have to, thank goodness, and they passed on their own.  But I am now getting involved as best I can in local politics here.  I know it will take a lot to change things (and it definitely feels weird to actually be involved at all with a major party) but I never want anyone else to go through that.",
            "So for probably most of our lifetimes we've heard this sentiment that life is so much better in Europe/Canada/wherever than in the US.\u00a0 I never completely agreed but can acknowledge some elements of truth to it.\u00a0 This sentiment is going to be amplified significantly on a left-leaning site like reddit.\u00a0 Is that collective narrative slowly changing though?\n\n\nWatching documentaries about life in the UK, for example, things look absolutely dire.\u00a0 I'm in a career specific sub and the Canadians are always crying about their insultingly low salaries.\u00a0 People in Canada and Australia are saying it's impossible to buy a house.\n\n\nDo you think our generation will finally stop saying \"ugh the US sucks, I wish we were like X\".\u00a0 Because I think in the real world the situation has already flipped.",
            "Capitalists are the enemy of all mankind from birth they lied to us, stolen from us and actively tried to harm us. From George Washington being a ruthless slave owner, Capitalism is slavery, ownership and control is capitalism. you can tell your boss he doesn't own you but he controls your lively hood and extracts as much value from you as possible without giving you actual stake in the end result.",
            "It's important to vote, all. Our political system are in the shitter, but it can be much worse.

            "We Millennials need to push our politicians to finally fix social security. Growing up we heard it as them kicking the can for the next administration to fix, and since Bush Jr. there hasn't been ANY talk of fixing social security and it was the same election year we millennials could start voting. I think this issue is a unifying issue for our generation.",
            "Allowing the agreement between Saudi Arabia and the US for the \"petro\" dollar will go down as one of the worst things to happen to our country in our life times. \n\nCountries are bolstered by what value they provide to other countries, usually by their exports. The US has minimal exports. The The three things we had going for us was:  \n1) that Oil was traded in USD, so other countries were forced to get USD to be able to buy oil,   \n2) Culture, Movies, music, TV shows, etc. I lived in Europe in the early 2000's for a couple of years, and Everything was \"American this\" and \"american that\" clothing stores, music stores, etc. They ate up our culture. Now our big name stars hate our country, Even flying the American flag is seen as extremist behavior, that only \"the far right\" would dare do such a thing. Our culture is fucked, the movies we make suck and nobody wants to watch them, our music is bad, and often anti American.   \n3) the last thing we have is Military. So war is the last thing we can do to prop up our country. Who's ready to go to war? \n\nif you don't think it is eminent, men are now automatically registered for the draft, and they are trying to require [women to register for the draft](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2022/06/27/requirement-women-register-draft-back-table-annual-defense-bill.html). \n\n  \nI know it is seen as insane to support an \"America first\" policy, but at this point if we don't do something, our country will have no other solution than to throw bodies at the bullets of \"their\" enemies, whom ever they decide that is. are you ready for it? \n\nIf I was in power, it would be energy. I would invest HEAVILY into modern nuclear power plants, Make them small, make them efficient. Offer to build them on/near every military base we have, and sell that power to the countries they are in, sell it cheap. Make it so that we power even the poorest countries in a manner that allows them to evolve past the polluting methods of farming and energy generation they do now. It would support electric vehicles of all types as well. It would do a lot to combat global warming, give our country something that we could sell to the rest of the world, and put our interest first.",
