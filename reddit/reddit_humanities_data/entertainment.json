But he also has a legacy he wants to keep alive.  \n\nEgo is a powerful drug, especially for a celebrity who has gotten away with all the shit he has for so long.  He\u2019s not going to back down.  He will claim innocence regarding the major accusations and give backhanded apologies for the others.  \n\nArdent fans will back him up no matter what so it\u2019s just a question of how many of them are out there.  He may have enough that he keeps his career alive \u00e0 la Chris Brown.",

It should absolutely belong to Frances",
