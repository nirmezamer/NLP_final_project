            " my wife and i recently replaced our baby formula with Monster Energy Drink (Zero Ultra) ever since they started sponsoring map contests and sc2 events. my baby has so much energy, you can really tell that the compounds in this drink make you strong and healthy!",
            "Will Microlizzard actually put them in the map pool, though?",
            "Nice. I still play 2v2 with a friend about once a week. I would love new maps for those.",

            "Beautiful!  I appreciate Monster's sponsorship.  I know ESL doesn't have much investment in the team game scene so it's nice that they're still coordinating this stuff.",
            "I am going to buy some Monster today to celebrate this",
            "Damn this will be FUN!",
            "please please please get some new team maps on the ladder!!!",
            "this a very welcome initiative indeed! since I have been grinding mostly 2v2 in the past seasons due to ladder anxiety, seeing the map pools just rotating the same maps instead of seeing new maps is kinda boring. Thank you map makers for the effort! Appreciated!",
            "Why wouldn't they be added to the map pool?  Less than three months ago there were multiple Community Edition maps added to the team map pools that included new maps and updated versions of old maps.  There's already a process for it."

            "If it's really the end of GSL, I hope Maru to win it to get G9L...actually I'm fine with any of these four winning it. I've had so much fun and joy from watching GSL over years and I'm thankful to all the GSL players for all the wonderful moments, brilliant builds and great games. I know all good things must come to an end, I will always remember all of these beautiful memory which keeps popping into my mind - I used to wake up at 2am just to catch up GSL live, we used to have 9pm GSL on Friday, the greatest TvT by Maru/TY in 2018 S3 Finals, gumiho's run in 2017, Maru's 4 GSLs in a row, Trap losing PvZ sadly in 2019 patch, sOs being so close to get his first GSL against Innovation, sOs' proxy nexus into DT vs bunny, Byun's win in 2016, \"Roar\", ... It's been a good run. No matter if it's the end, Thank you GSL.",
            "damn I've been watching this game for 10 years and this is the first time seeing dark cry on stage...",
            "Maybe GSL isn\u2019t dead after all. Tasteless said there will be more info to come after EWC",

            "Dark is always so fun to watch, his read on the game and decision making is so unique",
            "Wow, a great finals to end a really good season. So happy for Dark, he deserves every bit of it and played absolutely incredibly today. His reads on what Maru was going to do were incredible, and his nydus's were so on point.\n\nI really hope this isn't the last season of GSL. I hope to see everyone for the next season :)",
            "Despite him being really strong in TvT and TvP, Cure hasn't looked that great in TvZ to me, so we could well see a Maru v Dark finals again.\n\nExpected Dark 4-2 Cure, Maru 4-1 Creator, Maru 4-2 Dark.",
            "Msl.. Maru star league. But go creator!"

There's very little point."
