I've had so much fun and joy from watching GSL over years and I'm thankful to all the GSL players for all the wonderful moments, brilliant builds and great games. I know all good things must come to an end, I will always remember all of these beautiful memory which keeps popping into my mind - I used to wake up at 2am just to catch up GSL live, we used to have 9pm GSL on Friday, the greatest TvT by Maru/TY in 2018 S3 Finals, gumiho's run in 2017, Maru's 4 GSLs in a row, Trap losing PvZ sadly in 2019 patch, sOs being so close to get his first GSL against Innovation, sOs' proxy nexus into DT vs bunny, Byun's win in 2016, \"Roar\", ... It's been a good run. No matter if it's the end, Thank you GSL.",

        "content": "\nMech players. Ohhh mech players. We all now at least one. As a humble, hardworking bio Terran myself, I\u2019m often overcome with a sense of pity for my simple-minded mech friends. For years I made excuses for them:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s figuring out the game bro, let him play the style he likes\u201d\n\n\u201cMech is really strong in TvZ man, he\u2019s being strategic\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s starts off harmless enough. Perhaps your mech friend dabbles in a little cyclone Helion. Maybe he enjoys the occasional 1/1 tank all in. But what seems like a quaint, silly little hobby at first will inevitably, sooner or later, metastasize into a full blown mech addiction.\n\nThe signs are subtle at first. The third base starts becoming a planetary instead of an orbital. Their engineering bay will be researching building armor and turret range as suspiciously early junctures. And before you know it: Turrets everywhere, planetaries in every choke point, and more tanks than the battle of El Alamein. \n\nYou\u2019ll be 35 minutes into a TvT on Goldenaura, breathlessly spamming Vikings and researching liberator range wondering where it all went wrong. Why can\u2019t two decent men agree to Stim their marines into each other\u2019s tanks over and over again like a normal, healthy TvT?\n\nAs the most eLiTE MuLtIaskiNG, hardworking Gaymers, it is the responsibility of honorable bio Terrans the world over to stop your friends from descending into pure mech idiocy. To aid you in your struggle, I\u2019ve come up with a fool proof five step system to save your mech friends from moral degeneration: \n\nL.O.S.E.R.\n1.  L.\u2014Listen to your mech friends. \n\n2. O.\u2014Observe how slowly their cursor moves as they carefully siege their tanks behind a line of 20 turrets\n\n3. S.\u2014Suggest alternative, more respectable playstyles: \u201cyou can always play Protoss if real Terran is too hard bro\u201d\n\n4. E.\u2014Empathize with their lack of skill, human decency, and inability to not waste everyone\u2019s time\n\n5. R.\u2014Remind them that Protoss exists and you don\u2019t even have to siege anything or switch Thors to high tech impact mode if you\u2019re a-moving carriers\n\nWe must all do our part to save our mech friends from themselves.
