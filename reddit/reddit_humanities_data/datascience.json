            "I'm currently a psych student taking an undergraduate degree. I developed a great interest in data because of certain statistical concepts we discussed in psychometrics and research data. Can I become a data scientist with this degree? If so, what useful courses or certifications can I get for it?",
            "Might be a long shot, but did anyone here major in data science with a concentration in environmental science (or another related field)? Going into college with this degree plan but l'm not sure if it's even a good idea. I'm afraid of not finding a job\u2014 or at least not one with a good pay. Would love some advice or wisdom!",
            "I'm a 33M in northern Europe with a B.Eng and M.Sc in structural engineering, and 3 years of related work experience. I'm considering a career change due to lower salary prospects in my current field. I have some experience in C++ and Python and am drawn to the remote work opportunities in the IT sector. I'm thinking about pursuing a second master's in Data Science (60 ECTS) from IU International University of Applied Sciences, online. However, I've read recommendations suggesting an M.Sc in Computer Science might be a better option even if going for Data science career?\n\n\nI am currently following Andrew Ng courser on machine learning as an intro.",
            "What are the career prospects in food safety and logistics/distribution of food?  Both government and non-gov't, but likely private sector.  I'm thinking not necessarily epidemiology, but there could be overlap.  Public health undergraduate degree, comfortable with software and tech, public and private sector experience with food safety and production, but no software or DS certifications yet.",
            "Currently a doctor looking to switch careers into data science. I also have a business degree. \n\nWhat would be the best way to upskill without doing a formal data science masters etc?\n\nWould getting some certifications through coursera e.g. IBM data science course or Google be enough to leverage my background into a data science company?\n\nI'm not looking to transition into a technical role that would require mostly coding but maybe one that would leverage my background and understanding of data science?",
            "Hey all, I am about 4 months into an anti money laundering analyst position at a large bank, looking to transition into a more analysis focused role because this job doesnt seem to have any opportunities to learn anything, and I've had to resort to coding my own automation programs on my off time to make the job intersting. \n\nI've been trying to apply to other data analyst jobs but I've been having no luck. Should I apply after at least 1 year of experience? Can anyone offer some criticism? \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/VAArIkT",
            "I'm currently pursuing a master's degree in data science at UC Berkeley and have been finding it challenging to get a summer or fall internship. I feel this is partly due to my career pivot from a traditional, non-data-driven industry, which has left me with limited relevant experience on my resume.\n\nAs a hiring manager, what do you typically look for in candidates' resumes when hiring for an internship or a full-time junior data scientist position? Given the current market, what metrics or qualifications would make my resume stand out to secure my first internship in data science? Thank you for the insights.",
            "How feasible is it to go from a European degree to the USA for work? I am Canadian and have a Canadian undergrad (in a not particularly data related major) and am going to the Netherlands this fall for a MSc in Econometrics. However, I want to work in DS or Quant Finance, and I know that salaries and opportunities are significantly greater in the USA.",
            "Hello all! I am currently a junior studying data science and analytics. I'm supposed to graduate this spring 2025 semester and have begun looking for jobs but I sadly don't have an internship currently. I honestly feel unprepared to graduate and really only have the fundamentals of R and Python, with a little bit of Java on the side under my belt. Are there any tips yall could give me to help me prepare better for my upcomming career?",
            "Hi all! Recently I have been seeing a lot of big tech (FAANG) companies post their summer 2025 SWE internships. I\u2019m currently an undergraduate wanting to go into data science / machine learning and am wondering what positions I should recruit for? Do big tech companies post undergraduate data science internships? If so, when do those get posted? \n\nI know ML is typically harder to break into without a graduate degree, but what can I do as an undergraduate to set myself to get a career in ML after graduation?"

I'm not sure what's causing this mental block.\n\nAny input, tips, or just discussion would be awesome.\n\nThanks everyone!\n\nEdit to add: reddit can be randomly toxic sometimes but the replies here are so sincere and helpful.

            "Big projects can be overwhelming and the idea of starting can cause you to get diverted. I try to right two things, maybe one thing I want to do in the next period of time. I don\u2019t even try to map out everything. Just get one or two things started to help me focus and not go down the \u201coh jeez, so many things to do.\u201d",
            "I share a similar dilemma. I\u2019m working on an important project, checks all the boxes in terms of what I enjoy, what I want to learn, and importance. Yet, I find myself distracted and lacking motivation. Honestly, I feel like the color gray. \n\nWhat helps me is going out to my garden if I\u2019m home or playing with my dogs. In the office my peers around me seem to be enough to keep me going. \n\nBest of luck to you on your journey.",
            "You could try keeping a small todo list. My method is to use notepad or cot editor (something light and easy) and to have a like with TODO repeated and a line with DONE repeated. Tasks get their own line, and I use the shortcut for moving lines up and down to prioritize them or slide them down into done. For me it helps with momentum because the task prioritization is very low friction and I can break things down to where every task is something I can just do in one shot, so getting into a loop becomes easy.",
            "I also go through selective procrastination on work that I enjoy because in my mind I know how hooked i'll be on it. A delayed start on the inevitability and later i'll burn out  to finish it in time. Why do I do this?",
            "I\u2019ve struggled with this. What helps me is breaking it down into smaller steps so I feel like I\u2019m making progress. And timebox yourself if necessary. When you\u2019re timeline is very long, it\u2019s easy to go down a bunch of rabbit holes - or keep procrastinating. If I tell myself \u201cI\u2019m going to work on this for x amount of time\u201d then it helps me stay focused - after that I can take a short break. And it also stops me from spinning my wheels or going too far on a tangential idea. \n\nAlso making a direct connection to the work I\u2019m doing and the impact on the business or other teams. When that is too abstract, it can be hard to stay motivated, so I try to find ways to measure how my work is helping. \n\nAnd if you aren\u2019t already, schedule check-ins along the way to share your progress and get feedback. Just knowing I have to show *something* by x date in the near future keeps me somewhat motivated. \n\nAlso, I\u2019ve realized that a lack of positive recognition kills my motivation. I keep my own \u201cbrag sheet\u201d for when I do get recognition from others, whether my boss or peers or whoever, even if it\u2019s just a nice comment in Slack.",
