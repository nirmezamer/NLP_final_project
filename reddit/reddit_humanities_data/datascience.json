            "Should I do an online masters in data science while I work (eg Georgia tech or U Michigan)? I currently work at a multinational top 10 bank in North America as a data scientist. This is my first job out of uni and I have worked here for 1 year. Will experience be enough or will only having a bachelor's impact my career growth?",
            "Data Science or applied statistics MS??\n\nHi, I'm a Mathematics student here in Spain. I have decided that once I graduate I will pursue a career in Data Science. I have been reading tons of brochures and opinions from Data Science Masters from all across Europe but I find them quite general and introductory giving me the feeling that it would be no problem to acquire that knowledge within less than 2 years (usual duration of the MS) just by myself. I was wondering if something more concrete, e.g. applied statistics master (1 year in Spain) combined with self taught learning in coding, databases, ML, etc. (eventually kaggle) , would be a better option. Thanks in advance.",
            "Moved to US recently. I have a PhD in Particle Physics and vast majority of my peers went straight into data science positions in UK with it. However I can't get any interviews here, I assume due to lack of SQL experience (have some but not a lot professionally) and competition.\n\nIs there anything I can do to improve my odds or similar roles? I feel so lost",
            "Incoming Senior at UCSD with a Major in Data Science. What can I do to land a job once I leave College? We've had courses diving into Machine Learning, Hypothesis Testing, Linear Algebra, Python Experience, and a little bit of Spark and Dask work.   \n  \nWhat I'm wondering is what I can do for more experience to bulk out the Resume, and be able to land an job? More Projects and a Website to deploy them? LeetCode work? Networking and Job Fairs? If so, how and what should I do in them? Would appreciate any and all advice, because I'm feeling the pressure and the post-layoffs Job market has me stressing out.",
            "For data scientists who transitioned between working different domains/fields (healthcare, finance, marketing, etc.), what was your experience like? What skills transferred over, and what did you have to learn? Specifically interested in people who were in data science roles in multiple domains, not transitioned into data science from something else.\n\n(Would this question be allowed as a post? I'm just curious about learning about people's career trajectories.)",
            "I\u2018m looking for an internship in a large finance company for my 6th semester. What do I need to look out for?",
            "Hi guys! I'll be graduating college this December with a bachelor's in Computer Engineering. My focus throughout college has mostly been on Quantum Computing. Since I'm struggling a bit financially right now, I'm hoping to get a job in Data Science or Data Analytics for a few years before I decide to pursue a Master's or PhD. I have limited experience with Data Science with no internships only a few minor projects (which I'm working on to expand). I have some good projects and publications in quantum computing though. Would it be relevant for me to put those on my Resume while applying to DS/DA jobs? Thanks in advance!",
            "Does anyone have experience with traditional degree vs certifications for this job market? I'm a software developer with 4 YOE and no traditional degree. Debating whether to go back to school for computer science (data focus) or test my luck with certs.\n\nI know a degree brings a lot more opportunities in the way to networking and credibility, but I don't like the idea of taking on the debt..",
            "Hello so I'm trying out a Google certificate courses for data analytics for more information I kind lack job experience and I'm majoring in Advertising Design at my college but I wanted to try getting a certificate and then a job in IT and I was hoping I could get some advice or if you have taken the same course what your experience with it was and any tips Thank you",

Now of course people are saying AI is replacing jobs, and I know there is some evidence some companies have started experimenting with a reduced software engineering and DS work force.

            "In addition to what u/ds_throw said, you usually need more software engineers than data scientists, especially if your primary product isn't DS-specific. In my previous company we had various teams of software engineers but only a handful of data scientists. Both have been hyped as nice tech jobs but one has way more openings than the other. Thus my software engineer friends spent only a couple months of somewhat picky job searching while I had to spend around 9 months just looking for any data-related job (DS, DE, MLE, even fucking DA at one point), and I still got paid the least among my friends. (Yes I'm semi-ranting)",
            "There are a lot of so-called data scientists who could not construct an adequate training dataset from transaction data. There are a lot of junior DS who only know how to call the Open AI API and are clueless on how NLP works.\n\nWhen those people flood the job market it is not only that they are not going to get a DS role, the hiring manager had a harder time to go through so many underskill DS to get the right one. The interview-to-hire rate in my team is 1/20. All of the candidates resumes look very promising, but many can't even transform raw data into a training dataset. A handful of them can't explain how a certain model works on a high level. All candidates that put \"use gen AI to do something\" on their resume, don't understand basic NLP topics like tfidf, embedding and word2vec.",

All people doing the data work suddenly realized they can have a much hotter title called data scientist, then flooded the market with their CVs in hope of landing a better paid job. But little do they know, data science is quickly becoming commodity, it'll become a basic skill like MS Word skill was 30 years ago. The key differentiator in most jobs are and should still be the domain knowledge.",

For the past few annual reviews I've gotten, my feedback has been that I am \"exceptional\" and given a sizable raise and bonus but never an actual promotion despite asking for it several times.\n\nAt this point, I've built an end-to-end modeling platform (the data, the pipelines, the serving and monitoring of models) that has made the company millions of dollars in terms of measurable revenue and individually contributed to many large profitable projects successfully. However, despite all this, I am told that my main area of weakness is my \"math\". I feel like being told to \"improve math skills\" is so open-ended that it's almost discouraging as there's no actionable clear path forward. It's not that my math is poor or I am reporting inaccurate unreliable numbers, it's just that it isn't the most advanced. My own belief based on our current hiring process is that these roles are reserved for someone who has a \"PHD\" in their title but honestly, after interviewing multiple candidates with PHDs, I don't think they offer anything advantageous but perhaps my perspective on this is biased.\n\nI come from a more software engineering background (undergraduate in Comp Sci) so my strength is my ability to \"build\" and \"architect\" data solutions so I feel like I may be a good fit to transition into a ML engineer but the job market isn't pre-COVID anymore and I fear it may be a waste of time going through rounds and rounds of interviews that lead to potentially a role that isn't as good as the one I'm in.

I can count on one hand the amount of times iv had to do anything particularly mathematically advanced in the last 5 years, and I'm at the senior principal level. Thats obviously area specific ofcourse - maybe its more necessary in your area. My guess is they're stalling you. Giving you something that vague and broad to work on is just a way to keep avoiding giving you the promotion. I'd give an ultimatum and start looking for other positions.",
            "Yeah this doesn't sound like great personal development from your employer. Maybe you're not yet delivering at Staff level, but I'd hope your manager would work with you to develop a growth plan so you can get there in that case. If your manager is not willing or able to do this, is there anyone else senior who can help? I'm assuming good faith here and not that they're trying to fob you off! \n\nThe focus on a PhD seems weird for such a senior position. Yes it's a useful signal, but honestly experience should count for far more at that point in someone's career unless it's very research-focused.",

Take your manager\u2019s feedback on a face value (be objective) and ask him/her what they need. Give it to them. You dont have to ask for promotion. They will give it to you if they see you. Be visible. Be a teamplayer. Stop thinking about yourself and think about the business. And this advice is for everyone.",

            "Several possibilities here. 1) You are too valuable where you are to be promoted. 2) There is an unwritten rule that staff or principal roles are reserved for PhDs 3) Someone in HR has pegged you as an IC lacking the necessary people and management skills for higher level roles. Once you are tagged that way there is no escape. Bottom line: if you want the promotion you will have to change companies. Just be sure that the same blockers are not in place at the new company, and it may have to be a lateral move and hope to be promoted within a year or two."
