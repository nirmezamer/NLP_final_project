            "At the very least read the Ableton Live Concepts chapter in the manual. Also keep in mind its a professional-level program that does a billion different things so there's no way to learn everything all at once. My approach over the last year of learning it has been to try to learn/implement 1 new thing each time I use it.",

It feels like something that should be within Maschine. IMO Ableton can do everything Maschine does but much better and with more tools. It was super frustrating for me to learn at first but stick with it mate if you ever get frustrated.",
            "Don\u2019t try to integrate maschine. It\u2019s a massive headache. Other than that no tips. Ableton is fun bust maybe not as quick as Maschine. If you get frustrated with the pencil popping up you probably accidentally pressed \u201cb\u201d press it again and it\u2019ll go away lol. That caused me a lot of frustration my first day",
            "1. Don't use scale cheats. **Know your scales, modes,** etc.  (this will help you create without worrying about music theory.)\n2. Learn the everything you can about Ableton's **groove settings.**\n3. Use s**tock plugs and effects.**  Sure get your plugin bank built up but some of my favorites are within the stock samples, synths, and FX.\n4. Learn to group your tracks and how to target certain groups w/ **sidechaining.**  Learn everything about sidechain and don't over do it.  \n5. Purchase a **good EQ** (my pref. is Pro-Q3\n6. Learn **limiting, compression** - This is worth spending money on imo\n7. Learn **metering.** This is also worth spending money on imo\n\n8.Bounce stems and create a mixdown/mastering project once the composition and music is done and you are happy.  MIX AND CREATE SOFTLY.  You should never be in the red.  Bounce stems at -6db for mixdown\n\n10. Work 10,000 hours before you release anything. <---this is one I wish i could go back and follow because youre going to get better and better.  You'll smear the brand if you release bad music early on.  If you're like me and way too excited to wait for the 10,000 hour mark, create a side project that you're not worried about analytics.\n\n11. Don't be scared to get on the mic and learn your own vocal.  People want to hear exclusive shit and unless you want to pay 400-20,000 for features, just learn your own vox.  It's is just as powerful as producing.  Tell your story and let people resonate with it. (not ableton related lol)\n\nThis program changed my life tbh.  I took it through a music college w me and do nothing with my life except produce now lol.  You're about to find out things about yourself through your music.  My experience has been cool in a way that when i'm writing music and in the \"art of flow\", my mind speaks to me through this shit.  Sounds cringey but it's so true.  I went through a huge breakup and other personal issues and the music got me through it.  Early on, i was producing for an EP that I titled \"Love System\".  I would write and certain feelings would come out that I had to dig down deep for.  Helped me identify a ton of shit that I would have never discovered if I weren't creating. Respect the game and it will take care of you.  Sorry for the long message.  Good luck brother.  Reach out to me if you need any help I live for this shit. IG is v4nt4music.",
