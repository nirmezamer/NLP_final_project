He ran an open mic at a restaurant that was once used in a Woody Allen film and always seemed professional and courteous. He even guest hosted HQ Trivia for a bit before its downfall. His pivot probably started as a grift, but it also seems like he pickled his brain along the way to the point that his views are authentic. What a weird few years it\u2019s been.",

He spends the whole interview rehashing his gripes against other people while the host, and his partner, listen on. It seems as though he's learned nothing from rehab nor has he taken any accountability for anything that's happened in his life. Skip to whatever part to see what I mean...\n\nWith that being said, I wish him the best in his sobriety journey. ",

Then once the kid is old enough to go no contact (and he will), Bam will publicly cry and whine about how he doesn\u2019t understand why his kid would do that because he tried his best to be a great dad and he\u2019s so anguished over this and blah blah blah.

Then he goes on to say that the ultimatum pussy or vodka made him sober, no problem. \n\nYour takeaway from that series of words may be different than mine... All I can say is that if I loved this man I would be angry.\n\nAnyway, this moron has no clue just how absolutely awful it is to witness someone you love being neck deep in addiction. Even otherwise amazing days are spoiled by the near constant anxiety about their situation.\nAt some point, their death seems to become the best of two evils...\n\nHis whole situation is so messy, I don't think his friends and family will ever be able to trust his ass again."
