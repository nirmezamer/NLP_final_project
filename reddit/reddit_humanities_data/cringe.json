He ran an open mic at a restaurant that was once used in a Woody Allen film and always seemed professional and courteous. He even guest hosted HQ Trivia for a bit before its downfall. His pivot probably started as a grift, but it also seems like he pickled his brain along the way to the point that his views are authentic. What a weird few years its been.",
