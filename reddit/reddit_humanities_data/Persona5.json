        "content": "**1. There's a lot of Persona 5 games! Which ones do I get?**\n---\n\n  It is recommended to start with Persona 5 Royal. Please note Royal specifically, not \"Persona 5.\" While a different game, it is missing content compared to Royal. \n\n  If you want to read more about the different games, please read below:\n\n  1. Persona 5 (P5) is the vanilla game, often called P5 Vanilla or base game. It goes from April to December in-game.\n\n  1. Persona 5 Royal (P5R) is the updated game, released after Persona 5. It has the base game + Royal contents, which is sprinkled within the base game and then has another semester in the January month.\n\n  Note that you can't use saves from P5 for P5R.\n\n  There are requirements to getting to the bulk of the Royal content, ie Third Semester/January.\n\n  1. Persona 5 Strikers (P5S), or Persona 5 Scramble: The Phantom Strikers, is a sequel to P5/P5R, but it doesn't mention P5R characters. It is a musou game similar to Dynasty Warriors.\n\n  If you want more P5 after beating the game, you can buy this next if the other Persona games don't interest you.\n\n  1. Persona 5 Tactica (P5T) is an SRPG compared to the previous games. It's set somewhere during February but before P5 Strikers.\n\n  You can play this game before or after P5S. This does not narratively affect P5S.\n\n  1. Persona 5 Dancing (P5D), or Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight, is a rhythm game where you watch characters dance.\n\n  It's not narratively connected to anything, but it is best played after P5/P5R.\n\n  1. Persona Q 2 (PQ2) is a dungeon crawling game in the vein of the Etheryian series that includes the Persona 3 (both the original [Remake a good one to play] and Portable) and Persona 4 casts.\n\n  Best played after the P3, P4, and the base game, but it is set around November, so you can play it after the 7th Palace.\n\n  It is only playable on the 3DS.\n\n  1. Persona 5 X (P5X) is a mobile gacha-game based on an alternate world. Its main cast is another set of Persona users in the P5 timeline, and the OG cast does make cameos. It first came from China is slowly releasing in Taiwan and Korea. \n\n  No official English version yet.\n\n**2. How do I access P5R's new content: Third Semester?**\n---\n\n  You only need to get Councillor to Rank 9 by 11/17. On 11/18, you'll get Rank 10 automatically as a cut-scene.\n\n  You may have heard Justice and Faith are required, but that's based on old news when P5R was just released. They give cutscenes, fleshing their characters.\n\n  For the True Ending, you do not need Justice nor Faith, but they give extra scenes.\n\n  For more information on Councillor, Faith, and Justice requirements for extra content, check this [spoiler comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/177o7sp/compiling_some_subreddit_guides_and_tips/k4w5m15/).\n\n  For more tips: \n\n  1. If you want to access both the Vanilla ending and Third Semester without replaying the game:\n      1. Create a back-up save file on 11/17 afternoon while Councillor is Rank 8. DO NOT LOSE THIS FILE.\n      2. DO NOT DO Councillor Rank 9 on 11/17. Instead, do something else on the main save file.\n      3. Proceed with the game into the Vanilla Ending.\n      4. Return to the save file from Step 1, and do Councillor Rank 9 on 11/17.\n      5. Proceed to Rank 10 on 11/18 and towards the Third Semester.\n\n  1. It's X-month! Will I make it to the Third Semester? \n      1. Unless it's very late into November, October and November has a lot of availability. Theoretically, there are 9 days in November before 11/17, but I highly suggest not to do this.\n\n**3. I need help on 5th Palace/Okumura's Boss!**\n---\n\n  Use the command !OkumuraGuide. You can also check the Guides on the sidebar for the same guide.\n\n  [Here is an example of how it works](https://old.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/1cjlilu/persona_5s_subreddit_faq/l2grg4i/)\n\n**4. I need help on the Royal/Third Semester Boss!**\n---\n\n  Check this [spoiler comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/16wbkkt/how_long_does_this_boss_take_to_beat/k2wxcxa/).\n\n**5. Guides**\n---\n\n  I typically use [GameFaqs for guides](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps4/260936-persona-5-royal/faqs/78212).\n\n  Thank you, u/ZOLTANstudios, for [google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TLWmcW6PYv0T4Mcfwy18Xxh859q_GQtkkRa6KOV9Rog/edit?usp=sharing) that contains a list of Personas for tracking, traits, itemizations, etc.\n\n  Thank you, u/lazy_bread442, for [an optimized P5R NG+ Builds guide](https://old.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/hi1be8/p5r_new_game_plus_optimized_builds_with_steps/).\n\n  Thank you, u/bryanktr, for [a guide testing P5R's Battle Mechanics](https://old.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/gksz73/testing_p5rs_battle_mechanics_part_1_damage_boosts/).\n\n**6. Fusion Calculators**\n---\n\n  There are 2 main Royal calculators:\n      1. [aqiu384](https://aqiu384.github.io/megaten-fusion-tool/p5r/personas)\n      2. [Chinhodo](https://chinhodado.github.io/persona5_calculator/indexRoyal.html#/list)\n\n  I prefer using aqiu384's calculator since it also gives the level ranges for Treasure Demon fusions, which Chinhodo is missing.\n  aqiu384's calculator also has itemizations, skills, and they recently added a way to calculate how to get a specific Persona.\n\n**7. Need help with Maxing Confidants without a day-to-day guide?**\n---\n\n  Try reading this [guide](https://old.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/l3hicr/algorithm_to_maxing_all_confidants_in_a_single/?share_id=ZZi7GGl0EGSedByKPzOfW).",

Without this, you proceed to the original vanilla ending;\n* Within the third semester, there are *multiple* endings\u20141/9 deal, 2/2 deal, spiderweb, just fucking dying, true ending (without Akechi), true ending (with Akechi)\n\nI quite often see people who are clearly asking how to get the \"most complete\" or \"best\" ending told that they don't need Akechi, which is untrue\u2014you will get a cut-down version of the ending without him. You can get *into the third semester* without Akechi, but that's not the same as getting the true ending.\n\nIn short, should that line say \"for the third semester\"?",

Isn\u2019t the romance optional in-game? or do they just hate them because of their headcanon? While romancing minor confidants, those haters will be like, Eww, they\u2019re minors. How dare you, pedo? Like when it\u2019s adult confidants, they blame characters because MC is groomed, and then with minor confidants, they blame the player who\u2019s controlling MC to romance them.

For example, if you date Futaba in-game (which some players hate), that\u2019s fine too! Its a bit of a roleplaying game for the most part and Joker is like 16 or 17.\n\nYou could also choose all of them and see what\u2019s what, but you better prepare for the consequences in the future."
