            "Reddit staff go through this subreddit, sometimes several times a day. They will remove or permanently delete any comments or threads that violate community standards, including those that are racist or abusive. Additionally, Reddit has the authority to ban users for such violations.\n\nOur goal as moderators is to create and foster respectful and civil discussions. We encourage you to freely express your opinions, but it's essential to comply with both Reddit's policies and our subreddit rules.\n\nWe really don't care if your a bear, bull, renter, investor, realtor or landlord. Follow the rules.\n\nTry to not attack each other with insults. Rather than resorting to insults, back up your arguments with evidence and challenge the idea, not attack the person presenting it.\n\nIf you report someone claiming self harm, that is taken very seriously, we see it, Reddit sees it. Such reports are rigorously investigated, and they may lead to sitewide account bans.\n\nIf you encounter any hate speech or discriminatory content against individuals or groups, please report it immediately. You also have the option to alert the moderators directly or send us a message.\n\nThis image is one of the many messages they have sent us. Reddit will happily replace moderators to be more compliant with their goals, or just nuke the subreddit completely.\n\nReddit is watching.",

And we\u2019ll be seeing some form of bullshit post complaining about \u201ccensorship\u201d, or \u201cstopping honest discussion\u201d. \n\nSome of you REALLY need to have it spelled out: be very careful about how you approach the immigration topic. Stick to FACTS you can prove, and source, and STFU about your opinions that could be perceived as racist or xenophobic. \n\nRe-read every comment you make on the topic of immigration and ask yourself if someone could read it and interpret that as racist or xenophobic. If they can, don\u2019t post it. You leave it up to the imagination and interpretation of another person, and you accept the consequences. It\u2019s no one else\u2019s fault but your own if you get your pee pee slapped because of how you said something.",
            "Reddit is a private company. So as much as I agree with you, they can do what they want.\n\nYou could write \"there are too many people from India coming to Canada and it is affecting our economy in these ways, and if we reduce those numbers in the following ways we would all be better off\", but if Reddit reads it as \"these people generally are bad and should be hated\" then there is nothing that we can do if they already have that inherent bias built into their decisioning as paid staff of the company.\n\nIt is just the times that we live in I am afraid. Western civilization since around 2016 has been increasingly oppressive on freedom of speech, claiming that your freedom of speech extends to where someone's feelings begin, and that once you encroach on that then others have a right (they would say 'duty') to step in. What these people fail to realize on the Left is that by introducing that rhetoric, they are also encouraging the Right to apply that same logic to thoughts and opinions that they dont like, particularly about trans people, law enforcement and other discussion areas like on Israel recently. The whole thing has just created increased partisanship on both sides, whilst both sides look to maintain this saintly, leaderly stance as if they are the bastions and protectors of free thought, discussion and protectors of people. Funnily enough, these people - be it Reddit staff suppressing free speech or reactionaries on the Right - are the fringes of society who don't represent the majority. \n\nSadly it is us in the middle majority who get caught up and affected by it. Society has been warped where no-one is allowed open conversation yet we are being gaslit into thinking that we are allowed open conversation, and that it is us who are the problem, and that \"if only we would stop posting these views and have more moderate, less abrasive things to say\" would we not be curtailed/modded/banned for the things that we say, which the policing of language and conversation is literally the polar opposite of what free and open debate and conversation is about. They don't see it, and sadly until they are made to never will I fear.\n\nWe must have free and open conversation.",

            "People don't like facts.\n\nEvery number clearly say that immigration is bringing the cost of housing up (it's literally basic offer and demand), that is a fact, yet people reply that you are racist and you get banned. Even if you are the one trying to help the immigrants because they are the ones ending up in the streets and in the food banks because they were told differently.\n\nAnd of course tiktok real estate bros keep telling us that is totally normal because their condo went up 250% in 2 hours. And you are racist.\n\nSo no, i don't think that \"facts\" are what people here want."
