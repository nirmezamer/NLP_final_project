I am extremely critical about the lack of diversity in our immigration programs, but I don't blame the immigrants themselves I blame the Liberal government and it's policies.

A lot of speculators are looking to get out of their previous investment properties and pre-construction purchases... not to keep buying more when prices haven't really even dipped all that much.",

Eventually stopped paying rent, then arrested for sexual assault and just vanished.\n\nSecond group was 12 international students.\n\nFour years of hell. Used all of my savings to buy a detached house in Georgetown and now my neighbours are fantastic. All owner occupied and friendly. \n\nAlso not a lot of cars revving every 5 minutes. Oddly quiet."
