Most likely a janitor was caught after hours using a computer for something they shouldn't, so IT communicated to executive management that we wanted to implement a 30 minute idle lock.\n\nWe had a Finance Director was that a real hard ass and hated IT for some reason, but had more power in the company than the IT Director. She insisted on a 90 minute idle lock policy so her employees could go to lunch and come back without having to re-enter their password. IT Director knew he'd lose the battle, so he agreed to the 90 minutes, as it was better than nothing at all, and at least they would eventually lock after hours. So we implemented the ridiculously long idle lock policy via Group Policy.\n\nEvery workday, I would come in and adjust the policy setting down by one minute. Slowly over weeks and months the workstation would lock at incrementally lower idle times until after about 3+ months later we were sitting at 15 minutes.\n\nOnly one person noticed and didn't really care.\n\nCaution: This behavior can be a resume generating event depending on how strict your organization is, but this company was pretty casual, and I was young."
