I know this because I have been getting calls from numerous juniors this year which had never been the case in any previous year. I didn\u2019t get any call, let alone be many, in last 3 years, but this year was an exception. \n\nMany students do not opt for placements and go for research or off campus but that percentage is hardly 20% but there has been significant jump this year in non placed students this placement season. \n\nMarket situation is notably a problem right now. Jobs are less despite what the government is saying. But for you guys, the silver lining is that the things will definitely improve when you people will graduate after 4 years.",
