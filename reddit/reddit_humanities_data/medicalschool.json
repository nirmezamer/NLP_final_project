            "From me as an MS4: Among the most important thing when picking a school is knowing your school has a home program in what you are interested in. Even if you do not know what speciality you want to do, try to figure out if you have an inkling interest(literally any type of possible intereste) in a competitive speciality, try to pick a school that has such home programs. That is amongst the biggest thing that differentiates students who match and go unmatch (of course other factors will matter).",

        "score": 18,
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1dra6r4/14_years_of_financial_tracking_through_medical/",
        "content": "Hi all,  \n  \nCongrats to new grads and incoming students and residents!  \n  \nI\u2019ve made a number of financially-focused posts starting 5 years ago as a fresh hospital-employed interventional pain management attending, all to a generally warm reception. [Past posts and large Q&As can be seen in my post history.](https://www.reddit.com/user/DrPayItBack/submitted/) I have said that I would continue to provide updates and answer questions as I made progress on my financial goals. Much of this will be carried over from previous entries so that each post can stand on its own, but I have edited anything relevant.\n  \n**I graduated medical school in 2014 with $160k in loans (about $210,000 in 2024 dollars), which was just about the median at the time. Clearly average loan burden is higher now. I am also in pain management which is generally a well-compensated field. I make about 40th percentile for my specialty because I am employed and work reasonable hours, but it is still more than many physicians. Finally, I lost my dad unexpectedly in mid-2020 and therefore received an approximately $200k inheritance. In my opinion, all this does not change the principles of smart financial management, though it is certainly accelerating the timeframe. But if you feel these factors trump all else, you may not get much out of the rest of the post. This is not an exhaustive list of my privileges, but I always try to put them front and center.**  \n  \nI have been an attending now for 5 years. I work essentially business hours, 7:30a-4:00p, no nights, weekends, holidays, or call. My time is split about 50-50 between clinic and injections/interventions. In addition to holidays I get 7 weeks off per year, 2 weeks of which is for CME.  \n  \nAs in the past, my major goal has been to show one person\u2019s attempt to put the framework of smart physician personal finance into practice a la resources like the [White Coat Investor](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com). **I have never held myself up either as an ideal, just a real-world example of what it can look like when you\u2019re trying to do the \u2018right thing\u2019.**  \n  \nTo repeat my prior posts, I\u2019ve been tracking my income, spending, budget, and net worth since starting medical school in 2010.   \n  \n**Basic Stats**  \n* I took out about $160k in medical school loans (about $210,000 in 2024 dollars) and graduated in 2014. This was a very different time in terms of tuition, and I was helped by going to a public in-state school and a few need-based grants. I got married in 2014 as well, and our overall debt (student loans, cars, and credit cards) was $225k when I graduated.  \n* I started off residency putting some money towards loans every month and was able to get them down to around $200k. I did have a 403b match at my residency program so I contributed enough to max this, and I tried to contribute to a Roth IRA when I could. My wife was working as well. With the birth of our first kid in 2017 we started treading water financially.   \n* Fellowship pushed things further down, between my wife going stay-at-home, an unexpected car replacement, and probably overall less disciplined spending since the \u2018light at the end of the tunnel\u2019 was so close. I maxed out our Roth IRAs, but otherwise did not save at all. I did not have a work retirement plan available.  \n* Salary during my five years of GME training was $55-65k in medium cost-of-living cities. My wife worked for the first four of those years, bringing home $40-45k.  \n* We now are in a relatively low cost-of-living city. Base salary at my current job is $410,000. I receive an annual bonus which is generally around $30,000 for total comp of around $440,000.  \n* My wife has a hobby-turned-small-business which currently grosses in the high 4-figures annually.  \n* We finishing paying off my student loans in December 2022, after about 3.5 years as an attending.  \n  \n**Income and Spending**  \n  \nIn typical year given ~$450,000 pre-tax income, about $125,000 will go to taxes, $125,000 will go to spending, and $200,000 to savings.  \n  \nSince I became an attending 5 years ago, we have increased our net worth by **$1,465,000**, or an average of **$25,000 per month** over 58 months. Approximately $200,000 of this unfortunately came from an inheritance from my father between 2020-2021, but it is mostly a reflection of consistent saving and investing and maintenance of a reasonable lifestyle. Coming out of training it took us 10 months to go from a net worth nadir of -$156,000 to $0, with significant continued gains in 2020 and 2021. We remained about even in 2022, between the market pullback, buying a house, and getting a new car. 2023 things really began to skyrocket, from putting aside over $200,000 into saving and investments plus a ~24% rise in the US stock market (I saw about 21% with our diversified portfolio). Our investments are up about 10% year-to-date in 2024.  \n  \n**Disability Insurance**  \nI purchased an individual own-occupation disability insurance policy from Ameritas near the end of my residency training. The initial benefit was $5,000/month for a premium of $178/month. When I signed my attending contract at the end of fellowship, I exercised the future-increase rider that I had purchased and increased this to a benefit of $15,000/month for a premium of $472/month. This is a little bit more expensive than it might otherwise have been since I was over 30 when I bought the policy, and I have a couple minor chronic conditions. Like all disability insurance purchased with post-tax dollars, this payout would be tax-free at the time of disbursement.  \n  \nYou want disability insurance to afford a decent (not necessarily ideal) standard of living, and to allow for saving for retirement. Long-term disability will not pay out after age 65, so this has to be considered. For our current level of spending, the $180,000 per year post-tax benefit should allow for this. Because of the own-occupation rider I would also be allowed to work in another occupation without reducing my benefit. Disability (and life) insurance are most important in early career, given low assets, high debt, and a long runway of future potential earnings. As you build up your own stash (and have fewer years to work/live!), they become less important and can eventually be canceled.   \n  \n**Life Insurance**  \nI have three separate individual term life insurance policies, plus what is offered by my work. I use a laddering strategy, so I have three separate policies $1,000,000 each at 10 years, 20 years, and 30 years. This way my life insurance coverage phases out as I become less and less likely to need it due to accumulation of savings. For this I pay a combined $186/month, again a little higher because of some chronic conditions. In addition to this I have a $1,000,000 policy offered through my work for pennies each month, for a grand total of $4,000,000, or a little shy of 10x my base salary.  \n  \nWe have a $500,000 20-year policy for my wife at $17/month, and she also gets a $50,000 policy through my work. She is stay-at-home, but there would obviously be increased childcare expenses if anything were to happen to her.  \n  \n**Auto Insurance**  \nThrough Progressive. We pay $108/month for two vehicles, 2016 and 2021 model years. We plan to replace cars every 5-10 years. \n  \n**Umbrella Insurance**  \nThrough Progressive. We pay $20/month for $1,000,000 in coverage. I plan to increase this to $2,000,000 in the next year or so. There\u2019s no hard and fast rule for how much to carry, but most people seem to use an amount that approximates net worth.  \n  \n**Housing**  \nFor the first 3 years of my attending job, we rented a house for $1,850/month plus utilities. We bought a house in summer 2022 with a purchase price of $635,000, and we financed with 10% down on a physician mortgage at a 4.00% interest rate. Our timing didn\u2019t get us the rock bottom for rates, but we squeaked in under the wire before they really started skyrocketing. Total monthly payment is $3,580, and $2,730 is the mortgage itself. We used Truist and the experience was just okay. It felt like I had to micromanage quite a bit, but ultimately we got through the process with no major hiccups.\n  \nWhether to rent or buy is a common topic for trainees and new attendings. I generally subscribe to the idea that you should be 100% positive that you will be there for several years to even consider buying, like a longer residency or after the first few years of a job once you\u2019ve made sure it\u2019s a fit. Looking back we probably would have come out ahead if we had bought straight away in 2019, but it would have been a terrifying time with COVID and not knowing if I was going to keep my job or have to sell at a loss. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t have a $1,000,000 investment portfolio.  \n  \n**Student Loans**  \nI refinanced a portion of my student loans (federal loans that were unsubsidized, with a higher interest rate) with Laurel Road (formerly DRB) during residency. I refinanced to a variable rate at ~4%, down from the federal rate of 6.8%. This variable rate went up and down but mostly stayed about the same. At the end of fellowship I refinanced again with Earnest, this time the entirety of my student debt. I took a 5-year term with a variable interest rate at 2.5%. For 2.5 years it only went down, and it bottomed out at 0.16% for much of 2021. In 2022 it climbed back up again to around 4%, which is where it was when I paid it off. I refinanced my wife\u2019s graduate school debt at around the same time, also to a variable rate 5-year term. I paid off her loans in a lump sum in early November 2021. At no point did I have loans affected by the interest/payment pause, and we would have been considerably better off if I had just never refinanced them, but that\u2019s water under the bridge.  \n  \n**Savings**  \nWe use Ally which I have been very happy with. We typically have an emergency fund of ~$30-35k, which would cover about 3 months of expenses.  \n  \n**Investing**  \nOur investments include my 403b, non-governmental 457, and Roth IRA, my wife\u2019s solo 410k and Roth IRA, a taxable brokerage, as well as 529 accounts and custodial Roth IRAs for our two boys. Our kids were used in advertising for my wife\u2019s business when it was getting off the ground, which allowed her to employ them and contribute to the IRAs. We are not actively contributing to the custodial IRAs at the moment.  \n  \nAcross the retirement accounts and the taxable brokerage, our asset allocation is 63% US stocks, 18% international stocks, 10% US bonds, and 9% REITs. All in low-cost index funds. The 529 accounts and custodial Roth IRAs are in 100% US stock funds. Focus is on low cost, broad, passive funds. I do not have any holdings in direct real estate or syndications currently.  \n  \nI do have a smattering of cryptocurrency, a total of $10,000 principal, or ~1% of our investments. After going down to a low of $3,000, it\u2019s most recently back up to about $14,000 or 40% gain. I still think it\u2019s stupid.  \n  \n**Estate Planning**  \nWe have a living trust, wills, powers of attorney, and health care directives. I did these online with a company that did a good job (as confirmed by an attorney friend), but I think they no longer exist and we will probably just go with an in-person attorney next time we revise documents.   \n  \n**JUST SHOW ME THE CHARTS**  \nOverall, this is what the journey has looked like to date:  \nhttps://drpayitback.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/reddit-NW-Trend-Jun24.png  \n\nCurrent net worth statistics:  \nhttps://drpayitback.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/reddit-NW-Jun24.png \n\nFinancial independence progress:  \nhttps://drpayitback.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/reddit-FI-Jun24.png\n\nFor the few of you that have further interest, I have kept a blog [HERE](https://drpayitback.com) with a huge back-catalogue of posts though sparsely updated these days. I am sometimes on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DrPayItBack).   \n\nHappy to answer any questions, either pertaining to this post or previous ones, have a great day!",

            "This is benign don't worry",
            "I once saw a med student contaminate 3 foley caths before getting on the 4th try. Youre good homie just keep trucking,",
            "This is way more of a deal in your head than it is to anyone else. Simple, understandable mistakes like this dont affect evals (most of the time, some attendings suck but theyre gunna give a shit eval no matter what). The things that get you bad evals are poor effort/attention/attitude, not learning from mistakes, etc, not dropping something.",
            "Best thing to do is not let it get to your head and affect future performance. And don't keep bringing it up. It's an honest mistake.",
            "Make a joke about it \"the one time you guys give me a responsibility and I literally dropped the ball\". * chuckles * \"hahaha it's okay it happens to everyone\"",
            "Worked with an ophthalmologist and we were doing an intravitreal implant, before he picked up the syringe I literally reminded him not to hold it vertically bc the implant could fall out of the end of the applicator/injector, so it should be kept parallel. Two seconds after nodding he picks it up, holds it straight up and down, and a nearly $10,000 drug falls on to the floor in front of the patient. So mistakes definitely happen to everyone and in the grand scheme of things this is likely no big deal even tho it feels that way!"
