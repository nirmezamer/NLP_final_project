            "For non-trads / multiple gap year students, how did you adjust to returning to school? I know everyone\u2019s against pre-studying but I\u2019m kinda scared that I forgot how to study",
            "*Preface: This is looking into the future but something to consider as it's good to jump on this train early if you are going to do it. Also probably more information than you need right now but it's advice I got that helped me a ton. This is for when school starts, though, enjoy your break until then*\n\nIf anyone can swing it (you'll figure it out while you're in school) **I really, really recommend doing longitudinal study with Anki**. I used Anking v12 which you can keep updated for like $5 a month or just periodically with $5 as needed if you don't want to spend that cash. At first I wasn't sure if it was worth it but it has proven to be very helpful for me, personally.\n\nYou'll see it a thousand times here but I feel like a majority of my classmates did not do this. It's totally fine if you don't, plenty of people pass boards and match without it, but as someone who recently passed Step 1, it made my life so much easier. \n\n**Again, this is more than what you need for right now but just a testimonial for how keeping up with Anki reviews will help in the long run (even though it can really suck):**\n\nIf you have in-house exams or are at a DO school, it might be harder to do but especially if you have NBME based exams, it will make your life simpler in the long run. It is more work class-to-class but when our first CBSE (mock Step 1) rolled around I felt very prepared. I did ~60% of UWorld, two Uworld self assessments, new Free 120 and two CBSEs for board prep on ~2 weeks of \"dedicated\" which was pretty chill overall. \n\nIf you have the opportunity to get an AMBOSS discount, I'd recommend checking that out too. The \"for life\" thing is a lie (it's only for 4 years of med school) but the app is helpful and I completed the Qbank. The questions are geared for learning more than anything but between November and February I did ~30 questions a day and rolling into dedicated I was good to go. I also did most of USMLERx which is a good accessory if you need more practice questions during classes. They're a little easier IMO but it's tied in with First Aid so it's helpful and great reps. \n\nThere are some people who feel that AMBOSS is better than UWorld, I would say...idk. I think UWorld is closer to the real deal but AMBOSS (especially with the Anki addon) is a better every-day learning tool. It's important to treat it that way because the questions will have you pulling your hair out sometimes.\n\nFor practice question resources:\n\n**UWorld:** best for boards/exam prep IMO. Closest (but not the same) as the real deal.\n\n**AMBOSS:** great for learning, especially integrated with Anki addon. Will piss you off frequently. You can set a \"plan\" and it will allocate a certain amount of questions per day. I found this really helpful when classes sort of cooled off and I could focus on Step a little more before dedicated rolled around\n\n**USMLERx:** Great accessory before other Qbanks, a little easier but helpful. Also the easiest to sort if you're trying to target a specific set of topics.\n\n**tl;dr: if you can, keep up with your Anki reviews from class to class. It will save so much time, effort and anxiety come dedicated. GIVE IT A TRY but if you don't like it, that is also fine. I know plenty of successful people who do great without it. I think it's just the easiest way to stay on top of everything long-term.**",
            "From me as an MS4: Among the most important thing when picking a school is knowing your school has a home program in what you are interested in. Even if you do not know what speciality you want to do, try to figure out if you have an inkling interest(literally any type of possible intereste) in a competitive speciality, try to pick a school that has such home programs. That is amongst the biggest thing that differentiates students who match and go unmatch (of course other factors will matter).",
            "I feel like there are a lot of posts on here of M3/4s venting about the toxicity of their school or admin issues. How do we find out if a school is like that before attending? I feel like during interviews/second looks current students are a bit pressured to only say nice things",
            "1. How early should I try to lock in housing? I don't want to miss out on nice places but I also haven't been able to find any potential roommates yet\n\n2. How much time did/do you guys have for your hobbies during preclinical? Between studying, volunteering, mandatory classes, etc. I just have no sense of how much time I'll have left to chill, go gym, etc.\n\n3. How do you actually network to try and make connections with people at hospitals you'll want to apply for residency at in the future?",
            "What are habits that you have developed throughout med school that you wish you would have had from the beginning?",
            "when should i start supplementing my course work with outside resources like uworld/sketchy/pathoma/etc? are those only worth it when prepping for step or should you use them throughout school?",
            "Any recs for incoming medical students who have zero idea what they wanna do specialty wise? what research should you be looking for during M1-M2 if you\u2019re unsure around that time?",
            "For MS0's thinking of specialties...\n\n  \nI am a MS4 graduating matched into gen surg. Coming in I swore I would be doing anything BUT surgery. Thought EM for the first two years cuz I was an EMT. Got into the OR as a M3 and was so scared at liking surgery.\n\n  \nAll of this to say, keep an open mind. Shadow as a M1/2, do the research (esp if you are considering competitive stuff), but remember how while M3 is hard, you will learn what the day to day is like of things you may never have experienced.\n\n  \nWelcome to the hardest, but also coolest 4 years so far \ud83d\ude0e",
            "With the match becoming crazier by the day and PIs expecting longitudinal commitment to a specialty, when is the time to explore specialties you may be interested in?"

I feel fed up with hospitals and medicine in general. I just want to take my mind off this whole thing but it's impossible while working in a hospital. \n\nWhat can I do to motivate myself to study ? \nHow would you guys deal with a situation like this? \nSorry for the long rent, I just needed to get if off my chest I guesss.",
