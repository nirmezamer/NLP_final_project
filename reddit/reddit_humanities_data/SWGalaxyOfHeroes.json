            "I've been playing this game for years 6.5m.  Lately, I'm getting very tired of loosing to outmatched enemy squads, with lacking mod configs, only a couple lvl1 or 2 relics and a few gold gear12 against my squad with major mod setups on relic 7 & 8 chars. Buff and debuff abilities getting squashed, i.e., x can't be resisted or evaded, yet doesn't happen.  Enemy characters with debuffed heal, healing anyway, while my turn meter increases and healing effects don't appear to be working. What gives CG? Do they think seeing my heavy-weight squad loose to a feather-weight will convince me to spend even more money."

Beskar Armor Mando, Jedi Knight Anakin would be good overlap characters and are relevant, Grand Inquisitor could be a curve ball legendary requirement, if not him at least 1 relevant Inquisitor. \n\nCAT or could be a requirement but i dont see it, but you never know. She was one of the first conquest characters and a lot of people have her since shes popular and needed for a JMK team. Maul would be a fun curveball.\n\nBo katan mandalore would be too difficult. I cant see her being a requirement",
