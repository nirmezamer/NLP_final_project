            "I've been playing this game for years 6.5m.  Lately, I'm getting very tired of loosing to outmatched enemy squads, with lacking mod configs, only a couple lvl1 or 2 relics and a few gold gear12 against my squad with major mod setups on relic 7 & 8 chars. Buff and debuff abilities getting squashed, i.e., x can't be resisted or evaded, yet doesn't happen.  Enemy characters with debuffed heal, healing anyway, while my turn meter increases and healing effects don't appear to be working. What gives CG? Do they think seeing my heavy-weight squad loose to a feather-weight will convince me to spend even more money.",
