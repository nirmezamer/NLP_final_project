Had these administered one time in my life by a local PD and officer told me to my face that based on those two tests he was pretty certain I was under the influence, that he had a lot of experience administering these tests, and that taking a breathalyzer was my last chance. He had called another officer to the scene who observed all of this, and also watched while I blew a .00 in the machine. He was so embarrassed he let me go without giving me a ticket for a moving violation he claimed as the reason for pulling me over. Having to go through all that on the side of the road for 30 mins ruined the night. We were out for our anniversary and I had my wife sitting in the car worrying about what's happening.",
