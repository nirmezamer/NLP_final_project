If people are waiting to hear back from specific firms, please try to keep all discussion in a single thread (i.e. someone can start a Latham top comment in this thread, and people responding about movement should keep those as replies). \n\nFor anyone who doesn't know, a good chunk of firm recruiting is happening right now with pre-OCI. Send out applications or use your school's application portal to look for firms, get invited to do screeners and callbacks, and you can potentially save yourself the extreme stress of the actual OCI process.\n\nEDIT: We also do have a Discord server where you can chat about this. We'll be setting up a specific channel to talk about pre-OCI with threads for major firms\n\nhttps://discord.gg/lawschool",

            "Just wanna put an announcement for those of us who haven\u2019t seen movement who go to a T-14 and don\u2019t have high GPA\u2019s. an overwhelming majority of movement is for people with high GPA profiles. Several career counselors have told me that firms are going to get to lower GPA\u2019s later. People who are saying to panic by the end of the week if you don\u2019t hear anything are not right. The only people who should be panicking by the end of the week is if you have a very high GPA and you haven\u2019t gotten any movement. We just gotta sit tight and keep sending out apps!",
            "Any chance of this thread actually getting pinned, or is it going to fade off the front page and become useless like the other one?\n\nI know both the pinned threads rn are important but surely we can figure something out.\n\nETA: Thank you!!",
            "putting this in a separate comment because there seems to be a lot of anxiety- the norm in NY for many V30(ish) firms is now to go straight to callback, no screener. several DC offices of these firms have retained screeners, so these applicants are generally hearing/getting their interview process started before NY applicants. this is causing a lot of unnecessary panic. callback to offer will likely (but not definitely, so hang in there if you feel ghosted) be within a week for NY firms, but firms have way more pre OCI apps than last year and are taking their time to go through them, so don't write anyone off without a rejection letter just yet.",

            "When should we be concerned that we haven\u2019t heard back after a callback?? I feel like the only person in my friend group without an offer\u2026",

            "Is a nearly 2 week wait after a callback with no news likely a rejection?",
            "Any movement from Freshfields (NY)?",
            "Okay hi yall sorry for dooming the chat but when should I be a worried about lack of response in the pre OCI process? I know a lot of people are having screeners and CBs and stuff but I havnt gotten much traction at all and it\u2019s worrying me a bit\n\nBelow median at a T-14, I\u2019ve applied to over 100 firms across several markets (NY, DC, Boston)",
            "Anyone have insight on which firms have their classes full yet? And which are still planning on using Pre-OCI/OCI?"
