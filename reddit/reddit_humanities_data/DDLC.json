            "Man, life's killing me... People, be careful when you get into debt. I mean, I still can pay it, if I cut down a LOT for the next month, but it's gonna be a rough time. Savings are gone. Shit, I really messed up, I gotta do better from now on. Family situation is all messed up too, won't get into details.\n\nI guess this was not much of an update or conversation starter, more of a vent. I'll try to sit down, calm down, and figure out my next steps.",

            "I wish I had a friend like Sayori. It feels too easy for me to catch myself daydreaming about her being my friend and hanging out with me. Hope that doesn't sound weird. I guess I'm just lonely.",
            "I know it's funny haha day, but I kinda needed to get some poetry out of my system after replaying DDLC. It dredged up a lot of complicated feelings, so I just thought I'd try something. It's nothing perfect, but it's mine.\n\n-----\n\nSwirling voices beckon my return\n\nTo a small river\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nMy title feeling as foreign as the thoughts plaguing me\n\nDeteriorating diction truer than name\n\nOr face\n\nOr the water on my palms\n\nFrom a small river\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nSwells in my chest, tears that will never find their purpose\n\n>Fall\n\n>>Fall\n\nBut never cease\n\n-\n\nCascading\n\nBreath fading\n\n-\n\nSadness sings the theme to my stream\n\nPride's paces prodding the precious Earth\n\n>>Away\n\n>Further\n\nUntil the longing of a memory cascades overhead\n\nA home under the gentle currents\n\nA nice, clean place to let my lungs fill\n\nIn a small river\n\n\n-\n\n\n\nFeeling gloomy\n\nPlease entomb me\n\nIn a small river",
            "A little update on the whole Discord stolen account situation: I've tried to contact Discord and after almost two weeks they've done absolutely nothing and I still haven't received a response from them relating to my latest ticket I sent. The scammer who has stolen my account has also changed my account's name and profile to look just like the profile of the \"staff member\" that took my account called *Mark Smith* when looking at older messages in a few servers I'm in and it legit almost made me cry when I saw that. I've also received a dm from someone on Reddit who  lost their account because of the scammer using my old account. It's absolutely ridiculous that Discord has done jackshit about this so far and just let these scammers take the accounts of innocent users.\n\nAt least there's one highlight I've had lately and that's that I had a job interview yesterday at a company which makes car parts such as suspension and I got hired. I can already start next Monday so I'm actually pretty happy about that. Hopefully I can finally start earning some money and get back into a bit of a rhythm again.",
            "1 mo. ago",
            "What happened? :[",
            "I'm a few days into a month long game jam, and I just finished some sprite work.\n\nThings have quieted down since last time i posted on free talk friday, but I still feel a sense of unease. \n\nI just got the side order dlc for splatoon 3 as well.",
            "Today i just finished reading one of the most emotional DDLC fanfic at AO3, it somehow got me to read 440k words in one afternoon.\n\n\nLife is good!",
            "Decided to listen to a broader range of music lately, by checking out some playlists some friends of mine made. Seems my tastes are actually pretty broad!\n\nGot to say...it's an interesting experience going straight from an album by Billie Eilish to My Chemical Romance. (Neither of which I'd gone out of my way to listen to before) There's other, maybe even bigger, tonal shifts that come to mind - but eh, may as well give an example with the most recognisable names I can.\n\nThere have admittedly been a few songs I've disliked enough to skip, or that simply didn't interest me. But most of it, I've enjoyed - even songs it was assumed I would *dis*like. \n\nHasn't changed that Unlike Pluto is still my favourite musician by a lot, though~"
