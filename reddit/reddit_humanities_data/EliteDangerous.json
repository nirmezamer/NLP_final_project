            "o7 Commanders.\n\nSo I just picked up the game again after a few years of not playing. I went through all the tutorials again to refamiliarize myself with the game, but now I'm back into the actual game I have no idea what to do next. I spawned in at Long Sight Base in what seems to be an exploration ship. I looked in the galaxy view and also saw I have about 6 ships scattered amongst 3 different ports. Here are my current assets:\n\n\\* Vulture @ Diaguandri\n\n\\* Python @ Irula\n\n\\* Sidewinder @ Diaguandri\n\n\\* Dimondback Scout @ Diaguandri\n\n\\* Anaconda @ Diaguanadri\n\n\\* Fer-de-lance @ Diaguandri\n\n\\* ASP Explorer @ Long Sight Base (this is what I spawned in)\n\n  \nMy questions are, where do I even go to get started again in this game. I like playing in the open world, but I'd also like to stay safe until I understand where I'm taking a risk again. What systems are safe to be in? Furthermore, I'm sure I had different ships for different purposes, but I don't even know where to begin to figure that out. It certainly looks like Diaguandri was my \"home\" base so to speak, but I'm not sure why I'm currently in Long Sight or why I have a Python in Irula.\n\nAny tips/guidance to get me back into some kind of understanding of this game so I can start accomplishing some goals again would be very helpful.\n\n  \no7",
            "Is there an easy way to target/select a particular fleet carrier that your travelling to (for a delivery).  Right now, the best way I know is to go to the system, hang out in space just waiting to be interdicted while I'm scrolling through the list in the System map.  Is there anywhere I can paste the name in to search or some easier way to find one in a list of 30 or 40?",
            "What is the one I should save? What are the others for?\n\n[Image](https://i.imgur.com/S1r0Alj.png)\n\nPlaying on Odissey.\n\nPS: The black square is a 10 digit number",
            "Is there a safe way to enter glide mode instead of alway dropping into planetary flight? I've tried for an hour and I can't get it to work. I've tried reducing speed, keeping an eye on the angel and also the descent rate but whatever I do, I just get dropped in to planetary flight.",
            "Very new to the game, I've owned it for a long time but finally decided to jump in and commit to it after having tried NMS, Citizen and Empyrion more recently. \n\nIn order to jump or navigate to a location in the list of locations in the '1' screen I simply scroll up and down, but is there a faster way to find where my mission objective is or waypoint I set is without going up and down? I don't mind doing it, just curious if I may have missed or overlooked some instructions in the intro or if it's hidden in a mechanic of the game?",
            "Diaguandri is a popular system for buying ships and modules due to some of the highest availability and lower prices. \n\nI would guess your ship catalog is this:\n\n* Vulture - bounty hunting and dogfighting ship\n* Python - multipurpose, so could be used for anything, but likely combat or cargo\n* Sidewinder - starter ship\n* Diamondback scout - might be a fighter, or maaybe explorer\n* Anaconda - multipurpose, but probably your big space combat tank\n* Fer-de-lance - top-tier big fighter\n* Asp explorer - likely an explorer vessel",
            "It kinda depends on what you like to do.  Combat or exploration?  Your fleet makeup suggests maybe you're not that big into trading.  Do you like running missions?  Do you like the meta game?  Any of this ringing a bell?  As far as what areas are safe, I would say the answer is both anywhere and nowhere, depending.  It's *mostly safe* anywhere you go.  I would stay within about 100 light years of where you are at the moment.  The biggest danger is getting stuck way out in the deep black without a way to get home.  If you stay within a few jumps or so, that's less likely to happen.  If you have anything in your cargo hold, you're going to get jumped by (NPC) pirates.  Whereas if you have nothing or only limpets in your cargo hold, they'll mostly leave you alone.  If you play solo mode (chosen when you first open the game), that's pretty much all you have to worry about.  If you play open, then there are a few systems - Deciat and a couple of others, where player gankers like to hang out, or so I'm told.",
            "Before you take off, go to Galmap, pick the target system but don\u2019t plot the route yet, just click it, on your right there\u2019s a bunch of system related stuff. One of those options is viewing the local map (though sometimes it\u2019s not available for some reason)\n\nOnce you enter the System Map of your destination, there\u2019s going to be a fleetcarrier symbol next to the main star. That\u2019s your carrier menu, just scroll that and find the one you want to deliver to. If you hold the selection on the fleetcarrier directly, not only will it plot your jumps, it will automatically target the carrier once you enter the system. This works for any star, planet, planetside bases and stations as well within a given system.\n\nNOTE: this method only works on Live/Odyssey, Legacy/Console accesses the system maps differently.",
            "Custom 4.1 is the latest.\n\nIf 4.1 is not found, 4.0 will be used. 4.1 gets created when you make a change post Update 18. \n\nBackup is, well, a backup. Startup just tells it which pulldown name to try and default with. You can ignore both.\n\nMake a copy of your Custom 4.1. Rename it following these directions: [https://new.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/asav3r/naming\\_your\\_custom\\_bindings\\_or\\_how\\_i\\_learned\\_to/](https://new.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/asav3r/naming_your_custom_bindings_or_how_i_learned_to/)\n\nThen go into the game and select your new name from all four binding sections.\n\nThat is how you save it. Using Custom is just a recipe for disaster. Easily gets erased or overwritten.",
            "First: angle. Anything above 0 will fail, but I would say be steeper than 10 degrees otherwise the glide will fail and you'll still be far from the ground. Ideal for me is between 20-30. Anything too steep shows red (which I think hits at about 60). Get your angle before you get into glide.\n\nSpeed: when you hit the blue line you must be slower than 200km/s. This is *far* from the glide zone, but will still drop you into normal space if you hit it too fast.\n\nYellow line varies a bit by planet size, but safe speed is 5km/s or slower. From the blue line, fly 50% throttle and if you are going 20-30 degrees, you should be slow enough by the time. Very small planets will need you to slow down more, hit 0% throttle a few times to keep your speed down as you get closer to the yellow line. Very large planets can take a higher speed, but for now, play it safe.\n\nIf you still fail, look at the error when you drop out. It will tell you too fast, or which way your angle was bad. If its what the other comment mentioned, it will tell you if you're unable to land (I think it will stop you back at the blue line, though)."

        "content": "\"Greetings Commanders,\n\n3310 is a busy year for Elite Dangerous, with three Titans down already, Powerplay 2.0 in the works, four new ship variants on their way AND the other new feature we have not shared with you yet.\n\nThis year will also see us celebrate our 10-year anniversary - the love and support you have shown us over the years has been nothing short of incredible, and we want to share with you some other changes coming this year.\n\n#GAMEPLAY ADDITIONS AND CHANGES\n\nWe are excited to share more on Powerplay 2.0 over the coming months as we get closer to Update 19. We are confident the rework of this feature will not only allow players to pledge, engage with, and support their chosen power, but also visually see the impact their efforts have on the galactic landscape.\n\nIn addition, we will also be making some balancing changes to Engineering. Our focus will be on making Engineering more accessible and predictable, allowing you to focus on your ship build rather than the materials needed. As stated in the past, we also have another brand-new feature coming to Elite Dangerous later this year.\n\n#GAMESTORE AND PRICING\n\nOver the past few years, many of you have identified that the store has become hard to navigate and that it is difficult to find the content that you really want, with this in mind we will be refreshing the store to provide a better experience for our players.\n\nStarting in May 2024, you will notice a change in how we approach the gamestore \u2013 which will also include ARX pricing adjustments for some of our cosmetic items, alongside new product types which are detailed below. Players will continue to be able to earn ARX in-game by playing Elite Dangerous daily, or by contributing to events in game.\n\n#SHIP VARIANTS\n\nWe are excited to bring ship variants into Elite throughout the year and are looking forward to seeing how you make use of each one. Starting with the Python Mk II, we are pleased to announce that this will be available in game for Odyssey players on 7 August for credits at Shipyards across the galaxy.\n\nHowever, if you cannot wait until then you can get 3-month early access to this ship on 7 May from the store for 16250 ARX.\n\nNon-Odyssey owners will be able access ship variants from the store for ARX.\n\n#PRE-BUILT SHIPS\n\nWe\u2019re also going to be introducing a new category in the Elite Dangerous gamestore: Pre-built Ships. Pre-Built Ship packages will offer Commanders the opportunity to purchase ships that have been given a significant upgrade from their base models.\n\nWe envision these Pre-built Ships to be a quicker way for newer players to get involved in the areas they have the most interest in, or for our existing players who are considering a new career path in game, but do not have time to devote to a new build from scratch.\n\nA \u2018Pre-built\u2019 ship package will include instant-access to a pre-fitted ship, a ship kit, and a paintjob \u2013 and will typically be themed to match an activity within the game. For example, if you\u2019re looking to jump into the current AX conflict against the Titans, the AX Combat Jumpstart package will give instant access to an Alliance Chieftain with all the necessary modules to go straight into the action within the maelstrom.\n\nThe Python Mk II will also launch with a Pre-built Ship package, allowing you to kickstart your career in the latest ship, including a brand-new paintjob and ship kit.\n\n#COSMETIC ITEMS\n\nA \u2018Best Sellers\u2019 section will be added to the gamestore, including some of our most popular items, allowing Commanders to purchase items such as Midnight Black, Stygian and Chromed all year round. We will continue to add to the store throughout the year with that same focus on items that players care about the most.\n\nWe\u2019re excited to roll out Powerplay 2.0 and the Python Mk II, and we\u2019ll have more to show regarding Engineering and the brand-new feature coming later this year in future Frontier Unlocked livestreams. \n\no7\n\nArf",
