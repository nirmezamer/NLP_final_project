        "content": "Hello friends, \nI purchased a 1 year old house 2 months back in one of Melbourne west suburbs.\n\nI'm feeling buyer's remorse within the 2 months, because of the terrible Insulation in the house. House is not even giving 2 degree celsius Difference from outside, even all doors, windows and blinds are down.\n\nIs this common for all new houses ? Specific to my home ?\n\nCan I contact builder for this issue ? Or Do I need to hire any for looking into this insulation issues?\n\nAny info on this is really appreciated. Thank you very much in advance.\n\nEdit :\nFor the questions regarding the heating, here is a scenario that I have testing.\n\nOutside temp Is 10C. Heated the entire house to 22C using ducted heating and turned off. Exact an hour after, the home temperature came down to 15C, that is 7C down in an hour. \n\nI was hoping that the house(which is near to new build), will take at least 2-3 hours to come down to 15C, but it's a lot quicker than expected.",

            "Yep pretty common in Australia.  Minimum insulation requirements for new builds are a joke.\n\nGet some quotes to get batts installed in the roof cavity.  Will make a huge difference.",
            "Our rental was built in about 2008. Recently ripped out and replaced the bathrooms because they were constantly leaking water into the floor and causing the ceiling in the room below to collapse. Turns out there was never any waterproofing installed. Went to have a look at the ripped out bathrooms - was (mildly) surprised to also find out there isn't any insulation present either. Construction industry hasn't given a shit for a while by the look of it.",

            "If the house is one year old, then it was supposed to be built to a 6 star energy rating. Builders can be pretty lapse on how strictly they build to this code, but I doubt very much there is no insulation in the roof. Check the roof space it may just need some re-arranging. Also insulation does not work miracles, it merely slows down the speed at which a room heats up or cools down to match the surrounding temp. If you get multiple days with no sun and you are not running heating eventually empty rooms will get cold.",

            "My brother\u2019s house in Ireland stays at the same temperature all year round about 20\u00b0c, in the extreme cold of winter he puts a fire on but in reality it for aesthetics. The houses are built to an \u2018energy rating\u2019 the goes from \u2018A\u2019 to \u2018G\u2019, I think his must be an A or B. It\u2019s got double glazing. All the walls and the roof are insulated. I\u2019ve stayed with him in the autumn, outside temperatures about 7\u00b0c with no heat on and had to open the bedroom window. It was uncomfortably warm inside. Houses here in Australia are basically thrown up. If you\u2019ve seen the guy on Facebook who does building inspections you\u2019ll know.",
            "Your test is not sufficient to test the house insulation. If it was 10C when you started and it had been at that temperature for a while, then the air, plasterboards, floors, etc were all sitting at 10C. When you heated the house to 22C you just heated the air. If you touched any of the walls or any other part of the internal construction then they would still be sitting at 10C. To test properly, you would need to hold the temperature at 20C for at least 6 hours before switching the heat off. This would give you a much better sense of how well the house is insulated.\n\nNot saying you don't have poor insulation, just that your methodology is flawed.",
            "Interested to know, is your home brick veneer, double brick, other? Is it raise or on a pad.  I\u2019m in Perth where most homes are double brick, but our supposedly insulated home is the same.",
            "I was magically hoping the house we\u2019d brought would be warmer than the rental I was in for 6 years - it\u2019s colder (built 2008). I feel your pain"

            "This isnt a solely solid brick wall, otherwise you would be seeing bricks. It clearly has either gyprock or plaster on it. \n\nAs per the other commenter, its the joint line, you can tell by the distance they are spaced aligns with the size of gyprock panels. \n\nThis can be avoided if they gyprocker was better at their job, should have put thin framing between."

They said the vendor had unrealistic expectations of 1.5 to 1.6m but would work on them\n\nA few days later, they came back and said they\u2019ve got the vendor down to 1.45m\n\nYesterday we sent a final offer 1.43m\n\nREA texted this morning before their last open home and said our offer was sent to the vendor\n\nI\u2019m scared someone\u2019s going to come along and take it. I know there\u2019s other properties out there, but it is slim pickings at the moment and this is a solid house. \n\nDo you think we are negotiating the right way? Assuming they haven\u2019t come back to us today to accept it because they want to see what comes of the open home today? Plus, I\u2019m guessing contracts don\u2019t really get signed on the weekend.\n\nAny advice appreciated x \n",

            "Did you put a time limit on your offer? If not, they are likely to wait until Monday (at least) to see if anyone else offers.\n\nBtw I think your negotiation tactic is all good, just put a time limit on the offers and be ready to move on. That way the vendor has something to lose if they wait for potential offers from the open.",
            "Just came here to say that even though I\u2019m not sure if this is common practice, we\u2019ve definitely had a contract signed over the weekend! We sent our offer on a Saturday morning and got a signed contract by 6pm :)",
            "Umm you love the house...can u afford 1.45 million, youre afraid of losing it, theyve reduced their expectations and given u a figure to close. Offer 1.45 and be done with it. Its a long term investment anyway. Anything less and youll need to accept youre taking the risk of losing it over what 5 to 10k. Why arent u offering 1.45 is the Q id ask, unless its above u r budget?",
            "You\u2019ve done well.  Good luck. \nThey will wait to see what shakes out after the open home before you hear back.",
            "You are going the right way about it.  I would probably not have given them until Monday because others can pop into the mix.  On a side note you have offered $1,430,000 an increase of $10,000 on your initial offer.  The vendors have come down between $55 - 100k in their expectations, so psychologically they probably feel like they\u2019ve given away a lot more than your increased offer.  I believe that if the vendor got another bid then the REA would probably get back to you unless you said final offer no discussion.  I bought a house last year because the other people offered the same amount saying \u201cno further offer\u201d and i gave a shorter settlement period.  Also, if you really love this home and it is one you want to live in, then it is a lifestyle choice first and investment second.  If needed, I\u2019d be ready to pay the extra $20k because it is a minuscule percentage in comparison to the total price and if you can by with your head and your heart you will love your new home.  Fingers crossed you get it.  I have a friend did the same thing today\u2026the waiting is anxiety inducing! PS Lots of contracts are signed on weekends - busy time!",
