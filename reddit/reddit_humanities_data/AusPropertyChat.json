        "content": "Hello friends, \nI purchased a 1 year old house 2 months back in one of Melbourne west suburbs.\n\nI'm feeling buyer's remorse within the 2 months, because of the terrible Insulation in the house. House is not even giving 2 degree celsius Difference from outside, even all doors, windows and blinds are down.\n\nIs this common for all new houses ? Specific to my home ?\n\nCan I contact builder for this issue ? Or Do I need to hire any for looking into this insulation issues?\n\nAny info on this is really appreciated. Thank you very much in advance.",

            "Yep pretty common in Australia.  Minimum insulation requirements for new builds are a joke.\n\nGet some quotes to get batts installed in the roof cavity.  Will make a huge difference.",
            "Grab some earthwool ceiling batts from Bunnings. Easy to on install yourself and you\u2019ll save a ton of money on someone doing the job for you.",
            "2 degrees with what heating?  insulation doesn\u2019t make your house magically warm, it just slows the heat transfer.  \n\nJust like an eski doesn\u2019t keep things cold without ice. \n\nIf the house is not mega insulated and no passive solar design (designed to be heated by the sun), then you still need to heat it some how.  \n\nTurn the heat pump on, see what it uses and then you can see if you actually have an issue.",
            "What sort of window coverings? Put up some heavier drapes",
            "Installing insulation in the roof isn't that difficult if you're even a little bit handy, will cost you a couple grand",
            "Roof insulation batts are not very expensive, and you can install them yourself. You will need a ladder to get into the roof cavity, possibly some planks to use to safely walk/kneel around the roof cavity, protective glasses and a mask, and you may want to turn off electricity to the whole house for safety. (As you don't know  the condition of the wiring, and if there are any loose/poorly done electrical connections in the roof) \n\nDo some research first and watch some videos about how to move around a roof cavity, and what is/isn't ok to step on. You'll want to get the highest R value you can afford. R6 is fairly standard, but R7 and even R8 is available, depending on your budget and what you can fit into your roof. R6 should still be a significant upgrade however.\n\nIf you've had a quick look in your roof cavity and think it will be too difficult/scary for you, then contact a professional to get it done. \n\nGood insulation can reduce heating/cooling costs by a significant amount, so this is well worth it either way, but it's definitely possible to DIY, just take safety precautions.\n\nAlso consider heavier blockout-style curtains. Since you don't want to spend a lot of money, something like Ikea curtains are a good, DIY-friendly option. Keeping these closed at night will help reduce heat loss.",
            "If the house is one year old, then it was supposed to be built to a 6 star energy rating. Builders can be pretty lapse on how strictly they build to this code, but I doubt very much there is no insulation in the roof. Check the roof space it may just need some re-arranging. Also insulation does not work miracles, it merely slows down the speed at which a room heats up or cools down to match the surrounding temp. If you get multiple days with no sun and you are not running heating eventually empty rooms will get cold.",
            "There are so many different factors that are apart of this and it's not something you usually think about with your first house.\n\nType of construction - double brick, brick veneer, siding.\n\nThis will have significant different insulation factors.\n\nEven things like ceiling heights matter.\n\nThen we have all the other stuff, roof insulation, wall insulation, windows and doors, seals on all the windows and doors, the list goes on an on. \n\nSome things can be changed and some can't and some depend on the type of construction.\n\nBut yeah generally if you didn't request anything then you get the bare minimum. It's unlikely there are faults from the builder (as in things not installed properly), you get what you pay for essentially.\n\nUnfortunately most stuff you won't be able to change and the majority of the stuff you can change will be very expensive.",
            "Our rental was built in about 2008. Recently ripped out and replaced the bathrooms because they were constantly leaking water into the floor and causing the ceiling in the room below to collapse. Turns out there was never any waterproofing installed. Went to have a look at the ripped out bathrooms - was (mildly) surprised to also find out there isn't any insulation present either. Construction industry hasn't given a shit for a while by the look of it.",
            "Is it a steel frame house?\n\nIf so, the insulation in the walls isn\u2019t worth the money."

            "Keen to see what the masses think, because my builders opinion is there's not really any large companies doing a *good* job and I would tend to agree. Materials and Labor prices make it nearly impossible for them to do a job for the prices people would be willing to pay for a *good* job. Most builders hope you don't get independent stage inspections and you don't look to close at things.",

I received an invoice from South East Water for a bill from 13 May to 1 June, addressed to my name. \n\nGiven that I didn't settle into the place until 1 June, I'm thinking that's not my bill and since I didn't use any water as the place wasn't mine until 1 June. \n\nShould I just suck it up and pay it or contact the agent who I bought the place to try to get the previous owners to pay for it? \n\nThanks for your advice.

            "It should have been accounted for at settlement - an estimate would have been done for the period between the last meter reading and settlement date based on previous bills, and that amount taken off the final sum you paid.  So you\u2019ll need to pay it, but the previous owners have already effectively paid you for that as well.  Your settlement documents should have something about it.",
            "I\u2019ve been wondering the same thing\u2026 before settlement I got an email from my solicitor with the rates etc that I had to pay and there was a line in there that said \u201cthe water usage has been accounted for\u201d. I queried it after settlement as there wasn\u2019t a specific amount for water use, and asked how exactly it had been calculated, but the solicitor couldn\u2019t give me a helpful reply. I suspect I might also get a water bill with the previous owners use that I\u2019ll have to pay, because how the hell am I supposed to track them down and make them pay? Oh well.",
