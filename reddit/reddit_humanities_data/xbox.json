            "Honestly I'm all for it, as long as they don't cost cut so much that quality clearly suffers for it.\n\n\nWe're at the point where sequels/continuations to big games take half a decade + to relase.\u00a0\n\n\n- Halo 5 - Infinite was 6 years.\n- Gears 5 - Eday is already at 5 years and will likely be six.\n- Bethesda took 8 years after Fallout 4 to release Starfield.\n- We just got Hellblade's sequel after 7 years.\n- We're going to get GTA 6 12 years after GTA 5 and 7 years after Red Dead 2.\n\n\nNow granted, COVID fucked a lot of shit up and we're finally turning the corner from it, but back in the day I remember playing games and their sequels would be out within a year or two, with 3 years usually being reserved for hardware transitions.\n\n\n- Halo 2 - 3 was 3 years. The trilogy released over 6 years and we had ODST and Reach before the end of 2009\n\n\n- The Original Jak and Daxter trilogy was released from 2001-2004\n\n\n- the Sly Cooper trilogy released from 2002-2005\n\n\n- Morrowind, Oblivion, Fallout 4, and Skyrim all released in a 9 year gap (2002-2011), just shy of how long it took us to get Starfield.\n\n\n- GTA 4 released in 2008 and Red Dead Redemption in 2010. Both games also received substantial DLC's before GTA 5 released in 2013...\n\n\n- From Soft released Dark Souls 1, 2, and 3 from 2011-2016, with Bloodborne also releasing in that timeframe, with every game getting DLC.\n\n\n-\u00a0 After Dark Souls was done we got Sekiro in 2019, Elden Ring in 2022, and Armored Core in 2023.\n\n\nThe scope creep and dev times on a lot of games are out of hand. I'm all for supporting the creative process, but when devs like From Soft have put out 7 critically acclaimed games in 12 years and just released a game sized expansion to Elden Ring, which is now the highest rated expansion to a game **ever** in the 13th year since Dark souls 1 and in that time we've gotten like 3 games each from exclusive properties it's just getting ridiculous.",
            "2 years for the Elden Ring expansion is still too much, The Witcher 3 or Skyrim delivered equally big expansions much faster.\n\nPlus From Software is a bad example because their games are 90% just copy & paste from previous titles, half the enemies in Elden Ring are ripped from Dark Souls and Bloodborne complete with the same move sets and sounds. There is the same door opening animation since DS1. Of course they can make games faster that way when they barely improve.",
            "Don't forget a lot of games have an artificial wait time because of the online service games that are propped forward to be money makers. I'm convinced the only reason they made Starfield was because Bethesda wanted to make a new game that wouldn't tank Elder Scrolls Online or Fallout 76. GTA5... nuff said, GTA online prints money and is way cheaper to maintain instead of jumping straight into GTA6.\n\n\nAll of those older games you mentioned didn't have that variable to consider. They only made their money the first couple weeks of release then the used game market would gobble it up. It's no wonder they dive directly into making the next game.",
            "Hellblade 2 is such a joke. Mind you it's one of the most beautiful games out there and without a doubt the animation quality is baffling. It feel unreal at a point at how realistic the overall movements of characters can be.\n\nBut in the end its like a glorified tech demo than a game.",
            "They are reusing some animations and maybe few enemies but it no where near as you exaggerate to be. They also do fully new map, art, great number of enemies, new lore and so on. FromSoftware develops games quickly because they don\u2019t do tons of mocap, voice recording etc. Also they really don\u2019t care about optimization too.",
            "> They are reusing some animations and maybe few enemies but it no where near as you exaggerate to be.\n\nIt is, especially considering the game was in developement since 2016. \n\n[Watch this comparison and come back telling me the game isn't just a Dark Souls 4 with open world](https://youtu.be/SkaWgiXjWHg?si=PpNVcvNY_OjH6NPE&t=101)"

            "Elden ring also beat TLOU2 as the most GOTY awarded game of all time worldwide, amazing feat since TLOU2 got like 320 GOTY awards.",
            "While Elden Ring is generally receives 90+ scores from critics, user scores tend to be a little lower whereas Witcher 3's user scores are more in line with critics's verdicts.\n\nI'm not saying Witcher 3 is the better game, I'm just saying that Elden Ring seems a litte more polarizing. Either you love it or you hate it. Fore me personally Witcher 3 is a much more accessible game. I just couldn't get into Elden Ring. Maybe I should try the expansion?",
            "Shadow of the Erdtree is exciting, no doubt. Elden Ring was incredible. \n\nBut man\u2026 I just don\u2019t think an expansion will ever top Phantom Liberty for me. Ever since I finished Cyberpunk just nothing has held my interest.",

            "What the fuck 320?",
            "Witcher is more accessible over Elden Ring. I daresay that accessibility will be what tips it for user scores.\n\nElden Ring has no difficulty setting them make it easier, and the story/lore is fragmented (deliberately so) and hidden behind a lot of findable items.",
            "Well, to get to the Elden ring expansion you have to beat most of the game unless you know exactly what to do. If you\u2019re very good at the game you can get in after like 10 mins of starting."

Is there some sort of exclusivity deal with Playstation.\"\n\nAnd technically this sums that up:\n\nI asked both Microsoft and Game Science to comment on the \"optimizations\" issue, seeking some clarity. Was the Xbox Series S to blame? Game Science didn't respond, but this morning, a Microsoft spokesperson offered the below statement.\n \nAnd also who responded from Microsoft. A \"spokesperson\" whomever that is.\n\nNot saying there might not be a deal in place but it could just as easily them trying to ship a game to meet a investor demand and don't have the manpower to dev the Series S version right now.

Did y'all not experience the last 2 years of Xbox history? \n\nSuddenly the line is that it can't *possibly* be the Series S that is causing issues, because the Series S has *never* caused issues, it is *just* as powerful as the Series X. In fact, probably *more* powerful. Developers probably love developing for the Series S more than any other platform, actually.\n\nN-no, not that, it's gotta be a... a secret exclusivity deal! Yeah, that's it! Not our Series S! Couldn\u2019t be the precious Series S!",
