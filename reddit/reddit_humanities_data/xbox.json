For those unaware - this was a [limited time user flair for early and founding members of that group](https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/1rvop9/how_to_add_day_one_flair/), but sadly it was lost as the mod team at the time moved on to a different system. Further complicating the issue, Xbox has somewhat buried the achievement making it difficult to recover - or even find at all.\n\nThat said, we've been working on this one for a while and **think** we have a working solution. If you would like the Day One flair for your own profile, please do the following. It's not easy, and we won't be handing these out with validation - but it is a great way to celebrate your own long history with the Xbox platform.\n\n1. Find a gamer who already has it pinned to their feed. They don't have to be a friend - they just need to have it pinned to their feed. (you can search gamertag 'mocoworm' of 'f0rem4n' on your console as a starting point if you don't know anyone with the achievement).\n2. Click see 'full profile'>tab over to 'social'\n3. Click on the pinned achievement, then click on \"Xbox One - Go to official club\" on the right.\n4. In the club, navigate to the Progress tab and there you will see your own Day One achievement unlock.\n5. Click on the achievement, click on \"Share\", then you can share it to your own activity feed.\n6. Go to your own feed, click on the achievement and then 'more actions', then pin it.\n7. Post a photo or screenshot with your gamertag visible in this thread, and you will be awarded the day one user flair.\n\n# Important notes:\n\n* These will not be assigned instantaneously. It needs to be done manually, and the team will sweep this thread at regular intervals. If you think we missed you, please do send a modmail and we will review.\n* This is a limited user flair - this means if you change to something else, you will not be able to change back.  Ride or die if you will.",

If anyone wants to link to their unlock there - I don't see an issue with that. This is mostly a spot of fun, but having some form of validation helps give a little more weight to the designation. \n\nGood suggestion and thank you.",

            "I love these games and it's absolutely ridiculous EA is just letting the IP die. They should sell it and let some dev who actually cares about the IP work on it. I hate EA so much for this, even more so as a lot of work was put into Asylum  (a possible third game).",

Super clunky controls at a time when most other 3rd person platform adventures had far superior controlling characters. The platforming was also very clunky as was the very shallow combat.  \n\nIve tried restarting them several times and I just cant get very far into them due to the lack of smooth gameplay. \n\nIts a shame because I would have loved for them to have been great playing games. Theyre both in my XB library so I might give them a shot just to remind myself how clunky they are. \n\nSorry I know thats going to be an unpopular opinion seeing as this is trying to celebrate the games. I am happy to celebrate them too on that level of beautiful art and intriguing tone.",
            "> Super clunky controls at a time when most other 3rd person platform adventures had far superior controlling characters\n\nThe first game released in the year 2000 as a PC game. It plays like all platformer did at the time. \n\nWhat PC games controlled better?\n\nThe second game played like a third person shooter. Something makes me believe that EA pushed for that lol. But also the cutscenes just became silly and overly dramatic with \"ahh she's nuts because tough upbringing\" rather than mysterious and interesting with dark thoughts.\n\nThe series died with the first game imo. I enjoyed the first to completion on Xbox, but could barely push through the few hours I spent on the second game.",
