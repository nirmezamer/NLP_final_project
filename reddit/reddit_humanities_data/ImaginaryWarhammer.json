            "Inspo (kinda) - This part from Wrath of Iron\n\n>\u2018Psychological states exist in which a healthy subject comes to harm himself,\u2019 she said. \u2018He lets himself waste away through neglect, or cuts his own flesh, or desires to have limbs amputated where no wound has been inflicted. The image he has of his body is distorted, and it is difficult for others to understand such an impulse, since they can have no insight into what he sees when he stands before a mirror.\u2019\n\n>Ys spoke in a measured, confident manner, as if her speech had been long prepared. \u2018The body of a Space Marine is the most perfect human form ever created,\u2019 she said. \u2018Even our skitarii, given every augmetic aid known to us, do not compare to it in power and facility. You can imagine what degree of mental trauma would be required for a human to give up such a gift, to mutilate himself and replace his priceless gene- forged heritage with mechanical parts.\u2019\n\n>\u2018Forgive me, magos,\u2019 said Nethata, \u2018but your own kind are not exactly immune to that.\u2019\n\n>Ys nodded, and Nethata had the same impression again\u2013 the impression that under her cowl she had just smiled.\n\n>\u2018We take ordinary bodies and make them better,\u2019 she admitted. \u2018We do so because we desire to improve on what we were born with. The Iron Hands cannot make their bodies better, since they are already perfect. Nevertheless, still they amputate their limbs in favour of metal parts and aspire to the state of machine- hood. Why? Because they\u00a0fear\u00a0their flesh, lord general. They look at it in the mirror of their minds and they see something loathsome. It is difficult to understand such an impulse, since, as I said, we can have no insight into what they see when they stand before the mirror.\u2019\n\n>Nethata pursed his lips, considering what he was being told.\n\n>\u2018So the augmetics,\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s because\u2026 they can\u2019t help themselves?\u2019\n\n>\u2018Something like that.\u2019",
            "Iron Hands are my favorites, questioning one's own weaknesses is one of the most human things among all the Chapters. This gave me a lot of NieR Automata vibes.",

            "This is why I love the Brazen Claws (besides the badass quartered color scheme). Second founding succesors of the Iron Hands that missed most of the Heresy (because BL authors forgot they existed, so FW had to make up an excuse), so to the shame of losing their primarch they add the shame of missing the Heresy war, and *then went on to lose their home planet, prompting the entire chapter to launch a crusade* ***inside*** *the Eye of Terror, which they survived.* \n\nThey make the Lamenters look lucky.",
            "Awesome art, I really feel for the Iron Hands and their perceived weaknesses, even after all this time they still wish to be like their Primarch...and can't stop blaming themselves for his downfall.",

            "Im guessing the imperium would not have too much problem with it as long as its not based on alien technology like it is in Star Wars. \n\nAlthough they may just prefer to cheaply recruit from one of many hive cities if they determine that additional skill/loyalty of a clone is not worth the hefty price they come with.",

            "Imperium doesn't mind if your tithe outweighs the heresy. See, Kriegers and Necromunda. That being said, they may be exceptions to the rule, so be sure to ask your planetary governor. \n\nAussie Clones doing Steve Irwin impressions is adorable. Can you imagine how many alien creatures they can find? :D",
            "So, someone here mentioned the Afriel stain. In a story, the imperium tries to make a clone army a la Star Wars. It works really well! However the universe fights back against it causing all of the clones to have improbable bad luck until all are dead except one. So one of the concepts of Warhammer is that the fabric of the universe and souls are tied together... somehow. The best group that expresses this is the Eldari who, at one point could reincarnate, but no longer can because Slanesh eats their souls. One aspect of this in Warhammer is that souls are kinda malleable and can be combined/shattered... somehow... for plot reasons. The Afriel strain story suggests that the soul of the clones person was split amongst all of the clones and the universe doesn't allow that.\n\n There's some speculation about the Kriegers, so far it's not definitive in the lore, but they maybe vat grown using Colonial Yergan's DNA. It appears the soldiers can be both male and female, so we're not totally clear on what's happening. However, I would guess it's similar to how the Votann operate, but more crudely. The Votann are mostly a clone species of Space Dwarf, but can also have children normally. Both the Votann and Krigers get away with not having the Universe face-fist them by making each individual....and individual basically.",
            "I mean, having in mind that the Clone army is one of the best armies in star wars universe (some even say its the best) I think they would let it slide.\n\n\"Oh, they dont make mutants, thdy age rapidly so they dont get out of control, they have a chip that can be ysed to control em if needed and they are extremely efficient.
