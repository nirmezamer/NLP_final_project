            "To those who work at a movie theater, what's it like to work in one? I've been recently trying to find another job and AMC (which is the closest theater where I'm from) is one of my picks.",
            "I had a weird exchange in r/movies where someone said it\u2019s ludicrous that Paramount didn\u2019t make an Ilsa Faust Mission Impossible spinoff movie, and I said the decision to not do that makes sense especially with Furiosa flopping in a similar situation. Then the commenter blocked me and my comments are downvoted \n\nIs it wrong to say it\u2019s a risky move to make an Ilsa Faust spinoff because it might perform bad? Genuinely curious for opinions on this, please feel free to tell me I\u2019m wrong if you think so",
            "I worked in a theater six years ago, albeit for a few months. \n\nIt wasn't really chaotic. I often worked at the box office, and this place where people must show their ticket so I can let them in. We sold the most tickets for *Venom*. The least interesting part for me was working at the popcorn and candy section, cause it's much more stressful.",
            "It\u2019s  a great starting job if you love movies, it\u2019ll get really busy on weekends and whenever a big movie comes out but as someone who enjoyed just being in the cinema it as miles ahead of working in fast food on a busy day \n\nWorst part will be cleaning out theatres after a busy session",
            "Tom Cruise is the face of the franchise. The best shot anyone else has, male or female, is by being a co-lead with Cruise in a main installment. While I guess Paramount could technically make a spin-off or series around other people in the IMF, there's not really proof it'd do well . \n\nWhereas something like Top Gun has more potential to use the newcomers like Miles Teller and Glen Powell to keep the steam even if Cruise wasn't as big of a player.",

            "Watched A Quiet Place Day One. I really enjoyed it. This whole franchise is great in mostly the same ways so it's hard to compare to the others. But I would highly recommend it to anyone.\n\n\nI also planned on watching Horizon sometime this week until I learned that it's not just a 2 parter, but a 4 part movie series. They keep advertising parts 1 and 2, since I guess those are the ones that were made so far. That just lessened my enthusiasm for the prospect so much. Especially since it's 3 hours long and apparently only tells 1/4 a story.",

But it\u2019s never quite moving. - Owen Gleiberman, Variety\n\nAny of these plotlines might have sustained an hour of compelling television but they don\u2019t add up to much in this awkwardly stitched quilt, which rarely provides the space for anyone\u2019s experiences to resonate. - David Rooney, Hollywood Reporter\n\nA spectacularly unsubtle movie. **1.5/4** \\- Mark Kennedy, Associated Press\n\n\u201cHorizon\u201d is the kind of auteur project that makes one long for the idea of studio notes, for anyone to push back on Costner\u2019s worst instincts. Unfortunately, he proves to be the judge, jury and executioner of his own passion project. **1.5/4** \\- Katie Walsh, Tribune News Service\n\nThe film may be pretty to look at, but this passion project isn\u2019t likely to generate much of it. - Kyle Smith, Wall Street Journal\n\nThe dark reality of manifest destiny is a worthy topic, and worthy of a much better film. One in which we have even a modicum of investment in any of the characters. **1/4** \\- Johnny Oleksinski, New York Post\n\nIt\u2019s a semi-profound if not exactly original concept, sometimes articulated in that hamfisted-yet-poetic way Costner\u2019s worked since his still-greatest directorial statement, \u201cDances with Wolves.\u201d It\u2019s delivered best visually... **2/4** \\- Bob Strauss, San Francisco Chronicle\n\n\u201cHorizon,\u201d so far, anyway, is more about a certain set of movie memories than a movie of its own. **2/4** \\- Michael Phillips, Chicago Tribune\n\nPart of the pleasure of Horizon is the sheer, magisterial sweep of the thing \u2013 with mountains and buttes and mesas like these, who needs CG? But its texture lives in small, telling details. **4/5** \\- Robbie Collin, Daily Telegraph (UK)\n\nCostner boasts an instinctive understanding of the archetype and thus elevates the role and each line beyond the possibility of camp. **3/5** \\- Kevin Maher, Times (UK)\n\nThe film\u2019s impressive sense of scale and majesty is amplified by the swirling John Debney musical score. It\u2019s just a pity that the exposition is so clunky and so slow on the draw. **2/5** \\- Geoffrey Macnab, Independent (UK)\n\nCostner\u2019s real reverence for the classic western dances with disaster by passing off the first of his four-part saga as epic filmmaking instead of a trio of speechifying, clumsily linked one-hour episodes that play like a TV series with no direction home. - Peter Travers, ABC News\n\nNobody has done more to keep the western flame kindling on the big screen than Kevin Costner, but the audacity of his latest rodeo feels like overreach, if not outright folly. - Brian Lowry, CNN.com\n\nBut a film \u2013 certainly a Western \u2013 needs to have a plot, a bit of credible characterisation, and a structure that preferably includes a beginning, middle and end. Horizon doesn't have any of those. **1/5** \\- Nicholas Barber, BBC.com\n\nI\u2019m just not sure how much of a buy-in audiences will feel when this movie wraps up, even if the final five minutes is a ludicrous montage of \u201cscenes to come.\u201d **C** \\- Jordan Hoffman, Entertainment Weekly\n\nAt least Horizon accomplishes one staggering feat: it makes one wonder if we were maybe a little too hard on The Postman. - Richard Lawson, Vanity Fair\n\nThe first part of a planned four-part epic saga strives for a lot, but serves more to remind us of the best of the genre without achieving it itself. - Stephanie Zacharek, TIME Magazine\n\nIt's fine for an epic to sprawl, but you want a sense of purpose at the same time, and this one sometimes loses its way. Still, it\u2019s handsomely shot and well performed, a throwback to the glory days of event-movie horse operas. **3/5** \\- Helen O'Hara, Empire Magazine\n\nIt has the cinematography you\u2019d expect of a Western, as well as the vast landscapes and the emphatic, sweeping music... What it doesn\u2019t have is anything original to say if, that is, it has anything to say at all. - Deborah Ross, The Spectator\n\nSo expansive and incomplete that it resembles a modern television series awkwardly edited into feature form. - Nick Schager, The Daily Beast\n\nThe biggest problem with Horizon is that, even with its lengthy running time, Costner has only scratched the surface of the \u201csaga\u201d he\u2019s trying to tell. There is no arc to what happens, just the seemingly unending introduction of characters. - Esther Zuckerman, The Daily Beast\n\nThese aren\u2019t characters so much as the spokes of a plot in human form, each of their storylines moving as if being pulled by horses across the entire span of the American West. **C-** \\- Ryan Lattanzio, indieWire\n\nThe film is all table-setting, with the stories lacking in polish and dramatic momentum and the characters never developed beyond archetypes. **1/4** \\- Derek Smith, Slant Magazine\n\nThe biggest issue with this film is that in its rush to tell all these stories, it doesn\u2019t have time for the kinds of nuanced moments that make characters feel alive and real. - Liz Shannon Miller, Consequence\n\nThe often bewildering and somewhat underwhelming first installment of Kevin Costner's Western epic is long on characters but short on story. **2/4** \\- Oliver Jones, Observer\n\nRetroactively treating the frontier as the direction in which we were always headed is a slick way to absolve individual settlers of making the decision \u2013 then and now \u2013 to benefit from genocide. - Radheyan Simonpillai, Zoomer\n\nWhile the first film in the possible \u201cHorizon\u201d series does well in setting up future pictures, this single film is a chore to sit through. **2/4** \\- Robert Daniels, RogerEbert.com\n\nA visually impressive endeavour that sets the stage for a larger journey. While it struggles with pacing and narrative cohesion, it manages to hold promise for future instalments to build upon. Impressive stuff, but a little too schmaltzy in places. **3/5** \\- Linda Marric, HeyUGuys\n\n**SYNOPSIS:**\n\nIn the great tradition of Warner Bros. Pictures\u2019 iconic Westerns, \u201cHorizon: An American Saga\u201d explores the lure of the Old West and how it was won\u2014and lost\u2014through the blood, sweat and tears of many. Spanning the four years of the Civil War, from 1861 to 1865, Costner\u2019s ambitious cinematic adventure will take audiences on an emotional journey across a country at war with itself, experienced through the lens of families, friends and foes all attempting to discover what it truly means to be the United States of America.\n\n**CAST:**\n\n* Kevin Costner as Hayes Ellison\n* Sienna Miller as Frances Kittredge\n* Sam Worthington as First Lt.

            "Saw this yesterday afternoon. It was excellent. Yes, it\u2019s a setup movie but I would never say it doesn\u2019t feel like a movie on its own as well. Anybody who loves westerns like Open Range will love this.",
            "I understood that this project had some unique ambitions but now I am seeing people say that this is Part One of Four? That\u2019s just not going to work",
            "I saw it yesterday at AMC and live in a small market. I went to the matinee at 15:00 local time, including myself, there were 3 of us who saw it. This is not unusual as I attend mainly matinees, occasionally by myself or another person. I knew little about the film going in and knew there would be subsequent chapters. Viewed as an introduction, I liked the film enough to purchase a ticket for chapter-2.",
