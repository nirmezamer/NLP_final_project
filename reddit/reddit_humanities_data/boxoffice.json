            "The results are in for the [long range forecast for *Twisters*.](https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/1djm05w/rboxoffice_long_range_forecast_twisters/)\n\n- $53.31 million OW / $176.77 million DOM / $432.06 million WW\n\nWith 44 predictions, this was our most predicted film so far.\n\nThanks for participating! We're predicting *Deadpool & Wolverine* next week.",
            "I kind of want to put into perspective how bad 2024 is doing compared to 2023. Disney for example had a pretty bad year last year. But their bombs, like Ant-Man 3, The Marvels, Haunted Mansion, and Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny would be in the top ten domestic before May. Indy 5 would be the fifth highest grossing film of 2024 domestically. Ant-Man 3 would be above Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire and Kung Fu Panda 4 domestically. The Little Mermaid would be the highest grossing film of the YEAR domestically, and the 3rd highest grossing film WW. So would Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. Elemental would be the second highest grossing animated film of the year (before the release of Inside Out 2), only behind Kung Fu Panda 4. Dune Part 2, the highest grossing film of the year, would only be barely above Fast X WW (not Disney but that\u2019s how bad this year is doing)\n\nI don\u2019t think people realize that without Disney, early 2023 would be on par with 2024. Ant Man boosted the numbers in February along with the massive continued success of Avatar: The Way of Water. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 opened May strong and The Little Mermaid ended it strong. Both films provided over 450m to the month of May. Subtract that from the overall May gross and you get\u2026 334m, which is actually worse than 2024. Hell, even if you remove Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes\u2019s gross from the month, you get 411m, which is much better than no Disney 2023 May. So once Disney is gone from the first four months, you get 2024. I just think that\u2019s interesting because I think that means the theatrical market place is heavily reliant on Disney and if they don\u2019t deliver the box office suffers as a result.",
            "I've probably said this to some posters already, but I think Paramount actually had THE worst 2023 out of 5 major studios. Universal was obviously having a time of their lives with films like **The Super Mario Bros. Movie** and **Oppenheimer**, Warner Brothers may had a colossal embarrassment with **The Flash**, but **Barbie** and **Wonka** were still enough to compensate (for) that, and Sony had **Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse** becoming a success. Even Disney had 2 ceremonial wins with **Elemental**, which left its legacy thanks to its insane legs, and **Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3**, which became the only major success among films that had the budget of $200 million or higher that year.\n\nWith Paramount, on the other hand, I honestly can't think of a single blockbuster-level success. Every single blockbuster films that they've made either underperformed or flopped due to their poor release date managements and ones that DID become successes like **Scream 6** probably felt pale when compared to other studios' major successes.",
            "The teaser for Nosferatu apparently drops on Monday. Anyone got some early predictions? I was able to see it in the theater yesterday and while it is disturbing, I think it has more potential to break out and be a modest success over the holidays. \n\n$17m OW (maybe like $24m 5 day weekend)\n\n$55m DOM \n\n$110m WW",

            "Cinemark is doing a promotion for the Movie Club members where if you go see Thelma opening weekend they will give you a movie credit to go see any film you want. I took it and saw the movie.\u00a0\n\nI really enjoyed it, although I'm the age where I related much more to the grandson character than Thelma herself. And I'm not the most pop-culture savvy guy. I had no idea who played the grandson but he got 2nd billing above Richard Roundtree, so I guess he's somewhat famous. Plus he was an Executive Producer on the film. \n\nAnyways, my 2024 film rankings favorite to least favorite look like this:\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n1.) I Saw The TV Glow\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n2.)

            "The audiences score isn\u2019t looking good which is likely to land on the B range on CinemaScore.",
            "I thought this was a pretty good flick with solid characters showing the evolution of biker clubs. Thought the three main stars did a phenomenal job.\u00a0",
            "I liked it quite a bit. You can tell it was influenced by Scorsese but it doesn\u2019t have his humor or his flair for editing. It\u2019s not as violent as I expected and the true lead of the film isn\u2019t who we are led to believe in the trailer\u2026 which might anger some of the people who might be in the audience demo. That said I think the cast is wonderful and the cinematography is beautiful. Sound and music scoring is top notch too. I think the ending was a bit anti climactic but the ride was great fun",
            "You literally just said everything that verified critics scores have already said but ok",
            "Anti-climatic, and, a bit unwieldy narratively, overall. The framing device the interviews with Kathy represented decelerated the propulsion of the film\u2019s momentum for me.\n\nYet, it\u2019s bones and components remained compelling individually: the Americana iconography, the 50s/60s production design, Adam Stones deft touch weaving composition and lighting (Re: the scenario where Johnny asks Benny to consider becoming the Vandals heir apparent). It\u2019s motley of characters, though lithe in their stature as anchors of the story, nevertheless conveyed intrigue in their mythological nature. I just wanted the film to convey more than what amounted to moving snapshots of a world unknown, but I enjoyed participating in the journey and it\u2019s conversation with classic cinema of yesteryear. Perhaps I just wish it had more to say.",
            "Agreed 100%. Far from perfect but very well made with a stellar cast. Nice balance of tension and humor as well.",
            "And? I\u2019m glad we could agree I guess.\u00a0",
            "It\u2019s not exactly an abstract film lol straight to the point and it\u2019s quite good. No fucking clue what accent Hardy was trying to pull but that\u2019s par for the course with him I feel",
            "Agreed. I think we don\u2019t get a true look into Benny as a character. He is a romantic and distant character. The film is poorer for this omission. But Austin Butler is very charismatic and so is Tom Hardy and that\u2019s enough to carry the film mostly. I would love to have had a look into the reporter and his thoughts or interaction with Benny or Johnny at all",
            "It\u2019d be weird if you came away with a different take honestly. \n\nGreat movie."
