        "content": "There has been an increase of scams affecting Marketplace sellers. Scammers are finding new ways to trick you in ways that seems convincing. Stay vigilant, trust your gut, and don\u2019t feel bad for anyone!\n\nHere are a few of the current scams happening in Marketplace and advice with payment methods:\n\n\u3164\n**Giving out your phone number**\nScammers will want to verify if YOU are not a scammer by sending you a code. Victims who fall for this scam may have their entire google account compromised. They will have access to all your google apps including gmail and stored payment methods. Once they have access to your email, they can basically log in to any online account associated with that email by doing a password reset. If you believe your google account was taken over, follow this link for instructions to recover it: https://support.google.com/voice/answer/159519?hl=en#zippy=%2Cyour-linked-number-was-claimed\n\n\u3164\n**Fake orders, emails, and stories**\nScammers are asking to ship an item that was never sold. They may also send you a fake screenshot of the order confirmation. If you provide them an email, they may even send you a fake confirmation email. Always verify the order status in Facebook. Always log in your account to verify a cleared payment before shipping anything. Also, scammers are now accusing sellers of their items being \"stolen\" and demanding that it be returned to them. Block and report them immediately.\n\n\u3164\n**Offering more than what you asked for**\nIf someone is asking to pay more than the listing price, make sure they do this through Marketplace payments or cash if local. If they ask to send a payment in another form, I highly recommend you don\u2019t. You won\u2019t be covered if something goes wrong. \n\n\u3164\n**Odd Payment Methods**\nDo not accept checks, envelopes, mail, UPS, money orders, or any odd payments. You will NOT be covered by anyone if something goes wrong.\n\n\u3164\n**Keep your conversation in Messenger**\nScammers hate being detected by bots. They don\u2019t like saying specific phrases or words because they might get banned from Facebook. They like having text or email conversations better. It makes it easier for them to scam you. \n\n\u3164\n**Do not log into other people\u2019s devices**\nFacebook doesn\u2019t like this and they might think you\u2019re a scammer or hacker. You can lose access to Marketplace for \u201cSuspicious Activity\u201d. \n\n\u3164\n**Messenger Payments**\nThis seems like a safe and alternative way to get paid through Marketplace. Scammers will never use this. There is no transaction fee. Buyer and seller protection only applies for Facebook products such as Marketplace. \nMore info: https://pay.facebook.com/messenger/\n\n\u3164\n**Zelle Payments**\nDo not accept a Zelle transaction while the payment is processing. Always wait and log into your bank and verify the payment. You may receive a text and/or email from Zelle and your bank. Make sure you receive a confirmation email from your bank. If you don\u2019t receive an email from your bank, log in to verify your payment. \nMore info: https://www.zellepay.com/pay-it-safe/understanding-fraud-and-scams\n\n\u3164\n**Cash App**\nScammers love asking for your cash app email or phone number. They don\u2019t need it. Simply give them your CashTag ID instead. This is useless to them. Also, when sending money, Cash app will NEVER refund or reimburse payments. That is their policy. They also have 0 protection policy for buyers and sellers. I do not recommend Cash App for online sales. \nMore info: https://cash.app/help/us/en-us/6482-recognize-scams\n\n\u3164\n**Venmo**\nVenmo has just started offering buyer and seller protection in certain circumstances. To be eligible for protection, read their Terms and Conditions: https://help.venmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500010381401-Buying-and-Selling-on-Venmo-FAQ\n\nThere is another article stating they don\u2019t offer protection. It may be outdated: https://venmo.com/legal/us-helpful-information/\n\n\u3164\n**\u26a0\ufe0f DO NOT GIVE OUT YOUR EMAIL!**\nThis is the number one rule. Once you give out your email (that\u2019s linked to your Facebook), anyone can try to gain access your account and ban, block, or lock you out from Facebook and Marketplace. They can also try to gain access to any other accounts associated with that email, even your Instagram!  Instagram makes it near impossible to recover a hacked account. If your PayPal email is the same as your Facebook email, you can create a new email address and add it to your PayPal. You can use that new email address for online payments and keep your main email private. I also suggest you do not use your Facebook email on other websites or newsletters. Your email address can possibly be sold around the internet and taken advantage of by the wrong people. \n\n\u3164\n**HAVE YOU BEEN HACKED?**\nThere\u2019s a database that collects email addresses that have been leaked and sold on the black market. You can see if your email address has been compromised. This is a safe website I\u2019ve used for many years that\u2019s assisted several governments around the world to help stop online breaches. This database will list all the companies associated with your email that have been hacked and leaked online. It\u2019s always a good idea to keep yourself aware. \nWebsite: https://haveibeenpwned.com/\n\u3164\n\nDon't forget to report any possible scammers and bock them immediately!",

What, are you taking over my only bathroom?\n\n3.) \"Can we move in today?\"\nWhat? No, your crackhead ass is not just moving on in.\n\n4. \"So, I have my [partner] and kids....\"\nSo, I just have 1 room you're all going to squeeze into?\n\n5.) \"Where is this exactly?\"\nLook on the map, in the listing where I pinned it.",

I  negotiated for about $20 below the listing price but I felt that was fine as the seller said that he was open to negotiating and the item was over four hundred dollars. The seller and I agreed on the time, place, date and price, a week later. One day before the sale, the seller told me the item was broken and he wanted to cancel the sale. I felt that it was upsetting but a complete accident and felt bad so I looked at some of his other listings to see if I could help him out as he just lost a pretty huge chunk of change. But when I saw his reviews I realised he sold the item to someone else. If he just told me about it I would be fine with matching the price/ paying a deposit or something.
