        "content": "1. This sub is for sharing news and other information relating to Canada as well as major events, interesting or bizarre things from around the world that Canadians might like to know about and discuss.  This sub is not meant to be a \"conservative\" sub despite claims that it is.  This sub is intended to be a place for open discussion where people are free to share their views and opinions on the topics here regardless of their political leaning.  No one gets banned because their view is left or right leaning or because their view opposes what the popular take is on a topic.  **People are to be civil to the other members in here though.**\n\n2. Insulting the sub and general insults about the members here will result in a ban.  I'm tired of seeing users coming in here that have no interest in taking part in what the sub is intended for, but rather to just say the sub is trash or a dumpster fire etc, or to just throw out insults towards all the members.  If you hate the sub and the members to that extent, then it's probably doing you a favour to remove you.  No need to thank me though when that happens.\n\n  Troll accounts and those just looking to cause issues for the sub will also be removed.\n\n  These rule are not hard to follow but some choose not to.  This will be cracked down on.\n\n3. A number of complaints have been made about the posts.  They're usually claims of the posts mainly being right wing or pro Pierre Poilievre.  Most of these complaints have come from accounts that never post up topics on any subs.  Anyway people are free to post up left wing or pro-Trudeau things but the complainers never do that. I will add that meme posts don't go up very often just due to the fact that most memes are not very good.  Posts do await mod approval just as a protection measure for the sub.  It prevents spam posts and stops users from posting up things not suitable for the sub or things intended to get the sub in trouble.  It's not a big mod team so it can take a bit for posts to get approved, so just be patient.  Hopefully I'll find more mods.\n\n4. Comments that are just attacking a source instead of addressing the content are up for removal.  The people that usually do source attacks do so just to try to disrupt the topic and to prevent it from being discussed.  If they disagree with the content then they should be able to state why.\n\n5. Comments also need to follow reddit's rules.  Staying civil should help with that.  Also just to let people know that reddit's \"harassment filter\" is in effect here, so if you don't stay civil then that filter might catch and remove your comments.\n\nAnyway that is all for now.  Hopefully people continue to enjoy the sub and things stay civil and the sub continues to grow.\n\nEdit - Regarding post submissions, If a text post submission only contains a link to an article, the post will not be approved.  Either add more to that text post or just submitted the link as a link post instead.  Titles for article are to match the title found in the article or be very close to it.  Also Youtube videos should be submitted as link posts.  Video posts should have titles that are at least descriptive of what the video is about.\n\nEdit - Calling users \"bots\" because you don't like their views or opinions will be consider trolling.  Feel free to report any actual bots along with the proof which proves it, to the mods here using the \"message the mods\" button and it will be looked into and dealt with.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Making sure people are aware of Reddit's rules**\n\nJust putting up Reddit's rules so people can be aware of what they are so they don't end up breaking them.  The rules are found here:  https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy\n\nBreaking reddit's rules can result in being banned from this sub but also you can receive a temp ban by reddit or get your account permanently banned from the site.\n\nAlso when it comes to reporting posts and comments, if you see something that you think might be inappropriate and should be removed or is breaking rules but are not sure of which rule exactly, then report it using \"unsure\" and the mods will look into it.  This sub gets a lot of false reports which is the report reason doesn't match the content.  Such as when something gets reported as \"promoting hate based on identity or vulnerability\" when it clearly doesn't, or something is reported as \"someone is considering self harm\" and they're clearly not.  All reports that appear to be false reports now get reported to reddit and it then becomes a matter between reddit and the person submitting a false report.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Announcement about a change to the sub regarding comments on certain types of posts**\n\nFrom here on out, posting news articles and such that are about gay and trans matters, will no longer have comments on those posts. The news can still go up for people to see but comments will be locked. Those topics are such hot button issues that they just create a lot of problems. Far too many people are unable to express their opinions on these topics and choose their wording carefully enough to not break reddit's rules. Also there are a number of individuals that just deliberately want to break the rules on these topics and there are some that just can't handle differing opinions on these topics as well. So what ends up happening is that a huge number of comments get reported and have to be dealt with. So enough is enough of that.",

        "content": "Just an announcement that I'm reopening the sub this evening.\n\nThe sub closed mainly due to being burnt out as I explained back then.  Well a bit of time has gone by and I no longer feel burnt out and I found more mods to help out with the sub going forward, so it's time to reopen it now.  While the sub was inactive, I saw various news stories happen that didn't really get covered on other subs.  Seeing that helped push me to want to re-open the sub.  Also I have to give some credit to the onguardforthee sub for helping push me to want to re-open the sub this quickly.  They put up some nonsense post claiming that I turned the sub private in an attempt to keep people with opposing views out so it could be an echo chamber.  I even saw a mod there say this:\n\n> Guess it\u2019s tough to indoctrinate people when just anyone can drop by and point out your lies. Democracy dies in the dark.\n\nI messaged the mods there and told them that the whole post was ridiculous nonsense because my sub was not active at all and no one was being let in.  Did they take down that post.....of course not.  It just shows that they don't mind spreading lies and nonsense there if it is supporting narratives they want to push.  I was also amused by a comment in that post that claimed my sub bans people solely for their opinions while onguardforthee doesn't do that at all.  I don't know how they give out bans over there but no one gets banned here solely for their opinions.\n\nAlso a shout out to the guy that messaged me out of the blue via \"message the mods\" just to tell me that my sub is garbage and that the main Canada sub is the best.  Yeah that sub is popular.  People really do like a sub that censors news and opinions based on whether the mod agrees or disagrees with something on a personal level.  On this sub, I don't care what people's views and opinions are on the topics that come up here or whether someone is left or right leaning.  As long as people stay within reddit's rules and the simple sub rules here, then it's all good as far as I'm concerned.  But to some, that is apparently bad and censorship is good.\n\nOne last thing.  I was shocked at the number of dead accounts that requested access to the sub while it was private and inactive.  So many accounts that ranged from a few months old up to 8 years old that had 0 posts and 0 comments ever made.  It was odd how they left messages saying they were very active in the sub before and they wanted back in when I could see their accounts were dead in terms of activity.\n\nAnyway, enjoy the sub.",

Some people can be really unhinged from reality here.\n\nHowever, I haven't heard of anyone getting banned here.  It is a great place to hash out some of this stuff.  It's also somewhere my own concepts of things get challenged.\n\nHopefully this time it will move past all the rage farming.",

I would be willing to bet almost half this sub is banned from there for saying things they didn't like.\n\nImagine if you had to interact with those people in real life ?? \ud83d\ude06",
            "Thank you.  \nDealing with narcissists like that is draining; been there, done that, been threatened - all because I'm queer and don't agree with everything the LGBT community does. The censorship and inability to talk about problematic behavior lately is getting dangerous.\n\nThis was one of the only places I felt like I could say no or put my perspective in without being told to kms by terminally online idiots from \"either side\" in the replies; I could check replies here if I felt like it.\n\nGlad to see it back."
