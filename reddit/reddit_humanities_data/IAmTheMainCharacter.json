She is not bothering anyone, but at the start I thought she was running red lights and interrupting traffic, so I was expecting something much worse. The worst thing about this is that she wanted this recorded and the caption.",

Like, if this girl ran to the middle of a busy intersection to stop traffic for this, or she stopped a fellow pedestrian and refused to let him pass until he danced with her, some shit like that.\n\nAs long as she's crossing the street legally and not causing trouble to anyone else, which is what this appears to be, then fuck it, let her have her fun.",
