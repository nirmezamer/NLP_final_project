In the bar/restaurant, actors would walk around dressed as characters from the show. I had a Klingon threaten to kill me, a Borg wanted to assimilate me and a Vulcan call me an illogical human. I lived for it, and played along. \n\nI Apologized to the Kilingon for my cowardly greeting of a warrior, told the borg to back off because I have Janeway's nano virus in my pocket and agreed that the Vulcan was obviously more logical and intelligent than any human lol.
