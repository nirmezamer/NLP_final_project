            "Has anyone ever used rit dye on ribbed softstreme fabric? I have a ribbed softstreme\u00a0dress I was thinking of dying another colour, but I'm worried either the colour won't take well, or the dye process will mess up the softstreme fabric, or the stitching won't take the dye. Just wondering if anyone else has done this before I potentially ruin my dress :)",

            "I\u2019ve been hearing rumors about a ton of store closures. Any one  impacted?",
            "Hi, I l applied for a stock keeper position for Lululemon in Europe. Is it normal for employers to request a trial day in the store? I'm curious because I would be traveling from another state and want to understand if this indicates I'm close to being chosen for the job.",
            "Anyone worked as a product operations educator? I have an interview coming up for it and I want to know the best way to prep. All I find online is about product operations lead.",
            "The warehouse in sumner, WA is closing due to the opening if a bigger warehouse in southern California. Seattle also had a store close recently. The warehouses closure will affect me eventually\u00a0",
            "Would like to know if any stores in Houston will impacted\u2026.",
            "It's a new role, so technically no one would have officially been in the role yet! The  equivalent would be the previous expeditor role.",
            "Here's information that I got from my job.  \nThe Product Operations Educator (POE) role will be working BOH (back of house) during store hours (i.e., processing orders, shipping, refill, organizing bays, etc.) and after store hours, will be receiving/processing boxes. You won't be interacting with guests for the most part during your job. You will report to the Product Operations Lead (POL). As mentioned by another user, the role is similar to the previous expeditor role, but it's an updated version.  \nFrom my knowledge, all lululemon OUTLET locations will have POE role, but not all mainline store locations will have POE roles (only selected stores will have them).\n\nBest way to prep, in my opinion, would be just like for any other interview. They're still looking for the same kind of people that lululemon has always been looking for -- responsible and hardworking for the job, but not super serious and still likes to have fun (this is in all of their LLL job descriptions). Flexibility in time is also preferred, especially when approaching the holiday season. The preference would be organization and being agile at BOH, along with whatever other preferences they have. If you have an operations and/or BOH shipping/packing experience of any kind, that would be a plus.  \nAdditionally, at this present time, POEs are **not allowed** to swap shifts with AND cover shifts for other educators/leads, but are allowed to swap shifts within their role (POE). For example, if a POE from another night needs a swap and you, a POE, can take that shift, then you are allowed to do so. However, other educators will be allowed to cover for POEs. This also means that POEs will not be able to cover other educators from different store locations, unless they are a POE, from my knowledge (please correct me on this, if I am incorrect). That is one big caveat of this role at this moment.\n\nPay is the same as other educators of the store you will be applying to, along with the bonus. Hours depend on the store you apply to. Usually if the store's working hours are long and close at a later time, then you may have a wider range of hours.",
            "Do you know anything about the pay, structure of the job or the hours?",
            "It would depend on the location. All job postings that I've seen for Lululemon have the pay mentioned in the job posting. My understanding is a large part of the role will be processing boxes, which is done when the store is closed, either mornings or evenings (again, this will depend on the store itself). There are other tasks (like refill and fulfilling online orders) that can also happen during the day."
