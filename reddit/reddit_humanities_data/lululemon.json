Now you have a place to ask it!\n\nIf you are new to the sub, please read through our [FAQs](https://www.reddit.com/r/lululemon/wiki/faq/) as they address a lot of our commonly asked questions, such as \"when will \\[item\\] restock?\" and so much more!\n\nID and authentication requests are allowed in this thread only.

            "Haven\u2019t seen align c/d tanks or high neck align tanks be restocked or new colors added in weeks. Are they being phased out?",
            "Does anyone know how often the logo All Yours Tees are released? I feel like they're rarely released and when they are they're so popular they go FAST!",
            "I\u2019ve lost hope that Lulu will make the mid rise speed up shorts again. Does anyone know of a similar style from somewhere else? New Balance used to have some but those are also discontinued :(",
            "my hand went through a pocket of my Surge joggers (mens). Now it's just a big hole and where my fingers were. Not sure how this happened. Normal use. \n\nIs there any chance this could be replaced (free) or repaired? Would like to know before I commit the time to bring them to the store.",
            "Has anyone ever used rit dye on ribbed softstreme fabric? I have a ribbed softstreme\u00a0dress I was thinking of dying another colour, but I'm worried either the colour won't take well, or the dye process will mess up the softstreme fabric, or the stitching won't take the dye. Just wondering if anyone else has done this before I potentially ruin my dress :)",
            "What bras does everyone wear with the Swiftly Tank? I might buy a few to go running but don\u2019t know if the bras I have will work with the scoop neck",
            "Does anyone have any bras that work for larger breasts?  I need something to jog in and I keep striking out",
            "When do you think they will restock the align skirt in black? I was thinking of getting one but when I checked again, the black color was not on the app/website. Thanks!",
            "Is anyone else\u2019s lululemon not letting them sign in??",
            "does anyone know when the fourth of july sale details for this year?"

It\u2019s basically July and we haven\u2019t had any new bright summer colours!! You would think they would be pushing shorts and skirts in fun new bright colours so hard right now!",
