            "There should also be the following question in the Mini FAQ, I see it several times each month.\n\n* When the new games get announced/added?\n\n * PS+ Essential games get added every 1st Tuesday of the month, with the announcement happening on the Wednesday before that. PS+ Extra/Premium games get added two weeks later, on the 3rd Tuesday of the month, with the announcement also happening on the Wednesday before that",
            "When we will get the data of how many subscribers they lost? I\u2019m not sacrificing for nothing over here!",
            "Why ps plus essentiel is no more discounted for existing members??\nI use to stack 2 years every xmas.\nNow no more discounts at all (only discounts on upgrades to next tier).",
            "It's great to see all this helpful information in one place! Thanks for compiling it all for easy reference. It's always good to check before asking questions to avoid any unnecessary confusion. Happy gaming, everyone!",
            "Do you think PS Plus will be discounted any time soon?\nExpectation was to be discounted within January sale but that didn't happen",
            "is there a website like dekudeals or some website where i can browse the psn store and filter on free games which come by extra or premium etc?",
            "I may be screaming into the dark here, but my account just got banned overnight and I was wondering if anyone was also experiencing it.\n\nThe ban makes no sense as I haven\u2019t done a chargeback or anything. I contacted their support but obviously they won\u2019t respond. So I\u2019m just sitting heee confused and angry.\n\nIs it a bug?",

            "Borderlands 3 was on Extra before, but it\u2019s a good game. NHL 24 is not for me but I guess it\u2019s a fine addition.\n\nBut Among Us is a fucking 4\u20ac game that has been on sale for 2\u20ac already. This is not an acceptable game to include.",

            "As someone with PS+ Premium, I can say two things - PS+ is not very good and Sony Core has quite possibly the worst library of films you could imagine. You'd have more fun on one of the worst advert supported platforms that you find as an app on any smart TV these days.",
            "If it's the same as the app built into Sony TVs, it offers a much higher streaming quality than any other service. And many titles are IMAX enhanced with even the expanded aspect ratio."
