I've just gotten off infamous 1 2 and second son. They all run like shit, bloodborne, god of war 3, ghost of tsushima.\nI'm playing on pc. Please tell me that is the reason why, and people aren't actually playing with frames like this. It's insufferable to look at.",

It was always about the gameplay and how fun it was to shoot all these crazy guns, and making yourself more powerful. So I am never disappointed with any of these games, and I always have a blast. If it happens to have a good story, then thats just the icing on the cake, but it doesnt make or break the franchise for me.",
