        "content": "Hello everyone!\n\nIt's our last watch survey before Census season begins! \n\nOur Netflix survey closed with 1501 of you responding! Our [**tvN survey**](/r/KDRAMA/comments/1bt1m0b/tvn_dramas_watched_survey_april_2024/) and [**Disney+ survey**](/r/KDRAMA/comments/1c7pz2f/disney_dramas_watched_survey_april_2024/) are still open and slowly ticking away. \n\nOur fourth installment in the survey series is all about **JTBC Dramas** -- meaning the dramas that JTBC produced and aired originally on the Korean cable network, **JTBC** \n\nThe survey has two sections, a basic demographics section at the beginning to give some context about you as a viewer, and then then a selection of the JTBC dramas released between 2011 and 2023 organized by year of release (most recent to oldest). \n\nNot all JTBC dramas were able to be included so dramas were selected based on an evaluation of factors including viewership ratings, activity on on-air threads, accolades. If a **completed** JTBC drama you love that aired between 2011 and 2023 isn't included, don't be offended, it may be included in a future survey. Watch statistics for 2024 dramas such as **Doctor Slump** and **The Atypical Family** will be evaluated in our end of year survey. \n\nFor each drama you can rate it on a scale of 1 (Not Good At All) to 5 (Perfect) if you completed it or select options of 'Did Not Watch' or 'Dropped' depending on what is most applicable for you.\n\nWe know that people rate dramas differently, for the purposes of this survey we ask you to rate the dramas while considering all of the following aspects of the drama: (1) writing/script, (2) production quality (ie. cinematography, sound mixing), (3) acting, and (4) your enjoyment while watching the drama. \n\nIf you are currently in the midst of watching one, we ask that you either come back to edit your response (be sure to save the personalized url at the end in the submission acknowledgement page) or wait until you have finished it to take this survey.\n\n#[Survey Link](https://forms.gle/59M8KXrstaHYyXtv9)\n\n\n---\n---\n\n#**FAQ:**\n\n**Q.** Why haven't you included a plan to watch/ in progress / on hold option?\n\n**A.** For the purpose of this survey we are simply seeking to find out how many users have or have not watched them and if they have how they rated them, not whether they plan to watch them. \n\n**Q.** What do you plan to do with the data?\n\n**A.** Share the results with the community. Use it to further hype the upcoming census for those who love data.  \n\n**Q.** A part of the survey is not working for me, can you help me?\n\n**A.** Google forms can have their moments, either try again later or use a different browser. \n\n**Q.** Why isn't \\[drama\\] on the survey?\n\n**A.**  It either isn't a JTBC production or we excluded it on purpose. \n\n**Q.** When will this survey close?\n\n**A.** In around two months time. \n\n---\n---\n\nFeel free to discuss dramas in the comments but keep it spoiler free. We especially encourage sharing thoughts about how you rated certain dramas so that hopefully we can see the variance of approaches amongst us.\n\nFinally just a reminder that is for fun and not something serious. Let's not engage in fanwars, that just sucks the fun out of things and I really don't want to write another [apology statement](/r/KDRAMA/comments/sraegq/rkdrama_mod_team_officially_responds_to_anonymous/) because a ratings survey gets taken far too seriously than necessary.",

I'm always excited for these surveys, they are like a moment of reflection, where I adjust my ratings and add other dramas to my plan to watch, in some cases I even pull some dramas out of the dropped list.

            "Recently started a rewatch of The Heirs, this time with my 14-yo daughter in tow and she is FASCINATED by Tan/Lee Minho. I was like, \"Do you finally get why this man is a Korean national treasure??\" \ud83d\ude05 \n\nIt's funny because she agreed to watch it because of Park Hyungsik (she loves him) and was totally caught off guard by LMH.",
            "I recently watched **A Piece of Your Mind.**  I had been wary of this one in the past because I heard it was really slow which isn't my thing usually but I was craving Chae Soo Bin in another romance and I had enjoyed the writers previous work **On the Way to the Airport** so I rolled the dice and I loved it, I binged the whole thing in two days.\n\nAs I watched **A Piece of Your Mind** I thought repeatedly of Roger Ebert's quote about movies being \"machines that generate empathy\" because that's exactly what this show was. The two leads, who are drawn into each other's lives during a period of adversity, love each other and take care of each other in such a selfless way. The warmth and tenderness of their conversations, their easy physical intimacy (there's only one quick, chaste kiss scene in the whole drama but I didn't feel deprived because of how swoony the hugging/cuddling scenes were), and their deep compatibility with each other moved me greatly. \n\nI got emotionally invested in the supporting characters as well, particularly the landlady of the FL's boarding house and the landlady's childhood friend who is also grieving a severe loss. \n\nThis packs such a wallop emotionally and is so tender and thoughtful in how it treats its characters and relationships I was able to forgive the occasional bits of sloppy writing, like how the A.I. tech no sense if you think about it, or how >!Soon Ho was willing to betray her \"uncle\" to protect a sullen jerk she had known for 5 minutes!<  \n\nA beautiful, alternately heart wrenching and heart warming work.  Highly, highly recommended.",
            "I watched another episode of Legend of the Blue Sea last night instead of the\u2026thing that was on tv last night in my country (iykyk). It was a very good decision, much more enjoyable to watch by many orders of magnitude.",
            "I finished **Sweet Home S1 & **S2** this week because I wanted to watch Season 3 when it comes out. I've got to agree with some people that S1 is better than S2. There were a lot of new characters in Season 2 that I could care less about and the show >!killed off some of the good characters, for example Yoon Ji Su.!< But I think there some interesting stuff introduced like >!the firefighter girl's monster child and so on.!< \n\nOverall I'd rate **Sweet Home S1** a 8/10 and S2 a 7/10.",
            "I just started Misaeng after hearing lots of good things about it. For those of you who has seen it, is it similar to My Liberation Notes? The first episode of Misaeng was frustrating as he was clearly being bullied by his stuck up workers. My blood pressure was rising. Hope the ML gets a backbone soon.",
            "I finished watching **Pinocchio** yesterday and really enjoyed it!! Ha Myeong grew on me which I was happy about. I wasn\u2019t a fan of him in the beginning because he was so mean to In Ha but he got better. In Ha was a sweet, rough around the edges girl. Both of them >!became great reporters by the end!!!< \n\nI was worried about >!the brother\u2019s storyline since he became a murderer but the writer made it work! I hated the fact he killed them because I thought the focus would just go into him being a murderer and absolve the wrongs of everyone who wronged their family but everyone still got what they deserved. His scenes with Ha Myeong in the jail were also sweet. He gave his little brother good advice.!<\n\nIn Ha\u2019s Mom >!got quite the character development but I\u2019m not mad at it. It was nice to see her right her wrongs in the end and walk way from the reporter life which I think needed to happen. She did a lot of damage the past 14 years, she has to pay for her wrong doings. As for Beom Ja\u2019s Mom, the chairwomen, she deserves all the jail and probation time she got. She loses her cool so fast as well!< \ud83d\ude2d\n\nThe romance is cute but I feel like the leads spend more time >!apart than together. They break up twice technically.!< it doesn\u2019t feel like a big part of the show either though so I don\u2019t feel either way about it I guess.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed this drama a lot!! I was way more into the reporter life than I thought I would be too lol. 9/10 from me \ud83d\ude01",
            "I binged through **Death's Game**. And I have to be honest, I'm kinda conflicted.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0It is a really good show, the acting was stellar (with that All Star cast not that suprising), great production, interesting plot. All the hallmarks of a great drama. But due to personal reasons I utterly despise the depiction of suicide as a sin, deserving of torture, being shameful and selfish. And that happened here a lot. Especially with Death as a character. I mean it had some really good themes and points regarding your life effecting others around you, even if you don't realize it and similiar things. But those themes did not need that depiction of suicide that IMO even ventured into guilt tripping at times.\u00a0The way that the ML in the last episode >!restarted everything, by shooting himself, was also very messy and a mixed message. Suicidal ideation says hello to the ML and that action would be actually very bad for him.!<\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0The end also >!was also a bit unsatisfying, because what happens now to the villain? Yes, the ML has now knowledge of happenings and people involved but that doesn't necessaryly translate into stopping him. But IMO It's a nitpick and doesn't really change the enjoyment of the drama overall!<\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0All in all I'm a bit frustrated.\u00a0The suicide depiction annoyed me and sometimes even made me angry, but otherwise it's a great show. So overall I would give it an easy 7.5-8/10. The cast and their acting was really just that good.",
            "Watched mister sunshine and God I was totally mind blown. \n\nIn this era where 16 episode dramas have pacing issues, I never felt bored while watching 24 episodes. \n\nAll the characters and the visuals of the drama was amazing.",
            "i finally started watching revenant and boy am i confused. if anyone has watched it already, could you please answer my questions for episodes 1-2? \ud83d\ude2d\n\n>! why did hyunwoo\u2019s parents go to such great lengths to hide their daughter? what exactly did she do to deserve being shut in the basement and not even having her birth registered? and why does the shaman in the flashback stab the kid to death after giving her a plate of raw meat? and who\u2019s the dead kid that was put into the barrel and hung from the tree? if these questions are answered later in the drama, please don\u2019t spoil. but if they\u2019re not, let me know!! !<",
            "I watched adult trainee like two days ago, I saw a tiktok and was like wow talk about risqu\u00e9 in kdramas (FOR kdramas, for what they usually do) especially a kdrama that's set in high school. I actually liked it a LOT. I came to do a quick search over here, maybe I did it wrong because I couldn't find anything about it.\nI ALMOST dropped it from the first episode because seriously the way they were starting I was thinking wtf am I watching?? But went to the usual comment section I use when I watch kdramas and read the comments there and every.single.comment said this was such underrated drama, so funny, so good, so well done, pity it's so short, every comment I read was positive... Granted is not like I read more than 10, but that's usually all it takes to see if the opinions are different from each other and EVERYONE was praising it so I decided to continue. It actually was funny and I very much enjoyed it!\n\nNext on my list, warm and cozy and moonshine, idk why but I dropped those after the first episode but recently came across good critics for those so I'll resume them \ud83d\ude01"
