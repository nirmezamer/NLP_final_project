        "content": "Hello everyone!\n\nIt's our last watch survey before Census season begins! \n\nOur Netflix survey closed with 1501 of you responding! Our [**tvN survey**](/r/KDRAMA/comments/1bt1m0b/tvn_dramas_watched_survey_april_2024/) and [**Disney+ survey**](/r/KDRAMA/comments/1c7pz2f/disney_dramas_watched_survey_april_2024/) are still open and slowly ticking away. \n\nOur fourth installment in the survey series is all about **JTBC Dramas** -- meaning the dramas that JTBC produced and aired originally on the Korean cable network, **JTBC** \n\nThe survey has two sections, a basic demographics section at the beginning to give some context about you as a viewer, and then then a selection of the JTBC dramas released between 2011 and 2023 organized by year of release (most recent to oldest). \n\nNot all JTBC dramas were able to be included so dramas were selected based on an evaluation of factors including viewership ratings, activity on on-air threads, accolades. If a **completed** JTBC drama you love that aired between 2011 and 2023 isn't included, don't be offended, it may be included in a future survey. Watch statistics for 2024 dramas such as **Doctor Slump** and **The Atypical Family** will be evaluated in our end of year survey. \n\nFor each drama you can rate it on a scale of 1 (Not Good At All) to 5 (Perfect) if you completed it or select options of 'Did Not Watch' or 'Dropped' depending on what is most applicable for you.\n\nWe know that people rate dramas differently, for the purposes of this survey we ask you to rate the dramas while considering all of the following aspects of the drama: (1) writing/script, (2) production quality (ie. cinematography, sound mixing), (3) acting, and (4) your enjoyment while watching the drama. \n\nIf you are currently in the midst of watching one, we ask that you either come back to edit your response (be sure to save the personalized url at the end in the submission acknowledgement page) or wait until you have finished it to take this survey.\n\n#[Survey Link](https://forms.gle/59M8KXrstaHYyXtv9)\n\n\n---\n---\n\n#**FAQ:**\n\n**Q.** Why haven't you included a plan to watch/ in progress / on hold option?\n\n**A.** For the purpose of this survey we are simply seeking to find out how many users have or have not watched them and if they have how they rated them, not whether they plan to watch them. \n\n**Q.** What do you plan to do with the data?\n\n**A.** Share the results with the community. Use it to further hype the upcoming census for those who love data.  \n\n**Q.** A part of the survey is not working for me, can you help me?\n\n**A.** Google forms can have their moments, either try again later or use a different browser. \n\n**Q.** Why isn't \\[drama\\] on the survey?\n\n**A.**  It either isn't a JTBC production or we excluded it on purpose. \n\n**Q.** When will this survey close?\n\n**A.** In around two months time. \n\n---\n---\n\nFeel free to discuss dramas in the comments but keep it spoiler free. We especially encourage sharing thoughts about how you rated certain dramas so that hopefully we can see the variance of approaches amongst us.\n\nFinally just a reminder that is for fun and not something serious. Let's not engage in fanwars, that just sucks the fun out of things and I really don't want to write another [apology statement](/r/KDRAMA/comments/sraegq/rkdrama_mod_team_officially_responds_to_anonymous/) because a ratings survey gets taken far too seriously than necessary.",

            "Recently started a rewatch of The Heirs, this time with my 14-yo daughter in tow and she is FASCINATED by Tan/Lee Minho. I was like, \"Do you finally get why this man is a Korean national treasure??\"  \n\nIt's funny because she agreed to watch it because of Park Hyungsik (she loves him) and was totally caught off guard by LMH.",
            "I watched another episode of Legend of the Blue Sea last night instead of thething that was on tv last night in my country (iykyk). It was a very good decision, much more enjoyable to watch by many orders of magnitude.",
            "I just started Misaeng after hearing lots of good things about it. For those of you who has seen it, is it similar to My Liberation Notes? The first episode of Misaeng was frustrating as he was clearly being bullied by his stuck up workers. My blood pressure was rising. Hope the ML gets a backbone soon.",
            "I finished **Sweet Home S1 & **S2** this week because I wanted to watch Season 3 when it comes out. I've got to agree with some people that S1 is better than S2. There were a lot of new characters in Season 2 that I could care less about and the show >!killed off some of the good characters, for example Yoon Ji Su.!< But I think there some interesting stuff introduced like >!the firefighter girl's monster child and so on.!< \n\nOverall I'd rate **Sweet Home S1** a 8/10 and S2 a 7/10.",
            "Watched QoT a month after it came out and fell in love with Kim Ji Won which led me to watch My Liberation Notes which I enjoyed way more than QoT. I enjoyed it so much that I read that the writer for MLN also did My Mister and just finished binge watching it last night. My Mister might be the best Kdrama I've ever watched and it was perfect watching it now at my age rather than 6 years ago. The topics in MLN and My Mister are heavy and much more relatable once you're in the workforce and a grown up for a few years. Also I love how there's really no filler time which I found annoying in QoT. Incredible writing, music, cinematography, and sexual tension that I felt watching My Mister lol",
            "I watched The Atypical Family, and it was an good show. There were a lot of puns and hints and jokes contained in the names of the characters that was amusing, and in one case, a spoiler for the show.\n\nThe translator sometimes faired admirably in making work of the name stuff work in English, sometimes didn't. I thought the translation for the nickname for Dong Hee, Bok Don't Eat was a clever job. The original Korean nickname used was Bok Dong Eo Ri, which would mean \"little lump of luck.\" While the original meaning didn't translate, the Bok Don't Eat name I think added to the show, using something from personality of the character.",
            "Rewatched \"Lovely Runner\" after dropping it around episode 8. Glad I gave it another shot, ending wasn't bad.",
            "i finally started watching revenant and boy am i confused. if anyone has watched it already, could you please answer my questions for episodes 1-2? \n\n>! why did hyunwoos parents go to such great lengths to hide their daughter? what exactly did she do to deserve being shut in the basement and not even having her birth registered? and why does the shaman in the flashback stab the kid to death after giving her a plate of raw meat? and whos the dead kid that was put into the barrel and hung from the tree? if these questions are answered later in the drama, please dont spoil. but if theyre not, let me know!! !<",
            "I really enjoyed it too. It was so beautifully filmed - I liked to randomly hit pause just to enjoy the stills. \n\nI would love to see the original script (if there even was one), before it got shortened from 16 episodes to 12...",
            "Ikr, it was so sad for the rating being the lowest. And they also cut this drama short than it is. But it is a good drama."
