I've been seeing reviews from 2022 with the old seats. I would much prefer to fly on the A350s with the tried-and-true Cirrus reverse herringbones that are found in KLM/AF planes.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I'm having a tough time deciding since ANA's first class is so good compared to business on SQ, but there's a convenience factor. My brain says fly SQ, heart says fly ANA.\n\nedit: booked the SQ J class, decided convenience>comfort for a 20+ hr flight lol.
