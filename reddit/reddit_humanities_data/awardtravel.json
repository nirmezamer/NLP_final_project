I'm having a tough time deciding since ANA's first class is so good compared to business on SQ, but there's a convenience factor. My brain says fly SQ, heart says fly ANA.\n\nedit: booked the SQ J class, decided convenience>comfort for a 20+ hr flight lol.

Anyone had any success linking through reference numbers?",

After doing some research with award travel, the best option i found is 22,000 avois miles + 70 dollars in tax via BA.  my question is, i was told that it could take 48 hours for MR to transfer. i already went ahead and transferred the points. the points is already showing on my 'avios' balance via the BA shopping page but i cannot book via BA as it shows 0 balance on the book flights page...do i still have to wait the 48 hours until it posts?",

            "No one transfers to IHG. You would quite literally be better off using the portal and a 1.25 or 1.5 x Sapphire bonus",
            "IHG points are very well tied to the cash price of their properties at about $.005 per point. Yes, half a cent. There is a reason why their Co-branded cards get 3 points per dollar on regular spend. Generally transferring to IHG from Ultimate Rewards is a poor value outside of some specific use cases.\n\nNot all points are created equal is the lesson here.",
            "In addition, can often also buy the points to top up, since theyre often on sale at 0.5cpp\n\nSince CSR/CSP transfers to cash or cash equivalent at 1.25-1.5cpp, that should be your floor",
            "What about Marriott? Or is Hyatt the only one thats worth it?",
            "The short answer is Hyatt is the only hotel partner worth the transfer.\n\nIf you want to stay at IHG properties regularly, the IHG Premier and IHG Business Premier are good cards as long as you can use the free night certificate every year. You'll get a good return when you use the card at IHG properties. I wouldn't use them for everyday spending because the points value is too low.",
            "This is still a bad choice you can buy an IHG or a Marriott point at less than a cent, so it is always better to purchase points and redeem for statement credit for a top up",

            "You missed the point. You can buy points for less than a cent each, so transferring 1 UR/MR is worse than just redeeming for statement credit and buying points.",
            "IHG sure. Marriott, not always, youd need a good enough purchasing bonus and no transfer bonus",
            "The only time people typically transfer to Marriott or IHG is top up their balance to get what they need. Usually not to cover the whole balance.\n\nHyatt is the only one thats almost always worth it.\n\nIf you want Marriott or IHG points its much better to just get SUBs for their respective cards. Marriott regularly has 5x 50k FNC offers"
