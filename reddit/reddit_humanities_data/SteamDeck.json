The deck is way more powerful than my old shitty gaming laptop, but my laptop actually runs it better since I can actually change the settings (Yes I know there is probably some special way to change the settings despite the launcher being gone, but I haven't bothered yet)",

            "congrats! quick tip: ypu can add firefox or whatever internet browser as an option in game mode. Set it up through desktop mode then under steam. Cant remember specifc steps past that so google/reddit will show you....but it can be done. Stream spotify, quickly pause the game to search for a question...etc. its nice to have",

Not knowing that there was a freaken bundle that saves you almost 50 DOLLARS\n\nSteam was awesome and I refunded  the games. They denied one of the games because I already put 5 hours in the game. I explained my situation and they processed the refund to my wallet. Rebought the games and I saved that 50 bucks.\n\nAnyways. Just giving you all a reminder to be sure to look at the games on the store and check for bundle deals before adding from the wishlist",

            "The games actually run much better on Deck than some more modern hardware. Newer AMD cards have an issue with the games that causes them to be borderline unplayable with how often they crash, but since the Deck has an older AMD card it doesn\u2019t have the issue at all.",
            "They are running excellent for me. Even kingdom hearts 3 runs great, I only out about 20 minutes to just test though.",
            "You should also keep an eye on key sites. It's $15 cheaper on greenmangaming than steam"
