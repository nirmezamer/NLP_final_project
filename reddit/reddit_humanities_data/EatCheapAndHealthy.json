            "not sure what your financial situation is as far as being able to purchase some basic inexpensive items, but if you're at least allowed to wash ready-to-eat fruits/veggies at the shelter that's a good start. \n\nbuy greens you can consume immediately after washing: arugula, spinach. Plenty of nuts like walnuts, cashews, peanuts for protein. Peanut butter (the kind without palm oil) should be a staple. It's shelf stable and an excellent source of protein. I would try to ask someone to get you a decent brand of multivitamin (ideally Costco \"Kirkland\" brand) because the other stuff isn't good and you need to supplement your diet given some of the limitations of where you're staying.",

You can also get microwave rice packs and just add veggies and a sauce to those. Canned chicken works fine to make chicken salad. Same for tuna. Spam also is fun with rice and veggies. You want things that are shelf stable. Horizon has little milk cartons that are shelf stable. Tomato juice or v8. Just try to get things with low sugar/sucrose/corn syrup. Let me think on this some more and I'll come back and edit as I'm sure we can get you some healthy recipes.",

If you use the microwave cooking method, the vitamins are preserved, it's easy to yank the husk off, and the corn silk just slides off if you rub the cob.",
            "Snacks and foods you can keep handy outside a fridge and require no cooking:\n- prote\u00efne bar\n- fiber bar\n- apple\n- pear\n- tangerines\n- grapes \n- apple \n- snack cucumbers\n- snack bell peppers\n- snack tomatoes\n- zucchini can be eaten raw\n- canned fish like tuna and sardines\n- canned beans (you have the with sauce in so those don\u2019t need rinsing either, otherwise rinse them)\n- canned veggies like green beans, asparagus, corn, beets, peas, etc.\n- pre-cooked beets\n- mixed nuts\n- seeds\n- peanut butter\n- whole wheat wraps\n- pickles\n- beef jerky\n- etc.\n\nFoods that need to go in the fridge but will help you out:\n- hummus, great for dipping your snack veggies\n- jar of pesto once opened\n- kimchi\n\nNo cook recipes: (some do require a fridge for ingredients, most keep for multiple days in the fridge so you can mealprep)\n- pre-cooked beets, onion, walnuts, mozzarella, rocket. Bit of salt, pepper, vinnegar. Everything but the rocket holds up for a few days in the fridge when mixed\n- [fagiolo e tonno](https://memoriediangelina.com/2020/07/11/fagioli-e-tonno/). Uses mostly patntry items, keeps well for a few days in the fridge once mixed.\n- [cowboy caviar](https://www.spendwithpennies.com/cowboy-caviar/). Lots of chopping, but keeps in the fridge for 5 days. \n- [feta tomato bean salad](https://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-tomato-and-feta-white-bean-salad-247303). Keeps for multiple days as well. This is a favorite side to half a pizza or some such in my household\n- mix some stuff in your canned beans. Cumin, corn, green onion, and some cheese go great on black beans for example. Experiment\n- for more search google for banchan and fridge salads\n\n\nIf you can use a microwave:\n- sweet potato. Poke some holes with a fork so it doesn\u2019t explode, wrap a moist paper towel around and microwave, turn halfway through\n- popcorn\n- scrambled eggs, can use veggies.\n\nIf you need to mind your protein you can get pre-boiled eggs, canned/smoked fish, or smoked chicken to add to your meals. Rotisserie chicken requires some prep but can be very helpful.\n\nI don\u2019t know what your financial or tool/resources situation is so I just added a bit of everything. I personally found having some fresh stuff like a fruit, a veggie, and some nuts a great way to supplement. A can of beans (mixin in add ons if available) is a pretty cheap lunch and gives fiber and protein.\n\nBest of luck! \ud83c\udf40\ud83e\udd1e"

            "Chili, spaghetti, veggie fajitas",
            "I have two omnivores and a vegetarian, and often we'll make a meal and two proteins (chicken and soy chicken, chicken and chickpeas, beef and blackbeans) to make it work. \n\nYou can make a pot of chili  or pasta sauce, and add meat to half, as well, or a curry and add meat to half (beans for the other half in both cases, or veggie 'beef' if you like that). You can do a stir fry and remove half, and then add the cooked meat (edamame or tofu for the veg half).    Happily the veg fake meats don't need to be cooked, so they are really quick to sub in.  \n\nWhen kiddo went veg, I bought two identical skillets, a green paddle and a red paddle, and a green and red spatula  (she's not fussy about cross contamination but I like to keep things separate). Meat things cook on the left of my stove, using the red utensils and veg things on the right using the green.  I haven't mixed it up yet.  Lots of meals are the exact same but for the different protein. \n\nPizza is easy to split for two preferences, as are omelettes, pastas (meatballs and \"meat\"balls).   Anything with meatballs actually, sub \"meat\"balls for kid's portion.   Tacos, baked potato bar, and other 'self assembly' meals are great as well, everyone can choose their own toppings. \n\nBurgers, two skillets (bean burgers cook faster and on a lower temp than meat).  Everything else is identical - buns toppings condiments etc. \n\nAnd of course the non veggies can enjoy veg meals - we only have meat twice a week or less, and enjoy hearty veg meals with our kid, the rest of the time.  \n\nSome favourites: \n\n[https://www.budgetbytes.com/vegetarian-french-dip-sandwiches/](https://www.budgetbytes.com/vegetarian-french-dip-sandwiches/)\n\n[https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/black-bean-and-quinoa-enchilada-bake/](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/black-bean-and-quinoa-enchilada-bake/) or [https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/green-chile-enchilada-quinoa-bake/](https://www.twopeasandtheirpod.com/green-chile-enchilada-quinoa-bake/) \n\n[https://www.marthastewart.com/1535235/vegetarian-shepherds-pie](https://www.marthastewart.com/1535235/vegetarian-shepherds-pie)\n\n[https://tasty.co/recipe/southwestern-veggie-packed-tater-tot-casserole](https://tasty.co/recipe/southwestern-veggie-packed-tater-tot-casserole)\n\n[https://www.budgetbytes.com/black-bean-burgers/](https://www.budgetbytes.com/black-bean-burgers/)\n\nMake the Budget Bytes' taco rice and easy black beans, and add cilantro rice chicken for your meat eater.

Veggie burgers, vegan hot dogs taste almost the same as meat ones. \n\nTacos or fajitas are easy to make both vegetarian and not, just keep the meat separate.",
            "I\u2019m a big fan of thai curry. It is very easy to make and you can add whatever protein you want to it.  I have really enjoyed the recipe with both chicken and chickpeas. There are tons of recipes out there, but it basically boils dow to: stir fry whatever veggies+protein you want, add some coconut milk and curry paste, enjoy as-is or over rice. \n\nAlso burritos/burrito bowls are a super tasty and low-effort way to combine leftovers. Similar idea, just lots of veggies, spices, and your choice of protein. I usually do a bowl of sweet potatoes, diced onions, (frozen) corn, lime juice, cilantro, black beans, and either tofu crumbles or chicken.",
            "One of my favorite comfort foods is a bowl of mashed potatoes with a spinach gratin and mushroom gravy.\u00a0 If I am being lazy, I will modify it to a colcanon.\u00a0 I usually pan sear some chicken thighs or cod filets as well for those that want meat with their meal.\n\n\nAnother one we do is a spring vegetable pasta. So lots of mushroom, artichoke, spinach, peas, and carrots and served in a broth reduction with tortelini.\u00a0 Anyone who wants meat I usually offer ham with it.\u00a0 This one serves like a stew depending on how much broth you want to cook down.\u00a0 Using risotto instead of tortelini is also delicious. And pretty quick and easy.\n\n\nMy daughter loves stuffed sweet potatoes, usually with black beans, corn and salsa.\n\n\nStir fry is great. And you can prep the rice in bulk in advance to make is more convenient.\u00a0 Bonus precooked rice that isstored in the fridge becomes a resistant starch vs a simple starch.\n\n\nYou could always follow up with a fried rice or pilaf another night.\n\n\nThis one isn't exactly convenient in terms of effort.\u00a0 But I LOVE spaetzle with sauteed mushrooms and cheese.\u00a0 Some roasted green beans or asparagus on the side and it will fill you up.",

            "My go-to is to always go all out on sides.\n\nRoasted veggies:\nToss some carrots, brussel sprouts, potatoes, and sweet potatoes with some olive oil.  Add oregano, some rosemary, salt, pepper, paprika.\n\nRoast it on a sheet pan.  \n\nGreen Bean Casserole:\nUse some fresh green beans.  Sautee them.  Make a roux with sauteed mushrooms.  Add vegetable stock to the roux until you have a sauce.  Add it all to a casserole dish, top with cheese and crispy onions before you bake it."
