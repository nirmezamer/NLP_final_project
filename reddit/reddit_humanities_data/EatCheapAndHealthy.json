I usually have a protein shake for breakfast around 11 (internment fasting), no lunch, and dinner around 4. Been doing a lot of rice and chicken and thinking about doing this type of meal 2x a week to mix it up. What do you guys think? ",

            "There are some frozen fries that are reasonable with calories if you ever crave Irish potatoes. I'd also go hard on the veggies on the burger: lettuce,  tomatoes, onion and pickles.",
            "Listen. I love myself some good burgers, fries, and milkshake.\n\nBut I dont need a healthy alternative. This is a special treat to be enjoyed. One per month? Sure!",
            "Are you doing one meal a day?  While your proposed healthy meal is healthier than the fast food meal you mentioned, it's still quite high calorie. \n\nIf you're not exercising a lot, why not save the smoothie for breakfast and drink flavored water with your burger and fries?  Or have raw veggies instead of fries?",
            "The best turkey burger I ever had incorporated shredded and squeezed zucchini into the patty mix. It helped keep the patty moist, since the turkey is so lean. It was really good with kale, sauteed onions and mushrooms, and Swiss cheese. I don't have a recipe as my friend made it for me but holy moly. Highly recommend the zucchini trick.",
            "Mix ground Turkey with a bit of liquid beef bouillon and grill burgers, no bun, air fried sweet potato fries tossed with a small pinch of nutritional yeast, and if you want a milkshake, jello sugar free pudding mix in cheesecake flavor",
            "You could easily cut the shake down to lose some calories. You are getting plenty of protein in the turkey burger, so I would cut the protein powder (have that in your morning smoothie instead). You could also do half a cup of the fruit.",
            "if you were on a strict weight loss program this would almost be a days calories, if not it sounds like a delicious healthy and satisfying meal. Thanks for sharing ",
            "Also, turkey burger smash tacos with low carb tortilla, I make these every week, they are SO GOOD!",
            "If youre looking for a protein smoothie that will feel more like a dessert, you can swap out the berries and honey for banana (half or full) and use a chocolate protein powder. Depending on the milk you can have a pretty great smoothie for about 250-275 calories! \n\nDont force the sweet potatoes on yourself if youre not a fan. White potatoes have tons of nutrients and are a great thing to include in a balanced diet. I chop mine up, soak them in water for about an hour or boil them for 5-10 mins. Then I drain them, pat them dry, toss them with some spray oil and salt. Let them get a little beat up and fluffy. Then when you air fry them they get super crispy! Its my fav way to eat a potato."
