        "content": "\nSomeone requested I make this story. Then someone else requested I post it here. Enjoy.\n\nIt was 7:00AM, July the 4th. A young dictator named Kim Jong Un had an important meeting with the US president in just a few hours. This meeting was one of many on his to do list. No big deal normally but this time he felt something strange, a feeling he wouldn\u2019t normally feel for these meetings. Maybe something important was to come, perhaps he overhead talk of economic prosperity earlier this week that had somehow snuck into the back of his mind. It made Kimchi boy think. Not to think too hard and stress himself out, Kim decided to shake it off. His mental health came first. No need for stress. The dictator proceeded to climb out of bed and put on his regular businesses suit. He tied his best shoes on ready to start the day. Kim couldn\u2019t help but take a look at his gorgeous self in the mirror, as per usual. His beautiful body was something to take a gander at. He couldn\u2019t help but feel he looked heavier today, his skin noticeably imperfect, as well as his hair unusually frizzier. Anxiously, the young dictator ran to grab his bathroom scale. Not a single pound gained as he stepped on. \u201cThat can\u2019t be right\u201d. Kim stepped on the scale one more time. The number being the same. He measured his waist and thighs. Nothing different. \u201cI understand  now, it\u2019s the suit.\u201d \u201cThe housemaid must have shrunk it accidentally\u201d what a relief, it was his outfit not his body that was the issue. The beautiful dictator pulled out a gun and swiftly executed the nearest housekeeper. \u201cI\u2019ll wear this suit, I haven\u2019t put it on since I bought it so it should be okay\u201d as he put on the suit he still couldn\u2019t help but feel dissatisfied with his body. His usual beautiful appearance not just felt so inadequate, with there being nothing left to do the tight bodied dictator averted his eyes from the mirror and walked out the bedroom door. Feeling defeated and anxious as he strutted down the hallway. His staff greeted him with the usual. \u201cGood morning Kim, looking fit as always\u201d \u201cgood morning Mr. Dictator, your hair looks beautiful today\u201d. Their kind words feeling somehow patronizing today. \u201cWhy must they all pay attention to my body today?\u201d \u201cWhy do they keep patronizing me\u201d \u201cwhy are they secretly mocking me, these assholes I hate them just leave me alone\u201d. The young dictator\u2019s mind racing with negative thought. \u201cSHUT UP ALL OF YOU, GUARDS EXECUTE THESE FAKES!\u201d \u201cHOW DARE YOU MOCK ME\u201d. Kims shouting was enough to silence the whole room. One by one his housekeepers executed in front of him. He continued down the hallway and to the dining hall. A long table filled with a feast fit for a god was presented to him. Yet again he felt distain. His fast metabolism brought him comfort most mornings, looking at the plates of eggs, bacon, sweets and fried food was normally no challenge to him as he did not need to watch what he ate. \u201c I\u2019m not hungry\u201d kimchi told the chef. \u201c but sir, your metabolism. If we don\u2019t get your 5,000 calories in per meal your body will starve!\u201d Again kimmy boy grew angry. \u201cI see now\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cYOURE TRGING TO MAKE ME FAT\u201d \u201cGUARDS EXECUTE THIS CHEF FOR TREASON\u201d. One more body on the floor. Another favorite staff member of his now dead. \n\n\n\n(Page 1. Page 2 comming soon)",

            "My freshman kid is part of science Olympiad, and she has got a 1st places in one of the science Olympiad torments. I was and is proud of my daughter, and I posted on the high school group chat. I was hoping that parents would be happy and proud of my daughter because she is a freshman, she represents the school and she bit everyone, included older kids. The message was send to parents of freshmen kids and how they should be proud of them. The parent who created the group chat and brags about her 10th grade daughter, did not like that my daughter won over older kids and other nyc schools. She said my daughter won because of money and not her brain. I send her a message back that she has to be proud of freshmen not only her daughter. Anyway, she dropped me from the chat, her admirers were gossip about me. They found my personal information and posted on group chat, my phone, my name and home address. I contacted the principal, but no word from the school since she is part of PA and she things money can solve everything. No brain is required, you can buy everything with money. This parent remained me college scandal!! Can I do anything legal to protect myself and my kid? \u00a0Please help me post this story, so I can see comments on it. Thank you so much\u00a0",

Fuck you Mom, I go where I want.  TO THE BASEMENT!!!\"\n\nThe beauty of the next 17 minutes was indescribable.  A dozen grown men at 10:45 in the morning, giving unified voice.

        "content": "I've never posted on here before, but for those who followed my husband Sam over the years, I am Zoey.  I linked his last post to this one.  I'm only doing this because a lot of you showed him tremendous support, which I appreciate, and hope that anyone who finds themselves going through crisis like he was will get help.  \n\nThose who followed him know that 6 months ago we had an incident where he fell asleep while watching our son Stephen.  I wasn't angry, and I didn't blame him.  I knew he was having a hard time.  I was afraid.  I had been trying to get him to get help for awhile at that point, and with the emotion on the moment he snapped, and lashed out.  He hadn't done so in many years.  \n\nAt that point I made a horrible mistake I regret more than all my other life regrets combined.  I was frustrated, but thought a little space would help us both diffuse.  I was calm, I told him I just needed a break.  I meant just for a few hours and we went to my Mother's house.  I never should have left him alone.  \n\nAbout an hour and half later I got a call from my brother.  He was so distressed.  He had gotten a text from Sam asking for some help in the basement and to just let himself in. That's where he found him.  He had hung himself from the basement ceiling.  \n\nI hate that I couldn't see it sooner, years went by before I really started to notice.  Its just so hard when you're young.  I was working too, we were trying to buy a house, and have kids, travel.  It was a whirlwind.  When Stephen came I started to stay home.  That's when I finally noticed.  There had been hints, I just didn't want to see it I guess.  \n\nYou just don't want to admit things to yourself.  You want to think he did all this just because he wants to.  You think you're reciprocating it.  Reading his posts, I didn't even realize how much I missed.  I know he was actively hiding his stress and habits.  I know he rug swept all his emotions that could be taken negatively.  But there were hints, why couldn't I see them?\n\nI'm the catalyst of his descent.  I know I didn't deserve him after what I did.  I've felt that shame for 8 years now.  I've done everything I could think of to repent for my choices.  I won't justify them, I was wrong, and I hurt someone I love beyond measure. \n\nI'm sure some of you wonder how I could do that to him. I wonder that myself often.  It's easy to throw out the usual excuses, I was young, I was immature.  To tell you the actual truth it really was just FOMO.  Combined with having a few \"friends\" in my ear, which I now realize they were not friends, and a school girl crush on a classmate was all it took for me to traumatize the most important person in my life.  It sounds so dumb written out, but it's true.  The NRE lasted about a month, then it was 3 weeks of making up reasons to see it through.  By time I left I knew I had made a huge mistake, and came crawling back.  I still shutter thinking how much I compartmentalized.  The sight of him when I showed up has always haunted me.  It's guilt I deserve and will always hold on to. \n\nFor all the remorse I feel over what I did when I was 21, it pales to the feelings I have not being able to help him before it was too late. I think I have read his posts almost everyday in these last 6 months. I failed him so much, I'll hold on to this pain for the rest of my life.  I'll have to watch our son grow up without his father.  Nothing will ever fill this void. \n\nI don't know what I wanted to accomplish with this, though it's been surprisingly cathartic.  Maybe this will help someone else, someone holding onto something they can't handle on their own.  If that's you seek help, it's not weakness, it's strength.  No one is perfect.  No one can do it ALL on their own. ",
