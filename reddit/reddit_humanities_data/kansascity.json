            "\u2026This may be a hot take since this sub seems to be pretty left leaning, but can we please stop generalizing and stereotyping *all* churches and the people in them? Yes, there are pieces of shit that use their prominence in a church to do horrible, horrible things, and those things should be outed to the public and that person should be punished. But at the same time, there are so many genuinely *good* people in churches who have great intentions and help the community. Not every person that attends church is a pos and not every Christian is an evangelical loon.",

So I guess yeah there bad people everywhere but if we\u2019re to grade them on a scale I would say the churches win in a landslide in both quality and quantity.",

It\u2019s the sheriff department stupid policy.  \n\nThis gang leader who calls himself sheriff is who at fault.  \n\nThese fees should come out of the Clay county sheriff budget.\n\nAnd residents of clay county, which I am one, should not let this bully win reelection.
