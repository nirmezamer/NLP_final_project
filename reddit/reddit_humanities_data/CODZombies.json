            "It looks so good. I\u2019m a huge defender of Cold War Zombies but I can\u2019t defend the lack of support round-based zombies received.\n\nSo the fact that they have two maps on release and repeatedly said throughout the COD Showcase that this is, \u201cThe triumphant return of **round-based** zombies\u201d has me hopeful that Outbreak is a thing of the past and their full focus is back on round-based maps.",
            "COLD WAR 2 LETSSS GOOOO.\n\nAnd the set crew w/ gobble gums is the icing.\n\nSalvage is confirmed, and you can see it if you click through the trailer.\n\nOne thing I hope is that they tone down the amount of radio chatter, or atleast let us turn it off.",
            "I get the feeling this may be a return to BO3 style gameplay, most likely with some new additions. It makes me wonder how BO3 it\u2019s going to feel, but it is smart having a set crew. The amount of times they mention round-based makes me wonder what will happen to outbreak (never played it but I know it was highly popular amongst casual fans of zombies).",
            "sounds like Milo was pretty on point with his \u201cI found tranzit\u201d video given that one of the launch maps is Liberty Falls & (possibly over analyzing this) they mention how important the \u201clegacy of zombies\u201d is in the direct",

            "That round change music though, looks pretty nice, as opposed to many here, I actually really loved Cold War Zombie and I hope the mechanics are similar to it.",
            "I\u2019m genuinely hyped, they seem to be combining elements from Cold War and BO3 and I\u2019m all here for it. Everything we\u2019ve seen/heard so far is sounding really promising. I can\u2019t wait for more details!"

Expect every location you visit to be packed with powerful weapons, new and returning power-ups, a pantheon of revolting entities to face, and a host of secrets and easter eggs to discover.  \n  \nRemember too, that many of the previously revealed innovations in movement, visual fidelity, audio, and weapons will all be coming to Zombies as well. That\u2019s not including the many additional Zombies-specific features, both new and returning. Expect more information to come in the following weeks.\n\n[Black Ops 6 Zombies Teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1EpwQDzfk4&pp=ygUbYm82IHpvbWJpZXMgdGVhc2VyIHRyYWlsZXIg)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# MAPS\n\n*There will be 2 maps at launch for Black Ops 6 Zombies; Liberty Falls and Terminus.* \n\n# LIBERTY FALLS\n\n**Map's Description(***MrDalekJD)***:** In Liberty Falls, an \"elite unit\" is sent to investigate what happened. It is said to be an iconic setting for zombies and an Americana 90's theme. There is video stores, a motel, a gas station, a bowling alley, a comic shop, and a church. It is set in a town in the West Virginia mountains, with the mountains being the background scenery/skybox. This map is the bright and sunny map while Terminus is the dark one. \n\n* This map is said to be the casual pick up and play map.\n* Set in the same time as Terminus \n* Will include a Main EE as well as many side EE to discover when we play.\n* In the past, the following has been leaked associated with Liberty Falls\n   * Includes a bank that has a working bank system similar to Town in Transit.\n   * Includes the return of Jet Gun\n   * People have said that this is Treyarch's reimagining of a transit like map, but this is just based off speculation, not confirmed at all. Based off new leaks, this may not be the case but we have no clue. \n\n# TERMINUS \n\n**Map's Description(***MrDalekJD):* Terminus is called in-lore \"Blacksite 13\". There appears to be several divide sections of the map including the main prison as well as maze like elevated platforms. \n\n* The Easter egg/story implications of this map is to break out characters from prison. The twist os that two characters don't agree on intentions, this is Peck and the new character Maya. \n* This map is said to be the complex map filled with tons of Easter eggs to discover. \n* Set in the same time as Liberty Falls\n* Will include a Main EE as well as a ton of side EE to discover when we play\n* Includes a ton of variety of zombie types, including brand new ones for BO6.\n* Has a giant turret in the north end of the map that sucks of zombies in a dark aether way.\n* The island is MASSIVE and is set at night, described to be very dark and gloomy.\n* In the past, the following has been leaked associated with TERMINUS\n   * A drivable boat being able to be driven around the map\n   * The starting area is rumored to be in the cellblock\n   * Tentacle dogs that appear on the map\n   * Have an underground area: *This seems to be confirmed and being the prison part of the area.*\n* Here is some photos of the map. \n   * [Massive Canyon](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GPpzTl2aQAAIO9c?format=png&name=small)\n   * [Big Boy Zombie](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GPpzTnKaQAAWtAS?format=jpg&name=medium)\n   * [Official Crew(On both maps, but shown in Terminus)](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GPpyhgsakAA5kda?format=jpg&name=large)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# GAMEPLAY FEATURES\n\n*The following has been rumored or* confirmed *to return in BO6 Zombies*\n\n* GobbleGums\n   * Official Description: GobbleGums return to Zombies in Black Ops 6, and they\u2019re more delicious than ever! GobbleGums are everyone's favorite jaw-breaking confectionary power-up and were last available in Call of Duty: Black Ops 3. These earnable treats are a special consumable item that provide unique effects to players. Purchase or upgrade to the Vault Edition to unlock the GobbleGum Pack. This consists of 12 single-use GobbleGums offering unique in-game effects!  Expect these GobbleGums to be packed with amazing (and sometimes surreal) powers, accessible immediately at launch.\n   * GobbleGums is said to be the best of both worlds from Bo3/Bo4 inside BO6. \n   * GobbleGums can be earned by simply playing zombies. \n   * It is said that it will include multiple rarities to differ the gobble gums\n* Perks\n   * Quick Revive\n   * Speed Cola\n   * Juggernog\n   * Deadshot Daiquiri\n   * Death Perception\n   * Tombstone Soda\n   * PHD Flopper\n   * Stamina Up\n   * Elemental Pop\n   * Double Tap: *People are assuming this is returning due to classic perk bottles being teased in bo6 reveal today.* \n* Salvage\n* Rage Inducer \n* Traps\n* Wonder Weapons to return: new and old\n   * Ray Gun\n   * Jet Gun: Rumored\n   * New WW in Liberty Falls\n   * New WW in Terminus\n* Power ups\n   * Max Ammo \n   * Double Points\n   * Carpenter \n   * Full armor\n   * Bonus Points\n   * Buyers Sale\n   * Nuke\n* Exfils: This is a rumor, but is most likely to return\n* Mystery Box\n* Pack a Punch\n* Crafting\n* Some sort of armory system: *It is rumored that it's a combination of previous ones, to be the best one yet.*\n* Weapon Progression\n* Omnidirectional movement\n* **SET CREW RETURNS**\n   * It is unknown if the set crew is only on Terminus but my guess is that this will be our set crew for both maps at launch.\n   * You can also use other operators as your characters but if you want tons of chatter/OG story character implications, use the set crew as they will talk to each other about the map itself to carry the story forward.\n   * The 4 main characters are the following \n      * Weaver \n      * Gray\n      * Carver\n      * Maya\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n*Its still very early days for* information *for BO6 Zombies, but what we know so far sounds very promising and I* can't *wait to learn more.*",
