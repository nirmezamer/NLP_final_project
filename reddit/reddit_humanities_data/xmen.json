            "Was going to wait for this to come out in trades. But after catching the preview, I decided that I couldn't wait. And I'm glad I did. \n\nAfter what happened to Akihiro at the end of Percy's run on Wolverine and X-Force, this feels like a messy, but fitting way to continue his story. It's brutal. It's violent. And it's perfectly in keeping with the Wolverine family legacy. \ud83d\ude0a",
            "Wasn\u2019t gonna pull this for many many reasons but I\u2019m actually enjoying it so far. I don\u2019t care about the Destroyers but I think the Akihiro characterization has promise so far",
            "For people disappointed in Roberto\u2019s role in the show, this cameo kind of feels like insult to injury. More whitewashing of his appearance and backstory experiencing racism\n\nOverall I wouldn\u2019t say this mini added much to the show. It wasn\u2019t *bad*, it had decent moments. It just kind of\u2026 was a comic that came out",
            "I really liked this. It wasn\u2019t earth shattering or anything but it was definitely what was promised. A fun story about Yana kicking vampire ass",
            "Nice self-contained story. I like that Magik didn't just trounce the big boss through brute force, since he's shown to be bigger, stronger and faster than her, so she had to use some quick-thinking and smart tactics to beat him.",
            "Magik with going full ''I am not trapped here with you. You are trapped here with me'' mode.\n\nI guess you don't expect ancient vampires to keep up with their 'who to avoid' list, otherwise they wouldn't have brought Magik into their camp.",
            "Loved this issue for Magik, her getting to fight like a demon but still be the protector of the innocent, perfect! What I love about Magik is that after all shes been through, she still wants to be a hero and save people. She might be a bit scary but her heart is firmly in the right place.  \n\nI really enjoyed how she used her portals to speed up in this issue! They aren't just for transportation, they can be used to fight! And we got to see her use magic! I am holding hope that she gets to do cool stuff like this in the upcoming X-Men run instead of just being a taxi for the team."

            "It's real. It's from the first issue of Marauders at the start of the Krakoa Era. The context is that Kitty / Kate has discovered she can't go through the Krakoan gates, so that's essentially what they're talking about (as a jokey reference to the end of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\").",
            "I just watched the flashpoint paradox and a villain (the top) actually said \u201conce again it looks like you\u2019re the bottom and IM the top!\u201d. Then there was a whole weird moment with green lantern. The whole thing was so charged with gay overtones I almost unzipped thrice.",

            "Oh woah I literally just read this page like 3 minutes ago. I don't know the exact issue or date or anything, I'm still pretty new to X-Men stuff, but this was when Kitty Pryde was unable to use the portals to go to Krakoa, so she had to take a boat over and was super pissed about it. The person yelling off panel is Logan, asking if she brought beer with her (she did, she IS the supply).",
            "I think that's from Marauders #1 when Kitty can't use the gate to access Krakoa.  The joke is a reference to the last scene of Raiders of the Lost Ark.",

            "It's a callback to Kitty's past. She left the X-Men and tended bar for a while in the early 2000s. Chris Claremont wrote a limited series about her trying to be a civilian called Mekanix that's pretty good. It's all on Marvel Unlimited. You should check it out.",
            "She was a pirate for like 2 minutes. Barely even got to see it in action with all the bigger stories or time travel scenarios they got pulled into anyway.",
            "If I could still pay my rent and bills, I\u2019d go back to being a barista in a heartbeat",
            "An iteration of Marauders that just goes around saving other mutants after the fallout of Krakoa failing could be a good mini series idea tbh.",
            "Honestly, becoming a bartender seems like a natural job for a pirate that wants to settle down.",
            "Thanks for clarifying this for someone who hasn't read the stuff \u2013\u00a0bartender makes a lot more sense for Kate than barista!",

            "I just don't know why they brought back that outfit for her. Even if the idea was just to make her sexier and let her show more skin, it's such an outdated design. The long sleeves, the over sized mask, the material/fabric looking so plain and cheap. \n\nIt is pretty funny, because this instantly wakes Jean up and makes her go after Nightmare while Scott just kind of lingers in bed a bit until Jean comes back to bone him. I guess maybe (perhaps not intentionally) you could interpret that as Scott having these kinds of nightmares often? So he's used to them.",
            "Both of them got off better than Laura.\n\nThe Facility? Kimura? Zebra Daddy? Nope. Laura's nightmare was about a relationship that from her perspective NEVER HAPPENED.",
            "I cannot find it in me to respect that god awful outfits. It\u2019s just a short dress and an oddly shaped mask. I\u2019m literally going to throw myself out a window",
            "You say that like being on the wrong end of Emma Frost's legendary scathing wit isn't a valid fear. Her real primary mutation is Omega level roasts.",
            "I mean, the actual issue is clearly the loss of innocence and struggle to find self, which in Jean\u2019s case can lead to things much worse than the fall of mutantkind\u2026 but I guess Emma judging her is also a way to look at it\u2026",
            "I think in JDW\u2019s latest AIPTA interview he says that it was essentially to show that Jean wanted to go to the time before Phoenix and all her huge problems. Which I guess kinda makes sense, but also doesn\u2019t. She should\u2019ve been embracing her history and moving forward. The choice made more sense for the idea of Krakoa than that of Jean\u2019s character. They should\u2019ve upgraded this look at least tho.",
            "The only book where I liked this outfit was X-Force, because it helped show the contrast between Jean\u2019s innocence/purity and the dark workings of the team.",
            "For your second paragraph I believe Jean being an omega level telepath and could sense her mind being invaded had something to do with it.",
            "Everyone was bemoaning the outfit, but I think it was Hickman who said it was a deliberate choice. The outfit is significant for Jean because of what it represents in the context of her relationship with the Phoenix.",

Name, Powers, and Appearance accounts for like 60-90% of a superhero character\u2019s value. Now all the people who knew Psylocke from Marvel vs Capcom etc. are confused and/or disappointed.
