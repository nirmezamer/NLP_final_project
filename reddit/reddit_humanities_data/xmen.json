So if you don\u2019t like ghost rider don\u2019t read.\n\nI like ghost rider!",
            "Was going to wait for this to come out in trades. But after catching the preview, I decided that I couldn't wait. And I'm glad I did. \n\nAfter what happened to Akihiro at the end of Percy's run on Wolverine and X-Force, this feels like a messy, but fitting way to continue his story. It's brutal. It's violent. And it's perfectly in keeping with the Wolverine family legacy. \ud83d\ude0a",
            "Wasn\u2019t gonna pull this for many many reasons but I\u2019m actually enjoying it so far. I don\u2019t care about the Destroyers but I think the Akihiro characterization has promise so far"

            "Perfect. \n\nAlthough I know some artists were unaware that the two characters (Kwannon and Betsy) are even separate and were confused by the purple hair apparently no longer being Psylocke's thing. One artist for a variant cover for MacKay's X-Men said he was told by editorial not to colour Psylocke's hair purple, so he settled on a purple glow around her black hair. He remarked how it was a weird design change and he things the purple hair suited her. \n\nSo clearly a lot of the older fans and artists don't seem to be aware that they are two separate people now and the purple hair went to Betsy while everything else went with Psylocke.",

            " \nBut see, I think this was a mistake. People liked their purple haired ninja. Now we have a purple haired woman who isn\u2019t a ninja and a ninja who doesn\u2019t have purple hair. Name, Powers, and Appearance accounts for like 60-90% of a superhero character\u2019s value. Now all the people who knew Psylocke from Marvel vs Capcom etc. are confused and/or disappointed. I think they should have gone with dark purple for Kwannon and light for Betsy, and make your artists practice drawing Japanese people vs. English people. In real life this would not be hard to tell apart.",

I don't know the exact issue or date or anything, I'm still pretty new to X-Men stuff, but this was when Kitty Pryde was unable to use the portals to go to Krakoa, so she had to take a boat over and was super pissed about it. The person yelling off panel is Logan, asking if she brought beer with her (she did, she IS the supply).",

            "**MYSTIQUE #1 (OF 5)**\n\nWritten by DECLAN SHALVEY\n\nArt and Cover by DECLAN SHALVEY\n\nOn Sale 10/16\n\nShe\u2019s the mutant murderess you never see coming! This October, Mystique headlines an all-new solo series set in the X-Men\u2019s upcoming From the Ashes era!\n\nWritten and drawn by award-winning creator Declan Shalvey (MOON KNIGHT, DEAD MAN LOGAN), MYSTIQUE will sift through the dark underbelly of the Marvel Universe for an unpredictable tale of action and espionage starring the world\u2019s most mysterious mutant. \n\nOn Krakoa, Mystique reunited with her wife Destiny and forged new relationships with her children Rogue and Nightcrawler. Now that the mutant nation has fallen, Mystique will stop at nothing to protect what she fought so hard to regain!\n\nWith a hit list as long as her rap sheet, Mystique\u2019s actions catch the attention of Nick Fury, erupting in a deadly game of cat and mouse as the elusive shapeshifter infiltrates her way across the Marvel Universe. Complete with a new costume, Mystique\u2019s new saga harkens back to her beloved early \u201800s spy series as she takes on a new and pivotal role in the current mutant landscape. \n\nHow do you track a subject with a history that contradicts itself? How do you stop a force whose motives change like quicksilver? How do you stop a target that can be anyone? That\u2019s the question that confronts Nick Fury as he stumbles upon a web of lies and espionage leading back to Mystique. From the ashes of Krakoa, the shape-shifting mutant terrorist returns to remind the world exactly why it hates and fears her. \n\n\"Mystique is hands down one of the most compelling characters to come from the Marvel Universe,\" Shalvey shared. \"To have an opportunity to put my own stamp on such an iconic character and showcase her in a series of her own is a unique privilege.\"\n\n\"As a rabid X-fan since childhood, I\u2019m having a blast channeling all my X-enthusiasm into writing and drawing this project,\" he continued. \"In this series, Mystique is reeling from the fall of Krakoa. She\u2019s a rogue element with no accountability putting a mysterious plan into action, ruthlessly destroying anything and anyone in her way.\"\n\nhttps://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/mystique-limited-series-declan-shalvey-x-men-from-the-ashes",

            "Very excited for this one. Love Declan Shalvey and Mystique. Glad to see he\u2019s both artist and writer. I hope Destiny has a decent size role in this as well.",
            "Tailor: \"Here's your new costume, Mrs. Darkh\u00f6lme, hope you like it!\"\n\nMystique: \"There aren't enough skulls on it.\"\n\nTailor: \"Skulls? You mean like, you want the fabric to have a skull pattern?\"\n\nMystique: ::Hands tailor small skulls::\n\nTailor: \"Oh...sure...umm...let me just...\"\n\nMystique: ::Snatches skulls and costume back from tailor:: \"Oh Jesus H, I'll do it myself. Ugh, you want something done....\"",
