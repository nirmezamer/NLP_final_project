            "I think the date for Retropolis 2 is 6/14 and the date for Sky Climb is 6/25\n\nThese may change, but that is what they are per best information available today. VRSO is set for June but no date provided.\n\nJune looks scarce at the moment, but so did last few months that all ended up having 5-10 games released. For June, I think Windlands 2 and Compound are safe bets, but no official confirmation at this time.\n\nThanks for continuing the good work of maintaining the release calendar posts",

But holy sh*t! this game just ate up my entire Friday lol\n\nThe mechanics, while difficult to get into at first, eventually become super fluid. And I\u2019ve gotta say it\u2019s nice to play something other than a shooter in VR.\n\nMy only real complaint is a similar VR complaint: more content. There\u2019s a decent amount of tracks but It could def use more. More boards customization, more music options, etc.\n\nDef worth checking out if it goes on sale or at full price if you\u2019re a big skating/Tony Hawk fan.\n\n",

It\u2019s def a fair amount of content, I think I\u2019m just enjoying it so much I want MOAR",
