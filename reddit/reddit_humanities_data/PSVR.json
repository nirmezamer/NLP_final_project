            "What do people think of Drums Rock? I tried the demo, and I liked it more than I thought I would, but occasionally, it felt like the stick didn't hit when it should have, and it would throw me off. I adjusted the kit, and it got better, but does anyone play it and find they can consistently 100% songs, or is there always a bit of jank with it? With a physical peripheral like guitar hero, at least I know it's my fault if I mess up."

But holy sh*t! this game just ate up my entire Friday lol\n\nThe mechanics, while difficult to get into at first, eventually become super fluid. And I\u2019ve gotta say it\u2019s nice to play something other than a shooter in VR.\n\nMy only real complaint is a similar VR complaint: more content. There\u2019s a decent amount of tracks but It could def use more. More boards customization, more music options, etc.\n\nDef worth checking out if it goes on sale or at full price if you\u2019re a big skating/Tony Hawk fan.\n\n",
