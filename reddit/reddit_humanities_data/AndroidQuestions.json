They just launched their [phone recommendation engine](https://www.perfectrec.com/), and we'd love your feedback on it.\n\nHow PerfectRec works is they hire product experts from places like Reddit and have them work with a machine learning team to build a personalized product recommendation model.\nI'm looking forward to how well it recommends products vs other websites, but we would love some early feedback. Keep in mind - this is based in the US and at the moment doesn't really take into account \"global\" or \"international\" options.\n\nWhat do you think works? What doesn't? Do the Android recommendations seem good to you?",

            "I've been working with Fatalstryke on PerfectRec. One thing I'd add is our target audience for the site isn't product enthusiasts, but rather everyday consumers like my mom and dad who might call and ask what phone they should buy. People who find researching and comparing electronics overwhelming. \n\nI'm super curious what you think of the recommendations we are providing right now. Are they what you'd recommend to a family member who asked?",
            "I like it, especially the feature that recommends a phone that is slightly above budget. Users won't miss a recommendation just because a good option is a few dollars more than the base price. Good job.",

            "Is there a modern phone like the Galaxy S9/S9+? I've never been happier with a phone than my S9, but unfortunately it's gotten too old to be usable anymore (even if I replaced it with a sealed one), and my eyes have gotten to the point where I can no longer read such a small display. So I'm looking for a modern phone with the features I loved about the S9 - notification LED, SD card slot, no holepunch/notch, no camera bump, and a fingerprint sensor on the back. Unfortunately it seems like all the modern flagships use under-display sensors (which suck), the only ones that have rear or side sensors are mid-to-low-end, none of them bave notification lights, and all of them have holepunches. It has to have flagship features like an OLED display and a Snapdragon 8 series chip (865 or better). Ideal size is between 6.1\" and 6.5\" display, so more like an S9+ as it has the perfect width, just a tad bit too long..",
