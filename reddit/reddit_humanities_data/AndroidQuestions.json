They just launched their [phone recommendation engine](https://www.perfectrec.com/), and we'd love your feedback on it.\n\nHow PerfectRec works is they hire product experts from places like Reddit and have them work with a machine learning team to build a personalized product recommendation model.\nI'm looking forward to how well it recommends products vs other websites, but we would love some early feedback. Keep in mind - this is based in the US and at the moment doesn't really take into account \"global\" or \"international\" options.\n\nWhat do you think works? What doesn't? Do the Android recommendations seem good to you?",

            "Too me, its showing phones any other recommendation website or even Amazon App picks up on.\n\nWhat about Customization, Rooting, Privacy, Security, Years of Upgrades, Storage, RAM, etc...\n\nCoordinate with Magisk, Custom ROM creators, Security experts & privacy experts(REAL ONES), conduct surveys through out years on the same phones to see how users still feel/like them etc\n\nIdk, it just does not stand out at the moment. \n\nI will say congrats on trying to make things easy for the users... if its sincere..  i may look at it more in detail later.",
            "I used the website fully expecting a Galaxy A54 recommendation. I chose Android, Small (also medium), up to $400, 1 cam, 1 battery life, checked OLED display and refresh rate 90hz+, and it recommended me the p7a, s23, and p7. P7A wasn't a bad recommendation, but I give it an L because the A54 is cheaper, and higher refresh rate. \n\nI think you guys should pivot a bit and try to become pcpartpicker but for phones.\n\nI'd rather see a [pcpartpicker-esque](https://i.imgur.com/C9dt4Zu.png) view of looking at phones where there's a bunch of filters on the left side (sliding price, size, refresh rate, manufacturer, screen res, OS, battery, etc), and a filterable/sortable table that displays the most important info, and like in pcpartpicker, you can click on the phone and it'll show you literally all of its specs and features, and a list of best deals like [gsmarena](https://www.gsmarena.com/google_pixel_7-price-11903.php), but display them how [pcpartpicker does it](https://i.imgur.com/IycbuyX.png) so you can see other options.\n\nFor example, I'm currently in the market for finding an Android phone that has 120hz, is unlocked, has an oled screen, and under $500. From my own personal researching, I was able to find a Galaxy A54 for $320 on Amazon. I feel like there's a lot of options out there that satisfy those parameters, but googling \"best 120hz midrange phones\" or some other variations leads to me terrible looking websites that didn't really answer my question, showed expensive phones, or very long articles that required to do way more research anyway.\n\nI feel like the website would unironically do a much better job of \"recommending\" you something with an extensive list of filters and sortable table at first glance like pcpartpicker versus strictly an algorithm. \n\nImagine I could just check a box on the left side that said 120 hz and OLED screen, put under $500 on a sliding scale, and sort the table by ascending order of price. I'd instantly have a table of ALL the phones out there with the best prices that satisfy all my desired parameters instead of having to go through several arbitrary questions and answers. Imagine these results having a shareable link? Experts (or ppl who know about phones) would LOVE this, and experts would also have a much easier time recommending phones to askers with a tool like this. Basically, put the onus of the actual recommending part on the experts instead of an algorithm, and create a platform with a great UI & UX that'll make that easy. \n\nAll that being said, the recommendation part and the pcpartpicker part can definitely both co-exist on the platform for sure, so it's not like you'd have to scrap the rec algo entirely since it most certainly is very useful for complete newbies, but I think a shift of focus and priority would solve way many more needs and use cases.\n\nIMO you have a clear goal and a good idea here that is definitely needed, but I urge you to take heavy inspiration from pcpartpicker and think about that approach too, as I could easily see it potentially being super useful for newbies and experts alike.",
            "I've been working with Fatalstryke on PerfectRec. One thing I'd add is our target audience for the site isn't product enthusiasts, but rather everyday consumers like my mom and dad who might call and ask what phone they should buy. People who find researching and comparing electronics overwhelming. \n\nI'm super curious what you think of the recommendations we are providing right now. Are they what you'd recommend to a family member who asked?",
            "I like it, especially the feature that recommends a phone that is slightly above budget. Users won't miss a recommendation just because a good option is a few dollars more than the base price. Good job.",
            "As an engineer, I would strongly suggest look at pre-installed non-removable and updating bloatware and make your own decision.  Remember most phones out there have all apps installed in the internal memory.",
            "I didn't get any benefit from this whatsoever. I tried to be relatively vague with my answers just to see how it worked and just kept recommending me a Samsung.\u00a0\n\n\nThe only metrics it had was that cameras were a three out of four in importance and battery was a three out of four and importance and that I wanted OLED.\u00a0\n\n\nLol\u00a0\n\n\nUS market is so limited... 93% of characters sales go to two companies and I think there's almost no utility here.\u00a0\n\n\nMight I have some value at the super budget level where there's more options I suppose",
