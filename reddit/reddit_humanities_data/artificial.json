            "Cool, so that means AI can replace CEOs and those higher paid management roles, right? Why switch to AI when certain roles require human-to-human interaction and is often preferred, when no one, not customers or staff, really needs/wants to interact with upper management? The way I see it, the higher up the pecking order you go, the greater the need and ease it would be to replace those people with AI.",

Point being, I think \"most things\" is a much wider class of problems than people like Dario Amodei imagine - and often require you to be a physical agent in the world.",
            "LMAO they are trained on billions of images and can't even draw hands correctly without additional tricks. Current AI are very good statistical models and have a mind blowing amount of training data but are still unable to reason."
