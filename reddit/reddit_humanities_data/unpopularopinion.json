        "content": "Before y\u2019all hop into the comments telling me how wrong I am, let me explain my argument. I am NOT saying that your travel experiences make you unattractive. I\u2019m not even saying that liking to travel is bad.\n\nWhat I AM saying is that many women on dating apps (I\u2019m not sure if this is sex-specific, do men do this too?) have travel all over their profiles. Pictures of themselves kayaking in the jungle. Pictures of themselves in front of the Great Pyramids. And so forth. And then you read through their profile, and they say their biggest hobbies and goals involve travel. That they took a year off work to travel the world. That they\u2019re looking for a travel partner, and so forth.\n\nSo anyway. If that\u2019s legitimately what you truly love and that\u2019s a big part of your personality, more power to you. But I can\u2019t help but wonder if you\u2019re doing/saying all this because you think it\u2019s attractive or it makes you interesting. Because it doesn\u2019t IMO.\n\nHonestly, if I see someone who seems obsessed with travel, it\u2019s kind of a red flag. Traveling is fun for sure, but I don\u2019t want a \u201ctravel partner.\u201d I want a wife. I want to settle down and have children. And I know I\u2019m not the only one. I also want someone who\u2019s responsible with money, not someone who\u2019s going to blow all of our life savings to go to Paris. I\u2019d rather save that money to send out future children to a private school, or save it for retirement when we actually CAN travel without having to lose our jobs\u2014because we don\u2019t have jobs anymore.\n\nI dunno. Maybe that makes me boring. But your obsession with travel and being willing to risk losing your job to go on a year long African safari just seems irresponsible to me, and that\u2019s kind of unattractive to me. But that\u2019s just me. It also sounds exhausting, both mentally and physically. ",

            "I think them saying they like to travel isnt them trying to appear attractive, but maybe to connect with someone who has similar interests? \n\nWouldnt you hate if you didnt know they liked to travel and then connect and everythings great, and find out that their hobbies and interests dont match yours. I really dont think it has anything to do with trying to be attractive.",
            "The best photos are always taken while travelling imo because youre happy and the setting is interesting, thats why you see them a lot on dating profiles. I dont think your assessment of people that like travel being bad with money or not wanting to settle down is fair though.",
            "Ah yes, being passionate about travel automatically means one is bad with savings and cannot hold a job.",
            "It's wild to me that when women have documented experience of loving and engaging in travel you leap to thinking they only did it to *appear* attractive to men.\n\nThat woman climbing Kilimanjaro doesn't care that you want a traditional life and to stay in one place. Why do you care so much about *her* choices?",
            "Shocking that OP is single",
            "I do think traveling is attractive but only if people do it to learn about different cultures and maybe see the flora and fauna in other regions of the world. It shows curiosity about the world and being open for new things. \n\nHowever, there are also a lot of people who only go to super touristy places like Cancun, Bali, Phuket, Ibiza, etc. only eat the food they are used to and mostly disregard the nature, the people and their culture in thoses places. Those people are incredibly unattractive to me.",
            "OPs post history has some gems.",
            "Isnt that great? This way you can avoid these people who are not attractive to you. A lot of people like to travel. A lot of women (shocker) dont want kids, so they would rather spend their money than saving it up for an eventuality that might never happen. Perfect! You can go for the ones that dont have travel in their profile, and leave the explorers alone since you wouldnt be compatible anyway. \n\nIts the same with people posting pets in their profile. For a pet lover like me that would be a green flag, for someone with allergies its a pointer to swipe the other way.",
            "I think people put things on there in the hope of finding people who enjoy similar stuff. If you don't like travelling then you're not going to be a good match for these people. However you're not the kind of person they're after - people display their hobbies in the hope of finding people who share them.\n\nIt's perfectly possible to travel and still have a good job by the way - that's what annual leave is for. I use pretty much all my AL to go on trips, it makes me happy. And I have a full time job/career.",

        "content": "The service style currently used by most restaurants is inefficient and somewhat annoying.\n\nWaiters essentially need to guess when a table is ready to order, needs extra ketchup, or is ready for the bill. When waiters guess wrong, they interrupt a conversation. When a customer does need extra ketchup, they waste their time trying to make eye contact and hand gestures to signal a waiter (who's busy interrupting the conversations of people who don't need service).\n\nInstead, each table should have an option to use a call button which signals to the waiter that you need service. It can even be disabled by default, so if the game of trying to see which waiter can guess best when you need service is truly important to you, it can still be like that. The waiters would be better at servicing you since they don't need to guess when to service others.\n\n**Edit: The call button would simply activate a light above your table that would be turned off only when the waiter comes to the table. Hitting the call button multiple times would have no effect.**\n\n**Edit 2: I'm genuinely surprised that all negative comments are 'this would be bad for waiters'. I expected the opposite, along the lines of 'it's important that waiters make customers feel like  they're being attended to without asking'. The call button described above would be better for waiters. They clearly know who needs service and don't need to expend mental energy looking for eye/hand signals or waste energy checking on tables that don't need service. Clearly and efficiently knowing that a table is requesting service via a call button does not require a waiter to change anything else about his or her job. Inefficiently communicating that information does nothing of benefit for anyone.**",

Since I've moved to the city, no one knows but I still use it because the mountains are due north and its desert to the south, so if I ever need to orient myself that way I just look for the mountains. But no one else does that as far as I've seen. It's really only convenient if you have a landmark in the distance that's visible to orient yourself. If I can't see the mountain, after two turns in the city I have no idea where north is anymore",

Why aren't we talking about landmarks!! \n\nIf I ask you for directions to the hospital and you say \"oh yeah, the hospital, that's about 16 miles north of here\" I still don't fucking know how to get to the hospital!! If you tell me \"oh yeah, go straight until you see the McDonald's, hang a left, then go until you get to the gas station. Turn right, drive for about a minute, and the hospital will be on your left\" then I might actually have a shot in hell of seeing a doctor today!!",
            "cardinal directions have the problem of being consistent which makes them inconsistent. unlike normal directions you need to know where north is. sometimes its in front of you, sometimes to your left, most often somewhere in between of the 4 directions. sailors used it because the sea is a boring blue nothingburger with no points of interest and nothing blocking your path. a city isnt made up of straight lines to follow, it has alleys, buildings, dead ends, etc which is why its important to give more precise directions. sure youre north of me, lets say i know where north is, but how to reach you? which path to take? telling me to just face a direction and go forward tells me nothing unless youre the first thing i see after facing said direction",
            "West of the city centre gives me absolutely no idea where you are. You have any idea how much lies to the west of the city centre? Give me real fucking directions. You cant navigate a city just with cardinal directions, they arent built that way. We arent in a desert or a jungle or in the middle of the ocean. Jfc",
            "\"Go North\" is the least useful thing to say in a city that everyone you've told it to was right to mock you for it. Which street? How far? Which side is it on?
