It's honestly not a surprise that they're so popular since they took those sub genres and decided to water it and dilute it down for a Tiktok audience. ",

Maybe I just have a boomer mindset, but streaming should not be considered a \u201cjob\u201d. YouTube is more understandable, as that can take skill and hard work in terms of editing, communication etc. These streamers should not be getting paid thousands/ millions and a select few making more than some professional athletes for just whining about the game they are playing and reading a chat log for 6- 12 hrs, I just don\u2019t see the value at all compared to YouTube or other entertainment.

            "Truly an unpopular opinion. Different streamers are watched by different people for different reasons. Those people are donating them their own money. For whatever reason. But most probably, because they just like them. I can say the same thing about why certain famous football players have millions for kicking the ball.",
            "You\u2019re focused only on the big name streamers who make tons of money.  99% of streamers do not make that kind of money. In fact, most don\u2019t make enough to survive off their earnings to stream fulltime.  \n\nIn addition, those streamers making millions often are able to do so because they\u2019re supplementing the streaming income with ad revenue and a YouTube channel where they post clips and similar. So it\u2019s a hybrid system! It\u2019s *very* rare for a streamer to make the big bucks exclusively streaming. That\u2019s the 1% of the 1% basically.",

            "I disagree. I say this not to disparage young people but I invite you to consider my perspective as a Gen X\u2019er, because I am genuinely concerned. \n\nToday\u2019s generations are softer for sure. As a parent, for example, I see young parents fuss over every little thing about their kids that my generation would simply shrug off. You are afraid of everything. And in doing so, also raise soft kids. \n\nYou are soft also because you are afraid to form your own opinions today. Instead, and precisely because of the widespread influence of the internet and social media, you form opinions based on what you see and hear there. Mob mentality is what has caused today\u2019s woke culture, among other things. \n\nI find that younger folk aren\u2019t able to review things critically on their own, based on their own knowledge and experience. Instead, a lot of you refer to the internet. Your beliefs are those of the social media masses, and you revel in echoing them despite knowing full well that things on the internet are often exaggerated, faked, overblown or manipulated. \n\nI know you guys are going to downvote and challenge me. But again, I say this sincerely out of concern for you.  I have kids too. I want all of you young people to be the best you can be individually - by not copying each other.  You have a lot of potential. Please step away from the internet and social media and gain some perspective, hands-on experience and knowledge from the real world. Stand out and stand up as yourself.",
            "Hard disagree (and so, yes, unpopular opinion!)\n\nPeople haven't learned to regulate their own emotions, this is why time and again you see videos online of someone breaking down and screaming at strangers or, in the worst cases, assaulting those who they feel are not \"validating\" their feelings.\n\nSometimes it's filmed by the \"victim\" so it can be shared online for those sweet, sweet, \"I'm oppressed\" social points.\n\nNot the original, but this sums it up beautifully:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/JKOIX73ziP8?feature=shared",
            "Sorry, friend. The popular culture of people in the richest countries in the West is massively softer than it used to be. Young people are taught to focus on their weaknesses rather than developing coping strategies and out competing.\n\nAlso by most metrics life is close to being the easiest it has ever been places like the US. It's just that perhaps 10 years ago maybe it was easier. But compared to what generations prior had to experience, life today is a cakewalk.",
            "I see what you mean but also people are way more sensitive now.",
            "We feel more responsible **because** we are softer. If you have walls around you, you'll notice fewer things and care less.\n\nThere's a variety of changes due to social media, but the idea that people should be more empathetic isn't directly related to that. Of course empathy has side-effects- it's harder to be tolerant if you're easy to hurt - but there's been a lot of progress as well.",
            "IDK, a lot of delusions or flaws are either being ignored or enabled resulting in a lot of people acting like children or without regard for themselves at all.",
            "I don't know. Being bullied wasn't such a big deal in the 80s or early 90s much less in the ages before them. You could say certain things be it politically correct or not without being lynched, and cancel culture wasn't a real thing that carries with someone for their life. Maybe the internet does have a huge role to play in all of this but it definitely seems to me ppl are much more angry, sensitive, and ready to constantly play the role of victims now a days.",
            "Nah, I coach hockey.  Kids are definitely softer and fatter.",
            "I disagree. I'm in my 60s. Kids like to insult me without realizing that I am so much better at it simply because I'm not soft. One of these days my first response will be to report their comment to the moderator. For now, I just play the Insult Game until they run to the moderator after receiving a verbal beatdown. They seldom make it to the 2nd round. Soft AF. I would write more but I've already been banned from 3 sites."
