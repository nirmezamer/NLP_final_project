        "content": "**MAIN EDIT:** Winners have been officially drawn and sent their codes! The winners are...\n\n/u/TOMdMAK, /u/ALaRequest, /u/MrGoaty07, /u/3SunsGaming, /u/failtality, /u/Kienan, /u/ImCursedM8, /u/SmileyBMM, /u/leeec, & /u/Nickyshane\n\nWinners have been PM'd their batches of codes for GMG. Huge thanks to everybody for entering and massive thanks to Reddit and the Community Funds team for powering the event!\n\n**To the winners, I linked the wrong redemption page. The page you should use is this one. You'll redeem through the wallet - https://www.greenmangaming.com/my-account/wallet/**\n\n\n---\n\n\n**US and UK Only**. It's a legal thing from the Reddit team. Apologies for the limitation.\n---\n\n---\n\n\n\n[A couple months ago, we ran our first ever event powered by Reddit directly](https://redd.it/1bwn50k)! It was a great opportunity, but some users had some reservations about the way we handled it. We needed to do it that way to widen the range and size of the event. It may not have been perfect for some, but we wound up with a fantastic event that had some great entries. That event came in under-budget due to sales of games at the time. Thanks to that, a second event is officially under way! This time though, it'll look a little more familiar to what you might be used to in FGF Giveaways.\n\n---\n\nThe **Reddit Community Funding** program is Reddit's way of giving back to their communities. Back in April we ran an Art Contest for some of my favourite video games using the Community Funds. That event left use with nearly **$1,600 USD**. Many months later, we can officially use it for something! I was able to convince the team to let /r/FreeGameFindings run a second promotional event. \n\nFor this event, I used the roughly **$1,600 USD** to build 10 prize packs of roughly $160 USD per winner. To make things easier, as well as a means of letting you pick exactly what you want, the prizes will be gift cards to the popular video game storefront [GreenManGaming](https://www.greenmangaming.com/)! GMG was used heavily in the last event and was by far the easiest one to work with in terms of bulk purchasing. Considering that, I felt it was wise to let users make purchases of whatever they want!\n\nTo be eligible for this event, you must be in The United States of America or The United Kingdom. You also must be at least 18 years of age. You must have a one month old Reddit account with at least ten total karma. You also cannot be banned from /r/FreeGameFindings, nor be on the [universal scammer list.](https://www.universalscammerlist.com/) \n\n**To enter,** all you need to do is make a comment! Replying to a comment wont count, but please refrain from having other discussions in this thread. Now on to what specifically will be the winnings. **There will be ten total prize packs on offer. The prize pack includes the following gift cards:**\n\n* **4** x $50 CAD Green Man Gaming Gift Cards\n* **1** x $20 CAD Green Man Gaming Gift Card\n\n*Conversion rates as of time of posting is $50 CAD = $36.42 USD, and $20 CAD = $14.57 USD.*\n\nCodes will convert to US or UK currency when redeemed on your GMG account. As to be expected, you will need to have/make one of these accounts. Once redeemed, feel free to buy whatever you like!\n\n**This campaign runs until the 28th of June. On the day, I will close the thread, update it, and make a new post announcing all the winners. Each winner will be contacted by Reddit PM or Chat. Please ensure you can be contacted through at least one of those methods (I prefer PM if possible).**\n\n---\n\n**For a full list of Contest Sweepstakes Rules, visit this link -> https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeGameFindings/wiki/fgf-giveaway-info/powered-by-community-funds-bonus** \n\n**Your entry into this contest means you agree to the terms, the rules, and are stating you are eligible to win.**\n\n\n---\n\nMassive thanks to Reddit's Community Funding team for powering this and the first event. Glad to be able to use the leftover cash for the FGF community.\n\n\n---\n\n\n*For the sake of transparency, I did not receive any items/gifts/money/etc for putting on the event.*\n\n[*Here is a list of past promotions where I have and have not been given something during FGF Giveaways.*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RFeaSIpqFvvSzfOowecLz_rbbFo-YKa25PYAqF6Y6ko/edit?usp=drive_link)",
