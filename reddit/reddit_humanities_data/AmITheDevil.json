Unlike the name of this subreddit the poster does not have to be a literal devil with horns to fit here. We let posts stay up here often depending on the top comments of the original post: if they agree that the poster is an asshole. If they don\u2019t: please crosspost it to somewhere else, for example r/AmITheAngel. \n\nWe ask you to please read and follow the rules. Here\u2019s an overview:\n\n* Don\u2019t brigade: don\u2019t comment on the original post. Don\u2019t upvote/downvote the original post. Don\u2019t go after the original poster in DMs or in previous posts of theirs. We have a no tolerance policy for this rule. \n\n* Stay on topic: this subreddit is for discussing the crosspost and the poster. Stick to that topic, please.\n\n* Don\u2019t repost: please check the subreddit before crossposting to ensure you\u2019re not reposting.\n\n* Civility: try to remain civil in the comments. We understand that discussions can get heated. You won\u2019t be permanently banned for this unless you\u2019re repeatedly being uncivil.\n\n* No shitposts: this is only a place for crossposts. Don\u2019t make up fake posts. Don\u2019t ask here if you\u2019re an asshole/devil. Go to r/AmItheAsshole etc. for that. \n\nHope you have a good time here!",

            ">What's wrong with not wanting kids who rely on drugs to live? If kids can't drink or smoke until they're 21 it should be the same for other medications.\n\nBecause kids are still humans, and don't always make the fucking things needed TO live. Why the hell do people treat mental health and mental health meds like some nasty taboo secret. They'll take meds for diabetes, pain or the heart, but the second it's for mental health you're weak and you don't need those. I'm so damn sick of that argument",

            "My dad sat my brother and I down once and told us we were the cause of all of his fights with our mom. It was in the roughest stretch of their marriage (in my memory at least) and all of their fights were because my dad was grieving unhealthily and my parents were working together so they never got a break from each other. Ill never forget how shitty it felt.",
            "It says a lot about the relationship that their first reaction was to go quiet when she joked about regretting having them equally, because most families I know the kids would have realized that was a joke and they would have laughed along. Then she made it 10 times worse by trying to justify her comment instead of going oh my gosh, I'm so sorry that was just a joke."

I have accused you of being the dumbest creature on earth several times, and I now see the error of my ways. This idiot seems to legitimately think she means something to him, that this is an actual relationship, after **9 years** of being the side piece. Even as he outright, blatantly chooses to spend time with his wife and prioritize her emotions over OOPs, OOP still thinks they will have a happily ever after.",

I wonder if she'd feel blindsided when he would inevitably cheat on her too? Or does she think she's special, somehow?\n\nHe's the love of her life, and she's his dirty little secret.
