            "*In case this story gets deleted/removed:*\n\n**My (33M) desperate wife (30F) ruined our marriage for her flimsy career and did so in a shameless manner. How do I move forward after her disgusting behaviour? **\n\n\nMy wife (30F) is an indie film actor. Please stop reading this post if you\u2019re not open to the concept of ethnocentrism and the strong presence of family structures and values, because I\u2019m not from the West. \n\nI always knew that sometimes my wife\u2019s craft involves kissing/sex scenes. And although this caused issues with both me and my parents, I have worked on my insecurities and dissociation of her work with our relationship and now am a place where I am more tolerant. Although, there was one rule we both agreed on - she will do a good faith evaluation of the script with the director to see if any unnecessary intimate scenes can be eliminated, that is, any intimate scene in the script must be required by the plot from director\u2019s point of view. \n\nMy parents are still not very happy about my wife\u2019s profession but I try to support her and not let them criticise her. \n\nWe\u2019ve recently become parents to a 3 year old toddler and my wife took a break from acting. She decided several months ago that she wants to start working again and I support her. She got back in shape, networked with one of her friends in the industry and got a project after putting in so much effort. \n\nThere was a very erotic scene in this movie and although it made me uncomfortable and a little quiet at the premiere party, I was mentally prepared enough to handle it. But it still took me aback a little because it had been a long time. At the premiere party, several people wanted to talk to her and she is in talks with some over a new project and I\u2019m super proud of the progress she\u2019s made. \n\n\nI heard from the grapevine that the one of the co-leads of the movie (my wife) had requested the director to add the infamous erotic scene, as it would put the spotlight on her. No wonder why my wife was approached by many people. She wanted this. She breached a boundary we made several years ago. \n\nI was fuming and asked my wife if she was the one to do that. She went pale and meekly said yes. Her eyes were teary at that point and she looked like a pathetic wounded animal begging me to comfort her. I obviously withdrew from her and stopped even looking at her. \n\nEvery time I see her now, I see betrayal. I tell her she cheated on me, and now she\u2019s all angry, saying that\u2019s a part of the job. I don\u2019t even acknowledge her in our home and I even told my parents about this who have iced her out too, and her own parents too, who don\u2019t want to associate with her anymore. I told our friends in anger that she cheated on me with the said actor and they don\u2019t want to speak to her anymore either. She tried to refute this accusation but couldn\u2019t, given how our family treated her. \n\nIt hurts to see so isolated, and she expressed once saying that she was afraid she will lose her window and giving an erotic scene a chance was something she wanted to do and didn\u2019t want me affecting her decision and that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t tell me. I asked her \u201coh yea, was putting our relationship on the stake worth it?\u201d \n\nShe couldn\u2019t say anything. \n\nI have no idea what to do now. I loved her too much. I still do. And sometimes I feel awful for how I am treating her.\n\n\n\nTL;DR: My (33M) wife (30F) betrayed our agreement and ruined our marriage for her flimsy acting career by requesting an erotic scene in her latest movie. I'm struggling to move forward after her shameless behavior.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I'm really proud of him, I couldn't wish for a better son. \nAnyway, Lucas has been visiting my sister (28F) for 3 days. My sister has a son (8M) Gabriel. I was hoping Lucas would be friends with him. I exchanged messages with Lucas and he always said it's going okay. \n\nYesterday, I went to my sister's house to pick up Lucas and she looked really hurt. Lucas was sitting there glum as well. I asked what was wrong and my sister told me to ask my son that question. \nIt took me a long time to convince Lucas to tell me the truth, and he finally admitted what was wrong. \n\nAs I understand it, Gabriel was curious about what Lucas was drawing (he had his sketchbooks with him). Lucas let him see his sketchbooks, but told him that Gabriel should handle them carefully. \n\nBut when Lucas was outside, Gabriel (with his mother's permission, as I understand it, and I'm not excusing her for this) decided to check Lucas's things.

I mean, I'm not excusing what Gabriel did. \n\nBut according to my sister, my son didn't want to call me or my husband and he didn't want to hear Gabriel's excuses. He threw a tantrum and called Gabriel a ton of names, even though my sister said he was just a kid. All these days the atmosphere in the house was tense, my sister didn't call me because she was offended.  \n\nMy sister said she didn't even know if she would still want me or my son at their house after that. \nI said Lucas should apologize to Gabriel and his mom. Lucas was offended, but did so. \n\nWhen we go to home, I asked why Lucas didn't tell me that Gabriel had torn up his sketchbooks. Lucas cried and said, \"Because you never care.\" Those words hurt me deeply and were a low blow because I really love my son and I didn't think he could say those words to his own mom. But I promised him that I would buy him new sketchbooks and he could redraw his drawings in them. \n\nBut my husband thinks I acted like an asshole in this situation and Gabriel and my sister are wrong. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He has been in two relationshipships, both long term, but they broke up recently.\n\nIt's hard for me to tell if he has feelings for me too because he might just love me like a friend.\n\nI did go through a stage where I was sleeping with multiple people and having multiple hookups.

There's a difference between not thinking your friend is whatever misogynist version of used up is popular now because it's a stupid and gross concept, and not wanting to date someone who has different views on relationships to you.*\n\n>It is silly to say I don\u2019t actually care about him, as a person, and just want to date him just because I have feelings. I\u2019d easily still be his friend for life, even if he didn\u2019t have feelings for me. I just wish he had a better reason other than me being a bop. It shouldn\u2019t matter who I\u2019ve slept with in the past. Who cares? If he really cared about me, he wouldn\u2019t let that stop him.\n\n\n>And gay people have multiple hookups and still manage to be friends and be in long term relationships. This is just a boring straight person thing. Everyone should explore what they like. The idea that someone who hooks up a lot can\u2019t be faithful is slut shaming anyway. It\u2019s okay to have different views, but it\u2019s not okay if those different views are shaming people who are into casual sex.\u00a0\n\n\n\n*YTA, he has his preference and you have yours.

I wouldn\u2019t ask him that when he was in a relationship, it might come off weird. But anyway, it definitely gives me mixed signals because him saying that made me think that wasn\u2019t something he cared about. And he never said differently.\n\n\n\n*YTA. He probably was honest what he said those things before. He doesn't care if his friends sleep around. But people have different standards for romantic interests and he seems to want someone who is into long-term relationships more than short-term flings.\u00a0It doesn't even have to be about sex.*\n\n>I would be down for a long term relationship with him, just because I\u2019ve had flings in the past doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not down for a long term relationship.\n\n\n\n*YTA for insulting him.*\n\n\n*People have the right to have different standards for friends and girlfriends. As your friend, he didn\u2019t care about the hookups and all of that; why would he when it had nothing to do with him? As a boyfriend, he would care, and that\u2019s okay; a romantic partner is a more intimate relationship that requires a level of trust beyond friendship because, thanks to STIs, your health is literally in each other\u2019s hands.*\n\n>STI\u2019s isn\u2019t a good reason to have that opinion. We can always get an STD test. It isn\u2019t just a \u201ctrust me\u201d thing, you can take your health in your own hands and get your partner tested.\n\n\n\n*Not wanting to date a woman who has slept with many people isn\u2019t misogyny* \ud83d\ude12 *it\u2019s called preference.*\n\n>It can be a preference rooted in misogyny though?\n\n\n\n*Another good example of what you said are job hoppers. I wouldn't even consider someone for a job if they have haven't spent at least a year at any job.*\n\n>If everyone has that mentality, how are people suppose to get jobs in the first place?
