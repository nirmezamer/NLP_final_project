            "Missed confessions \n\nBut I had surgery Monday as I\u2019ve mentioned. Was absolutely terrified about not waking up (I\u2019ve never really had surgery). Was getting a little teary eyed in the pre op room about it. I think the fear of dying is kind of a good sign for me and my (hot) shrink agreed.\n\nSpent a lot of time in college and some time after not wanting to be alive and I\u2019ve worked on myself to the point where I don\u2019t wanna die which is pretty awesome. Even just the past year: quit being a Big 4 simp cuck, went to Japan, got a new job where I traveled basically everywhere from August - December (which had some glaring flaws but was still awesome), started grad school, worked on my health more, and I\u2019ve got a bunch of stuff I\u2019m jacked to do the remainder of the year. Pretty cool",

            "This isn\u2019t my confession but it\u2019s confession adjacent. When I was in middle school and high school some of my friends made a game out of stealing hot chick\u2019s panties if we were ever at their house. Bonus points if it was somebody\u2019s hot older sister. Then one buddy would store them in one of those safes that you get from a scholastic magazine or something and hid it in the back of his closet. \n\n\nHis parents still live in the same house and he moved away pretty abruptly after college. Some times I shutter at the idea that his dad is sitting in a house that likely has a plastic safe full of young women\u2019s underwear hidden in a closet. That could turn out terribly.",

She deserves it\u2026I love them both. \n\nBut I have no idea how to tell them the money is making them unbearable cunts.\n\nThey buy a nice wood dining table. There\u2019s a minuscule chip on it.  Minutes later they have customer service on the phone asking for a replacement. They\u2019re complaining about the cleaning ladies not moving the furniture to get the dust behind it.  Moving people left one scratch tiny on the wall and they\u2019re having them pay for someone to fix it. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s cause I grew up in a blue collar family. But I don\u2019t know how to tell them I kinda dont want them to watch my kids cause they\u2019ll inherit their cuntiness",
