(I think it was [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XFFxBRZ9CRyu1azf6))\n\nAbout 3am BRRRZzzummmmm...\n\nOlder cop to my pal \"wtf - did you see anything? Whatever that was was going FAST\"\n\n\"Nope - didn't see anything & whatever it was is long gone - we ain't gonna catch em now\".\n\nNext nigh, same overpass, about 3am....\n\nBRRRZzzummmmmm....\n\n\"WTH! I did NOT imagine it that time for sure!!!! But didn't see anything??!!\"\n\nNext night....\n\n\"Right! I'm gonna be ready for this fukker tonight!\" So they park up on the slip road ready to set off at any moment...\n\nAbout 3am...\n\nBRRRZzzummmmmm.\n\nScreech!!!! Off they go in pusuit - \"I still didn't see anything, but I'm gonna catch whoever this little sod is!!\"\n\nEventually they catch up with them at the other end on the road - up near the army ordinance depot....\n\nTurns out it was 2 guys from the army depot with night vision goggles in a black 911 with the lights turned off :D",
