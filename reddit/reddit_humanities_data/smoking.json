Get your rub right, your temps right, and your times right. It won\u2019t matter if you have a little bit of bull d0ng dangling off your brisket, it\u2019s gonna taste delicious.",

            "This is about 80% of the BBQ joints in my area, or at least very close.  Dry, lack of flavor, small portions, overpriced.  I just make it at home, better in every way.",
            "Up until 2 years ago, I lived my whole life 50+ in NYC. For most of that time there was NO BBQ at all. I didn't even know what BBQ was except maybe from some random travel quide. Instead I was a connoisseur of Pastrami!!!!!!\n\nMoved to Rockland, bought a smoker. Took a few cooks to get a feel for it but now I can not imagine how I lived my life without this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow you can find BBQ in Manhattan (there is actually some good consistent stuff in Brooklyn) but it never seems to last. Some examples:\n\nHill Country was great for maybe 3 years. Still there but awful.\n\nDallas BBQ awful and still awful.\n\nMighty Quinn started out great, made a name and quality has gone down dramatically.\n\nRUB (Righteous Urban BBQ) got flooded during Sandy. Was set to reopen when someone drove a Suburban through the restaurant RIP. I really liked that place and they even made decent Pastrami! and awesome Turkey along with fantastic burnt ends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are a lot of really bad BBQ spots in Rockland. My amateur self puts them to shame. Truth be told, most places in Rockland suck. There is no edible Chinese or Pizza. Its a f'in desert so i have to make my own. When I am exhausted and need delivery there is some passable falafel and some extraordinary Pastrami YAY!",
            "Hey guys I know how I\u2019m going to make my million!\n\n\nGet this: bbq trays at the farmers market that don\u2019t absolutely suck. Lol.",
            "100% accurate, especially in parts of the country that have never had \"real BBQ\". I'm lookin' at you SoCal. The worst part is it isn't even good pitmasters overcharging, it's the blind leading the blind. So many people LARPing as pitmasters and making shyte BBQ, truly believe they're awesome at it and they're managing to convincing the ignorant that it's all true.",
            "I'm shit as smoking, but my wife loves it when I make ribs and pulled pork rather than us getting it from a reataraunt"
