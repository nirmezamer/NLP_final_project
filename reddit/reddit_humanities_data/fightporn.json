        "content": "*Update:* We\u2019ve been on a banning spree the past week, so I wanted to provide a more specific update on some of the common things people are getting banned for:\n\n- Well well well, typical, and similar low-effort comments. \n- Equal rights equal lefts / women shouldn\u2019t act like men\n- Fuck you bloody\n- Intentional misgendering (this violates Reddit rules)\n\n\nIn the past 12 months:\n\n* We received 25,700+ reports of rule violating comments.\n* Over 50% of those reports were for some type of \\*ism.\n* 114,000+ comments were removed.\n* Reddit (Admins) removed 4,500+ comments.\n* Nearly 65,000 users have unsubbed.\n\nOur goal in moderating is to keep this sub alive (not banned) by enforcing Reddit's rules and removing content that violates said rules. We've previously been pretty lenient with what we allowed to be posted so long as it wasn't overt violations of those rules, but we've been getting a lot of feedback from users who are tired of the innuendo and the amount of reports and unsubs seems to support that. This is your sub and we'll moderate it how you want it moderated. To that end, the following rule changes are now in effect:\n\n* All comments consisting of any \\*ist/\\*phobic innuendo or generalizations = permaban. We previously just removed these comments if they weren't overt violations, but that approach didn't work.\n* All posts of minors = permaban. We repeat it over and over and there are a dozen school fights posted a day.\n* Any posts or comments that get removed by Reddit = permaban.\n* Obvious bait titles = permaban.",
