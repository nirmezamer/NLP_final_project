        "content": "I heard its best to have a \"weakness\" that you can say you redeemed and worked on to improve rather than a full negative. \n\nI was thinking of saying \"i suck at prioritizing in multi-tasking but ive worked on it with my last job and feel like i've improved.\"\n\nThough, this position involves a lot of multitask and teamwork and i wouldnt want that to be a \"weakness that i've improved\" \n\nAny suggestions would be great.",

            "I always say that I have struggled with self-confidence in the past and can sometimes second guess myself, and that this is something I have improved on greatly and I take a few seconds to calm down and focus and then come back to the task feeling better.\n\nIt is mostly true and I feel it is something that most people have experienced so the interviewer may relate. Plus, someone being overly confident and hell-bent on pursuing bad ideas just because they like them would be a hindrance to a team.",
            "The best weakness is an honest one. Can you draw any insight from past reviews?\n\nSome of my personal weaknesses (and how I think I have improved) are: \n-I am uncomfortable with delegating tasks and often get overwhelmed trying to manage things alone (worked on trusting the skills of my employees and holding them accountable). \n-I am not great at multitasking (use software to make lists and better track projects so that I can more easily manage multiple tasks simultaneously).\n-I am not good at networking, which is an important part of my job (I\u2019m making an effort to push outside my comfort zone... I recently attended a meeting with x and y outside of our organization to collaborate on an important project).\n\nHope this helps!",
            "I always say that I'm impatient--especially with myself! I then say that because it is a weakness, I have learned to be self-aware of it and then step back when I see the signs and assess whether I'm being ridiculous or the impatience is justified. Then, when justified, it comes out as a motivator!",
            "The weakness question is your opportunity to talk about something you\u2019ve worked on and improved at recently. ",
            "Definitely don't say suck \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 say something like I've had trouble with , or an obstacle ive overcame was etc etc",
            "\"As demonstrated, I interview pretty badly\" \n\nI'm kidding, but I've used it to lighten the mood, and it worked. Other options for WIYGW: Carbs, and Texas BBQ. Keeping plants alive. and my personal favorite: \"what's a weik-ness?\"\n\nThen I usually talk about how I have a hard time walking away from something, and in that, I've found that sometimes walking away is needed, in order to get a fresh perspective.  I've learned with time to let myself take a step back, more often - before trying to force a step forward. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGL OP, HTH",
            "Whatever weakness you choose, you always want to portray it in a positive light to your potential interviewer. Always mention on what action you have taken to counteract the wekness and the result from that action. If we use this approach, you will likely tick the box regardless of what weakness you choose. Why is this the case you may ask? The interviewer isn't really looking for a specific weakness and whether it's good or bad, they are looking for specific personality traits, one being the ability to overcome challenges! I hope this helps",
            "I say I have issues saying \"no\" when people ask for help. It works very well.",
            "I used to use the old chestnut, \"I am just too much of a perfectionist\", lol. My most recent interview, I liked the guy and said, \"I feel like I am eager to hit the ground running hard from day 1, but have learned that it's important to really observe, learn and listen to get an idea of company culture, values, etc before going full throttle.\"",
            "I have ADD, so I know i tend to create a lot of little fires everywhere that I don't finish. I have been working towards creating little goals and deadlines so, I always feel like I am accomplishing something to motivate me."

It wouldn't be a promotion, so I wouldn't make any more money. I left the interview thinking I didn't want it anymore but decided to sleep on it. Found out today they are calling my references so I'm preparing for a job offer to come soon. I'm planning on declining. I've never had to decline a job offer. What is a professional way to reply (via email) that I don't want the job because they are asking too much of one person? Should I mention if they were to give me a raise or hire a partner I would accept? I have nothing to lose if they say no but don't want to come off overbearing.\n\n  \nTLDR: Best way to word a declination to a job offer?",
