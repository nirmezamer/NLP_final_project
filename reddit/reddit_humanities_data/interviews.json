            "I always say that I have struggled with self-confidence in the past and can sometimes second guess myself, and that this is something I have improved on greatly and I take a few seconds to calm down and focus and then come back to the task feeling better.\n\nIt is mostly true and I feel it is something that most people have experienced so the interviewer may relate. Plus, someone being overly confident and hell-bent on pursuing bad ideas just because they like them would be a hindrance to a team.",
            "I always say that I'm impatient--especially with myself! I then say that because it is a weakness, I have learned to be self-aware of it and then step back when I see the signs and assess whether I'm being ridiculous or the impatience is justified. Then, when justified, it comes out as a motivator!",
            "The weakness question is your opportunity to talk about something youve worked on and improved at recently. ",
            "Definitely don't say suck  say something like I've had trouble with , or an obstacle ive overcame was etc etc",
            "Whatever weakness you choose, you always want to portray it in a positive light to your potential interviewer. Always mention on what action you have taken to counteract the wekness and the result from that action. If we use this approach, you will likely tick the box regardless of what weakness you choose. Why is this the case you may ask? The interviewer isn't really looking for a specific weakness and whether it's good or bad, they are looking for specific personality traits, one being the ability to overcome challenges! I hope this helps",
            "I say I have issues saying \"no\" when people ask for help. It works very well.",
            "I used to use the old chestnut, \"I am just too much of a perfectionist\", lol. My most recent interview, I liked the guy and said, \"I feel like I am eager to hit the ground running hard from day 1, but have learned that it's important to really observe, learn and listen to get an idea of company culture, values, etc before going full throttle.\"",
            "I have ADD, so I know i tend to create a lot of little fires everywhere that I don't finish. I have been working towards creating little goals and deadlines so, I always feel like I am accomplishing something to motivate me.",
            "As someone who asks this question in interviews, I dont care so much about the weakness. What Im looking for is whether or not you have the self-awareness to recognize your weaknesses (because we all have them), and I want to hear that you work to overcome/compensate for those weaknesses. Of course thats just me, I cant wait to read the other responses here.",
            "So, you can use a lack of soft skills as a weakness but you can also use hard skills. So for instance, if you're tech and you felt that you weren't performing as well because you weren't as well-versed with a tool/technology, you can use that. You can say how you identified that as a weakness, initiated self-learning, and overcame that skills gap. In summary, don't hesitate to share an actual weakness. All you need to do is show them how you overcame it. It's all about putting a positive spin on something negative and it will come across as your strength instead. Hope this helps :)"

This most recent one is with a company that could put me on my career path goals and use the skills I have gained. Total win win. Interview went great. Wonderful conversation, 10 min over allotted time and a follow up to schedule for second round of interviews. But I think the only thing that threw me off was their background. It was one of those fake office backgrounds. (I did blur my background but can still clearly see the outline of my home office, oh and I found the job on indeed but went to the actual company website to make sure it is still open and applied on that platform)\n\nAfter the interview, I had some time to process all the awesome opportunities and then this nagging background issue, if it is one. Is this something to be concerned about?\n\nLike I said, I just started interviewing and it\u2019s been almost 8y since I\u2019ve had to do this. Is this normal, especially with medium to large size businesses? Could I have questioned the background during the interview? TYIA\n",

It wouldn't be a promotion, so I wouldn't make any more money. I left the interview thinking I didn't want it anymore but decided to sleep on it. Found out today they are calling my references so I'm preparing for a job offer to come soon. I'm planning on declining. I've never had to decline a job offer. What is a professional way to reply (via email) that I don't want the job because they are asking too much of one person? Should I mention if they were to give me a raise or hire a partner I would accept? I have nothing to lose if they say no but don't want to come off overbearing.\n\n  \nTLDR: Best way to word a declination to a job offer?",

If the decision was to hire a candidate HR will let you know in an about a week pending preliminary background verification.  (Whats on your resume is accurate.)

All has to do with legal shit so you dont sue us.",
            "I feel like it is a pretty common saying that cannot give much insight if you locked in a job or not. A better indicator would be levels of engagement or sentences that were said during the interview that gave positive reinforcement. \n\nFor example, I was in an interview with the manager and he mentioned that he was  really impressed with my background and experience . And they ended up moving me to the next round faster since I had another offer with another company. In the last interview they told me when they would make their decision and I should hear around that time. \n\nAll interviews I have been in they usually tell me expected time lines if I dont ask during my Q&A in the portion of the interview. \n\nSending good vibes your way! It is possible they have one or two more interviews they need to wrap up and are going to make their decision shortly. The one indicator is the later you hear from HR the less likely you got the job. If you dont hear back by Wednesday/Thursday/Friday your chances are looking slim.",
            "Great question!\n\nYes, this is something that is typically said at the end of interviews. Hiring managers don't generally contact candidates with follow ups, their recruitment team or HR does. If you felt as though the interview went well, this is great! Try not to overthink this and the outcome.\n\nHaving to wait for interview feedback can definitely cause some worry, especially if you knew you performed well. However, **it is very rare that you are told (especially these days) that you either have the job or that it was a \"no\" on the spot**. There are a few reasons for this and sharing some of these reasons below can help you remain positive as you go through the weekend:\n\n1. They could be interviewing other candidates after meeting with you early next week and they haven't decided on a final candidate as yet.\n2. The managers, need sometime to \"compare notes\" and decide on next steps collaboratively after meeting with you.\n3. You interviewed on a Friday afternoon. **Nothing happens on a Friday afternoon.** Everyone is trying to wrap up their day/week to head into the weekend and hiring managers are generally back to back with meetings.\n4. Needing approvals to make a hire from HR or the head of the business unit/team that you interviewed with. Even if an interview goes well and there are plans to make an offer, most companies have an approval process for hiring. For example, the HM you met with will need to connect with HR or the VP and send in a request to make an offer.\n5. You could have another interview as a next step and there needs to be alignment on who you're meeting with.\n6. Repeating this one: Hiring Managers do not typically contact candidates directly with next steps after interviews. They usually have very minimal direct contact, especially if the company has an HR team.\n\nAs you can see there are so many reasons why you may have to wait to be contacted by HR or the recruiter with next steps after your interview. **These are reasons that are beyond your control.** Be kind to yourself this weekend and try and remain positive. **Congratulate yourself for being able to get interviews in such a tough job market** :).\n\nWait to hear back from them early next week. Be patient and remember everything takes time. Give them until Wednesday and if you haven't heard back by EOD Wed, send a quick follow up email. Either way, you should send them a thank you email for having the interview if you haven't done this already.\n\nGood luck and let us know how you do! :)",
            "Thank you for responding! This is good news. Although, I didnt hear any reinforcement, hearing a response is so much better than screaming into the void with anxiety. \n\nIt seemed as if the manager was reading from a script during the pre interview phase , the questions and the wrap up. She did say it twice, but not much genuine interaction during the whole thing. \n\nWe shall see. Ill be sure to update yall. Im going to go enjoy my weekend and the outdoors. \n\nThanks to all. Hope others get to see this big they have the same question because it is helpful and makes sense. \n\nTake care everyone.",
            "Wow. I wish I had an award for you. Im going to get one. Youre so thoughtful and thorough. \n\nThanks internet stranger, you are more efficient than my real life friends. lol\n\nSincerely, thank you."
