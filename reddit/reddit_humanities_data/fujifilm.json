            "Fujifilm just announced they intercepted a lot of suspicious orders for the Limited Edition (shocking). So they are cancelling those orders and are going to have a raffle. Great move but seems they could have just done that from the beginning.\u00a0",
            "i really wish fujifilm was more communicative to consumers and the retailers. from what im gathering it seems like retailers small and large are waiting to see what fujifilm decides to deliver. i wonder what kind of strings these bigger retailers are pulling to divert more inventory their way",

        "content": "I think some of them are post processed a little bit. I wanna make my pictures more warm, I have to figure out the recipe. I have an older Fuji camera - XT-10. It\u2019s a great camera but I\u2019d really love to try the newer ones with different film simulations and settings for grain and stuff like that. For the lens most of the pictures are taken with a manual TTartisans 35mm f/2, but the six flags pics are taken with the Fujinon XF 18-135mm, got that lens on Wednesday and had to try it immediately. Anyways, constructive criticism is welcome, would love to see your opinion about my pictures. I\u2019m a beginner photographer focusing mostly on street photography. \nIf you want to see more of my work you can find it on my instagram: @lenkaa.kot",
