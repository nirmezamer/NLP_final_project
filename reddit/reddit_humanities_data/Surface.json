Since Copilot Pro relies on the cloud, it can be used across different devices and platforms and is not limited to Copilot+ PCs.\n\nOf course because this is a launch week, there are a lot of threads, questions, and answers. We're noticing that most of the questions being asked are already answered or being actively discussed so **please use the search function**.\n\nImportant to note:\n\n* Recall is not available at this time. There is no date or ETA.\n* Due to the delay of Recall, review units were not sent out to press prior to launch, therefore official reviews will be delayed/incomplete.\n* As is always a good practice, you should update your device using Windows Update and update all apps available through the Microsoft Store for the best experience. You need to update your new Copilot+ PCs in order to enable most of the AI features.\n\nOther useful articles:\n\n* [Windows ARM-based PCs FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-arm-based-pcs-faq-477f51df-2e3b-f68f-31b0-06f5e4f8ebb5#ID0EFD=Windows_11)\n* [Top things to know about Copilot+ PCs from Microsoft Surface](https://blogs.windows.com/devices/2024/06/18/top-things-to-know-about-copilot-pcs-from-microsoft-surface-available-today-at-microsoft-com/)\n* [Update on the Recall preview feature for Copilot+ PCs](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2024/06/07/update-on-the-recall-preview-feature-for-copilot-pcs/)\n* [A Step Forward for Gaming on Arm Devices](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/step-forward-for-gaming-on-arm-devices-2024/)\n* [Microsoft Surface for Business](https://surface.com/business)",

        "content": "So, my daily driver is a Surface Pro 8. I took the dive and picked up a Surface Pro 11, and man, I am loving it as a former Surface Pro 8 owner. Now, I'm not too technical. I just do writing, and I don't game or use a lot of x64 apps, but my impressions are more about the hardware rather than the software.\n\n1. They improved the button layouts. On the Surface Pro 8, power is on the right and volume on the left. I got a lot of accidental turn ons when the thing is in my bag with the Surface Pro 8, none with Surface Pro 11 so far.\n2. They improved the port location. On Surface Pro 8, charger was on left, and USB-C also on the right. As a right handed person, that annoyed me. Now, on Surface Pro 11, the charger is on the right, and ports on the left! So easier to route cables at my desk.\n3. The old Type Cover keyboard used to \"hide\" the bottom of the screen on the Surface Pro 8. On the new Flex Keyboard with Surface Pro 11, this is no longer an issue.\n4. Microsoft rounded the keycaps on the new Flex Keyboard. It fits good with Windows 11, but the keycaps are smaller now.\n5. And speaking of the keyboard, the fact you don't have to \"unclip\" the keyboard from the screen to get the pen. This makes it soooo much easier. The pen is much easier to reach.\n6. The Standby time is incredible. I put it in my bag at 11AM, came home at 5PM and it was still at 100%.\n\nAll in all, this is worth it for me just because of those small changes! I'm impressed!",

            "FYI, your 1. and 2. were already done with the SP9. The ports of the SP11 are identical to the SP9.   \nagree with the rest. cheers",
            "So I've owned SP8, SP9, and now SP11.  The change (not including keyboard) was between SP8 and SP9.  SP10/11 is same as SP9. \n\nI had the opposite impression for the power button.  I guess it's because of how I grab the machine, but I was always accidentally hitting the power button on the SP9/SP10/SP11 and preferred the power button on the right of the SP8.  \n\nThe volume rocker on the SP8 was on the left side and made sense because pressing the top half of the rocker raised the volume and pressing the bottom lowered the volume.  The volume rocker on the SP9/SP10/SP11 is on top of the machine right next to the power button (which also led to accidentally hitting the power button).  But more importantly, the rocker is backwards!  Windows has always had volume lowest on the left and highest on the right.  You slide the volume to the right to raise volume.  But the SP9/SP11 rocker has you press left to raise volume!  Heck, as you press the left side to raise the volume, you see the on-screen volume bar go to the right!\n\nAs for ports, the Surface Connect charge port is on the right side for both the SP8 and SP9/SP10/SP11.  The SP9/10/11 was a big improvement for me because they raised it higher on the body.  The problem with being low on the body in the SP8 was it didn't give much room for the cable so it was kind of bent.  I ended up flipping the cable around so it pointed toward the sky rather than bending at the bottom on the SP8.  On SP9/10/11, it's no longer an issue and now I have the cable pointing downward again.  As for the USB Type C ports, it was on the right for the SP8 but on the left for SP9/10/11.  I'm kind of indifferent.  However aesthetically, I preferred it on the right because it meant all your cables were on the right. But on the SP9/10/11, you have cables hanging off both sides of your Surface.  The advantage of the SP8 was that almost everything was on the right:  your power cable, your USB cables, and your power button.\n\nBut one more thing about ports...  SP8 has a headphone jack which was removed in SP9/10/11.\n\nAs for the type covers...  Yes, it's much nicer to not hide the pen.  However, none of the type covers obscured the screen.  They only cover the bezel.  Now, it is true that the older type covers came awfully close to the edge of the screen which mean it was hard to use your finger to press icons on the taskbar.  So this is a win for the newest keyboards.\n\nAs for the keycaps, they shrunk the function keys on the newer keyboards but the other keys are the same size.  The newer keyboards have rounded corners now.\n\nLoving my SP11 too!  Congrats!  :D",
            "I have an SP8 with LTE and do some mobile development, so I'm waiting a bit longer for an LTE version and to see if ARM-native tools come out for Android emulation. But I did buy the flex keyboard because they implemented the three things that I wanted most: moving the keys away from the screen to prevent accidental touches (your #3), making the pen accessible (your #5), and allowing disconnected use.",
            ">I got a lot of accidental turn ons when the thing is in my bag\n\nIt's very likely that was a software issue, Microsoft [fiddling with the Standby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHKKcd3sx2c) \n\nAfter a game of cat and mouse Microsoft won and basically killed any option to properly standby, basically leaving your device wake up at the most inconvenient times in the bag, getting hot, etc. The only workaround is to pull the power before you standby.",
            "The screen is not covered by keyboard in Sp8, it is the bezel which is covered. You can still hide own in flex keyboard.",
            "lol, I can feel you about the first one... Mine kept draining my battery and overheating when in my bag. In the end, I got a BSOD and couldn't even repair the setup, so I thought that it was a hardware issue and sent it to Microsoft to repair. \n\nThey sent me back the formatted device with a notice that they didn't find anything wrong. But then, after a while, I had the same issue with the battery drain, after taking it out of my bag (fortunately, no BSOD). I decided that I wouldn't buy a Surface again, until I figured it out: When in the bag, the power button was pressed, probably because of the extra weight from the Brydge keyboard that I had attached, and the device must have kept rebooting until it probably couldn't take it anymore, hence the irreperable BSOD. \n\nFrom then on, I put the device in my bag always making sure that the power button faces the top, and all the problems magically dissapeared! :D",
            "Ah didn't know that! Good to know now though ;)",
            "Yeah the volume rocker thing is really weird considering that these devices are used in landscape mode 99% of the time, I'd love to know who thought that was a good idea.",
            "> As for the type covers... Yes, it's much nicer to not hide the pen.\n\nThe shifting down of the keys on the new wireless Surface Pro Flex keyboard doesn\u2019t do lapability any favors, regarding typing posture ergonomics.\n\n* https://youtu.be/JJy1R2AZ6G4?t=238\n\n* https://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/1dlcjkm/was_hesitating_between_the_ipad_pro_and_the/l9o4wmz/",

Heck, as you press the left side to raise the volume, you see the on-screen volume bar go to the right!\n\nYES, this was in SP5 and others too, I've even seen people defending that for some strange reason.\n\nWhat I don't get is why this isn't a registry setting or something, I mean windows used to be Fiddle City or Tweak Town but over the last decade or so they're going the Apple way, our way or the highway. They hijacked with some Windows 10 update the Win+Shift+S (which was used by their own OneNote!) with no option to change or disable the hotkey. Luckily OneNote being older probably than the kids changing Windows just for the sake of it, and the desktop version being essentially on freeze since the modern (and later mobile) version(s) appeared (Windows 8, beginning of 2010s?)  still has the registry settings and you can change it there (but to something else, which breaks muscle memory)."

But to get that speed and easy to use I had to used a waterdown, mobile version of the software I needed. I use mostly lightroom and Photoshop and even though the version of Photoshop for the iPad is great, the Lightroom was quite limited. It was nothing but the mobile version. \n\nOn the surface I'm now running a desktop version of Lightroom CC and a full version of Photoshop beta. I installed Lightroom classic but haven't here the opportunity to test it out yet. \n\nLightroom CC and Photoshop works perfectly, it runs better on battery than my Asus Z flow 13 did plugged in.\n\nThe surface pro 11 is now why he iPad pro should have been. If you are a photographer thinking about getting a new surface pro don't hesitate, you will be pleasantly surprised.",

A OLED Surface Pro seems ideal, but I\u2019m pretty tied into Lightroom Classic, so until they release an ARM version of that I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll be sticking to x86 machines.",
            "I just got the X Plus Surface Pro. I haven't done a lot of editing yet, but my initial impression is a bit disappointing. Lightroom Classic still runs on emulation. For Lightroom (Cloud-based), even it's native for ARM, there is only basic graphics acceleration and no full acceleration for image processing. My A7R5 raws are on the demanding side, but I think the hardware is good enough - we just need more software optimization",
            "i\u2019ve tried to install classic Lightroom, but could only do CC. when i got it last year CC was cloud only so my intel mac focused on LRC. is using CC ok if your not touching cloud in any way? \n\nyour use case is the exact same reason i got the yoga slim and a graphics tablet.i needed something that can run for ages on battery, but i dont need ultra portable of the surface pro more than needing the battery life the yoga has over the SP.",

            "I've been waiting to hear a photographer talk about the Pro 11. Which model did you get? OLED or LCD, 16 or 32 GB ram? How does the AI Noise reduction in LR work, or selections in PS?\n\nI don't even have a laptop, still edit on a 10 year old desktop, which ran great until the AI powered noise reduction. It takes forever. \n\nI have a Surface Pro (which i think is around the 4 or 5?) and haven't been able to run PS on it for an age...so slow. Also I got a USB splitter to use a card reader to transfer photos to an external hard drive and it never worked. I can use LR and edit jpgs from LR mobile pretty easily, just for proof-of-concept stuff. I don't expect to do big editing on a Surface, I'd just like to do a little more. \n\nBecause of some other tasks I use the Surface for, I kind of do need the form factor, so I'm really curious. I will need to upgrade soon, my battery life is about 10 minutes unplugged.",
            "This was the primary reason I picked this up. I had previously been using an HP Spectre X360, and it worked well enough, but it struggled even on the smaller photos from my 6400.

I was about to purchase the Surface Laptop 3 a few years ago, especially considering the display and to use for grad school. Ultimately cost is what counted for what I needed, and so I chose the Mac.

The M1 Air is still solid for me and in my use case considering I got it for $800. There is also the fact that you have to consider that too many things are still unsupported on ARM64. I would caution on buying one right away if you're a student or someone looking into it as an investment for work. Give it a month or two, let things start to stabilize, and maybe circle back to it if it fits your needs. But hey, just my two cents.",
