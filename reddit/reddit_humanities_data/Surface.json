Since Copilot Pro relies on the cloud, it can be used across different devices and platforms and is not limited to Copilot+ PCs.\n\nOf course because this is a launch week, there are a lot of threads, questions, and answers. We're noticing that most of the questions being asked are already answered or being actively discussed so **please use the search function**.\n\nImportant to note:\n\n* Recall is not available at this time. There is no date or ETA.\n* Due to the delay of Recall, review units were not sent out to press prior to launch, therefore official reviews will be delayed/incomplete.\n* As is always a good practice, you should update your device using Windows Update and update all apps available through the Microsoft Store for the best experience. You need to update your new Copilot+ PCs in order to enable most of the AI features.\n\nOther useful articles:\n\n* [Windows ARM-based PCs FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-arm-based-pcs-faq-477f51df-2e3b-f68f-31b0-06f5e4f8ebb5#ID0EFD=Windows_11)\n* [Top things to know about Copilot+ PCs from Microsoft Surface](https://blogs.windows.com/devices/2024/06/18/top-things-to-know-about-copilot-pcs-from-microsoft-surface-available-today-at-microsoft-com/)\n* [Update on the Recall preview feature for Copilot+ PCs](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2024/06/07/update-on-the-recall-preview-feature-for-copilot-pcs/)\n* [A Step Forward for Gaming on Arm Devices](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/step-forward-for-gaming-on-arm-devices-2024/)\n* [Microsoft Surface for Business](https://surface.com/business)",

            "Is the AI talks you through Minecraft feature they demonstrated at the reveal locked behind Copilot pro? I cant seem to get it into a mode where the AI is aware of my screen (other than uploading a screenshot manually).",
            "It would be cool if they had a chat not llm I could run locally on my device!",
            "So when is Recall coming out officially?  Because all the reviews are positive, but vary alot. Hoping for the bigger reviewers to come out.",
            "If paint, it says it will generate while I draw for cocreator.  But it doesnt do anything when I draw.  Any ideas?",
            "Honestly I have yet to see ANY feature that I'm willing to pay $20/month for. Heck the image stuff I get in my $11 Adobe Photoshop subscription. Why would I pay MS to ALSO have that feature. Nearly everything else that would be useful to me is also available in the free Copilot.",
            "This was one of my biggest disappointments with the new surface. Copilot worked in minecraft because MS build a version of minecraft with copilot built in. There is no way (yet) to make copilot+ aware of your screen, so no using AI to improve desktop workflows :/",
            "The feature was demo'd as simply \"coming soon\". There was no official announcement of when or how it will be enabled. Otherwise, I'm sure it'd be listed on the linked article.",
            "I don't see any promos there",
            "This is the comment/question/answer I've been searching the web for. Thank you.",
            "I'm pretty sure the feature will use GPT-4 vision on any active window. If you look at the icon they pressed to activate this feature in the Copilot App, it seemed like so at least."

        "content": "I'm testing Surface Pro 11 - Plus/LCD (16GB, 256GB) and Elite/OLED (16GB, 512GB) against each other - to decide which one to keep.\n\n(that will be my 5th Surface Pro device - I like them)\n\nBoth charged to 100%, recommended power mode, disabled automatic brightness control, screen always on, screen 120hz/dynamic, windows update done, apps from store updates done\n\n\n**battery use** - playing video - brightness set to 35% (good for use when it's darker), unplugged at the same time, Big  Buck Bunny H.264 1080p60, in default Media Player - playing in loop\n\nafter 12h 44m:\n\nPlus/LCD: 26% battery left\n\nElite/OLED: 29% battery left\n\n**screen quality**\n\nLCD: as expected\n\nOLED: this is complicated...\n\ngrain is visible on any lighter color solid space - especially white one\n\nlooking at news websites now - and in some places, if there is a color photo next to white background next to vertical scroll bar, there is a little of extra noise visible on white. it changes when scrolling - sometimes not visible, sometimes slightly visible - it's there when you look for it. But I don't think I will notice it without looking for it. I've tried to make a photo but because of moir\u00e9 it's useless\n\nbut when playing videos the colors, contrast, blacks and HDR are much better on OLED \n\n**performance**\n\nin best performance mode, Geekbench 6\n\nPlus/LCD: CPU 2445/13147, GPU 19856\n\nElite/OLED: CPU 2833/14348, GPU 19717\n\nin recommended performance mode, Geekbench 6\n\nPlus/LCD: CPU 2309/12045, 19073 GPU \n\nElite/OLED: CPU 2373/13122, 18983 GPU \n\n\n\n**strange performance/application issue** standard Media Player on Elite/OLED machine when pausing/resuming/resizing video (especially on 4k hdr hevc) stutters/pauses for longer time (like 0.5 - 1 second) than on Plus/LCD machine. After that video play smoothly. Same video file, both machines fully updated, restarted, I don't understand it.\n\n**noise** - under 100% load you have to put your ear next to the device to hear that it's even running\n\n**Windows on ARM** - I'm surprised that even my electronic signature (dedicated software + USB reader + smartcard) works just fine. But VLC arm64 is still unstable and crashes sometimes. And many of VPN clients do not work\n\n**conclusion** - looks like for my needs Windows on arm is finally ready - so I'll keep one of them. Still have to decide which one - currently I prefer the OLED one because movies look better and I don't really care about the grain. The plan is to use OLED one for next few days to confirm that",
