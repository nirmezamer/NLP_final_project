            "I love Waldman\u2019s husband\u2019s writing. Michael Chabon has an extraordinary voice and it hurts me that he has more empathy for the people who would send their children out as bombs to kill Israelis than he has for his own flesh and blood. \n\nAnd the way he sometimes lovingly describes Judaism is so beautiful and yet I\u2019m am then abruptly reawakened when I realize how utterly hateful he is regarding Israel. And to see that dichotomy is so very raw and painful in a very personal way. How someone can see and describe the beauty of a belief, of religious people and yet cold heartily root for their political enemies is beyond me.",
            "Thanks, interesting read\u2026 I wish I knew more about why the family was asked to leave two kibbutzim.\u00a0",
            ">This should also include Israeli Arabs. Why is everyone making a big deal about Charedim refusing and demanding the government take them against their will, but nothing regarding Israeli Arabs?\n\nIt's unrealistic to draft Israeli Arabs, as they mainly identify as Palestinians who happen to be living in Israel. I think drafting Israeli Arabs would lead to bullying at best and insubordination at worst. Imagine telling an Israeli Arab he has to raid his cousin's house in the West Bank or shoot at relatives in Gaza. Whether we like to admit it or not, many Israeli Jews do not have an overly positive opinion of Arabs, including Israeli Arabs and the army has a ton of right wing dati leumi settlers in the ranks. Recipe for disaster if Israeli Arabs were forced to integrate into the army.",
            "Charedim also annoy the heck out of people by insisting that they're participating in the war effort (and even shouldering most of the burden) via their Torah study and prayers, which is frankly nonsensical; neither the Torah nor secular logic tolerates such a position. Many of them want the privilege of being just as right wing as religious Zionists without making the same sacrifices.",
            "Looking from it from their point of view- Israel has always made it clear that it exists primarily for Jews. They have to endure plenty of discrimination from both Jewish Israelis and other Arabs. While most of them acknowledge that life in Israel is better than it would be in the West Bank or Gaza, they are largely caught up in a situation that was and still is out of their control.",
            "Theirs is a complicated identity. You can't reduce them to being Palestinians or Israelis. There's a fair amount of survey data on this. You can reliably find majorities that identify with the state of Israel and as Palestinians. \nYou also find minorities that don't identify w/Israel or don't identify w/Palestinians.",
            "100% correct, so this gives the government an easy way to fairly ensure they don't vote to the detriment of Israel's best security interests... likewise with Charedim who would vote detrimentally extreme right.\n\nIf the Israeli Arabs want to vote and maintain Israeli rights and comfortable lifestyle, they should serve. They could be a very effective \"Day-After\" police force in Gaza.",
            ">If the Israeli Arabs want to vote and maintain Israeli rights and comfortable lifestyle, they should serve.\n\nIt's unrealistic. When a commander living in a settlement tells an Israeli Arab conscript to go raid an apartment in Jenin, what do you think is going to happen? And to make the right to vote conditional upon that is ridiculous.",
            "They're \"their own\" in the sense that they're both Arab, not Jewish.",

        "content": "I was reading [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/29/realestate/co-op-keypad-entry-sabbath-discrimination.html) about electronic locks at a NYC co-op, and intuitively I gathered that entering a code on a keypad to perform an action (unlocking a door) is not a permissible action on the Sabbath for observant Jews.  \n\nWhich led me to wonder, is using a physical key to unlock a deadbolt door lock permissible?  I don\u2019t see why it would be, as it\u2019s causing a bolt to open/close.\n\nThis just popped into my head.  What about opening the refrigerator door?  It\u2019s causing a light to turn on/off.\n\nI\u2019m sure theae have been ajudicated (a-jew-dicated lol) already, just curious as to what\u2019s permissible and what is not. I\u2019m reform, so none of these really effect me unless I visit Israel or a Sabbath observant property.  As an ADDHD sufferer, I couldn\u2019t stand buildings with one elevator. Either take the stairs or wait an hour for the car to stop on every floor.  \n",

            "Sorry for the ignorance here.  The refrigerator is using electricity...how is that allowed...or lighting or ac?",
            "It's the turning on or off of the electricity that's the problem. Since your fridge is (presumably) always on, it's permitted. Some people I know tape down the switch that turns the fridge light on, so it's not triggered each time the door is opened.\u00a0\n\n\nSome orthodox people put their lights on automatic timers so they don't need to turn the lights on themselves. Some keep lights on in some common rooms, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom, etc., on for the duration of Shabbat, and keep lights off in their bedrooms, or use a night light.\u00a0",
            "Thank you.",
            "It\u2019s the electricity that isn\u2019t permitted, not the opening of a lock. A regular keyed lock is fine, as long as the key isn\u2019t carried in an an area without an eruv. Some hide it near their home, some have it built into their [clothing](https://thekeybelt.com/).\n\nThe light in a refrigerator can be taped down in the off position so that opening the door doesn\u2019t turn it on. Or the bulb can be unscrewed."
