Did I praise communism in the past here, or is there communist praise in this picture?\n\nIf my caption in the art was the issue, I'll admit it, but you clearly banned this painting for hate-mongering.\n\nWhat hate is in this painting, or is it because you dislike that I drew it in the Soviet style? All I wrote there were the words \"Federal Air Force of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\" and the full name of the MIG-15 in Russian.\n\nTo begin with, I'm South Korean. I have a strong dislike for the pig upstairs, Winnie the Pooh downstairs, and the Ice Lich King upstairs. But that's just my personal opinion, and I never mentioned anything related to them in that post. I created this art for the upcoming Korean War commemoration (June 25th). The previous art featured a Corsair that participated in the Korean War, and this piece is a continuation of that theme. There's no other meaning to it.\n\nIf a Reddit admin dislikes communism, that's none of my business. It's not hate-mongering; it's just a personal idea that no one has the right to infringe upon.
