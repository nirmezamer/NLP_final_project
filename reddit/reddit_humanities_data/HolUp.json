        "content": "Hello inbreds. \n\nAs some of you may have noticed, our community sucks ass right now. Very few posts are on topic. Instead we have rage bait, some dudes podcast, shitty memes and  photos of random trans people. \n\nMany of you leave comments along the lines of \"what's the holup?\" and \"this sub used to be good.\" We feel the same. This subreddit has been kicked from mod to mod for a long time and many have tried and failed to bring it back to what it once was. Which brings us to today: we no longer have enough mods and need a hand moderating. \n\nIf you're interested in ~~cleaning up our mess~~ helping out, here's our [mod app](https://forms.gle/kYDj63fye45uYZbf7) and no, it's not paid.",
