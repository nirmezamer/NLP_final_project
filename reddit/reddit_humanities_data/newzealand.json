        "content": "I live in Christchurch, and can drive, and do have a vehicle. But choose to take the bus because it's cheaper, I can do my work on it, it's faster durring rush hour, better for the environment and I hate driving. But there's always pricks that yet out stuff along the lines of \"get a car\" whenever they driver by. They usually drive either a ute or one of those run down looking fart box cars . I don't usually have a problem with it. But I've never understood where their thought process is. I've driven in my city before, and was once involved in a hit and run (I ride a motorcycle so a hit and run hurts alot) and no one else helped me besides a near by bus who blocked the road and helped get me from underneath the bike. I see the shit bus drivers go though and have nothing but respect from them. Don't get me wrong it pisses me off when I'm waiting 30 minutes in the rain for three of the same bus to come by. But I generally don't understand the hate ",

            "Hello fellow bus user! Likewise, I could choose to drive to work, but I like having the quiet time to listen to music or books, read reddit, and generally just people watch. Plus do it for environmental reasons, and so Im not adding another single-occupant car to the roads in peak hour. I would love the service to improve, but it never will until it becomes mainstream. \n\nIve never had anyone yell at me at the bus stop, though.",
            "A combination of imported American culture where a car is a status symbol, and just plain old ignorance. \n\nHead to Wellington and you'll see thousands of people on 6 figure incomes happily choosing to ride trains and buses to work for the same reasons as you.",
            "I take a 33-min train to/from work, which most people in Wellington think is pretty far. Meanwhile I lived in London for several years, so I think taking a train for only 33 minutes where I almost always get a window seat looking out over the ocean is pretty fucking awesome.",
            "Former Christchurch resident, currently living in Welly. \n\nChch is pretty much impossible to navigate via public transport if you live in certain suburbs. I think the attitude is also quite different. In Welly, lots of people including students and professionals in the city use public transport so its not seen as such a lowly thing. The busses here are also nicer by comparison.",
            "We need a big cultural shift. The obsession with cars over active modes and PT is so backwards",
            "Also in Christchurch - public transport here is so unreliable, especially in winter. That vs the luxury of just having a car with a heater, radio, space etc just far outweighs the all unexpected variables, not to mention the people",
            "I don't hate it. I also live in Christchurch but driving is so much more convenient. I can get to work in under 10 minutes whereas a bus would take much longer. The bus service doesn't start early enough for me to get to work also.",
            "I don't think they do hate it, they just hate how bad it is. If you could get to work faster by public transport than by driving,i think most would do it. For a developed economy, the state of transport is simply embarrassing (along with any form of forward planning).",
            "The stigma isn't there in Auckland or Wellington, in fact if you drive in in Wellington there's probably a slight stigma for driving. I've worked with millionaires who catch the train to work in Wellington. Think it's just a cultural thing in Christchurch and probably other cities. Wellington always had public transport and in Auckland it's a necessity",
