But at a guess, it'll be:\n\na) It's Labour's fault!\n\nb) It's Kiwirails fault!\n\nc) Free Square\n\nd) It's not our fault, the reports etc didn't say this would happen!\n\nc) It's the contractors fault, they fucked up the steering and totes not mechanical/electrical failure to components at their end of life!\n\ne) Blame The Experts, it's totes not our fault despite KR telling us the ferries needed to be replaced ASAP.\n\nf) Brown attempts to spin some other bullshit to get out, and fails. Because he's an idiot duh.\n\ng) It Cost Tooooo Much!11!1! Even though it was the portside stuff that was the problem, not the boats.\n\nAlas, I lack the focus to be able to sit through Brown doing what he does best and the hard liquor needed to survive it.\n\n  \n\\[Edit\\] - And b) is the \"answer\" Simon Brown has taken, in the form of \"Asset Management\", despite the fact the steering was completely overhauled 3 weeks ago with new parts and probably a shit ton of checks etc. So KR have been keeping up with \"asset management\" you vacuously brained nonce.

            "When a large complex machine gets old enough, replacing worn out parts often sends the old ones next to it down the toilet as well because they cant handle the strain of the fully performing new part. Its a cascade failure, where fixing one thing leads you down the road of fixing many other things.\n\nOh you fixed the oil pressure on the power steering pump? Now the hydraulic cylinder is leaking oil. Oh you fixed the oil leak on the cylinder? Now the reservoir tank is overflowing. Oh you replaced the fluid and bled the system and put new fluid in? Now the control arm bushings have cracked because the steering is no longer soft. Oh you fixed the bushings? Now the previous oil leak onto other components has fried them and you need to replace the alternator. Oh you replaced the alternator? Now one of the safety systems has burnt out but you wont find out until you try to brake hard and the ABS doesn\u2019t engage.\n\nThese boats are OLD. And they have been in constant service for 26 years, shit wears out and a maintenance schedule is not going to be comprehensive enough to prevent issues without having the entire engine, electrical and transmission systems taken apart and rebuilt.
