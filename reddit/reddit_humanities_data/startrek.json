        "content": "We've had several users report they're unable to make text posts. After some investigation we've confirmed there's a bug affecting the official Android Reddit app.  \n\nThe bug manifests as the Post button being unusable unless a link is entered. This prevents the creation of text posts since they do not use links.   \n\nReddit has yet to acknowledge the bug or provide an timeline for fixing it. \n\n# Workarounds  \n\nPlease don't enter a random link to create a text post. There are better workarounds you can use until it's fixed:\n\n1. Use your mobile devices web browser to make the post. Once you create the post, you can interact with it in the app. The bug doesn't affect commenting on an pre-existing post. \n\n2. Use a non-Android device such as iOS (iPhone/iPad) or a desktop computer. Once the post is made you can switch back. \n\nWe tried swapping around random isolinear chips but that only seemed to make things worse. The suggested workarounds are the only known solution for now. If you think you have a different solution please feel free to [send us a modmail.](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/startrek) If it works we'll add it to the list. \n\n# Reporting  \n\nPlease report the bug to Reddit if you're experiencing it. The more people who report it, the faster Reddit will fix it (hopefully.)  \n\nBug reports can be filed by making a post on /r/bugs. Yes we understand that's silly since the bug prevents posting. Unfortunately that's just how Reddit chose to handle bug reports. The aforementioned workarounds should help.",

        "content": "So I just finished the first season of Enterprise and am working my way through the second. I can't understand why they are just wondering aimlessly around deeper regions of space though. It becomes obvious that they have no oversight or direction on what they are doing out there. It's humans (as a collective species) ONLY ship. In TNG they get directives on where to go and what missions to do. Enterprise should be patrolling trade lanes (it's shown on the series that raids against trader vessels is a real problem and you would think star fleet would have a vested interest in protecting it). They have a database collected from the Vulcans, they should be combing through it and assigning Enterprise to contact known species that humans might be able to ally with or trade with. Towards the end of the season the admiral tells Archer he is \"doing good work out there\" but I have to disagree, he isn't doing anything. Maybe this type of aimless exploration would make sense if they had several ships but this is their only ship wandering around getting nothing done for the organization that funded and launched the ship. \nI'm still enjoying the series but this plot point urks me, I'm not going to lie.",

            "been a while since I saw it.\n\nbut basically: humans were a bit fed up by the vulcan babysitting. They just wanted to go out and see what the galaxy had to offer.\n\nWhy go to places that the vulcans already explored, when humans can do so as well with new places?\n\nDangerous, risky and potentially stupid? Sure. But so were basically all humans who explored new frontiers",

            "As their first warp five ship, it makes sense to assign them to exploration. They're heavily armed to defend against the unknown, they can get out there and report back, faster than any other ship, and while they're out there they can deploy subspace transponders to bust Starfleet communication signals.\n\nStarfleet has other, slower ships they use for known routes. They are in contact with races other than the vulcans (phlox) but the whole point of Archer's mission is to wander around and find things the vulcans haven't. To seek out new life and new civilisations. To boldy go where no one has gone before."
