        "content": "We've had several users report they're unable to make text posts. After some investigation we've confirmed there's a bug affecting the official Android Reddit app.  \n\nThe bug manifests as the Post button being unusable unless a link is entered. This prevents the creation of text posts since they do not use links.   \n\nReddit has yet to acknowledge the bug or provide an timeline for fixing it. \n\n# Workarounds  \n\nPlease don't enter a random link to create a text post. There are better workarounds you can use until it's fixed:\n\n1. Use your mobile devices web browser to make the post. Once you create the post, you can interact with it in the app. The bug doesn't affect commenting on an pre-existing post. \n\n2. Use a non-Android device such as iOS (iPhone/iPad) or a desktop computer. Once the post is made you can switch back. \n\nWe tried swapping around random isolinear chips but that only seemed to make things worse. The suggested workarounds are the only known solution for now. If you think you have a different solution please feel free to [send us a modmail.](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/startrek) If it works we'll add it to the list. \n\n# Reporting  \n\nPlease report the bug to Reddit if you're experiencing it. The more people who report it, the faster Reddit will fix it (hopefully.)  \n\nBug reports can be filed by making a post on /r/bugs. Yes we understand that's silly since the bug prevents posting. Unfortunately that's just how Reddit chose to handle bug reports. The aforementioned workarounds should help.",

        "content": "I just binge-watched the first season of Picard.  So SPOILERS, obviously, for the first season.  (But I haven't seen the last two seasons, so please no spoilers for those seasons.)\n\nThey killed off Icheb.  A little WTF, but ok.  Then they killed off Hugh.  Again, for no reason, but fine, be dArK aNd gRittY.\n\nBUT THEY KILLED OFF PICARD????  And sorry, but his synthetic clone is NOT him.  Yes, he's \"real\", but he's real as Johnny Lucas or whatever.  Not real as Jean-Luc Picard.  You can't just put some memories into a body and pretend that's the original person.  IT'S NOT.  And what about the implications of this?  You've just invented immortality for humans, is what you've done (if it really is the \"same person\" - which again, I don't think it is.)  Your body is failing?  You're getting old?  No problem - just create a synthetic one and dump all your memories into it.  Voila! Instant new life.\n\nWhat the actual WHAT.\n\nAnd we didn't even get the benefit of a grand Picard funeral.  Because apparently, this synthetic person is a good enough replacement to actually be him???  I mean, what is Troi going to think?  She's obviously going to know.  Do they plan on announcing his death and \"resurrection\" or do they plan on hiding it?  (Don't tell me if they actually deal with this issue - like I said, I haven't seen the last two seasons.)  But they really better.\n\nI mean, I was expecting Agnes to use that magical doohickey the androids gave them to fix the ship, to actually fix *Picard*.  Like, she'd imagine some marvelous medical cure, and it would just manifest itself.  I knew there were another two seasons of the show, so I never expected him to actually DIE.\n\nBut he did die, and now I don't know what to do.  But see - I *knew* something like this would happen.  Not that they'd kill off Picard, of course, but... something bad.  Which is why I put off watching this show for *years*.  I didn't have Paramount +, but my library got the series on DVD, so I could have watched it.  But I didn't want to.  And then I got a few months free of Paramount, and the temptation was too big to resist.  Picard is my *absolute favorite*, after all.  \n\nI don't know what to do.  I'm so... SAD.  And I knew the show would make me sad, and *I watched it anyway*.  Dummy.",

Voyager is my favorite ST, and part of the fun was watching him basically become a Starfleet savant and fulfill his dreams of going to the Academy after being freed from the Borg. Still, after all of that, they kill him off like he was some sort of unnamed ensign. They didn\u2019t even seem all that upset about it. I did not enjoy Picard. At all.",

        "content": "So I just finished the first season of Enterprise and am working my way through the second. I can't understand why they are just wondering aimlessly around deeper regions of space though. It becomes obvious that they have no oversight or direction on what they are doing out there. It's humans (as a collective species) ONLY ship. In TNG they get directives on where to go and what missions to do. Enterprise should be patrolling trade lanes (it's shown on the series that raids against trader vessels is a real problem and you would think star fleet would have a vested interest in protecting it). They have a database collected from the Vulcans, they should be combing through it and assigning Enterprise to contact known species that humans might be able to ally with or trade with. Towards the end of the season the admiral tells Archer he is \"doing good work out there\" but I have to disagree, he isn't doing anything. Maybe this type of aimless exploration would make sense if they had several ships but this is their only ship wandering around getting nothing done for the organization that funded and launched the ship. \nI'm still enjoying the series but this plot point urks me, I'm not going to lie.",

            "You're kind of missing the whole premise of the show then, which is that humans want to get out there and explore and discover *for themselves*. It's the \"human spirit\". A constant throughout the early episodes is the Vulcans keep finger-wagging humans aren't ready for intergalactic adventures and Archer hits back they could/should have set out even earlier than Enterprise' mission. I think it's even flat out said in one of the earlier episodes humans *could* just rely on the Vulcan database as they're covering a lot of territory, metaphorically and literally, that the Vulcans already have, but humanity wants to see and experience things for itself.",
            "As their first warp five ship, it makes sense to assign them to exploration. They're heavily armed to defend against the unknown, they can get out there and report back, faster than any other ship, and while they're out there they can deploy subspace transponders to bust Starfleet communication signals.\n\nStarfleet has other, slower ships they use for known routes. They are in contact with races other than the vulcans (phlox) but the whole point of Archer's mission is to wander around and find things the vulcans haven't. To seek out new life and new civilisations. To boldy go where no one has gone before.",
