Not really losing any weight at the moment. Fluctuating up and down (likely water weight). Clothes do feel slightly loser than they did last year (when I was the same weight as my starting weight) and my stomach is less bloated, but scale-wise not much is happening. I'm not eating that much as it is so I'm trying to increase my steps instead of shrinking the eating window even more."

            "I appreciate it as the posts were getting out of hand, but I do feel like a megathread would be a good option to help with the influx. That study doesn't seem to hold enough evidence to firmly prove that IF can cause cardiovascular issues (hell, it even says that they didn't take into account other factors that play a role in health like dieting, which is a way bigger point to cardiovascular health), but I do feel like a megathread would help at least ease tensions. Lots of people coming here to either warn people about it or to ask if that study holds up, that a loved one sent them that and that they're worried sick because they do IF or they know somebody who does IF and such.",
            "I remember in the late 2000s or early 2010s, I was put off fasting because some articles came out that fasting wasn\u2019t good for women. And then I thought about it, like how? Both men and women went through periods of feasting and famine. Anyways, wish I started sooner.",

My biggest problems always would be snacking or over eating, my portion sizes were always too much. I would eat from 10am-6pm and stop all snacking and eating outside of those windows. I think that just helped remind me that i was snacking at all hours of the day. I do work out but not as much as i did in the beginning. Now its only a few times a week were i use weights and do 100 squats per workout.",

I weighed about 225-230 and i did omad until about late April and I weighed in at about 190-195 which the first time i was under 200 in an extremely long time. \n\nAfter that i started eating more regularly (lunch and dinner and a few in between here and there) but i jumped rope almost everyday to not gain the weight back, and i weighed about 200-205 for the majority of the summer. Once i began college i made myself believe i still felt like i wasn\u2019t where i wanted to be and so i start OMAD again in mid October to Thanksgiving and i went from in high u about 205ish to about 185ish, but then i impulsively tried a smoothie diet because someone i knew was doing it and i wanted to see how much weight i could lose, and i began it December 1st for about 2 weeks and i was at my lowest weight at 177 but i noticed a bit of loose skin probably because the abrupt diet change but i don\u2019t know. After my friends insisted that stop the diet, i abruptly stopped just before Christmas break and started eating regularly again and i was so scared of gaining all the weight back. After break, around mid January 2024, i didn\u2019t pay much attention to my weight, but i could feel it coming back on.\n\n Around mid February i started weight training and a bit of cardio alongside OMAD, but i would often find myself having worse cravings and giving in. I stopped working out and OMAD completely for about a month and in mid April i decided to pick OMAD back up and i was making progress, but it felt like my body had become adjusted to the fast quickly now after only 2 weeks. I became demotivated as the number on the scale wasn\u2019t moving and just gave it up on my birthday May 4th. I weighed roughly around 208. After about a month, starting June 4th, i started consistently working out and burning 400 calories doing cardio 5-6 days a week and have being doing until present day, but my weight has increased to 211 most recently.\n\nI recently stopped working out for about 2 weeks now (10 days to be exact) and i went down from 212 to 203, but ive been stuck at this weight for the past several days. Im scared my body has learnt how to get used to OMAD now, and its seems like nothing is working anymore. Please help:(",
