            "Type: 16:8\nContext: Start around lunch time which usually means I'm eating lunch and dinner. \nLength: 8h eating window\nWhy: Weight loss  \nNotes: Stuck. Not really losing any weight at the moment. Fluctuating up and down (likely water weight). Clothes do feel slightly loser than they did last year (when I was the same weight as my starting weight) and my stomach is less bloated, but scale-wise not much is happening. I'm not eating that much as it is so I'm trying to increase my steps instead of shrinking the eating window even more."

            "Can we please have a pinned thread? Or a megathread? \n\nParts of it seem like bullshit but I still think it's worth discussing even if it's just to debunk it. Just saying the study is flawed and should be ignored doesn't help at all",
            "I appreciate it as the posts were getting out of hand, but I do feel like a megathread would be a good option to help with the influx. That study doesn't seem to hold enough evidence to firmly prove that IF can cause cardiovascular issues (hell, it even says that they didn't take into account other factors that play a role in health like dieting, which is a way bigger point to cardiovascular health), but I do feel like a megathread would help at least ease tensions. Lots of people coming here to either warn people about it or to ask if that study holds up, that a loved one sent them that and that they're worried sick because they do IF or they know somebody who does IF and such.",
            "I remember in the late 2000s or early 2010s, I was put off fasting because some articles came out that fasting wasn\u2019t good for women. And then I thought about it, like how? Both men and women went through periods of feasting and famine. Anyways, wish I started sooner.",
            "The thing is... intermittent fasting already has many research articles that show it improves cholesterol, lowers blood pressure, decreases insulin resistance, helps with weight loss, causes autophagy... which is basically everything that goes into cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk lol. So... like.... I'd need to know what their thoughts are on the mechanism for the increased risk because it doesn't make sense to me. It's self reported data and we don't even know the details on the test population versus the control population. Were the pre-existing co-morbidities equivalent? Were the ages equivalent? How closely did they actually follow IF and how often? On the AHA website it says something about 2 days determining which category people fell into... 2 days out of what???\n\nI'm not swayed by just one study... there needs to be many studies. You need the meta-analysis to make final conclusions. There are already many studies supporting IF. Biochemically the science supports IF. \n\nAlso... I plug this guy everywhere because I'm so impressed by him. But I'd encourage anyone to check out Dr. Pradip Jamnadas, MD who is a cardiologist in Florida. He has some great YouTube videos about the benefits of IF. A CARDIOLOGIST who takes care of actual patients... not some researcher who has no idea what goes into patient care.",
            "\"Dr Pam Taub, a cardiologist at UC San Diego Health, told Sky News' US partner NBC News: \"It's a retrospective study looking at two days' worth of data, and drawing some very big conclusions from a very limited snapshot into a person's lifestyle habits.\"\n\nShe added her patients have seen \"incredible benefits\" from fasting regimens, before concluding: \"I would continue doing it. For people that do intermittent fasting, their individual results speak for themselves.\n\n\"Most people that do intermittent fasting, the reason they continue it is they see a decrease in their weight. They see a decrease in blood pressure. They see an improvement in their LDL cholesterol.\"",

            "Really great in-depth investigation by NY Times (paywalled) https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/20/well/eat/intermittent-fasting-study.html. \n\nSome highlights:\n\n- \"As pointed out by @sameerbansilal there were 31 cardiovascular events in a total of 414 individuals in the <8 hour eating group over a median 8 year follow up. \n\n- This group only represented 2% of the total sample (414 out of 20,078 individuals). There are 60% more smokers in this group (23.2% vs. 6.6% in the control group) .  \n\n- The assessment of <8-hour duration of eating was based on only 2 days of dietary recall.\"\n\nIn other words, it's not even very good data interpretation for a nutritional survey."

            " Keep in mind that it's your personal health journey and you are the principal beneficiary.  It stands to reason that you're going to be your #1 supporter.  When people make dramatic changes in their eating habits and their daily exercise regimen, it can feel both a bit scary and somewhat threatening to their SO's.  Particularly if their partner has similar reasons to get active and watch what they eat - but aren't ready to commit to changing their habits.\n\nMy suggestion is that you stay focused and continue to lead by example.  You're no doubt looking and feeling much better now and this trend is only going to continue.  In due time the contrast between how you look and feel versus how your SO looks and feels will become impossible for your partner to ignore.  At that point you can gently nudge them to join you in your new healthy lifestyle.\n\nBut... even if they don't?  This is about you living your best life and it's a very good thing regardless of your partner's less than supportive attitude.",
