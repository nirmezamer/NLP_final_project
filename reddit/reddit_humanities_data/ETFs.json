            "Ehh I like DGRO for more of a dividend growth etf. \n\nIn terms of VTI over VOO (from a VOO owner perspective), people choose VTI because they own all the stocks in the USA. So instead of 500 in VOO, VTI has a few thousand. Also, VTI includes the mid cap and small cap stocks so its more diversified compared to VOO as VOO has only large cap and a small amount to mid cap stocks, but VTI is still heavily weighted to its large cap holdings thats why I said more diversified. In terms of performance, they will be insanely similar to eachother because they are market cap weighted. Flip a coin honestly if youre looking for a  better  return. Cant go wrong with either. Both great !",

            "Growth ETF'S are actually less risky than Value ETF's, due to this and the fact that these hold mega and large cap companies makes them fairly conservative looking at it from a mathematical standpoint. If you want to take more risk consider funds like AVUV, AVDV, and AVES which are much more risky than growth funds because th y hold something called Small Cap Value (SCV). They also have performed the best because of this risk. If you want something set and forget just do a simple VT + AVGV portfolio at something like a 70/30 tilt in order to be able to capture the whole entire world and tilt it to something more risky. Remember, you never want to put all your eggs in one basket which is pretty much what you're doing by putting everything into US Large Cap Growth Companies and pretty much nothing else w your risky play. \n\nHere's some links to some backtests showing SCV and it's performance:\n\n\nHere's AVUV vs SCHG, QQQM, VUG, etc. (US Large Cap Growth)\nhttps://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation?s=y&sl=4jNjJKRE0zcxxzlGuh5Vzx\n\nAnd here's AVUV vs VOO (SP500)\nhttps://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation?s=y&sl=5WVMRjTOHucQi0mnPk6DPJ\n\nAnd for fun here's value outperforming growth, growth really only took off after 2000\nhttps://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation?s=y&sl=4xtzj2RHQ7Ptb6LdAIr6uS\n\nAVUV (and it's worse backtest DFSVX) both outperform what Portfolio Visualizer calls Small Cap Value meaning there might be an even greater difference.\n\nSmall Cap Value vs DFSVX\nhttps://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation?s=y&sl=5acYU2SFPwgLtZHBEA9uPj\n\nSmall Cap Value vs AVUV (small time frame)\nhttps://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation?s=y&sl=1fOsuQFVLyBJ3gnz8bWyVu\n\nDFSVX vs AVUV vs SP500 (for comparison)\nhttps://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&sl=2A6gkIa0NAZDyTm2K35Pal\n\nhttps://www.nerdwallet.com/calculator/compound-interest-calculator?utm_source=goog&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=bk_mktg_paid_092723_banking_dsa_mobile&utm_term=&utm_content=ta&mktg_hline=19335&mktg_body=2989&mktg_place=dsa-2206538784443&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw1K-zBhBIEiwAWeCOF1QJ93szNISQcXjdbK2ic4p4aNSCNeaetXtAJ-CXXBPt7Lg_bzWjJxoCKoYQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds\n\nHope I could help!"
