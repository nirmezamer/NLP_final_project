        "content": "Hello r/Food,\n\nWe are thrilled to announce a new change to the sub: **Text posts are now allowed**! \ud83c\udf89\n\nThis decision comes from our ongoing commitment to make r/Food a more inclusive and engaging space for all food lovers. We understand that sometimes, you have thoughts, stories, and discussions that go beyond just sharing images. Whether you want to share a detailed recipe, ask for help or feedback, tell a culinary story, or start a conversation about food-related topics, you can now do so with Text posts.\n\n**A few things to keep in mind:**\n\n1. **Title Tag \\[Text\\]:** Please use the new \\[Text\\] tag in your title~~, if the other tags would also be relevant, feel free to include them as well.~~ Edited 25/06/24. \n2. **Health and Medical Claims:** While we are excited to see the variety of content you'll bring, we want to maintain a safe and reliable environment for everyone. Therefore, we have implemented a filter to catch health and medical-related claims.\n3. **Quality and Relevance:** Please ensure your text posts are relevant to food. Posts should be informative, engaging, and respectful to other users and communities.\n4. **Ongoing Adjustments:** As we see how text posts are used, we may make further adjustments to how they work here. Your feedback is incredibly valuable. If you have any suggestions or encounter any issues, please let us know.\n\nWe are looking forward to reading your food stories, engaging in meaningful discussions, and seeing our community grow even stronger with this new feature.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pqcmuh1sf48d1.png?width=375&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7998e9deb15f35b040d0a51c9ce805372ab3ccb",
