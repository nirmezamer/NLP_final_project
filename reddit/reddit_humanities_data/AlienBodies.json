            "This was a great talk. If you have not been following along this would be a pretty good place to start. When he talks about the greater implications of this discovery and the impact this has had on him it really resonated with me. This is a story that needs told and Im so happy he was brave enough to put this out there.",
            "I was just coming here to see if this was posted after watching it. It is excellent and worth. Awatch for anyone, beginner or veteran.",
            "this needs to be passed along it was really good!",
            "For anybody stumbling on this weeks after it was posted: this is outstanding and you should watch both of his videos on the subject. While I disagree with a few things he says, his thinking is clear and organized, and the case he builds is both compelling and fun AF to watch. He's just a great presenter.\n\nWhat a tremendous benefit to the community, to have a philosopher thinking and speaking openly about the process of investigation and discovery.",
            "I don't usually pay much attention to stickies.\n\nBut oh my god, this talk was amazing. Absolutely worth the watch.",
            "Excellent video, thanks for sharing. \n\nLooking forward to the April 4th reveal from Peru.",
            "Give that man a raise",
            "Actually a really fun and convincing watch",
            "Good video. We need more discussion. With Frankensteining I think he also missed out that the bones are hollow. So you cant just use human bones. Youd have to hollow them out. \n\nHe got the UAP disclosure act bit wrong though. The review board didnt make it into law. Just the National archives part.",
            "whoa...  this video was amazing.  i had assumed they were just modern day 'fiji mermaids' until watching this. I'm officially a believer now."
