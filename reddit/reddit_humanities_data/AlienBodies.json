While I disagree with a few things he says, his thinking is clear and organized, and the case he builds is both compelling and fun AF to watch. He's just a great presenter.\n\nWhat a tremendous benefit to the community, to have a philosopher thinking and speaking openly about the process of investigation and discovery.",

            "The original skinny Bob video is slowed down a little bit, I believe you have to speed it up a tiny bit to see their real movements. I also heard somewhere that this is a female specimen, not a male. I have also read that given the date this was originally released they would have had to use some very impressive animatronics to get the details. Like when they scanned from bottom to top you can see individual fingers moving around very smoothly, if you play with the brightness you can see it has an eye that is a lot smaller than the larger Shadow you see. \n\nOne of the few videos of another species that has yet to be disproven, this could very well be a genuine video of an alien species right in front of our face.\n\nTo get more Comfort we would require some official source to back this video up of course. Or to Simply have more video leak of the exact same specimen"

It can be seen blinking and gasping. Has severe head injury. Mostly covered wearing loose black clothing.\n\nVideo here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxy-k7CZYKc&list=PL3ztC_6JCilju0lWbpJxrgbA-DndGrEE0&index=1\n\nSmall Reptilian:\nFilmed in Russia, the being appears approximately 3 foot. Leg and arm missing, dead.\nVideo here: https://youtu.be/zwWWjqA8kIk?si=wbeE1GOA6w5Nh4iD\n\nInsectoid:\nCaught in fishing net. Dead. It appears to have a metallic implant on one of its arms.\n\nVideo here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8-GQ4AWaf8\n\nHybrid:\nShows an interview type setting. Being seems to be struggling to breathe.
