Links to the first two parts can be found below (*depreciated*):\n\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/w6e4hy/for\\_anything\\_related\\_to\\_amazon/](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/w6e4hy/for_anything_related_to_amazon/)\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/wndu5g/for\\_anything\\_related\\_to\\_amazon\\_2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/wndu5g/for_anything_related_to_amazon_2/)\n\nThis is Part 3. However, there are separate threads for interns and new grads. They can be found below:\n\n* [Interns](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/xx7fhp/for_anything_related_to_amazon_3_interns/) (also includes those looking for co-op/placement year and spring week opportunities)\n* [New grads](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/xx7fiv/for_anything_related_to_amazon_3_new_grads/) (also includes those looking for roles that require experience)\n\nThe rules otherwise remain the same:\n\n* Please mention the **location** and the **role** (i.e, intern/new grad/something else) you're applying for, where relevant.\n* Please search the threads to see if your question has already been answered - this is easy in new Reddit which supports searching comments in a thread.\n* Expect other threads related to this to be removed (many of which should be automatic).\n* Note that out-of-scope or illogical comments (such as \"shitposts\") must not be posted here. This is not the place to ask questions unrelated to Amazon recruiting either.\n* Feedback to this is welcome (live chat was removed as a result). This idea was given by a couple of users based on feedback that Amazon threads were getting too repetitive.\n* You risk a ban from the subreddit if you try to evade this rule. Contact the mods beforehand if you think your post deserves its own thread.\n\nThis thread will be locked as its only purpose is to redirect users to the intern/new grad threads.",

            "Applying massively rn\u2026 couldn\u2019t get any SWE intern.. i feel like applicant skills are similar tho.. is that because of referrals?? I\u2019ve heard it being crucial at FAANG. Can anyone confirm this?\u00a0",
            "What do you feel makes a good resume stand out in the application process? Are there any resources you'd recommend for improving your resume?",
            "is there any way you guys can add multiple locations instead of just one?(Preference category)",
            "1. What do you see people liking the most or engaging with the most with jobright.ai? 2. what are some future products that you plan role out?",
            "I'm a recent graduate with a master's in CS and 2 years of experience in the industry as a junior data analyst and later as a junior data engineer. And I also had a graduate assistantship during my masters that kind of gave me work experience related to being a data engineer yet i'm not able to land a single job in data engineering role or analyst i want a template that could get me through the ats system, as analyst isn't working because of the immediate rejections",
            "How is Jobright.ai different from traditional job boards like LinkedIn? Why should I use Jobright.ai if I need to use LinkedIn for networking?",
            "I was trying to search for specific job listings that I knew existed on other job boards so that I could tailor my resume to that job description but couldn't find a search feature. Is that something that can be added in the future?",
            "Hello, Eric. I\u2019m not in the tech industry but was last in a start-up manufacturing company in the kratom space, in addition to having 23 years in private and public ECE-12 education. I have teaching, and admin experience within this realm as well as non-profit experience. I am currently seeking a new job as I\u2019ve been laid off for over a year as an executive director of a non-profit. However, I am not receiving any replies. I recently found your jobright.ai and think it will be really useful. I have experience in the private and public sector. What can I do to get noticed.",
            "If I go 2 years without a tech job post graduation, am I really going become obsolete to the new batch of graduates and forced to spend more time and money on a masters? There's no saying if the time it takes to complete the masters will land me fresh into a new recession and in some over-qualified under-experienced trap.",
            "Would you recommend trying to build a startup if your job search isn't going well? Building a startup would require learning a lot of new things which would likely make you more attractive to recruiters and if the startup is successful you won't even need the job so it's kind of a win-win.  Thanks for your time."

Their stock is going up as a function of being dragged up by the overall market.\n\nSo, if you looked at being a Finance major two years ago and thought, \"Wow! It will always be like this!\" without looking at the surrounding factors, it's no different from looking at CS during Covid and assuming there would always be a pandemic that drives people to software.",

Guess I know I'm not getting this position. Do you guys have any tips on how to improve and get comfortable with such one sided interviews?",
