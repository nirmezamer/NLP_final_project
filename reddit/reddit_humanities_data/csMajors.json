However, there are separate threads for interns and new grads. They can be found below:\n\n* [Interns](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/xx7fhp/for_anything_related_to_amazon_3_interns/) (also includes those looking for co-op/placement year and spring week opportunities)\n* [New grads](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/xx7fiv/for_anything_related_to_amazon_3_new_grads/) (also includes those looking for roles that require experience)\n\nThe rules otherwise remain the same:\n\n* Please mention the **location** and the **role** (i.e, intern/new grad/something else) you're applying for, where relevant.\n* Please search the threads to see if your question has already been answered - this is easy in new Reddit which supports searching comments in a thread.\n* Expect other threads related to this to be removed (many of which should be automatic).\n* Note that out-of-scope or illogical comments (such as \"shitposts\") must not be posted here. This is not the place to ask questions unrelated to Amazon recruiting either.\n* Feedback to this is welcome (live chat was removed as a result). This idea was given by a couple of users based on feedback that Amazon threads were getting too repetitive.\n* You risk a ban from the subreddit if you try to evade this rule. Contact the mods beforehand if you think your post deserves its own thread.\n\nThis thread will be locked as its only purpose is to redirect users to the intern/new grad threads.",

No name school, B.S. in CS, 3.6/4.0 GPA with 3 internships.\n\nI have found that having a positive attitude going into the interview has been helpful as that's usually mentioned in the feedback I get. Being enthusiastic looks good and can encourage your interviewer to help you! Also, do your research on the company before the interview, what do they do? what are their cultural values?\n\nThe market is rough so don't forget to take care of yourself, get support from friends and family, and don't give up!\n\nTC: 160k HCOL\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uf4einl5p18d1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=11d66b7f4fc9f82cfdd6e9278aee450416ceaf3b",
