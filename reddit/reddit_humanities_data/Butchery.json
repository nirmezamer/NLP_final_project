        "content": "I buy and eat a lb of ground beef once or twice a week. Every single week I find a piece of bone in the ground beef. I've had to change my eating habits to avoid biting down it, now whenever I eat ground beef I try to feel for a piece of bone with my tongue before I chew, and eat slower as a result. It is extremely unpleasant to bite down a piece of bone, especially considering I normally scarf down my dinner with the ferocity of an emaciated beast.\n\nI have tried Kroger, Whole Foods, local grocery stores and local butchers. It doesn't seem to matter where I buy the beef, the bits of bone are inescapable. There might be more of them in the beef at Kroger and Whole Foods, but I'm not keeping a record of every time it occurs, so it could just be my own bias (I generally have an expectation/belief that the beef from local shops would be of higher quality).\n\nI have asked my friends and family if they experience this, and they all have as well. I have absolutely zero memories of this occurring when I was a kid. The first time it happened was maybe in a high-school lunch hamburger, and after that I hardly ever experienced it. Over the past 5-7 years, it seems to have gotten progressively worse, to the point where I'm now finding bone on a weekly basis.\n\nHas something occurred in the past 7ish years related to quality control in butchery?!? It sounds conspiratorial and ludicrous, but I have no other explanation for this. I've seen you guys in other threads saying that this should not happen, the bone is considered a contaminant, and it is obvious when it is accidentally ground (the grinder makes a different sound). So what, every single butcher in my city is grossly negligent?! What the fuck? If nobody in the replies believes me, I will start keeping a log of every-time it happens and come back in a few months with evidence. This shit is driving me insane.",

            "Keep a log, photo evidence, before and after cooked pics help too.",
            "It\u2019s almost impossible for bone to get through the grind plate. The grinder is essentially pushing meat through these tiny holes in a round plate, then a blade is cutting it at the same time, making it \u201cground\u201d. For a bone to get through it would have had to of been smaller than the hole to start with and not get caught in the blade at all.",
            "I\u2019ve been grinding burger for almost 15 years.  Never once had anybody tell me there\u2019s bone in it.  It\u2019s just not feasible unless the store you shop at is doing something really weird.  Try shopping at a different store.  If you have the same problem, it\u2019s you.  That said, are you mistaking gristle for bone?  Very small bits of gristle can get through, which is what I imagine you are noticing.  I never notice it in the stuff I grind but it isn\u2019t out of the realm of possibility.  Again, I would try a different store.  They might make their burger using a different process.",
            "I\u2019m in the Midwest. I\u2019ll be 40 this year. I eat ground beef minimal of 3 times per week. Usually as a grilled burger. There are certain brands and grinds of beef that I\u2019ll catch the occasional piece of gristle/cartilage. I usually find those in \u201cpub burgers\u201d cut off the chub or when I buy the whole 10# chub. As far as fresh grind I rarely ever find anything other than flesh and fat. I can honestly say I\u2019ve never found bone in my ground beef. \n\nIf you eat ground beef as burgers try any of the wahlburger blends. If near a GFS store they carry their own brisket blend fresh patties and fresh ground beef patties. Both sold in cryovac trays. I\u2019ve never had a bad burger with any of these pre pattied options. While wahlburgers are fairly pricey imo, the GFS ones are at a great price point. But I think in your situation the extra cost might be worth it to compare and find if they work better for you.",
            "There are some contributing factors. If the place you buy ground beef from only uses trimmings for the mixture there is a higher chance of having gristle or bone fragments in it. The likely hood of it being gristle over bone is higher. \nOperations that use whole muscle grind and no trimming are less likely to have those less desirable bits. And not all trimming is created equal some of the material out there has little regard to what\u2019s in the box. Large operations that use trimming have bone extractors and metal detectors built in line to mitigate the risk of the lower tiered trimming. Small operations that buy the same trimming do not have the $150,000 attachments for the $1,000,000 grinder. Large operations are also going at a speed of 30-60 patties a minute.",

        "content": "Hi, I\u2019m not a butcher, however a family friend recently opened a butchery and liquor store in my small town. He\u2019s been open for 6 months now and since he opened his turnover at the butchery has not been well. The reason for this is that employees seem to be stealing the money and not logging meat sales. The point of sale system needs to be updated and changed to accommodate the variables of the meat products but the guy who is supposed to set it up, never comes out because he is always fully booked. Do any butcher store employees or owners know what we can do to prevent such thievery until the POS can be updated? I am sorry if this makes no sense. Also the guy doesn\u2019t want to fire the employees because he has a soft heart. I have tried convincing him but it\u2019s not working so now I\u2019m looking for other solutions. Thanks!",

            "The reality is even with the updated POS there's always going to be unaccounted loss. Trimming, spoilage, fat-fingering the wrong PLU are all going to happen both intentionally and accidentally. One thing to try and curb it would be give everyone a \"staff meal\" of like $8 worth of product a shift or something along those lines. Besides that, firing offenders or making examples of them some other way would be the only real way to fix the issue, unless the owner can keep a sharp eye out whenever there's other staff at the counter.",
            "Something I\u2019ve learned while working in this trade for about 4 years is that a surprising amount of cutters are absolutely shitty humans and if they see an opportunity to get away with something they will. It\u2019s hard to find good workers that are also good people.",

We cut the belly from our salmon and that\u2019s always available for anybody who wants it. We have ground beef/pork mix from going between proteins that\u2019s always available. Chicken and some seafood items are up for grabs on their last day. Several times my boss has given me a steak for going the extra mile one way or another. In the time I\u2019ve worked here I haven\u2019t heard of any employee being caught for theft, and I feel like having so many honest opportunities to take home some product keeps the employees happy and discourages theft.",
            "Get cameras on the till and in the prep area. It should be pretty easy to see who is stealing. Also, balance the till at the end of every shift - is it out money when one person works consistently? Does it appear that you're moving more product than is accountable in sales? These things are easily spotted on camera. \n\nHave the meat cutters log waste and trim by weight if they aren't already. This will promote accountability.",
