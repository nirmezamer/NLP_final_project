            "Dear IO Interactive:\n\n# Get rid of the Part One DLC.\n\nIt is completely pointless as a DLC as all it contains is the Hitman 2016 GOTY Edition...which is already included in the standard edition of HWoA, there isn't a reason for this to be a seperate DLC. It just adds to the confusion of what it even is, and generally causes newbie strife on what to buy in order to play your game optimally.\n\nBy keeping this Part One DLC, you are actively going against the very reason you rebranded WoA to begin with; to make it easier to get locations and to lessen the confusion when purchasing.\n\nSigned: James \"Dribbleondo\" Hawkins.",
            "what do you do if you have hitman 1 & 2 . i get what they trying to do but holyfuck. i thought part 1 was basically hitman 3 and saw it was on sale",
            "Just buy the most expensive edition. \n\nI'm not exaggerating when i say hitman woa was the beat game this past generation. Stellar level design, great world building, solid mechanics, and nearly infinite  replayability.",

This process applies the same 60% discount as Part 1 itself has, and allows purchase of Standard Edition content at 40% of the original price. If other users can please verify whether this is true or misinformation would be appreciated.",

At first it made me think that yet another of my controllers had drift issues, and ultimately lead to me failing the second escalation when I was running behind the enforcer in the area with the bell. The jolt threw my path off and I ran right in front of the enforcer like a noob. There are some other maps where the camera moves deliberately toward a target or goal for guidance, but those were slow swerves. This one feels like a weird unexpected snap.
