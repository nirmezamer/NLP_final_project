This process applies the same 60% discount as Part 1 itself has, and allows purchase of Standard Edition content at 40% of the original price. If other users can please verify whether this is true or misinformation would be appreciated.",

I\u2019ve been completing some of the old escalations, and this single item makes many of them utterly trivial.\n\nThe old emetic device in a briefcase trick, itself meta warping to the point where people wondered if it was intentional or not, has been completely power crept by this single fruity boi. Not requiring a briefcase and being totally legal means it can be taken in any undercover start location, unlike the briefcase, and it\u2019s area of effect is actually much bigger than you\u2019d expect meaning you can get rid of multiple NPCs with it fairly easily.\n\nI\u2019m amazed IOI have made this an unlock, not complaining though!",
