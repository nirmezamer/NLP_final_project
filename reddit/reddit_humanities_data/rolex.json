            "Hi everyone, \nI just came from a farmers market/flea market in Alicante, Spain.\nI have no idea wether i have just wasted or possibly picked up a bargain Rolex for 110 euro from an elderly man who I think tried to explain with hand signals that he was selling bulk items as one. (Tried to sell me a cupboard and ash tray with the watches.. 200 the lot \ud83d\ude06) \n\nAnyways i will upload the photos of the Rolex and hope they could be genuine or at least i think some of it is genuine as it feels heavy and well made!\n\nThe crown is flimsy and won\u2019t close but it keeping time and I think the day and date are broken because it hasn\u2019t clicked over by itself from yesterday since i bought it, I have manually changed the day and date. \n\n\n [Rolex i haggled for in Alicante](https://imgur.com/a/MixIi8P)",

            "Hello, a while back I had someone comment on my Rolex saying it was fake, but they provided no details on why they left that comment. I want to posit it here with all the evidence to get an expert opinion. I inherited this watch from my late grandfather. I have no reason to believe this watch was fake outside of one rouge comment on Reddit. I have weighted the watch and it is 119 grams. Online resource say that is the exact weight (technically 118.6 but my scale does not have decimals, plus maybe missing links for the online one). I sent the watch to Rolex in Switzerland for service. I did not end up getting it serviced as they wanted to replace several key original parts. In the service review, Rolex did not mention that the watch or any of the parts were fake, but they did say that the end links that attach to the lugs belonged to a different model (I cannot spot the difference, but there are a lot that have jubilee end parts). I am not sure if not paying for the service would have limited Rolex\u2019s authenticity review. I even have the original packaging, but no papers. The serial number is time period accurate (early 90s, 1991-1992 ish). Here are [the images](https://imgur.com/a/MgMjth8), let me know what you think.\n\nIf you think it is fake, please provide reasons.",

I expressed interest in the GMT Master II but I knew it was much harder to get than the other two, so I didn't even ask to try it on. I settled on the sub thinking I had a better shot at actually getting one being the poor first time buyer, thanked the AD for their time and went on my way. It's been 9 days and I get a call that they have a BLNR GMT for me if I'm interested. I have absolutely no idea how I managed to get so lucky but this is a massive purchase for me and it'll be worn daily so I'm beyond happy that I got the one I truly would've wanted. This was purchased in the NJ/Tristate area for anyone wondering.  Other AD's told me flat out \"No\" when I asked to give them my information, some said 3 to 5 years, but then one did this.
