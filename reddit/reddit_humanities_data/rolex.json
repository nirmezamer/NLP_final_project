Its fully gold with a black/brown dial with what seems like gold shining pieces on it. I checked the gold of multiple sides at the gold dealer and it was real. Now my question/problem is how can I know that its real because the gold is real and the possibly the diamonds are also real. The watch is broken and I have been told that I should send it to London to get it fixed. Now I would like to know if the rolex is real. Btw it says at the bottom swiss movt instead of swiss made. I think its fake but the gold on the watch is real.\n\nSorry for my bad English.",

What watch did you buy?  \n2. When?  \n3. How long did you wait?  \n4. Where are you? (Be as specific or nonspecific as you want, from continent to a specific AD)  \n5. Any purchase history with that AD? (Again be as specific or nonspecific as you feel comfortable)",
