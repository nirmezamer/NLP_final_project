        "content": "To All Whom It May Concern:\n\nFor fifteen years, /r/Funny has been one of Reddit\u2019s most-popular communities. That time hasn\u2019t been without its difficulties, but for the most part, we\u2019ve all gotten along (with each other and with administrators). Members of our team fondly remember Moderator Roadshows, visits to Reddit\u2019s headquarters, Reddit Secret Santa, April Fools\u2019 Day events, regional meetups, and many more uplifting moments. We\u2019ve watched this platform grow by leaps and bounds, and although we haven\u2019t been completely happy about every change that we\u2019ve witnessed, we\u2019ve always done our best to work with Reddit at finding ways to adapt, compromise, and move forward. \n\nThis process has occasionally been preceded by some exceptionally public debate, however.\n\nOn June 12th, 2023, /r/Funny joined thousands of other subreddits in protesting the planned changes to Reddit\u2019s API; changes which \u2013 despite being immediately evident to only a minority of Redditors \u2013 threatened to worsen the site for everyone. By June 16th, 2023, that demonstration had evolved to represent a wider (and growing) array of concerns, many of which arose in response to [Reddit\u2019s statements to journalists](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/16/reddit-ceo-blackout-moderators-steve-huffman/). Today (June 26th, 2023), we are hopeful that users and administrators alike can make a return to the productive dialogue that has served us in the past. \n\nWe acknowledge that Reddit has placed itself in a situation that makes adjusting its current API roadmap impossible. \n\nHowever, we have the following requests:\n\n- Commit to exploring ways by which third-party applications can make an affordable return.\n- Commit to providing moderation tools and [accessibility options](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/14ds81l/rblinds_meetings_with_reddit_and_the_current/) (on Old Reddit, New Reddit, and mobile platforms) which match or exceed the functionality and utility of third-party applications.\n- Commit to prioritizing a significant reduction in spam, misinformation, bigotry, and illegal content on Reddit.\n- Guarantee that any future developments which may impact moderators, contributors, or stakeholders will be announced no less than one fiscal quarter before they are scheduled to go into effect.\n- Work together with longstanding moderators to establish a reasonable roadmap and deadline for accomplishing all of the above.\n- Affirm that efforts meant to keep Reddit accountable to its commitments and deadlines will hereafter not be met with insults, threats, removals, or hostility.\n- Publicly affirm all of the above by way of updating Reddit\u2019s User Agreement and Reddit\u2019s Moderator Code of Conduct to include reasonable expectations and requirements for administrators\u2019 behavior. \n- Implement and fill a senior-level role (with decision-making and policy-shaping power) of \"Moderator Advocate\" at Reddit, with a required qualification for the position being robust experience as a volunteer Reddit moderator.\n\nReddit is unique amongst social-media sites in that its lifeblood \u2013 its multitude of moderators and contributors \u2013 consists entirely of volunteers. We populate and curate the platform\u2019s many communities, thereby providing a welcoming and engaging environment for all of its visitors. We receive little in the way of thanks for these efforts, but we frequently endure abuse, threats, attacks, and exposure to truly reprehensible media. Historically, we have trusted that Reddit\u2019s administrators have the best interests of the platform and its users (be they moderators, contributors, participants, or lurkers) at heart; that while Reddit may be a for-profit company, it nonetheless recognizes and appreciates the value that Redditors provide. \n\nThat trust has been all but entirely eroded\u2026 but we hope that together, we can begin to rebuild it.\n\nIn simplest terms, Reddit, we implore you: **Remember the human**. \n\nWe look forward to your response by Thursday, June 29th, 2023.\n\nThere\u2019s also just [one other thing](https://i.imgur.com/xLmTxcR.jpg).",
