DM us on social media or email us if interested. We are a SOF veteran owned company. Our instructors have decades of experience teaching firearms and medical, not just an operational background from military/government service.\n\nThis is an intermediate level course, students considering attending should have a firm enough grasp on the fundamentals they don\u2019t require attention from an instructor to go over the basics. Small pointers and tweaks are always okay, just nothing that would require a lot of one on one attention for the fundamentals. We run CCW classes every Saturday and will be offering more entry level courses in the near future. Those attending should already be able to demonstrate flawless firearms safety and have a good grasp on grip, stance, sight alignment/picture, trigger control, etc. This course will work beyond the fundamentals of shooting. Some skills we\u2019ll cover are how to utilize and properly shoot from cover/concealment, weapons transitions, engaging multiple targets, and shooting on the move."

One of the latter has been with the company for 18 years, great performer, earns his keep and then some, well liked, but he came in with some others for a townhall/training thing and was concealed carrying, one of the project admins noticed it was a pistol, clutched her pearls, and sent a 911 email to the entire world (top brass, building security, all the other admins, anyone she could think of) saying there was \"a man with a gun in the building\".  \n\nFast-forward, and HR informed him then and there of their \"zero tolerance\" policy on weapons (and there is actually proper signage on the building), and he was fired that day after almost two decades for being totally chill but carrying protection.",
