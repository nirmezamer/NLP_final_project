DM us on social media or email us if interested. We are a SOF veteran owned company. Our instructors have decades of experience teaching firearms and medical, not just an operational background from military/government service.\n\nThis is an intermediate level course, students considering attending should have a firm enough grasp on the fundamentals they dont require attention from an instructor to go over the basics. Small pointers and tweaks are always okay, just nothing that would require a lot of one on one attention for the fundamentals. We run CCW classes every Saturday and will be offering more entry level courses in the near future. Those attending should already be able to demonstrate flawless firearms safety and have a good grasp on grip, stance, sight alignment/picture, trigger control, etc. This course will work beyond the fundamentals of shooting. Some skills well cover are how to utilize and properly shoot from cover/concealment, weapons transitions, engaging multiple targets, and shooting on the move."
