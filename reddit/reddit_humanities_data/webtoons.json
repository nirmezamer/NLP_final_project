            "I used to hate daily pass but if you get free ads it's quicker to read. For example I read trapped on daily pass with 10 ads I think and I was able to finish it in a month. If it wasn't on daily pass it would've taken way longer.",
            "God of high school ran for 8yrs where people had to wait a week in between each chapter, plus any hiatus that might have happened.\n\nIt\u2019s still quicker to read it on daily pass.",
            "Eh, I see this complaint a lot and I just don\u2019t totally agree. At least you can read for free if you\u2019re patient. Plus, with ads now, you can get a lot more chapters for free each day. I think the discussion of fair payout to creators is a somewhat different topic, but at the end of the day, creators need monetization of some type. I don\u2019t mind watching ads, or being patient, or even using coins to read series I really enjoy. Other platforms require more monetary investment to enjoy stories, so I am okay with this model they\u2019ve chosen. I\u2019m sure many people here will disagree with me, but I just thought I would give my perspective!",
            "Daily pass is a free way of reading someone else\u2019s work. If you can\u2019t wait, you can purchase the chapters (usually for a discount for bill chapters). No one is entitled to free webtoons from anyone else.",
            "Eh. If it keeps the story up and available for free, I can\u2019t really complain. Artists have to make money off their work somehow. I just unlock like 10+ days of episodes, binge read them all at once, then wait until I\u2019ve stockpiled episodes again. \n  \nIt\u2019s more just annoying when I can\u2019t go back and look at an episode I\u2019ve read before if I want to look back for reference or whatever, but most of them have ads now, so it\u2019s not that bad.",
            "You get to read something someone has created for free. Be grateful",
            "daily pass ruined me for like 3 days bro. Spent the days watching at least 100+ ads (i think there was a special event that lets you watch 150 ads) for It\u2019s Mine. Kind of my fault for doing it but i feel like putting so many ads in a row is just horrible.\u00a0",
            "atleast it's better than fast pass because you can read it for free, some webtoons you can read like 10 chapters too. if you have multiple accounts, even better."
