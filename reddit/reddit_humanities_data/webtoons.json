            "Eh, I see this complaint a lot and I just dont totally agree. At least you can read for free if youre patient. Plus, with ads now, you can get a lot more chapters for free each day. I think the discussion of fair payout to creators is a somewhat different topic, but at the end of the day, creators need monetization of some type. I dont mind watching ads, or being patient, or even using coins to read series I really enjoy. Other platforms require more monetary investment to enjoy stories, so I am okay with this model theyve chosen. Im sure many people here will disagree with me, but I just thought I would give my perspective!",

            "daily pass ruined me for like 3 days bro. Spent the days watching at least 100+ ads (i think there was a special event that lets you watch 150 ads) for Its Mine. Kind of my fault for doing it but i feel like putting so many ads in a row is just horrible.",
            "Eh. If it keeps the story up and available for free, I cant really complain. Artists have to make money off their work somehow. I just unlock like 10+ days of episodes, binge read them all at once, then wait until Ive stockpiled episodes again. \n  \nIts more just annoying when I cant go back and look at an episode Ive read before if I want to look back for reference or whatever, but most of them have ads now, so its not that bad."
