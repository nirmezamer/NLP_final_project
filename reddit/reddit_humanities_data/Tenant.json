        "content": "For some context: my bf (21 m) and I (20 F) rent a room from our landlord in his house. We live in California. He has done a lot of illegal nonsense and caused a lot of problems but currently we can\u2019t move out because of our personal circumstances. \n\nMy landlord requires that we pay him in cash, it is written in the lease that we have to pay in cash. He has openly admitted that he has us pay him in cash because he doesn\u2019t report the income so that he doesn\u2019t have to pay taxes. According to California law (based on my limited understanding) he cannot require that we pay him in cash, but he says that because it\u2019s in the lease we have to. He always gives us written receipts after we pay him, but I just don\u2019t feel comfortable paying him cash and would rather just transfer him the money or give him a check. Can he really demand we pay cash? ",

            "Yep, u/sillyhaha is correct, I'm adding the code it's from below: \n\n>According to California Civil Code Section 1947.3,\u00a0**landlords in California are prohibited from demanding cash as the exclusive form of payment for rent or security deposit**.. Landlords must allow tenants to pay rent using at least one of these other options as well: check, cashier's check, or money order.",
            "OP, there is a law in CA requiring landlords toast rely on cash or other payment methods. There are exceptions, so please Google it. \n\nIt sounds like you are possibly renting a room. Is it monthly?  Do you have a lease?  Consider if this is worth making a fuss as you stated you aren\u2019t in position to find a mother rental at the moment. \n\nI suggest making sure you continue to get and save your rental receipts. Save them somewhere outside of the house to be safest.",

Thus, you cannot be required to pay in cash.\n\nAll LLs are required to be willing to accept a check, money order, or cashier\u2019s check.\n\nhttps://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/California-Tenants-Guide.pdf\n\nSee page 38\n\nEdit: photocopy page 38 for your LL.\n\nYour LL cannot retaliate because you stop paying in cash."

        "content": "I live in Brooklyn. My building is owned by New Park Management. My boyfriend and I live together and are currently out of town on vacation. My boyfriend\u2019s brother is watching our apartment and cats while we are away, for less than two weeks. He is not paying us and we are not paying him. Building manager found out and is accusing us of running an illegal sublet bc we did not notify him in advance of this. Is there any legal weight to this?\n\nThe building manager found out about this bc the brother left the keys inside the unit. The super refused to unlock the door, so I called the building manager and asked what to do. After accusing us of breaking the law, he suggested that they try to enter the unit via the fire escape via a neighbor\u2019s window. He successfully did this per the advice of the building manager, and then later found the super trying to enter the unit on his own (after refusing to help before). I\u2019m wondering if we could be in trouble and if we should seek legal counsel. Thanks",

There was no paint damage aside from nail holes when I moved in and when I moved out. No pets. I lived in the apartment for about 1 year 8 months. I know in California, normal wear and tear is not chargeable to the tenant.\n\nI'm looking for any and all advice on how I can fight this.

            "I would say repaint is only really necessary if you painted the walls or scratched them up a ton.  Think of it like if it was your place.  Would you repaint all the walls for a nail hole?  The judge will agree, but that means small claims.",

            "What he meant by \"actually entitled to repaint at your expense\" is that they are entitled to charging you for the repainting due to damages you caused.  \nSo, did you cause any damage that warrant a complete repainting?",
            "I just mean the cost is reasonable. I don't know if you should be charged or not, nor does my opinion really matter in that regard. However, personally it sounds like normal wear and tear but I have seen some pretty large holes made by nails or even thumb tacks."

It\u2019s our first month here, and we haven\u2019t even gotten to the next pay period. Or end of the 6th month lease. He raised it because the other couple in the house are paying more, but he never told us to pay their same amount. They found out how much we\u2019re paying, complained to him and now he raised our rent to make them feel better? He has all the tenants on the same piece of lease paper, so I assume they found out how much we are paying from that. Does this go against any laws, he never gave us notice on the raise of rent, he even told us he wasn\u2019t going to. And when he came to bring new lease papers he even asked if I can sign for my bf.
