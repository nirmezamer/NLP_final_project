        "content": "As you can see in the screenshot, the apartment management is charging me over $700 just for repainting. It's one of the older unrenovated apartments, but it's still a nice place. There was no paint damage aside from nail holes when I moved in and when I moved out. No pets. I lived in the apartment for about 1 year 8 months. I know in California, normal wear and tear is not chargeable to the tenant.\n\nI'm looking for any and all advice on how I can fight this. Any help and assistance is greatly appreciated and thank you in advance!",

            "I mean, what evidence do you have? Are they renovating the unit after you leave anyhow?\n\n*According to the HUD,* ***nail holes in the walls are considered normal wear and tear****. However, it's reasonable to classify large screw holes or multiple nail holes that cause damage to the paint or drywall as property damage.*\n\n***If the tenant has caused damage to the walls beyond normal wear and tear, the landlord may deduct the cost of repairs, including repainting, from the tenant's security deposit****. Examples of tenant-induced damage include excessive holes, large stains, or unauthorized painting.*",

            "In Ontario we pay $100 cash.",
            "You should only be charged for any patches and second coat of paint if you used candles/ smoked/ etc.",
            "I would say repaint is only really necessary if you painted the walls or scratched them up a ton.  Think of it like if it was your place.  Would you repaint all the walls for a nail hole?  The judge will agree, but that means small claims.",
            "If they are actually entitled to repaint at your expense, then $785 is a pretty good deal.",
            "The dispo doesn\u2019t say painting because of nail holes. It just says paint. \n\nCA has pretty consistent guidelines (not rules) on charging back to tenant on paint. 3 years to 5 years are acceptable life expectancy. \n\nYou were there about 1.5 years. If they had to repaint due to above wear and tear (marks on walls from furniture, kids coloring walls) then the prorate to repaint is what you owe. \n\nDid you get invoiced receipts? At the very least assuming you owe anything, it should be prorated. \n\nBut I can tell you labor costs are high.  Share the invoice. If you don\u2019t have one, ask for it.",
            "I took a thorough video after I cleared and cleaned the apartment. I even sent them the video and explained that I know what my rights are, etc. I write professional emails every day so it was very professional. Clearly they didn't care.\n\nI almost guarantee they are renovating it.",
            "I've looked through my lease, and nowhere does it say they are.",
            "I knew the paint lifespan would be an issue since I didn't spend long there. I don't have an invoice but I'm definitely going to ask for one. Thanks for that information."

        "content": "(AR, US) \nThis is gonna be a bit lengthy just so I can explain everything properly. Main question is: should I wait it out and give her time to pay me back or just nip it in the bud before any more problems arise?\n\nI\u2019ve been apartment searching for months, and have been looking for a roommate. One of my friends, who im not very close with, was also wanting to move out. We got accepted for a nice apartment, but I have paid for absolutely EVERYTHING. \n\nHer application fee, deposit, pro-rated rent, and im about to have to pay for electric and first month of rent by myself. Now, if I wanted to pay for everything, I would\u2019ve moved in somewhere by myself. The reason she can\u2019t pay is because she just started a new job and she gets paid every 2 weeks, and has to get car insurance + pay a phone bill + gas + food (me too bitch??)\n\nShe got her first check today, about $400. At first she offered to pay me $118 of this check out of the almost $800 she owes me!! But we realized the electric deposit would be $270 so she offered to just go ahead and pay her half of that. \n\nI have been trying to give her the benefit of the doubt but we aren\u2019t even fully moved in yet and she owes me almost a grand, not including the furniture I\u2019ve bought. She keeps telling me \u201cjust wait until I get settled into this job\u201d \u201cim good with my money don\u2019t worry\u201d \u201cI promise I\u2019ll pay you back\u201d but she won\u2019t be able to until July 27th, but by then next months rent will be due.\n\nI have another friend who I trust a lot more financially, and just in general who has offered to move in with me instead and pay me back for half of everything. Would i be an asshole if I took her off the lease and tried to get my friend added? \n\nI already signed a year lease with this girl, so im not sure what to do/ what I CAN do, all I know is she severely fucked me over already. The landlord is pretty nice and understanding, but im scared to bother him with this so early on. Also, what would I do about getting other girls name off the lease? Would that totally fuck her over?\n\nBefore anyone judges me for my poor choice in roommates, I know. But I was under the impression she was a lot more responsible financially and didn\u2019t know id be paying for everything myself. \n",
