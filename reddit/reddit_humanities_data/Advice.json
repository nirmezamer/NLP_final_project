Are they success-driven? Would they want you to continue with this university or consider this a sign you aren't ready for it? Would they cut you off? Would they pay for tutoring?\n\n\nBefore you come up with the correct way of telling them, you need to have a plan for going forward.",

I hope they\u2019ll understand.\n\nAnd if you dont want to go to that uni, tell them i couldnt give my best, and will not be able to do any better even if i try again, because its just not what i want.\nJust dont think too much and tell them.",

She always speaks about my future baby, referring to it as \\_\\_\\_\\_, but I really don't like that name, and I don't know how I'd feel about MY own baby having a name I didn't choose myself...considering that I'm the one that has to be pregnant. I feel as if I were to tell her no, she'd feel as if I betrayed her. I just don't want to be on bad terms with her considering everything she's done for me.

            "Your husband needs to shut this down, not you. Anything you do or say will just create problems. \n\nIt has nothing to do with liking the name choice or not, naming your child is a personal decision between the parents of said child.",

You wouldn't be betraying your mother in law- you don't owe her this no matter how much she talks about it. You *can* find a middle ground if you want, but you're not obligated to by any stretch of the imagination.       \n        \nAs far as how to tell her- directly, compassionately, and firmly. Honestly your partner should probably be doing most of this, or at least you should *both* do it, but either way she needs to understand that her *grand*daughter isn't the daughter she never had. Doesn't mean you don't want her to be a huge part of your daughter's life, she just needs to respect you and your partner's boundaries, same as any other relationship. Good luck!",
            "Something I\u2019ve noticed about our parents generation is that they allowed their parents to live vicariously through them because that\u2019s just \u201chow it was\u201d so they expect to be able to do the same thing with their children. They paid their dues to their parents, now they\u2019re owed (whether they realize it that literally or not).\n\nOne example we encountered was my MIL wanting to be at the hospital while I gave birth because both her mother and MIL were there when she did. \n\nIt can be really uncomfortable to be the one who is trying to break that cycle. Like others have mentioned, it really is up to your husband to handle this confrontation. A mother will always forgive her own child, but you\u2019re right in worrying that she may harbor resentment towards you over a conflict. If I\u2019m honest? Cross that bridge when you come to it. Don\u2019t even worry about having the conversation until you know you\u2019re going to have a baby girl. Otherwise it might all be a moot point. I get that it\u2019s frustrating to hear/deal with, but it will get easier to ignore over time. \n\nIf you\u2019re open to it as a middle name, maybe consider that. The tradition in my family is to have the middle name have family ties, but the first name belong totally to the child and be \u201cfor them\u201d. Just throwing it out there in case you like the sound of that idea. You\u2019re in no way obligated to use the name at all. \n\nYour MIL will already play a big part in any future daughter\u2019s life as their grandma - she doesn\u2019t need any mama responsibilities. Naming a baby is a parent thing, not a grandparent thing.",
            "You feel she'd feel betrayed. You are letting your feelings control your life long decisions and in this instance these feelings are not good guides. You're trying to reason with fear - your fear that your mother in law will be angry, will reject you or will feel hurt. Whatever she'll feel about your kids name is not your concern. You are not responsible for making her happy, for supporting her, for realising her dreams or helping her to deal with disappointment. It's her task and her friends'.",
            ">she's told me that she's always wanted a daughter named _____, but she only had boys.\n\nShe didn't have the chance to name her daughter, so she will take your chance to name your own daughter. Really !!",
            "Well don\u2019t you sound like some who doesn\u2019t like confrontation\u2026\n\nMuster up courage now to step up for your child and you and your parenting choices.\n\nYou don\u2019t like the name. You don\u2019t want to name your kid this name. Nor donuts want it as a pet name. \n\nThat you being pregnant doesn\u2019t mean she suddenly gets a vote. The grandparent title is granted to her by the mean that you respect her son enough to make a kid with him there are privileges to that title like they can be proud and are there to spoil the kid rotten. But that\u2019s about it. Unwanted advice or living vicariously through you or the kid is dead wrong at any given time. She shouldn\u2019t put her trauma of overly fantasizing about a baby girl and her name on you. She might suggest the name as one she thinks is gorgeous but that was about the span of it. Not the even rest of it. It\u2019s useless information anyway. It\u2019s secondary to its meaning. \n\nFor you. \nDo you like your MIL enough to appraise your kid with a name bound to her grandmother in that way. It will definitely create a bond between them. Is that what you wish for your kid. And what will happen if the kid does not live up to grandmas expectations or gets crushed by the anxiety to not displease grandma. \n\nThis is not just about the name. It bigger than the mame"

He is often very insistent that he still loves me even if the sex isn\u2019t great and he doesn\u2019t want me to feel embarrassed, but I\u2019m having a really hard time pleasing him in bed. Here are some things that he has been critical about: \n\n1. My facial expressions during sex are not flattering\u2014I have since been very mindful of my face and making sure I try to look attractive \n2. Not being vocal enough\u2014I have tried moaning more which didn\u2019t help because of point #3\u2026 \n3. I don\u2019t talk enough\u2014which I fixed by telling him how good he feels, which positions feel good, what spot to say in, when I feel like I\u2019m going to finish which didn\u2019t help because of point #4\u2026 \n4. I don\u2019t move enough. This one I really really struggle with. Like when I am in missionary I try kissing him (which he is not really into I have learned), try putting my legs around his shoulders, try pulling him in and moving him up and down against me where he usually pushes my hands off. When we are doggy style I literally just cannot force my body to move, some women may be able to relate but that position is just paralyzing to me but I am able to arch my back all the way! And when I am on top he doesn\u2019t like when I grind back and forth which is really the only way I finish, and doesn\u2019t like when I bounce up and down because he says it hurts. All in all he says I\u2019m not very \u201cgraceful\u201d. His ultimate criticism is that I am not \u201cworking with him enough\u201d and moving with him but I just can\u2019t figure out what that means because this brings me to point #5 \n5. I don\u2019t have rhythm he says. So when I try to rotate my hips against him or also move when we are in missionary or side lying he says that I am not moving right and ruining the flow. \n\nI truly am starting to feel bad and like everything I do is wrong in bed. He says that he loves me so much and that I shouldn\u2019t feel so ashamed but I really don\u2019t hear anything positive at all except for that I am attractive. There\u2019s been many criticisms from the beginning and I barely finish myself because I\u2019m so focused on making him happy. The only thing I know that I am good at is head which he doesn\u2019t let me do anymore because he wants sex to last longer. I\u2019m sure I do genuinely suck and want my partner to enjoy intimacy with me but it makes me feel genuinely inadequate. \n\nI genuinely wish there was like a tutorial or something, we were both virgins and I truly don\u2019t have experience. I feel like I\u2019ll never live up to his expectations and really need advice. I know some comments may say to not stay with him if he makes me feel this way but that is not an option for me right now. Sex tips are so appreciated, thank you! ",

            "Heres a sex tip:\nI recommend you both read \"she comes first\". You'll get lots of tips for yourself, and he'll learn that life isn't like a porn movie and if he wants great sex, criticizing what kind of facial expression you have. Like good lord. How's he some kind of expert with his one sexual partner who he can't even satisfy?!\n\nSeriously. If my partner said those kind of things, I'd never have sex with them again. I was lucky enough to have my first partner set a high bar - he always made me feel beautiful and sexy and thus, the sex was amazing. Rest of the relationship was a hot mess. But the SEX! \n\nThe thing is: it's not about the sex per se. It's about how your partner treats you in a vulnerable moment that's supposed to bring you closer. He criticizes you constantly, and none of those criticisms have anything to do with making it better with you. So, in this vulnerable moment, he's orgasming every time, and you're not because you're worried (understandably) about what expression is on your face. Like if it's that much of a problem, he could close his eyes and make you come like crazy. I'm not going to say leave him. But use this as important info about who he is as a person.",
            "Your fianc\u00e9 sounds like a piece of shit. My advice, try again.",
            "This guy is a shitty lover. You're not the problem here. You don't suck at sex. He does, and he has absolutely no concern for anything but turning you into a personal porn star. \n\nI'm sorry you've given two years to this waste of space and have been so beaten down that you actually think it's reasonable for him to treat you like this.\n\nETA: If you feel like being gracious to him and want to try to make this work, I think at this point you need to go nuclear. \n\nHe obviously thinks his behavior is perfectly fine, so you need to stop coddling and accommodating it. Tell him straight up that if he continues this behavior the relationship will ultimately end. You will no longer accept criticism during sex and if he opens his mouth and a criticism falls out, you will hop right back out of bed and go do something nice for yourself. *Follow through on this.* Even if it means sex stops seconds in. Even if it means sex stops seconds before he cums. Even if it means he gets upset. *Stop allowing him to treat you like this.* \n\nInsist on seeing a sex therapist as a couple. Make sure you are in therapy yourself because you need to develop a sense of self that isn't built on his approval. \n\nI cannot emphasize this enough: \n\nTHIS IS NOT HOW SEX GOES IN A HEALTHY, LOVING RELATIONSHIP. \n\nGOOD LOVERS DO NOT BEHAVE THE WAY HE BEHAVES. \n\n\nYOU ABSOLUTELY DO NOT DESERVE TO BE TREATED LIKE THIS."
