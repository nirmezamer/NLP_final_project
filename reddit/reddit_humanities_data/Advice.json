It ended amicably. \n\nMy best friend and i have recently noticed a change in behavior from him. We\u2019ve noticed that he has been extremely touchy in the past month. For example, we went camping, we shared a tent, and slept on a queen inflatable. We all had our own sleeping bag and on the second night, he slept hugging my best friends bare legs (she was wearing shorts). \n\nFast forward Today, we had a pool day! All was well until my sibling left the pool and went home. It was just the three of us. In that time, we noticed a shift in his personality. We noticed that he was grabbing us, hugging us, throwing us around, and pulling my best friends hair, touching my legs/and face, rubbing faces with me, whispering in my friends ear, and staring at our racks! \n\nNow, we understand this might be normal? Maybe it is or maybe it isn\u2019t. I felt something poking my back at some point though. Is he trying to have a challengers moment? \n\nYes, me and him have history but i think it\u2019s weird that he is trying to get at my friend too. He even left a couple bruises on my friend from playing around too much.\n\n Are we overthinking this? Is this all in our heads or is this actually happening? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

There was a knock at the door that I had to answer so I made the mistake of quickly handing my mum the phone so she could swipe through them herself. \n\nAs I came back into the room, I heard my mum go \u201cOh wow\u2026\u201d When I asked what it was, she smirked and turned the phone around to show an NSFW picture of my boyfriend from a couple of weeks age. \u201cAren\u2019t you the lucky one?\u201d (My boyfriend is well endowed).\n\nObviously I was super embarrassed and swiped the phone out of her hand as fast as I could. My mum just laughed. She likes to tease and make jokes about things, which is what\u2019s got me worried that she\u2019ll say something the next time she sees him. So now I\u2019m left wondering, do I warn my boyfriend that my mum has seen his goods (and is likely going to make a crack about it)? Or do I just pretend it never happened and hope for the best?\n\nWhat is the best way of dealing with this? ",

His reaction obviously hurt my feelings and I was explaining why. He apologized and said this is exactly why he hates gifts and would\u2019ve appreciated being \u201csurprised\u201d by a gift. \n\n I put a great deal of effort into getting him things that I thought he would love and was excited to give him his gifts but his reaction left me confused, hurt and feeling rejected. \n\n\nAm I being dramatic or is he being ungrateful? \n\n\nEdit: thank you for all your comments.

My older brother moved away for college so he\u2019s been staying in his spare room. These days it\u2019s really hot and humid at night in my country. The only rooms with AC in my house belong to me and my parents. \n\nSo recently my uncle asked me if I\u2019d mind if we share a room. I agreed only on the condition that he sleeps separately on a mattress and not on my bed (simply because I\u2019m not comfortable sharing a bed with a grown man). He disagreed saying that I should let him sleep on the same bed because he\u2019s family and not a stranger. Majority of my family members did take his side and told me I\u2019m disrespecting my elders. I definitely get where they are coming from. But Ever since then he\u2019s been acting a little weird. For example two days I woke up to this man staring at me or touching my forehead. One day he even bragged about how he came to my room at night , kissed me on my forehead and left.  I mean nothing about this is wildly inappropriate and I have no idea if the last sentence even happened or not because I was asleep. But the idea of him even staying in the same room  as me has increasingly become very creepy for me.",

            "The majority of sexual abuse is from family members. This is 100 percent preditory behavior. Absolutely stand up for yourself regardless of his age. You have a right to say you are uncomfortable with this. Honestly if your family is that blind. My advice is let him have the whole fucking room and go sleep somewhere else. I dont know what country your in but if you are legally considered an adult at 18 then I would try to leave that house as soon as possible for you. Clearly your family isn't protecting you. If he touches you CALL THE COPS. YELL, KICK, PUNCH, SCREAM! If he is willing to hurt you in the most devastating way someone can hurt another person, then you have the right to destroy the family and yell it from the roof. Dont stay silent. I feel like in these situations young people dont know how to speak up because they are afraid or they dont realize till way later that it was abuse. DONT BE SILENT",

An adult year old should never be sleeping with a 17 year old. Especially not some fucking creepy uncle which just adds to the situation. Definitely buy a lock for your door and put them in yourself if you have too.",
            "Sleep on the floor in your parents room and continue to loudly accuse him of being creepy to anyone who will listen. If he takes over your room fuck it but you cannot be alone with him any longer. Keep asking your parents if theyre going to take his side when he assaults you. Raise holy living hell anytime he is near you. The only way you get out of this as of now is raising a huge stink about it. Do not take any food or drink offered by him.",
