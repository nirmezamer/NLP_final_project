        "content": "This is a quest i ran for a group of level 13 character. It lasted 4 hour for me, but the duration of the quest will vary greatly depending on how the party behave, so beware.\n\n**~Synopsis.~**\n\nThere is a spike in undead activity in Bloodleaf Valley. Undeads and night creatures are emerging from the forest, attacking small farms and innocent travelers.  \nThe burgmeister Anduin, mayor of the city of RedAmber and the surrounding villages, wants to start a campaign to purge the forest from this evil. His scout have noticed the ruins of an old castle, located deep within the forest. It has become the lair of a powerful pack of werewolves, whom the baron thinks are responsible for the all this and he will hire the party to clean up the place.\n\n**~Context\u00a0:~**  \n***~-The Moon Curse.~***\n\nTwo centuries ago, the Bloodleaf Valley was a deadly forest filled to the brim with undead and monstrosity of all kind. The ruler of this place was a vampire count, a violent warlord cursed with an eternal thrist for blood and murder.  \nHis evil deeds eventually brought the attention of an order of paladins, the Moon Watchers, servant of the goddess Selune. With the blessing of their goddess, they launched an holy crusade against him and his armies of the night.  \nThe war was succesfull at first, but eventually turned into a bloody stalemate. Realising they could not hope to beat the Beast with the power of light alone, they decided to dive into the dark side of their mistress.  \nA ritual was held on a full moon, granting them the power of lycanthropy. This moon magic gave them the power to overwhelm the vampires, but it came at a terrible price: they were now werewolves, cursed with a feral hunger that made them unfit for life in a civilised society.\n\nRealising there was no going back for them, they made a deal with the authorities of the newly liberated valley. They would remain in the forest, and protect the realm from the shadow. As a secret order of werepaladin dedicated solely to the war against undeads in general, and vampire in particular.\n\nThose werewolves are the one the party is supposed to kill. They now live inside the very castle of their defeated foe. Over time, they have evolved from a strict order of paladin to a more diverse group of monster hunter.\n\n***~-Those bloody politician~***\n\nThe Burgmeister has betrayed the Moonwatchers, and is now working for the vampires.  \nHe was elected on the promise that he would lower the taxes, but failed to reduce spending in any meaningfull way, thus creating a massive debt his citizens will eventually have to pay off. Upon realising this, he was given a choice\u00a0:  \n-Tell the truce, increase the tax to restaure the budget balance, and look like an incompetent fool.  \n-Sell his souls to the Nine Hells to get re elected  \nNow that he has become an Infernalist, he serves the interest of the vampire lady Andromeda Solomon. She is the one actually responsible for the increase in undead attack.  \n  \nHer plan is to pit the party against the Moon Watcher, and then kill whoever emerge victorious. To prevent the party from realising the werewolves are actually nice, she made sure to give them the mission during a full moon, when the curse of lycanthropy is at it's peak and the werewolves are struggling with their animalistic side.  \n\n\n**Chapter 1\u00a0: At the manor**  \n  \n*recommanded theme\u00a0: Dark Vampire Music - The Vampire Masquerade | Waltz Music \u2013 by Peter Grundy*\n\n\n\nThe quest begins with an invitation from the Burgmeister. Should the party accept, they will enter his manor, and meet the nobility of the town, who is very eager to meet such high-level team of adventurer.  \nThere are 20 guest at the banquet. Ten of them are actually Vampire Spawn created by Ursulla. The rest of them are just regular infernalist Noblemen. All of them are in on the Burgmeister\u2019s plot.  \n  \nImportant note\u00a0: If there is a paladin inside the group, all the vampire will skip the dinner, to avoid being spotted by a divine sense.  \n  \nThe crowd will do everything they can to get on the party\u2019s good side, from compliment to straight-up flattery. If Ursulla is part of the crowd, she will appear disguised as charming young woman, and flirt with the party member of higher charisma.  \n  \nAt some point, the mayor will tell the party about the reocurring undead attack, and tell them it is linked with a pack of werewolves who lives in the forest. He will ask them to deal with it, and fast, for he fears the werewolves might be preparing something.  \nA great reward will be offered if they agree to this  \n  \nThe party will be offered to sleep in the manor for the night. During the night, one of the party member will have nightmare about being chased off by monstruous werewolf, coupled with some a few wolf-related bad omens. Those nightmare are made by Andromeda, to manipulate the party even further  \n  \n**Optionnal chapter\u00a0:The Town**  \n  \n*Recommanded music\u00a0:Celtic Music - Where I Belong \u2013 adrian von ziegler*\n\nAfter living the manor, the party can chose to investigate the town.  \nRed Amber is a human town, with a small minority of halfling. Her economy is dedicated to the harvesting of wheat and grapes, which is used to make a famous red wine.  \nThe population does not know the truth about the Moon Watchers, but there are a lot of rumours and contradicting legends. If they ask the townsfolk, they will recieve some tales and story about those werewolves who dwell in the forest. Each tale has a 75\u00a0% chance of being negative, painting the werewolves as dangerous monster you should avoid, and 25\u00a0% chance of being positive, painting them instead as mysterious benevolent creatures who should be left alone.  \nGoing into the city and inquiring with the townfolk about that should take about an hour in RP  \n  \nIf they investigate the archive/local library for long enough (1 hour), the party will be able to establish that\u00a0:  \n-the werewolves have been here for centuries (If investigation check goes above 10)  \n-While existing, the werewolves attack have been extremely rare, and the victims were 99\u00a0% o fthe time foolish teenagers who ventured too deep into the forest. (If investigation check goes above 15)  \n-The authorities have never done anything to drive off the werewolves, up until today (If investigation check goes above 20)  \n  \n  \n**Chapter 2\u00a0:The forest**  \n  \n*recommanded theme\u00a0:Enclosed Forest | Eerie Fauna, Creepy Noises, Nighttime Ambience | 3 Hours*\n\nThe travel towards the keep is going to be long. The big question about this part is\u00a0: can the party make it before nightfall\u00a0?  \n  \n-If they manage to reach the keep in time, they will arrive before the curse of the full moon reach it\u2019s peak, and the werewolves are going to be easier to deal with. (-3 on the difficulty of every social check+  \n  \n-If they do not manage that, the party will have to face the werewolves at the peak of their madness, thus complicating the mission.  \n  \nIt takes eight hour to reach the keep. The party leave the manor at 8AM, and the sun will go down at 7 PM, meaning they have 11 hour to make [it.As](http://it.As) they venture into the forest, one of the party member must take the leas make a Survival check DD15, or the party will get lost for an hour. At the end of the hour, a new check can be made, and so on and so forth, until the leader find the correct path towards the keep.  \nChoosing to move with discretion across the forest should slow down the party by about an hour, but will allow the party to avoid all random encounter. If they move normally, the party will have to face 1d4-2 random encounter  \nAfter five hour of travel, all party member with a proficiency in perception must make a perception check DD15. If there is a success, they will notice something strange in the distance, and can choose to investigate.  \nIf they investigate, they will discover the remnants of a fight between a bunch of undead and a Moon Watcher\u00a0: dead bodies of Ghouls and Zombies laying of the ground. Their leader, a Vampire Spawn, lies dead as well, with a wooden stick planted in his heart.  \n  \nRandom encounter\u00a0:  \nLed by Ursulla, the vampires have returned , and despite the best effort of the Moon Watchers, their numbers are soaring. Consequently, the party may be subject to some attack on their way towards the keep.  \nLaunch a d6\u00a0:  \n1 \u2013 a group of Zombie, led by two Zombie Plague Speaders. They used to be woodsmen, but were zombified after drinking the water of a corrupted pond.  \n2 \u2013 a patrol of skelleton warrior, led by a skelleton captain. They used to be servant of the old vampire lord. Their leader still carries the banner of his master.  \n3 \u2013 a couple of Vampire Spawn, who live in a cabin in the wood with their three children, also vampirised. The family will act friendly, but attack the party if they ever let their guard down.  \n4 \u2013 An Undead Tree, with body hanging from every branch. At the start of each turn, the tree will drop 1d4 body on the ground, who will immediately become zombi.  \n5 \u2013 a group of Shadows, led by a Shadow Demon. They will only attack if the party is still in the forest after 7PM  \n6 \u2013 A group of Nine Hells Cult Fanatic, holding a ritual to summon the forces of their master in prevision of tonights battle. If the party does not kill half the cultist during the first turn, two Bone Devil will join the fight.  \n  \n**Chapter 3 : Reaching the keep**  \n  \nThere are three different ways the plot can go for the party when they reach the keep.  \n  \n- For various reason, the party is suspicious of the Burgmeister and does not believes his lies anymore. They will immeditaly attempt to to negociate, and will be able to forge an alliance with the werewolves. Seeing this, Ursulla will panick and launch a desperate surprise attack on the keep  \n  \n- The party still thinks the werewolves are evil, and will start killing them. But in every new room they clear, evidence of the truth can be found, so they eventually realise they are attacking the wrong people.  \n  \n-The party kills every werewolf in the keep.  \n  \nEach encounter and room the party will meet has a clue about the peacefull nature of the werewolves.  \nThere are two different ways to befriend the werewolves. The party can try to appeal to what remain of their consciouness, with a persuasion check, or try to get in touch with their animalistic side with an Animal Handling check.  \nImportant Note\u00a0: Due to the specifity of their curse, those werewolves are a special breed. They are bigger, but do not have the immunity to non-magical damage, it is replaced by a simple resistance.  \n  \n  \n**The Moon Watcher\u2019s Keep**  \n  \n*recommanded theme\u00a0:* Ruined Castle | Haunted Or Not ? Ambience\n\nThe Keep was built on a cliff, but it is nothing more than an old ruin at this point. The Moon Watchers are too feral to care about reparation, so it is in a state of utter disrepair, but it is their home anyway. The southern gates lay shattered on the ground, the walls have crumbled in severeal point, and there is only a single Watchtower still standing, on the northen side of the keep  \nThe party arrive from the east. There are essentially two ways to enter the keep\u00a0: through the main gate, or by escalating the crumbling walls  \n  \n***1) The southern gates***  \n  \n*Recommanded battle theme: Curse of the Werewolf \u2013 Timeless Miracle*Brother   \n  \nMathias and Sister Lucia are standing in front of the southern entrance. Amongst the Order, they are considered to the most level-headed ones, and are very good at controlling themselves during the full moon. Their duty is to keep watch, and scare away any fool who may be tempted to enter the keep. As soon as they see someone, they will growl at them to scare them away. They are, however, still curses, and will eventually attack if the party does not back away or find a way to calm them.  \nThey have the statblock of a Werebear with max HP, and they both carry warhammers. They have the ability to use the *divine smite* ability 3 times per day  \n  \n  \n***2) The walls and the watchtower***  \n  \nRecommanded battle theme\u00a0: Killer with the cross - Powerwolf  \n  \n  \nBrother Maxim is patrolling the walls with a heavy crossbow in her hands while the Sister Alexa does the same from the top of her watchtower. Their duty is to protect the northen side of the keep. Unlike the Moon Watchers at the entrance, they have not been chosen for their curse resistance, but rather for their keen eyes and ability to spot an undead attack from afar. There will be no warning shot from them. If the party attemps to climb the wall, they will get shot at immediately, and they will cound the alarm.  \nThey both have a Weretiger statblock,with max HP and an ability to place a Hunter\u2019s Mark on someone, once per day  \n  \n  \n***3) The courtyard.***  \n  \nInitiate Emilia, Andreos and Helios are in the courtyard, eating the remains of a deer they hunted down earlier this day. They all have a Werewolf Stablock with max HP and a +3 proficiency bonus, and will rush to help whoever sound the alarm. They fight with their claws and bite.  \n  \n***4) The Great Throne Room***  \n  \nThis place has become the Wall of Fame of the Moon Watchers. Everytime a powerful undead foe is slain, his head is mounted on a spike and planted there. At first glance, they are just human head mounted on spike, but a DD12 investigation check will reveal most of them are vampire.  \n  \n  \n***5) Alchemist Tower***  \n  \n*Recommanded Battle theme\u00a0: Sanctified with Dynamite \u2013 Powerwolf.*  \n  \nAt the top of this shattered tower stands Brother Dynamite and a bunch of alchemical equipement.  \nHe has a Werebear Statblock with Max HP, and he carries around an experimental Flamethrower. This unstable magical object can cast the spell Burning Hand at level 1, ten times per Day.  \n  \n***6)The Dungeons Cells.***  \n  \n*Recommanded Battle Theme\u00a0: Full Moon \u2013 Timeless Miracle*  \n  \nThe most unstable werewolves are locked here by the Order every full moon, under the watch of Sister Silence. In each of the four cell lies an Initiate driven mad by the Full Moon. They can not be befriended through any means the party may employ.  \n  \nSister Silence has a Weretiger statblock with max XP, Blindsight and the ability to cast Darkness on herself, 3 times per day. She has 4d6 Sneak attack damage.  \n  \n***7) The Chapel of Selune.***  \n  \n  \n*Recommanded Battle Theme\u00a0: Amen and attack - Powerwolf*\n\nThe*Grand MasterThiess von Kaltenbrun* is praying there, in front of a statue of Selune.  \nThe Grand Master has complete control over his inner wolf and is unaffected by the full moon. Unlike all his brethren, he is able to speak, reason and argue. If he notices the party, he will try to negotiate with them, telling them the history of the Moonwatchers, even if the party killed the other Moonwatchers, for he can see this is another trickery from his vampirix foes.  \n  \nHe has the Statblock of a Werewolf Pack Lord with max HP . He fight with a greatsword and can use 3 level 2 divine smite per days.  \nAs a bonus action, he can use a concentration spell to summon from the Feyworld a Black Unicorn named Luna. He will ride her into battle if the necessity arise.  \n  \n*8) The rest of the keep.*  \nThe keep contains a lot of other rooms such as a kitchen, throne room, library, ect...Add as many as you want. 1D4-2 Initiate are present inside each room.  \n  \n**Ursulla von Bloddensmirk.**  \n  \nThe lady vampire has been following the party with her army of the night. She is monitoring their progress via a divination spell. Five minute after she sees the fighting has stopped, either from a lack of ennemy or because the party has realised the trick, she will launch the attack and attempt to overwhelm the defender Fighting will immediately broke out in every room, and the party will have to either flee, or clear up the keep from the undead menace.  \n  \nThe attack will come simultaneously from multiple direction.  \n  \n-The Southern Gate will be attacked by a group of zombie, cultist or skelleton, led by a vampire  \n  \n-The northen wall will be attacked by a squad of Vampire Spawn who are trying to climb the wall They are led by a vampire.  \n  \n-Swarms of giant bats led by a vampire turned bat have entered the keep  \n  \n-a group of shadow led by a vampire disguised as a shadow demon are attacking the dungeon cells  \n  \n-Ursulla herself will be inside the great hall with a bunch of vampire spawn she uses as bodyguard. She has the stablock of a vampire mage  \n  \nThe party will have to fight alongside the werewolves to win. The battle ends with the death of 4 vampire. Ursulla count for 2 vampire. The remaining survivor will retreat and scatter after this defeat. If the party has killed all the werewolves, they will probably have to flee to survive the army of the night.  \n  \n",

Recent lumberjack deaths and dark magical rumors deter Glida from venturing herself. As the heroes delve into the woods, they will uncover an ancient temple and face a malevolent druid who is seeking its power.\n\n**GLIDA DIERORCH**\n\nGlida accompanies the PCs but will hide during fights. When she finds the plant she is looking for in the temple, she will ask the heroes to help her investigate the temple, as its magical power is responsible for the properties of the plant.\n\n**FOREST ORIENTATION**\n\nPlayers will need to navigate through the forest, so the DM should notify them at each crossroads to decide which direction they want to go.\n\nSurvival and perception checks may give the players relevant information about the paths.\n\n**D4 RANDOM TREASURE**\n\n1. 1d6 Random seeds\n2. 1d4 Mushrooms\n3. 1d4 Goodberries\n4. 1d4 Random nuts\n\n**FINAL REWARD**\n\nHeroes will get a ring of animal influence, which has 3 daily charges for casting the following spells:\n\nAnimal friendship (DC 13)\n\nFear (DC 13)\n\nSpeak with animals\n\n# Enemies\n\n**TWISTED VINE**\n\nA vine plant corrupted by dark magic, entwines around the limbs of the unaware.\n\n(HP:12; AC:14; SP:20\u2019; XP:25)\n\n(STR:12; DEX:8; CON:6; INT:1; WIS:7; CHA:1)\n\n(ATT: Lash: +6 | 1d6+1)\n\nEntwine: The vine can try to immobilize a medium-sized creature, this can be avoided with a DC 17 DEX saving throw. Trapped creatures can free themselves by succeeding on a DC 15 CON saving throw.\n\n**CORRUPTED ENT**\n\nAn ancient Ent dominated by Malakars domination dark spell.\n\n(HP:138; AC:16; SP:30\u2019; XP:3000)\n\n(STR:23; DEX:8; CON:21; INT:1; WIS:16; CHA:1)\n\n(ATT: Hit: +10 | 3d6+6)\n\n(ATT: Throwing rock: +10 | 4d10+6)\n\nRange 60/180 ft, affects one creature.\n\nControlled: The Ent lacks willpower and only acts as a Malakars puppet, attacking anyone that try to reach or harm the druid. Players can end the spell if they kill Malakar or successfully cast Remove Curse on the Ent. In that case, the Ent will immediately attack Malakar if he\u2019s still alive.\n\n**MALAKAR, THE GREEN SHADOW**\n\nThe evil druid who pursues the power of the temple.

It lasts the entire combat.\n\nLocust Swarm: A locust 10 ft swarm surrounds and attacks any living prey it encounters. A swarm deals 2d6 points of damage to any creature whose space it occupies at the end of its move.\n\n# The Forest\n\n**1. FOUNTAIN:**\n\nSeveral houses, now in ruins, surround a magnificent stone and bronze fountain. The fountain is filled with water and crowned by a statue of a woman holding a large empty jar. If the characters fill her jar, the fountain will activate, opening a compartment containing one of the three magical runes.\n\nIf the players decide to explore the houses, 1d4 twisted vines will sprout from the ground, attacking them immediately.\n\n**2. INTACT HOUSE:**\n\nA house that, unlike all others in this forest, remains in perfect condition despite the passage of time.\n\nInside, various supplies, 2d8 GP, and an ancient tome detailing the presence of ents in this forest can be found.\n\n**3.MALAKAR\u2019S CAMP:**\n\nAt first glance, nothing is visible as the camp is hidden by a concealment spell. However, if they venture down the path, the spell\u2019s effect will dissipate.

TEMPLE:**\n\nAn ancient hexagonal structure made of massive slabs of granite and marble stands gloomy but still imposingly among the trees. The temple is filled with a strange plant with purple flowers.\n\nBetween its columns and up a staircase, there are three altars with slots for magical runes. If all three runes are placed, the power of the temple will activate, revealing its secrets.\n\n**5. RUINED MENHIR:**\n\nA small muddy clearing with a tiny village built around a large menhir.

Chances are, if you're reading this, you've played in games where these questions have at least been raised in passing.\n\nI'm not saying I want to excise this complexity from the game entirely: it certainly has its place. I just don't want the burden laid at my conscience every time I pick up a set of dice for a bit of escapism. If only there was a way to encourage players to be kind and leave a positive impact on the world, while adhering to D&D's core gameplay mechanic of remorselessly slicing through hordes of dark creatures for loot. If only...\n\n# What are Dark Goblins?\n\nDark goblins share the stats of normal goblins in pretty much every respect (unless, of course, you have decided that they're distinct). Dark goblins aren't biological in the same way that regular D&D goblins are, in that they're born of goblin parents, nor are they twisted versions of other species like elves, in that classical Tolkienian goblin sense. Dark goblins are genderless, fiend-adjacent creatures from the plane of Acheron, formed of shadow magic and latent energy from the wicked, malicious, spiteful feelings and actions of every sentient creature in the multiverse.\n\nAcheron is home to the divine goblin realm known as Clangor. Some religions preach that Clangor is where all greedy, mean and mischievious thoughts come from, extending outwards from Clangor to touch every corner of every plane. Whether or not that's true is up for debate, but one thing is certain: whenever there is war, or a population begins to shift from being kind to just plain mean to each other, goblins are never far away. They seem to be drawn to conflict like moths to flames, gathering in groups to create more mischief, fanning the flames of strife - which eventually begets more goblins.\n\nThey'll quite happily work for hire for a more intelligent master, which satisfies their greed for gold and gems while causing all manner of problems. They dissolve back into shadow magic on death, which crawls away into any crack or crevice it can find to await eventual reformation. To reform, these shadows need to be close to a creature or community full of malicious thoughts and deeds.\n\nDark goblins are the Hand from Marvel, the Foot clan from *TMNT*, the Putty Patrol from *Power Rangers* and the Heartless from *Kingdom Hearts*: creatures not of flesh and blood that delight in sneaky, underhanded, five-on-one hit-and-run combat. No moral quandaries about burning down goblin camps here: unrelenting and unrepentant, players can scythe through dens of goblins with zero moral quandaries as they burst into shadowy smoke.\n\nThis has a very nice implication for world consequences, that adheres quite well to the Saturday morning cartoon-esque idea of evil henchmen disappearing in a puff of black smoke on defeat. If goblins form, or are drawn to, times and places where people are nasty to one another, the only true way to permanently end the goblin threat is for the players to create a world in which it's easier to be kind to one another than mean. Acts of kindness are antithetical to a dark goblin's existence: after removing the initial goblin threat, leaving a place better than you found it might be the only way to ensure they never come back.\n\n# Running Dark Goblins\n\nWhat does this mean in practical terms? Dark goblins are both problem and symptom. A single low-level adventure might be clearing a gang of goblin thieves from the city's sewers, but you might also have a goblin clan stealing stuff from around town, burning down taverns and blaming their misdeeds on two rival factions, exacerbating the tensions that drew the goblins there in the first place. In this way, parties can both work towards a peaceful resolution between the two local factions, and have a dungeon full of goblin mooks to hack-and-slash their way through guilt-free.\n\nIn combat, dark goblins are full of mischief and spite, sliding 10-15% towards the \"Tucker's Kobolds\" or \"ninja\" archetypes. They make use of traps, hidey-holes, darkness and smoke to catch their enemies unawares. Swathed in black and wielding curved swords, they'll spring on a party unawares, perhaps trying to steal the wizard's staff instead going in for a slash, or one might trip up the paladin so two others can attack with advantage.\n\nTolkien's goblins delight in explosions and invention, and dark goblins echo this by using their bonus action Hide in conjunction with smokesticks, poison darts and simple fire-based traps. Steal your players\u2019 magic swords from their scabbards and cut the straps on their Bags of Holding: be really, really annoying, in essence, and play up the mischief angle. When defeated, the goblins burst into black smoke, the shadow-stuff crawling out of their empty rags towards corners, cracks and crevices.\n\nThere are also mechanical implications toward \"killing them with kindness\". Spending an afternoon helping the poor tavern owner rebuild after a fire caused by dark goblins (you could even run the fire itself as a [natural hazard](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/1dejgsd/an_update_to_an_old_post_treating_natural_hazards/)) could be considered XP or treasure-worthy, as it's ultimately working towards the party's goal of ending a goblin incursion. You could even do a skill challenge here: the bard could make a persuasion check to get the other townsfolk helping, while the barbarian could focus on athletics to hoist the biggest beams himself.\u00a0\n\nKeep a tracker of intentional kind deeds and successful skill checks - you could hide it from the PCs, or choose not to - and declare the goblins vanquished (for now) after a certain number of good deeds and successes. If the party makes an effort to lift up the community, foster attitudes of kindness among townsfolk and broker deals with warring factions, the goblins will stay away. This is a good opportunity to introduce fetch-quests and have high-level players use their powers for good - for example, using *Plant Growth* or weather control spells to ensure a better harvest to stop two factions competing over scarce resources.\u00a0\n\nIf you're looking for a \"nice\" PG-13 game with the tone of *Legend of Zelda*, you could certainly do worse than using dark goblins. Link doesn\u2019t slice his way through bone and sinew, or murderize baby goblins. Dark goblins are a gang of mooks that make a special effort to be annoying at every turn, have an additional layer of complexity, but still engage with the game\u2019s basic tenets. They also come with built-in incentives to reward behaviour and attitudes of kindness, compassion and community towards your NPCs.",

        "content": "Over the past couple of months in my current game I have been playtesting some new mechanics for players to train during their downtime (I try to give a lot of options for downtime as mini games between sessions). Have been playtesting these with just 1 character in the group before rolling this out to the entire group.\n\nI wanted to reach out to the community also to see if I could get any advice over these and whether you felt the balance was correct on these. I have given examples of the skills attained by the play test character; level 6 echo knight fighter.\n\n**Personal Training Rules**\n\nAs part of downtime you can spend time training and honing your skills. This can be done by yourself, or with a skilled trainer in the discipline you are looking to train. Each time you train you will earn progress points against the discipline you are training. On hitting milestones along that training path you will gain new skills or benefits specific to your character and their fighting styles.\n\n\u00a0There are 3 disciplines in which you can train;\n\n\u00a0**Attack focused Skills**- Training in this area will be focused around you primary attacks be that weapons attacks for martial classes, spell attacks for casters and a mix of both of combined classes. Checks to earn progress points in this training discipline will be made with your primary attack stat; eg Strength/Dex for most martial classes, and spell modifier stat for other classes.\n\n\u00a0**Defensive Skills**- Training in this area will be focused around you primary defensive stat be that constitution for more tank orientated characters, evasion for more dexterity based characters or defensive spells for . Checks to earn progress points in this training discipline will be made with your primary defence stat.\n\n\u00a0**Special Skills**- Training in this area will be focused on augmenting the abilities associated with your character's sub classes, for those multiclassing you will receive options for each of your multiclass. Checks in this area may differ based on the flavour of these subclasses.\n\n\u00a0**Progress points** - The number of progress point required in each discipline to acquire a new skills/ability will increase with each acquired skill, an increase in the DC to attain progress on that training pathway will also increase with each skill acquired. This means at higher levels of skill, the benefits that skilled trainers bring are an necessity.\n\n\u00a0**Trainers**- Throughout the world you may be able to identify training masters who will be able to assist you with training as part of your downtime, and will have a range of effects from reducing the DC of the training checks, boosting the amount of progress that can be made or giving access to particularly powerful skills that can be gained from this specific trainer only. Most trainers will exchange there services for gold, but others may need more to secure their services and share their secrets.\n\n\u2022Level 1 skill\u20223 progress points required \u2022DC 10 1 progress point, DC 14 2 progress points, DC 18 3 progress points\n\n\u2022Level 2 Skill\u20225 progress points required \u2022DC 12 1 progress point, DC 16 2 progress points, DC 20 3 progress points\u2022\n\n\u2022Level 3 skill\u20227 progress points required \u2022DC 14 1 progress point, DC 18 2 progress points, DC 22 3 progress points\n\n\u2022Level 4 Skill\u20229 progress points required \u2022DC 16 1 progress point, DC 20 2 progress points, DC 24 3 progress points\n\n\u2022Level 5 Skill\u202212 progress points required \u2022DC 18 1 progress point, DC 22 2 progress points, DC 26 3 progress points\n\nTraining in this manner will use up 1 primary activity as part of your downtime, and will be equal to 1 attempt to make progress against your chosen discipline.\n\nUpon completing a skill milestone you will be provided with 3 options for skills which you may choose from, allowing for a greater level of customisation for your character.\n\nExamples of skills that can be acquired; note these will be tailored to your characters and there abilities. The below examples are options that were made available to Arien (Echo Knight) when play testing these rules.\n\n\u00a0**Level 1 attacking skills.**\n\n1. Riposte, when you are attacked and the opponent misses you can use your reaction in order to make a single attack against them.\n2. Improved weapons training, get a permanent +1 to hit and damage with melee weapons.\n3. Improved critical, you now score a critical hit on a 19 or 20.\n\n\u00a0**Level 1 special skills.**\n\n1. Long shadow; your echo gains reach ability allowing it to attack at a range of 10ft for melee attacks.\n2. Elemental echo, when summoning your echo you can designate an element selecting from fire, cold, acid, lightning. Your echoes attacks now deal this damage type rather than slashing.\n3. Echo surge. When you use you action surge ability your echo can instantly make an additional attack.",

            "I do something similar. My players can train in any skill, tool, language, they please. Even shields and light armor. But there is a time/gold requirement so as not let them have it too soon.",
            "I like it.\n\nBut aren't the skill at level 1 a bit too powerful?\nIt's almost as if you were giving them a feat.\nI'm worried that players will abuse the system and try to train several days in a row in order to get all the points as fast as possible."
