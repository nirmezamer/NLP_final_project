This is more an exploratory adventure than a combat based one, I just described basic locations, so DM can, if they want add more content like checks for crossing the river, or some secret items to the ruins, etc.\n\nI played this one in my campaign for three lvl5 PC and it went pretty well, if someone has any suggestions or adjustments will be very welcomed.\n\nThanks for reading me!\n\n# ADVENTURE STARTS HERE:\n\nHeroes receive a letter from Glida Dierorch, a renowed herbalist of Danovar, urging them to retrieve a rare plant from ancient forest ruins. Recent lumberjack deaths and dark magical rumors deter Glida from venturing herself. As the heroes delve into the woods, they will uncover an ancient temple and face a malevolent druid who is seeking its power.\n\n**GLIDA DIERORCH**\n\nGlida accompanies the PCs but will hide during fights. When she finds the plant she is looking for in the temple, she will ask the heroes to help her investigate the temple, as its magical power is responsible for the properties of the plant.\n\n**FOREST ORIENTATION**\n\nPlayers will need to navigate through the forest, so the DM should notify them at each crossroads to decide which direction they want to go.\n\nSurvival and perception checks may give the players relevant information about the paths.\n\n**D4 RANDOM TREASURE**\n\n1. 1d6 Random seeds\n2. 1d4 Mushrooms\n3. 1d4 Goodberries\n4. 1d4 Random nuts\n\n**FINAL REWARD**\n\nHeroes will get a ring of animal influence, which has 3 daily charges for casting the following spells:\n\nAnimal friendship (DC 13)\n\nFear (DC 13)\n\nSpeak with animals\n\n# Enemies\n\n**TWISTED VINE**\n\nA vine plant corrupted by dark magic, entwines around the limbs of the unaware.\n\n(HP:12; AC:14; SP:20\u2019; XP:25)\n\n(STR:12; DEX:8; CON:6; INT:1; WIS:7; CHA:1)\n\n(ATT: Lash: +6 | 1d6+1)\n\nEntwine: The vine can try to immobilize a medium-sized creature, this can be avoided with a DC 17 DEX saving throw. Trapped creatures can free themselves by succeeding on a DC 15 CON saving throw.\n\n**CORRUPTED ENT**\n\nAn ancient Ent dominated by Malakars domination dark spell.\n\n(HP:138; AC:16; SP:30\u2019; XP:3000)\n\n(STR:23; DEX:8; CON:21; INT:1; WIS:16; CHA:1)\n\n(ATT: Hit: +10 | 3d6+6)\n\n(ATT: Throwing rock: +10 | 4d10+6)\n\nRange 60/180 ft, affects one creature.\n\nControlled: The Ent lacks willpower and only acts as a Malakars puppet, attacking anyone that try to reach or harm the druid. Players can end the spell if they kill Malakar or successfully cast Remove Curse on the Ent. In that case, the Ent will immediately attack Malakar if he\u2019s still alive.\n\n**MALAKAR, THE GREEN SHADOW**\n\nThe evil druid who pursues the power of the temple. Once  a defender of nature, his heart was corrupted by ambition.\n\n(HP:40; AC:14; SP:30\u2019; XP:1500)\n\n(STR:6; DEX:8; CON:8; INT:18; WIS:20; CHA:12)\n\n(ATT: Club: +1 | 1d6+1)\n\nAntilife shell: A shimmering barrier extends out from Malakar in a 10-foot radius and moves with him, hedging out creatures other than undead and constructs. It lasts the entire combat.\n\nLocust Swarm: A locust 10 ft swarm surrounds and attacks any living prey it encounters. A swarm deals 2d6 points of damage to any creature whose space it occupies at the end of its move.\n\n# The Forest\n\n**1. FOUNTAIN:**\n\nSeveral houses, now in ruins, surround a magnificent stone and bronze fountain. The fountain is filled with water and crowned by a statue of a woman holding a large empty jar. If the characters fill her jar, the fountain will activate, opening a compartment containing one of the three magical runes.\n\nIf the players decide to explore the houses, 1d4 twisted vines will sprout from the ground, attacking them immediately.\n\n**2. INTACT HOUSE:**\n\nA house that, unlike all others in this forest, remains in perfect condition despite the passage of time.\n\nInside, various supplies, 2d8 GP, and an ancient tome detailing the presence of ents in this forest can be found.\n\n**3.MALAKAR\u2019S CAMP:**\n\nAt first glance, nothing is visible as the camp is hidden by a concealment spell. However, if they venture down the path, the spell\u2019s effect will dissipate. Inside the clearing stands a large tent, several crates with supplies, and the remains of a shattered statue with barely readable inscriptions.\n\nWhen trying to access the tent, five twisted vines will sprout from the ground, attacking the adventurers.\n\nInside the tent, they will find one of the magical runes, 3d10 GP, and a 4d4+4 healing potion.\n\n**4. TEMPLE:**\n\nAn ancient hexagonal structure made of massive slabs of granite and marble stands gloomy but still imposingly among the trees. The temple is filled with a strange plant with purple flowers.\n\nBetween its columns and up a staircase, there are three altars with slots for magical runes. If all three runes are placed, the power of the temple will activate, revealing its secrets.\n\n**5. RUINED MENHIR:**\n\nA small muddy clearing with a tiny village built around a large menhir. The houses are completely destroyed and the roofs are caved in.\n\nIf the menhir is carefully examined, a series of runes in a grid can be distinguished. To solve the puzzle, the answer must be chiseled into the stone. Once the rune is taken, 1d4 twisted vines will attack the players. (You can see both, the puzzle file, and the solution in the free downloadable file, as both are images)\n\n**FINAL FIGHT:**\n\nWhen the players place the three runes, Malakar will appear alongside an Ent under his control at the temple\u2019s staircase.\n\nOn his first turn, Malakar will cast an antilife shell on himself, fighting from the rear while the Ent attacks the players at will.\n\nA DC 14 arcana check will reveal to the players the nature of the spell Malakar uses to control the Ent.\n\nAfter the fight, PC will found the entrance to the treasure room that opened when they placed the runes in the stands.",

        "content": "The older I get and the more complicated my personal life becomes, the less morally complex games I like to run. I've both run and played in games with difficult decisions, where you have to either give in to the urge and kill a lot of sentient creatures, or risk said sentients overrunning a peaceful populace. The nature of D&D by default means you often have to kill gangs of goblins, bandits, kobolds, orcs and the rest, leading to questions like *\"Are all goblins evil? Are there goblin children? Are we being species-ist?\"*. Chances are, if you're reading this, you've played in games where these questions have at least been raised in passing.\n\nI'm not saying I want to excise this complexity from the game entirely: it certainly has its place. I just don't want the burden laid at my conscience every time I pick up a set of dice for a bit of escapism. If only there was a way to encourage players to be kind and leave a positive impact on the world, while adhering to D&D's core gameplay mechanic of remorselessly slicing through hordes of dark creatures for loot. If only...\n\n# What are Dark Goblins?\n\nDark goblins share the stats of normal goblins in pretty much every respect (unless, of course, you have decided that they're distinct). Dark goblins aren't biological in the same way that regular D&D goblins are, in that they're born of goblin parents, nor are they twisted versions of other species like elves, in that classical Tolkienian goblin sense. Dark goblins are genderless, fiend-adjacent creatures from the plane of Acheron, formed of shadow magic and latent energy from the wicked, malicious, spiteful feelings and actions of every sentient creature in the multiverse.\n\nAcheron is home to the divine goblin realm known as Clangor. Some religions preach that Clangor is where all greedy, mean and mischievious thoughts come from, extending outwards from Clangor to touch every corner of every plane. Whether or not that's true is up for debate, but one thing is certain: whenever there is war, or a population begins to shift from being kind to just plain mean to each other, goblins are never far away. They seem to be drawn to conflict like moths to flames, gathering in groups to create more mischief, fanning the flames of strife - which eventually begets more goblins.\n\nThey'll quite happily work for hire for a more intelligent master, which satisfies their greed for gold and gems while causing all manner of problems. They dissolve back into shadow magic on death, which crawls away into any crack or crevice it can find to await eventual reformation. To reform, these shadows need to be close to a creature or community full of malicious thoughts and deeds.\n\nDark goblins are the Hand from Marvel, the Foot clan from *TMNT*, the Putty Patrol from *Power Rangers* and the Heartless from *Kingdom Hearts*: creatures not of flesh and blood that delight in sneaky, underhanded, five-on-one hit-and-run combat. No moral quandaries about burning down goblin camps here: unrelenting and unrepentant, players can scythe through dens of goblins with zero moral quandaries as they burst into shadowy smoke.\n\nThis has a very nice implication for world consequences, that adheres quite well to the Saturday morning cartoon-esque idea of evil henchmen disappearing in a puff of black smoke on defeat. If goblins form, or are drawn to, times and places where people are nasty to one another, the only true way to permanently end the goblin threat is for the players to create a world in which it's easier to be kind to one another than mean. Acts of kindness are antithetical to a dark goblin's existence: after removing the initial goblin threat, leaving a place better than you found it might be the only way to ensure they never come back.\n\n# Running Dark Goblins\n\nWhat does this mean in practical terms? Dark goblins are both problem and symptom. A single low-level adventure might be clearing a gang of goblin thieves from the city's sewers, but you might also have a goblin clan stealing stuff from around town, burning down taverns and blaming their misdeeds on two rival factions, exacerbating the tensions that drew the goblins there in the first place. In this way, parties can both work towards a peaceful resolution between the two local factions, and have a dungeon full of goblin mooks to hack-and-slash their way through guilt-free.\n\nIn combat, dark goblins are full of mischief and spite, sliding 10-15% towards the \"Tucker's Kobolds\" or \"ninja\" archetypes. They make use of traps, hidey-holes, darkness and smoke to catch their enemies unawares. Swathed in black and wielding curved swords, they'll spring on a party unawares, perhaps trying to steal the wizard's staff instead going in for a slash, or one might trip up the paladin so two others can attack with advantage.\n\nTolkien's goblins delight in explosions and invention, and dark goblins echo this by using their bonus action Hide in conjunction with smokesticks, poison darts and simple fire-based traps. Steal your players\u2019 magic swords from their scabbards and cut the straps on their Bags of Holding: be really, really annoying, in essence, and play up the mischief angle. When defeated, the goblins burst into black smoke, the shadow-stuff crawling out of their empty rags towards corners, cracks and crevices.\n\nThere are also mechanical implications toward \"killing them with kindness\". Spending an afternoon helping the poor tavern owner rebuild after a fire caused by dark goblins (you could even run the fire itself as a [natural hazard](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/1dejgsd/an_update_to_an_old_post_treating_natural_hazards/)) could be considered XP or treasure-worthy, as it's ultimately working towards the party's goal of ending a goblin incursion. You could even do a skill challenge here: the bard could make a persuasion check to get the other townsfolk helping, while the barbarian could focus on athletics to hoist the biggest beams himself.\u00a0\n\nKeep a tracker of intentional kind deeds and successful skill checks - you could hide it from the PCs, or choose not to - and declare the goblins vanquished (for now) after a certain number of good deeds and successes. If the party makes an effort to lift up the community, foster attitudes of kindness among townsfolk and broker deals with warring factions, the goblins will stay away. This is a good opportunity to introduce fetch-quests and have high-level players use their powers for good - for example, using *Plant Growth* or weather control spells to ensure a better harvest to stop two factions competing over scarce resources.\u00a0\n\nIf you're looking for a \"nice\" PG-13 game with the tone of *Legend of Zelda*, you could certainly do worse than using dark goblins. Link doesn\u2019t slice his way through bone and sinew, or murderize baby goblins. Dark goblins are a gang of mooks that make a special effort to be annoying at every turn, have an additional layer of complexity, but still engage with the game\u2019s basic tenets. They also come with built-in incentives to reward behaviour and attitudes of kindness, compassion and community towards your NPCs.",

Have been playtesting these with just 1 character in the group before rolling this out to the entire group.\n\nI wanted to reach out to the community also to see if I could get any advice over these and whether you felt the balance was correct on these. I have given examples of the skills attained by the play test character; level 6 echo knight fighter.\n\n**Personal Training Rules**\n\nAs part of downtime you can spend time training and honing your skills. This can be done by yourself, or with a skilled trainer in the discipline you are looking to train. Each time you train you will earn progress points against the discipline you are training. On hitting milestones along that training path you will gain new skills or benefits specific to your character and their fighting styles.\n\n\u00a0There are 3 disciplines in which you can train;\n\n\u00a0**Attack focused Skills**- Training in this area will be focused around you primary attacks be that weapons attacks for martial classes, spell attacks for casters and a mix of both of combined classes. Checks to earn progress points in this training discipline will be made with your primary attack stat; eg Strength/Dex for most martial classes, and spell modifier stat for other classes.\n\n\u00a0**Defensive Skills**- Training in this area will be focused around you primary defensive stat be that constitution for more tank orientated characters, evasion for more dexterity based characters or defensive spells for . Checks to earn progress points in this training discipline will be made with your primary defence stat.\n\n\u00a0**Special Skills**- Training in this area will be focused on augmenting the abilities associated with your character's sub classes, for those multiclassing you will receive options for each of your multiclass. Checks in this area may differ based on the flavour of these subclasses.\n\n\u00a0**Progress points** - The number of progress point required in each discipline to acquire a new skills/ability will increase with each acquired skill, an increase in the DC to attain progress on that training pathway will also increase with each skill acquired. This means at higher levels of skill, the benefits that skilled trainers bring are an necessity.\n\n\u00a0**Trainers**- Throughout the world you may be able to identify training masters who will be able to assist you with training as part of your downtime, and will have a range of effects from reducing the DC of the training checks, boosting the amount of progress that can be made or giving access to particularly powerful skills that can be gained from this specific trainer only. Most trainers will exchange there services for gold, but others may need more to secure their services and share their secrets.\n\n\u2022Level 1 skill\u20223 progress points required \u2022DC 10 1 progress point, DC 14 2 progress points, DC 18 3 progress points\n\n\u2022Level 2 Skill\u20225 progress points required \u2022DC 12 1 progress point, DC 16 2 progress points, DC 20 3 progress points\u2022\n\n\u2022Level 3 skill\u20227 progress points required \u2022DC 14 1 progress point, DC 18 2 progress points, DC 22 3 progress points\n\n\u2022Level 4 Skill\u20229 progress points required \u2022DC 16 1 progress point, DC 20 2 progress points, DC 24 3 progress points\n\n\u2022Level 5 Skill\u202212 progress points required \u2022DC 18 1 progress point, DC 22 2 progress points, DC 26 3 progress points\n\nTraining in this manner will use up 1 primary activity as part of your downtime, and will be equal to 1 attempt to make progress against your chosen discipline.\n\nUpon completing a skill milestone you will be provided with 3 options for skills which you may choose from, allowing for a greater level of customisation for your character.\n\nExamples of skills that can be acquired; note these will be tailored to your characters and there abilities. The below examples are options that were made available to Arien (Echo Knight) when play testing these rules.\n\n\u00a0**Level 1 attacking skills.**\n\n1. Riposte, when you are attacked and the opponent misses you can use your reaction in order to make a single attack against them.\n2. Improved weapons training, get a permanent +1 to hit and damage with melee weapons.\n3. Improved critical, you now score a critical hit on a 19 or 20.\n\n\u00a0**Level 1 special skills.**\n\n1. Long shadow; your echo gains reach ability allowing it to attack at a range of 10ft for melee attacks.\n2. Elemental echo, when summoning your echo you can designate an element selecting from fire, cold, acid, lightning. Your echoes attacks now deal this damage type rather than slashing.\n3. Echo surge.

So ancient, that the language warps around the concepts they're conveying.\n\nLet\u2019s call those *collapsible names.* Two words, the end of the first is the same as the start of the second. *Dream + amber = Dreamber.* Or, with diacritics over the shared part: **Drea\u0307m\u0307ber**.\n\nIn this post, I revisit that idea and show the cool names I\u2019ve mined with a script.\n\n# Aesthetic\n\nSo, what\u2019s special about Hagrove, Treerie, and Weapond?\n\nI got an idea from a fantasy map I saw on Pinterest, maybe a tutorial or a commission example \u2013 it had a forest named Hagrove. And I thought: oh, interesting, the \u2018g\u2019 is shared! It felt like was not a mere grove with some hags \u2013 but *the* hag grove. As if the two words were invented just to describe it. You might break the name apart and re-purpose its pieces to describe a troll grove or a hag mire \u2013 but you can see that those are derived terms, as they don\u2019t fit as nicely together.\n\nSimilarly, I like the idea of prehistoric entities speaking in rhyme. Not intentionally \u2013 just due to the gravitas of their presence crumpling and plowing this \u201cnew thing\u201d, the language.\n\n\n\n# Applications\n\nThe intended use for collapsible names is to be written on a map or to be mentioned in a text. An idling eye stumbles upon a familiar-yet-different word and, hopefully, piques interest. Adornment with diacritics (or over- and under- lines) is also meant to work toward that goal.\n\nAdditionally, the contrast between names draws attention to whatever cultural element behind it. If the human name for the forest is Elderwood but elves call it Arb\u0307o\u0307r\u0307ough \u2013 just by using the visually distinct naming styles, you can convey the information about what culture controls it.\n\n\n\n# Curated list of names\n\n**Two-letter collapsible names**\n\n|Ap\u0307e\u0307ak|ape|peak|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Aw\u0307e\u0307ll|awe|well|\n|Brin\u0307e\u0307t|brine|net|\n|Bus\u0307h\u0307ire|bush|shire|\n|Curs\u0307e\u0307a|curse|sea|\n|Drea\u0307m\u0307ber|dream|amber|\n|Fa\u0307e\u0307rie|fae|aerie|\n|Glad\u0307e\u0307n|glade|den|\n|Gnom\u0307e\u0307adow|gnome|meadow|\n|Immens\u0307e\u0307a|immense|sea|\n|Lak\u0307e\u0307ep|lake|keep|\n|Lav\u0307a\u0307lley|lava|valley|\n|Lus\u0307h\u0307ire|lush|shire|\n|Moo\u0307r\u0307chid|moor|orchid|\n|Raindro\u0307p\u0307al|raindrop|opal|\n|Solitud\u0307e\u0307n|solitude|den|\n|Slim\u0307e\u0307adow|slime|meadow|\n|Tea\u0307r\u0307id|tear|arid|\n|Tre\u0307e\u0307rie|tree|eerie|\n|Wild\u0307e\u0307n|wilde|den|\n|Wind\u0307y\u0307ke|windy|dyke|\n|Yout\u0307h\u0307orp|youth|thorp|\n\n\n\n**Three-letter collapsible names**\n\n|Ar\u0307i\u0307d\u0307ge|arid|ridge|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Bas\u0307i\u0307n\u0307khole|basin|sinkhole|\n|Charm\u0307e\u0307r\u0307e|charmer|mere|\n|Clo\u0307a\u0307k\u0307|cloak|oak|\n|Gard\u0307e\u0307n\u0307|garde|den|\n|Gl\u0307e\u0307e\u0307ch|glee|leech|\n|Hidd\u0307e\u0307n\u0307|hidden|den|\n|Hi\u0307l\u0307l\u0307usion|hill|illusion|\n|Jew\u0307e\u0307l\u0307l|jewel|well|\n|Massac\u0307r\u0307e\u0307ek|massacre|creek|\n|Nih\u0307i\u0307l\u0307l|nihil|hill|\n|Putr\u0307\u00efd\u0307ge|putrid|ridge|\n|Spect\u0307r\u0307e\u0307e|spectre|tree|\n|Spr\u00efn\u0307g\u0307ot|spring|ingot|\n|Tid\u0307a\u0307l\u0307e|tidal|dale|\n|Tr\u0307e\u0307e\u0307d|tree|reed|\n|Veter\u0307a\u0307n\u0307ge|veteran|range|\n|Weap\u0307o\u0307n\u0307d|weapon|pond|\n|Whis\u1e57\u0117r\u0307ch|whisper|perch|\n\n\n\n**One-letter collapsible names**\n\nI\u2019ve got about 23k options for this one \u2013 too much noise to be practical.\n\n\n\n**Four-letter collapsible names**\n\nMy code couldn\u2019t find any four-letter names due to a bug. If this thing gets enough interest, it might fix it. For now, purely with the sheer power of my imagination, I discovered `Sp\u0307\u00efn\u0307e\u0307: spine + pine`. The second close thing is `Gl\u0307a\u0307d\u0307de\u0307r: glade + ladder` \u2013 but it has an extra \u201cd\u201d breaking the perfect overlap.\n\nIf you come up with a four-letter collapsible name \u2013 leave a comment, I\u2019d love to see some :)\n\n\n\n**Curious finds**\n\n* Fetis\u0307h\u0307ire: fetish + shire\n* Genocid\u0307e\u0307n: genocide + den\n* Coco\u0307a\u0307k: cocoa + oak\n* Infern\u0307o\u0307ok: inferno + nook\n* Sakur\u0307a\u0307in: sakura + rain\n* P\u0307o\u0307o\u0307l: poo + pool\n* Tamp\u0307o\u0307n\u0307d: tampon + pond\n\n\n\n# More Collapsible Names!\n\nI have put together an [online page](https://www.mykkonovalow.com/namess/index.html) on which you can play with the idea and generate your own names.\n\nIt\u2019s under **CC BY-SA 4.0** \u2013 so feel free to distribute and build upon the results however you want (even commercially). The only requirement: please attribute me: *\u201cCollapsible names by Myk Konovalow\u201d.* A link to the online page would be much appreciated.\n\n\n\n# Parting Thoughts\n\nThis was fun. I parsed 9M entries of Wikitonary \u2013 and filtering so much data (about 17Gb) that was a fun algorithmic challenge. I tried a few fancy tricks for that but the only two things that worked were: a) limitng length ad b) looking up the word's frequency (from a third party dictionary).\n\nIf this thing gets enough interest, I\u2019d be up to do a pass through comments and implement most requested features. Same with bugs, if any.\n\nP.S. Here\u2019s the original post that inspired collapsible names: [\"Naming. And what it can do for you worldbuilding\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/jrtub2/naming_and_what_it_can_do_for_your_worldbuilding/).",

            "You could also age the names by applying consonantal shifts to them. For example, Basin Sinkhole might run together to make Basinkhole, but that\u2019s kind of hard to say. After not too long it would probably shift to something like Basingol, or bazingol. This further obfuscates the words from the player/reader, if that is a goal one has.",
            "This is a really interesting way to look at names. Totally agree that a lot of them sound very Fey. Will give this a run next time I need some NPC names, thank you!",
