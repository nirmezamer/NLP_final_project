        "content": "I get complimented a lot on my Japanese.  But what do all these complements mean?  Let's find out!\n\n**\u3081\u3093\u3069\u3046\u304f\u3055\u3044**\n\nPeople say this a lot when I come around.\n\n*  \u99ac\u9053[\u3081\u3093\u3069\u3046] is a long-roofed passage used in Heian-era architecture.\n\n*  \u6551\u6e08[\u304f\u3055\u3044] is salvation based on Buddha's teaching\n\nThis means, that when they see you, they are saying you are the hallway in the long passage to enlightenment.  This is a pretty high complement!\n\n**\u3046\u308b\u3055\u3044**\n\nWhen I speak Japanese, people say *\u3046\u308b\u3055\u3044* a lot.  \n\n\u5f97\u308b[\u3046\u308b] is to be able to do something\n\u624d[\u3055\u3044] is the sort of a talent someone was born with.  \n\nBasically if people say this when you speak to them, they are saying you have a natural born talent for Japanese!\n\n**\u3057\u306d**\n\nThis is another one people say to me a lot.  It's short for \u30b7\u30cd\u30de(cinema) which means if someone says this to you, they want to go to the movies with you!  Japanese love shortening words like this.  But, unfortunately I'm too busy to go to the movies with all these people!\n\n**\u304f\u306b\u306b\u304b\u3048\u308d**\n\nPeople kept saying this to me and it took me a bit to figure this one out.  At first I thought they were talking about hot water bottles, but I figured out that it means they want to go on a trip to Cairo (which is the captial of Egypt) with you.  A lot of people seem to want to travel with me but I'm too busy.\n\n**\u3069\u3046\u304b\u3057\u3093\u3067\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044**\n\nI get this one more rarely, and people seem particularly desperate when they say it to me.  I believe \u3069\u3046\u304b\u3057\u3093 is a provincial version of \u72ec\u8eab[\u3069\u304f\u3057\u3093] (to be single), so I think they are saying \"Please be single!\" (so I can go on a date with you), but the grammar doesn't seem to really work out so I'm wondering if this is more of a colloquial phrase.  I hope someone can explain this one a bit better.\n\n**\u3060\u305b\u3044**\n\nSometimes people *just look* at me and say this!  \u60f0\u6027[\u3060\u305b\u3044] means \"force of habit\".  I believe when they say this, they are referring to all the good habits I have built up!\n\nAnyway, have you received many compliments?  Let me know about them!",
