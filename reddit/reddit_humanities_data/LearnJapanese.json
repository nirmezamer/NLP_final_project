            "\n#Question Etiquette Guidelines:\n\n* **1** Provide the **CONTEXT** of the grammar, vocabulary or sentence you are having trouble with as much as possible. Provide the sentence or paragraph that you saw it in. Make your questions as specific as possible.\n\n>\uff38 What is the difference between \u306e and \u304c ?\n\n>\u25ef I saw a book called \u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u306e\u77e5\u3089\u306a\u3044\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e , why is \u306e used there instead of \u304c ? [(the answer)](https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/68336/difference-between-%E3%81%8C-%E3%81%AE-and-no-particle)\n\n* **2** When asking for a translation or how to say something, it's best to try to **attempt it yourself** first, even if you are not confident about it. Or ask r/translator if you have no idea. We are also not here to do your homework for you. \n\n>\uff38 What does this mean?\n\n>\u25ef I am having trouble with this part of this sentence from NHK Easy News. I think it means (*attempt here*), but I am not sure.\n\n\n* **3** Questions based on DeepL and Google Translate and other machine learning applications are discouraged, [these are not beginner learning tools](https://old.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/stepqf/deeplgoogle_translate_are_not_learning_tools/) and often make mistakes.\n\n* **4** When asking about differences between words, try to explain the situations in which you've seen them or are trying to use them. If you just post a list of synonyms you got from looking something up in a E-J dictionary, people might be disinclined to answer your question because it's low-effort. Remember that Google Image Search is also a great resource for visualizing the difference between similar words.\n\n>\uff38 What's the difference between \u4e00\u81f4 \u540c\u610f \u8cdb\u6210 \u7d0d\u5f97 \u5408\u610f?\n\n>\u25ef Jisho says \u4e00\u81f4 \u540c\u610f \u8cdb\u6210 \u7d0d\u5f97 \u5408\u610f all seem to mean \"agreement\". I'm trying to say something like \"I completely agree with your opinion\". Does \u5168\u304f\u540c\u611f\u3067\u3059\u3002 work? Or is one of the other words better?\n\n* **5** It is always nice to (but not required to) try to search for the answer to something yourself first. Especially for beginner questions or questions that are very broad. For example, asking about [the difference between \u306f and \u304c ](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/wa-and-ga/) or [why you often can't hear the \"u\" sound in \"desu\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Devoicing).\n\n* **6** Remember that everyone answering questions here is an unpaid volunteer doing this out of the goodness of their own heart, so try to show appreciation and not be too presumptuous/defensive/offended if the answer you get isn't exactly what you wanted.\n\n---------------------\n\nUseful Japanese teaching symbols:\n\n\u2718 incorrect (\uff2e\uff27)\n\n\u25b3 strange/ unnatural / unclear\n\n\u25cb correct\n \n\u2252 nearly equal\n\n---------------------\n\n#NEWS (Updated 3/07):\n\nAdded a section on symbols. If it's unnecessary clutter I can always remove it later. Have a nice day!\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Most people in Japan appreciate someone who shows genuine interest in the language and culture; more so if in a place not awash in foreign tourists.   \n  \nTottori, Matsue, Onomichi, etc. etc. are all lovely.",
            "I agree with the sentiment to avoid the touristy places to a certain extent.\n\nBut it's not like those places are popular by accident. They're noteworthy and more likely than not worth your time. Definitely think about where you'd like to go and what you'd like to experience before blindly following someone else's itinerary. And yes, there's so much more to explore than the Golden Triangle of cities as well.\n\n  \nNow where nihonjin can definitely get annoyed is when you're going off the beaten path and armed with a gopro to \"eXpLoRe REAL JaPaNggG\" imposing yourself in spaces where you could be a burden, like a local sunakku and forcing them to give you turns singing karaoke, which I read someone on one of those subs did until he was kicked out. When I read it I thought, \"Like how did you not realize that they didn't want you there? Or did you just not care?\" No matter, some tourists like this one treat the whole country as an amusement park and even the most xenophobic nihonjin is justified in not wanting to put up with that kind of tourist.\n\nOP, you'll be fine there. Most will appreciate and even praise their effort; a couple will be annoyed or just not give a shit. But don't take it personally, they might not even want to put up with other Japanese that day. I learned to accept that the most conscientious tourist is still a tourist and does require some level of grace and patience from the locals; just be grateful for it. No use getting anxious or discouraged by it.",

            "Controversial and I am sure unpopular suggestion: go and read r/japantravel for a bit. Note down the itineraries there and then \\*don't\\* go to any of those places. \n\nThat's a bit extreme, but there is a lot more to Japan than fairly well-trodden tourist routes. If you want to meet and talk to Japanese people you will have at least a different set of opportunities in less \"you must go here\" sorts of places.\n\nOf course \"all of Japan\" does include Tokyo, Kyoto and so on, but there's a lot more to Japan than that. Shikoku - an entire home island - rarely seems much by way of foreign tourism (sometimes people go to Naoshima which is technically in Kagawa, but...). Lots to see there, though easier if you can drive and rent a car. \n\nBut as others will point out better than I, even in the really tourist dense areas, you will surely find people to talk to - that was my experience - and if you go even a hair's breadth off the very beaten track you will find all sorts of experiences. Obviously if your time is limited you will miss out on seeing the key tourist spots, but you might enjoy yourself more. Life isn't a tick box.\n\nWell, that's my thought. I rather enjoy wandering around the towns and cities of Japan, as well as in the countryside.\n\nThe other people commenting are making more conventional points, but they are all good ones. Don't overthink, be friendly and polite and so on. All good.\n\nSome places it seems easier to get into conversation with locals than others. Some places it is hard to get a konnichiwa out of anyone but in others people do come and chat (even when they aren't Jehovah's Witnesses).",
            "if anything, you'll know better what and what not to do when you're there. none of my japanese friends there give a shit about overtourism.",
            "I wouldn't worry about it, but I get mistaken for Japanese so they wouldn't care about me. \n\nBut while I was living there during the pandemic, it got to the point where business owners and such kept admitting that they need tourists to keep their business afloat. So if anything, a lot of them probably have a new appreciation for tourists.",
            "Anyone who will view a stranger like that likely isn't going to be your friend to begin with. There are plenty of people there who don't care about that."

I want to be consistent but this is hindering me.\n\nI take breaks when these stuff happen, but after getting frustrated and taking a break my motivation just dies.\n\nthese stuff are most likely normal and part of the process, but it's driving me insane...

            "I think it\u2019s all part of the learning journey. Also when I get tired my Japanese language ability completely tanks. I notice even in my native language in have my good days and bad days, of course it\u2019s not as noticeable as it is in my still rudimentary Japanese.",
            "I just tell myself that there are good days and bad days and I don\u2019t really deal with it \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Not sure if it\u2019s a good solution though. \n\nBut yeah, some days I forget the most basic kanjis and think I have Alzheimer's, and other days I feel like I\u2019m a genius of memorization, so it balances out I guess",
            "Take a small break when you're feeling super burnt out, not when you're simply forgetting things.\n\nStart by removing the \"most likely normal\" part first and fully internalize that's literally what learning is. The idea that you'd remember something by only seeing it once or even multiple times and it's somehow going to be there locked in forever with perfect recall is silly.\n\nSeparate your own ego from the situation and realize that forgetting something isn't a negative reflection of your ability. You're probably forgetting information all the time on other things in your daily life, but you've not tied those things to your ego. You ever forget where your car keys or cell phone are? Is that a reflection on you? Do you curse life and have to take a break to recover from such an embarrassing mistake?\n\nI also want to highlight something very important you wrote\n\n>I am halfway with quartet book 1 and there are genki 2 grammar I still forget.\n\nProgress is a like a staircase with broken steps than a straight line, you'll always stumble but eventually you get to the top floor. If you keep at it, eventually you're gonna find yourself thinking\n\n>I am halfway with quartet book 2 and there are quartet 1 grammar I still forget.\n\nAnd then\n\n>I am halfway with Shin Kanzen Master N1 and there are quartet book 2 grammar I still forget.\n\nAnd then finally\n\n>\u3042\u30fc\u3084\u3070\u3044\uff01\u307e\u305f\u305d\u306e\u8a00\u8449\u3092\u5fd8\u308c\u3061\u3083\u3063\u305f\uff01\n\nI'm know I sound very pseudo-self help guru with this advice lol, but in dealing with the exact same frustrations, I realized it wasn't just coming from learning Japanese and came from other deeper insecurities that were revealed to me when I started learning a new challenging skill.",
            "I started learning for about 3 months now and still have days where I completely forget the basics of hiragana and other days where there is no problems at all. As others have said we have good days and bad days. You\u2019ll wake up day and look at this with no problems at all!",
            "It really takes weeks for your brain to be able to process new information. It's not like I already learned this kanji, okay my brain already learned it. It could take weeks or months, because some topics are just easier to understand. And that's okay, you're not a machine.\n\nYou can take a break from learning Japanese and start enjoying it. Read for the sake of reading, watch series for the sake of watching, don't try to understand everything. And if you forget something, it's okay, you'll eventually learn it.\n\n\n\nI learned English without learning English. I spent years in an institute where I learned nothing. NOTHING. And wanting to watch faster animes was the reason I started immersion. And not six hours a day, I didn't have time for that. 5 years later I can already read, speak, understand. The same can happen with all languages.\n\n\n\nDon't overdo it",
            "Language acquisition is not a linear process.",
            "If you're early in the process, perhaps stop trying to learn about the language (i.e., grammar).\n\nDo a search for Stephen Krashen. His talks on language acquisition are very informative. \n\nThen find some more enjoyable source material.",
            "Yeah it's definitely part of the learning process, but man I haven't learned anything this hard, so it feels frustrating to me when I feel like I'm getting pulled back. \n\nI'm also the same when I'm tired, so I don't study when I'm tired.",
            ">some days I forget the most basic kanjis and think I have Alzheimer's, and other days I feel like I\u2019m a genius of memorization\n\nOh man, this is exactly me... Somewhat glad to see I'm not alone",
            "This is actually helpful, When I posted this I was thinking that people also get frustrated when they forget like me. However it seems people just see it differently than me.\n\n>I realized it wasn't just coming from learning Japanese and came from other deeper insecurities that were revealed to me when I started learning a new challenging skill.\n\nVery insightful actually since I'm probably dealing with this aswell which is causing me to have too high expectations of myself. Maybe I should switch to a childs perspective who doesn't care if they forget at all lmao. Man I now sound like a self-help guru aswell haha"
