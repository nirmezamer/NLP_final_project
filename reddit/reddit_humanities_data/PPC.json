        "content": "Howdy Y'All\n\nWe crossed the 1,000 mile mark. Feels like a huge win for us. We got 1,060 responses this year, which makes it our best year to date. 2023 was our next best year at 902  responses. Countries/regions are listed in alphabetical as we got 100+ slides.\n\nI redesigned our 5 year trending median salary chart. For reporting, the bar is 20 for the USA and 10 for the rest of world to show a country, region, province/state or a city.\n\nI want to give a special shout out to Spain and India for both cracking the top 6 countries, which gave us the most responses this year. Both countries are giving Australia & Germany a run for their money (in terms of responses we get). This is the first time that a new country has cracked the top 6.\n\n**Some Notes**\n\n* India more than 2x their responses since 2023 and 2022. We gave them their own section this year. Please keep showing up if you are based in India\n* Top 6 countries now has a slide to show how much data we get from each one\n* Remote work seems to be decreasing. A lot less currency conversions to do this year. Is remote going back to a niche thing?\n* Some people have 1-3 years experience in paid but having been working for 8-10 years, thus they can skew salaries higher.\n* Some people include their bonus in their salaries I imagine. This can make their salary higher then someone who might not have. Hence why we try to use the median salary across all reports\n\n**Results Served Two Ways**\n\n[Google Slides 2024 Salary Survey](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jobUKJQcQhvPe8TAwfpc0z5OOCNCjFDq7XZC__aOL8Y/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**or**\n\n[PDF 2024 Salary Survey](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GpFnUIXryxwY9PavADu5lfkm3X8QW9yu/view?usp=drive_link)\n\nThanks  you for helping make this happen.

They will be forcing tens of thousands of small businesses across the country to pay for their advertising service by invoice or debit rather than credit card. This change will strip countless \"little guys\" of their cash back offers on credit cards. These cash back incentives help keep the lights on.

More reliable.\" Feels like he was really running out of steam selling this bullshit.\n\nThe reason Google is doing this is obvious: To make a zillionth of a % point more in profit this quarter.\n\nI'm here for one reason: Rally the fucking troops.\n\nI implore anyone reading this with an ounce of fight in their veins to kick up shit with whatever rep you know best at Google. There is no chance any one of us can make a difference, but if we can get a large community of people screaming we can at least make the Monopoly Man squirm.\n\nAre you with me???\n\n<insert american flag being held by big muscle guy here in your brain>\n",

The only suggestion I could find was that the campaign is inflating conversion values for new customers, but we don't have that option enabled.\n\nFrom checking the insights report we're about 75/25 search to display and we're using GA4 imported conversions in this account if that's relevant.",

It is a niche market that I am in and region-specific. I started a google campaign about 9 months ago with a cheap website. It performed Ok got a few leads that made it worthwhile. Then suddenly I was banned from google in the rudest way, \"account suspended for circumventing systems\".  Nobody to speak to, no details given, tried for months until eventually the account was no longer suspended and I resumed. In the meantime I had deleted the website altogether for fear of some tech problem I did not understand with the site and had a new one made. So I was able to resume on the new website and everything was fine until now, same problem all over except slightly different the account is not suspended but instead the ads are \"disapproved\" and the reasons are circumventing systems and compromised site.\n\nSo as I contemplate going through several months minimum of no advertising, jumping through hoops, spending money on a new website and more importantly no visibility to a solution, I don't know if I can even solve this issue as I don't understand the problem...\n\nIt seems my time energy and effort would be better spent to abandon google forever and switch to advertising on insta/fb. I mean it's a real hit to my business to have to spend my time on this! At least if I spend my time learning how to use and putting into place insta/fb then it is time well spent (?) rather then taking the risk of having this absolutely horrible company dynamite my business marketing once more. Don't know if the effectiveness is comparable but really ready to walk away from google forever at this point. \n\n",

            "I hear the frustration. Google is notoriously mysterious when it comes to bans and suspensions. Meta is slightly better at support, from my experience.\n\nHowever, Meta is a bloodbath right now. I suggest you go to the facebookads sub and check out pros and cons, maybe even search for thoughts people have posted around B2B lead gen.",
            "I think the issue is that you're trying to do this all yourself. During your first suspension you could have appealed  to try and get the account reinstated. Now that your ads are getting disapproved, [you can appeal those](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/9338593?hl=en&sjid=1833553587040619747-NC). I would also recommend reading [Google Ad's policies](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/topic/1626336?hl=en&ref_topic=2996750,1308156,&sjid=1833553587040619747-NC) to understand what it means to be compliant. \n\nGoogle also seems to think that your website is compromised. Depending on what platform you used to create the site, it probably is. It's an issue and you need to look into that asap. Otherwise you're just wasting your time trying to drive traffic to your site, if it's being redirected to spam sites.\n\n>It seems my time energy and effort would be better spent to abandon google forever and switch to advertising on insta/fb.

Don't know if the effectiveness is comparable but really ready to walk away from google forever at this point.\n\nThis is why you hire a reputable marketing agency or consultant. Given that you're in a highly niched and localized field of business, google search is going to be your best bet since you can target your niche related keywords. \n\nYou're whole approach to marketing your business has been DIY and at this point, after 9 months or so if you haven't figured it out and are overwhelmed, I would just invest in a good agency or marketing consultant who can take care of this for you.   \n  \nMy advice, take your marketing seriously. If you want to be the best local engineering consultant and have leads flowing in, then don't just throw up a \"cheap website\". Make sure it's good and optimized for conversions. Make sure you're on google maps/google business profile. Work on building your SEO. And advertise to generate leads while you work on your SEO. Find and pay and expert to handle this for you, so you can focus on your consulting business. I'd recommend looking local or find someone on Upwork.\n\n  \nGood luck!"

        "content": "*this is not a complaining post so bear with me*\n\nI have a couple of years since I was using PMax campaigns for my store (edible decorations manufacturer company). In the last months, sales dropped big time. I thought \u201cmaybe I\u2019m doing something wrong\u201d, I started to read all forums, groups, got in touch with several companies (even people from Google Ads), nothing really helped.\nBasically, no matter the strategy I want to use, Google will eat my money, send tons of useless traffic and get just a couple of small orders. I checked everything, signals, tags, tag manager, headlines, pictures, videos, absolutely anything.\nThe shop is on Shopify, it\u2019s almost 6 years old, we have lots of customers database, GA4, everything works together, no errors. \n\nAnyway, here, on this sub, I saw some discussion where someone recommended to use a search campaign + classic shopping campaign instead PMax. I said \u201cwhat the \u2026\u201d and give it a try. \nWell, what can I say, I have at least similar or even better results at a fraction of the price. Now it\u2019s up to me to improve especially the searching campaign since the classic shopping campaign can\u2019t be customized too much (and that\u2019s a good thing). \n\nMy point is: if you see some bad results lately, just give it a try, for 1-2 weeks and, even if you won\u2019t see an increase in your orders number, at least you will pay much less than running a PMax campaign. At least this happened for me.\n\n*sorry for my poor English, not a native speaker",

Nothing wrong with using search campaigns and shopping campaigns to make your business more money and get conversions. We still use both campaigns types and PMax where it makes sense for clients.",
            "PMax is highly automated so expect it to churn through spend for a while it learns what converts. Standard Shopping can be highly customized around your catalog & goals. Ex: PMax might focus on selling your $50 low margin items and ignore your $175 high margin products. It\u2019s always good to have a professional work with you on strategy.",
            "You know the concept of look-a-like audiences? PMax does this except it's look-a-like advertisers. \n\nFor smaller retailers there just isn't enough data to model conversions for every product and every keyword, so Google is going to lump you in with what it thinks are similar advertisers to aggregate data in PMax. \n\nSometimes this works, many times it doesn't. When it doesn't there isn't any signal for PMax to latch onto to bring it back up. It becomes a death spiral. Gradually grinding down to no activity.\n\nWith standard shopping you can see where it's going wrong and dial it back in. It's even possible to use standard shopping to \"train\" the product level keyword data for PMax later on. \n\nFor most smaller account query filtered standard shopping is the right choice. The trouble is it takes a lot more work than PMax and fewer people can do it well."
