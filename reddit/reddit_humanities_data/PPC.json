        "content": "Howdy Y'All\n\nWe crossed the 1,000 mile mark. Feels like a huge win for us. We got 1,060 responses this year, which makes it our best year to date. 2023 was our next best year at 902  responses. Countries/regions are listed in alphabetical as we got 100+ slides.\n\nI redesigned our 5 year trending median salary chart. For reporting, the bar is 20 for the USA and 10 for the rest of world to show a country, region, province/state or a city.\n\nI want to give a special shout out to Spain and India for both cracking the top 6 countries, which gave us the most responses this year. Both countries are giving Australia & Germany a run for their money (in terms of responses we get). This is the first time that a new country has cracked the top 6.\n\n**Some Notes**\n\n* India more than 2x their responses since 2023 and 2022. We gave them their own section this year. Please keep showing up if you are based in India\n* Top 6 countries now has a slide to show how much data we get from each one\n* Remote work seems to be decreasing. A lot less currency conversions to do this year. Is remote going back to a niche thing?\n* Some people have 1-3 years experience in paid but having been working for 8-10 years, thus they can skew salaries higher.\n* Some people include their bonus in their salaries I imagine. This can make their salary higher then someone who might not have. Hence why we try to use the median salary across all reports\n\n**Results Served Two Ways**\n\n[Google Slides 2024 Salary Survey](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jobUKJQcQhvPe8TAwfpc0z5OOCNCjFDq7XZC__aOL8Y/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**or**\n\n[PDF 2024 Salary Survey](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GpFnUIXryxwY9PavADu5lfkm3X8QW9yu/view?usp=drive_link)\n\nThanks  you for helping make this happen.

        "content": "As I'm sure many of you know by now, Google has announced a major change to their acceptable forms of payment. They will be forcing tens of thousands of small businesses across the country to pay for their advertising service by invoice or debit rather than credit card. This change will strip countless \"little guys\" of their cash back offers on credit cards. These cash back incentives help keep the lights on. For us, it's literally a line on our profit and loss sheet.\n\nWhy is Google doing this? Oh, they're doing it for us! From the mailer:\n\n>The\u00a0[Monthly Invoicing](https://notifications.google.com/g/p/ANiao5pqHLrUlLt159M2dZ0hyUs4tSBSTIn65DIq5yNdwWpJhk9bwbJ5ThcBNZnWNaO1IQV3vwIGVJ-BlFcQlEuqxvGQrYcDne8PUwZK_Z8ynxlSrDU9wsAGgVNJcg35f5B3EFLPkRgyi_7i94MwkkKOlN65BdWUlQU9UqxJGT-SbT_AHSfyE-E_f5aazfl9HV-aUlNkDU0yNuMOxmA99-5MXZsq2HT66jL7ZgfQFApD7W_E9yNSVjnIyW0S5pzsS5t8pATZ43pIwe7j1A)\u00a0billing method is best suited for your account(s) given the flexibility it provides high-growth customers (e.g. access to a credit line, monthly invoices with 30 days to pay, greater control over spend, more reliable).\n\nWhat the fuck is this copyrighter talking about? \"Greater control over spend. More reliable.\" Feels like he was really running out of steam selling this bullshit.\n\nThe reason Google is doing this is obvious: To make a zillionth of a % point more in profit this quarter.\n\nI'm here for one reason: Rally the fucking troops.\n\nI implore anyone reading this with an ounce of fight in their veins to kick up shit with whatever rep you know best at Google. There is no chance any one of us can make a difference, but if we can get a large community of people screaming we can at least make the Monopoly Man squirm.\n\nAre you with me???\n\n<insert american flag being held by big muscle guy here in your brain>\n",

            "Why would they do this, they're making tonnes of money credit card fees shouldn't be an issue for them.",
            "We haven't been impacted (or seen any emails yet) yet but this is super lame. There are several clients who will be very uncomfortable with this option. Especially with how Google does jack shit for click fraud. Credit card provides a last layer of protection for the advertiser.\n\nedit: Maybe, on the hopeful side, they're testing this out to see how people respond as there hasn't been an official announcement. \n\nIf so : GOOGLE THIS IS SHIT",
            "My organization just absorbed a competitor with a $5million per year budget. $3million of it done with credit cards. This company we absorbed used an agency for everything - including all Google Ads.  The agency owns the account.  They had several credit cards that are all in rotation.  It\u2019s wild.  I have been doing this since before AdWords ever existed and never seen this before.  I don\u2019t know why the agency managed billing in this manner - perhaps they couldn\u2019t get approval to invoice the entire amount?\n\nAnyhow, the agency also got this notice but we are already moving their accounts into our own so it\u2019s a non issue for us.  My point being it\u2019s not only the small businesses getting this notice.\n\nEdit: corrected the credit card spend.",
            "I have a few small clients with less than 1000 USD ad spend getting this email too\n\nThe thing is \u2026 some people live on credit and don\u2019t have like the 5k ad spend until they sell x products or make a commission check. \n\nI think this will kill some mom and pop businesses",
            "I am impressed they didn't open their own bank/payment processor to benefit from the fees but instead they did this which will make them lose clients",
            "Google needs to understand that offering credit card payments is a huge benefit to small businesses with uncertain or irregular cash flow.\n\n**Please contact your elected officials**. Also contact Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, who has done a good job of challenging Google (I'm not a Mike Lee fan, but the guy has authored some legislation to try and reel Google in and it's sorely needed).",
            "Now imagine a reality where everyone is finally moved on \u201cMonthly Invoicing\u201d, and then Google decides it\u2019s too risky, and rejects credit limit increase or worse scales back the credit limits they approved for accounts, next minute you need to make daily/weekly bank deposits just to keep your account within _Googles Defined_ credit limit if you want any chance of scaling your business. Before you know you need to make bank deposit repayments every other day, effectively 2 days credit facility and getting zero Card Protection / Benefits for it\u2026",
            "We lost, they have our a$$",
            "I'm totally with you but let's face it, google doesn't give a fuck about those spending less than a million or so per year",
            "This is a really bad thing for Google to force this on business owners, many of which rely on credit cards and even some rewards from credit cards, to run their business. This is essentially another example of Google's monopolistic behavior. I think all advertisers should band together and complain to their Google reps and make noise in the media about this. We should all spend less and lower our bids if they continue down this road, and vote with our wallets! Let's get our Congressmen involved to tackle this anti-business unilateral behavior which might even be illegal. Let's band together and spread the word far and wide about this that we don't agree with this and it will cause everyone to spend less with Google. As a business owner, I feel like this is absolutely an over - reach by Google and a prime example of corporate greed on their part. Google needs to hear advertisers screaming about this issue...in their support channels, with account reps, in the media and places like this forum. We should all move over to the Google ads support forums and complain their as well. We shouldn't stop until the reverse this terrible decision!"

        "content": "*this is not a complaining post so bear with me*\n\nI have a couple of years since I was using PMax campaigns for my store (edible decorations manufacturer company). In the last months, sales dropped big time. I thought \u201cmaybe I\u2019m doing something wrong\u201d, I started to read all forums, groups, got in touch with several companies (even people from Google Ads), nothing really helped.\nBasically, no matter the strategy I want to use, Google will eat my money, send tons of useless traffic and get just a couple of small orders. I checked everything, signals, tags, tag manager, headlines, pictures, videos, absolutely anything.\nThe shop is on Shopify, it\u2019s almost 6 years old, we have lots of customers database, GA4, everything works together, no errors. \n\nAnyway, here, on this sub, I saw some discussion where someone recommended to use a search campaign + classic shopping campaign instead PMax. I said \u201cwhat the \u2026\u201d and give it a try. \nWell, what can I say, I have at least similar or even better results at a fraction of the price. Now it\u2019s up to me to improve especially the searching campaign since the classic shopping campaign can\u2019t be customized too much (and that\u2019s a good thing). \n\nMy point is: if you see some bad results lately, just give it a try, for 1-2 weeks and, even if you won\u2019t see an increase in your orders number, at least you will pay much less than running a PMax campaign. At least this happened for me.\n\n*sorry for my poor English, not a native speaker",
