            "I'm having a weird framerate issue with Elden Ring. I just bought a new 1440p monitor to replace my old 1080p one. The game runs at a stable 60fps (game is capped at this, I don't want to go any higher) on medium settings, but it doesn't feel as smooth as it did on 1080p, and I'm fairly certain my PC can run it at this resolution. I want to play online, so disabling EAC or using performance mods isn't an option. Does this seem like a hardware problem or can I fix it somehow?\n\nMy specs are: RTX 2060 6GB, i5-12600k, 16GB RAM, TUF z690 D4 motherboard, Windows 11. New monitor is a Gigabyte M27Q, and I have it on 144hz",
            "I'm trying to install Windows but it says that it doesn't find any drives. It's true that I didn't install any memory device behind the moherboard, but I did put the memory slot and the 1TB SSD in the front of the motherboard, so why can't I istall Windows?",
            "What's up ya'll. I have an old and weak card with 4 GB of VRAM. As you know, it's super easy to fill that even when playing nearly a decade old games. Weird thing is I still get a solid 30 FPS in every game when using all the 4 GB & up to 2GB+ shared memory. I thought shared memory was supposed to slow everything to shit so I'm confused. Obviously not complaining, just looking for an explanation.",
            "I thought my wired x box controller was bad bc when I play baldi from steam or Roblox if I plugged it in USB then started game it would work fine but as soon as the keyboard was touched or I was AFK for a certain time it would default back to keyboard and mouse. No matter what I did the controller wouldn't work again unless I closed out the game and unplugged and plugged back in controller. My computer is old so I purchased a BT adapter via USB for it and connected my switch controller. Working great! Ok after first game realized it does the exact same thing. So it's not the controller. Removing from Bluetooth and adding every single time the games are played is very time consuming as I'm playing them with a small child with little patience. I've looked at stuff online and I see stuff about BT adapters and this and that but it's the exact same issue with a wired USB x box controller. I've also tried another keyboard to make sure any key wasn't stuck and that's not the issue either. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks",
            "When launching any Ubisoft game from steam, it says launching and underneath of that says running install script (Microsoft VC redistributable) and sits like that forever. The game never opens.\n\nAny ideas?",
            "What PC should I buy? I want to save up and get one of those with a box and a monitor. I want to use it to run VR games, and to have a lot of storage so I can download a bunch of softwares like Unreal Engine and Blender. I also want to be able to add on new storage components and graphic cards.",
            "since yesteday afternoon  i' m experiencing fps drops on war thunder , one second i have 70fps and the other i have 30fps resulting in stuttering. i tired to update my driver,change settings , turn off dlss, limit my fps but nothing.\n\nmy specs are nvidia 2070 RTX, 16BG ram, Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8700 CPU",
            "Not possible.\n\nA hardware audio mixer can combine two inputs into one output (the speakers), but they need to be using audio cables. If you're using HDMI for sound now, that won't work.",
            "Was the old monitor 60Hz?",
            "Is it shown in the BIOS?"
