Do I need to just do a clean wipe of my drive and start all over again? What is causing these issues?\n\nFor GG, I'll tab over to the game, I'll see it on my other monitor say it's recording, and then my keyboard flashes, goes dark, GG says no game detected, but then has a banner saying GG is recording.\n\nZero idea what's going on.\n\nEdit: And please don't suggest other recording software, I want to know what's going on because I've used both these programs for years with no issues and now my keyboard and clipping software refuse to work correctly since going to Windows 11 and reverting back to 10.",
            "Hi, so I'm trying to hit the new elden ring DLC, I played the previous game on an older 60hz monitor, since then I upgraded to a 144hz one, however the game looks weird and not smooth at all, on the other hand it looks really smooth on my 60 hz monitor, I've tried reducing the refresh rate and playing around with freesync/variable OD and other settings without success. Any Idea on how can I make my game as smooth as intended? I heard the disabling v-sync integrated in the game worked, it worked for me in kakarot that also has 60fps limit, but elden ring doesn't have this feature, appreciate any help. Thanks!",

So I rolled back my driver but the problem continued. I then tried to install many different game ready drivers but nothing changed. I then tried using a DDU and installing the latest driver but nothing changed. I then ran DDU again but this time I installed driver 537.58 as I heard it is the most stable Nvidia driver, however this did not resolve the issue. (I don't know if this is related to the issue, but everytime I use a launcher to run a game a new document is created titled \"launcher\" followed by a number.)\n\nAnyone know how to fix this?

You can expand your storage by adding another SSD from any brand as long it's one of the two sizes. Your Laptop also supports up to 32GB of DDR4 RAM with 3200MHz or 2933MHz frequencies on two SO-DIMM slots.  I personally wouldn't recommend trying to mix and match RAM and instead buy 2x16GB or 2x8GB DDR4 3200MHz SO-DIMM. (The \"SO-DIMM\" is important here, because of the form factor). Something to keep in mind is a note in the document saying that \"installed memory is actually 3200MHz but may run at 2933MHz due to processor limitation\". \n\nHere is an image of your laptop without the back cover: [https://www.notebookcheck.com/fileadmin/\\_processed\\_/b/0/csm\\_Lenovo\\_Legion\\_5\\_15IMH05H\\_Innereien2\\_72310f66ac.jpg](https://www.notebookcheck.com/fileadmin/_processed_/b/0/csm_Lenovo_Legion_5_15IMH05H_Innereien2_72310f66ac.jpg)\n\nYou can see the RAM modules in the middle and the M.2 SSD slots on both sides.\n\nOpening a laptop can be a little tricky sometimes.

I think thats why a lot of AAA games became souless and generic games overtime because they try to cater to everyone and eventually appealed to less and less people. O=ne of the best parts of Elden Ring is the interactive difficulty slider which makes it very accessible while keeping the original spirit of the game intact. There are many ways to \"cheese\" the game via optional ingame mechanics. \n\nYou have the NPC summons via ashes that you can also upgrade and level. You have the actual NPC summons near fog gates like in previous games. You can summon other players to help you through the area and with the boss. You can explore a majority of the map without killing a single boss and grab upgrade materials to max your weapons out. You can over level the area and kill bosses at high levels.\n\nIf you want a harder experience you just limit yourself, don't use the summons. Stay region locked and don't overlevel and don't use the thousands of 1 shot buff builds and bleed/frost builds.",

            "Elden Ring shines because its difficulty is seamlessly integrated into the lore and the world itself. You can adjust the game's difficulty to your preference, and both easy and challenging experiences are equally rewarding.\n\nIf you want to make combat easier, you can find items, weapons, clothing, skills, and upgrade paths that help you achieve that (you can literally 1 shot bosses). This approach, which requires players to explore and use their brains rather than a simple difficulty slider, is what makes Elden Ring so successful.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the hardcore crowd that purposely limit their skills / levels to make their playthrough punishingly difficult. This game has it all, for all players."
