        "content": "Hello\n\nFrequently Asked Questions are pretty darn frequent these days!  Liking or Not Liking the Master Collection is also a very frequent topic.  \n\nTo address this we're taking two steps:\n\n1) We are updating the [FAQ](https://old.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/wiki/faq) in terms of technical/objective information.  There's probably a bit more we could change, add, and remove as we go, which we will, but for now this gives us something to point people to when we remove frequently asked questions.  If you're feeling generous or helpful, you could also leave a link to the FAQ on someone's repetitious post, or even answer it, when you report it.  Feel free to leave suggestions for the FAQ!\n\n2) Asking you to have your say here on the Master Collection debate.  Nobody wants to stifle genuine discussion or archival of what's been changed, what's been messed up, what's been done well, what could have been done better etc.  So please take the opportunity to answer the question 'What's the deal with the Master Collection?' in this thread.  Posts about this or that comparison, change, or whatever are getting repetitive with, more importantly, the exact same debates playing out over and over in the comment threads.  Nobody is going to change their mind and nobody is learning anything new any more.  \n\n*We aren't completely going to remove these posts outright because it's still an important topic*, but we will prune them for the most active, or the stuff that isn't just turning into more shitfights, whatever.  This thread will be a resource we can point to so that the information itself isn't buried, but the front page isn't just the same argument over and over again.  Please post your comparisons, videos, links to threads you've already made and so on here, as well as your well-reasoned, calm and polite written appraisals of the Master Collection Volume 1.",

            "Honestly, the Master Collection (on PS5 anyway) is pretty good. If you really wanna hate yourself, start with the MSX games, but if you want to enjoy life, I'd just start with MGS1. They explain what happens in MG1&2, so it's not that bad. I recommend to play in release order, so that the story unfolds as it was being written, and once you finish 3 you could go back and play MG 1 and 2.",

            "just dont play the games in story order, it will be bad play a recent game and go to a older one. i am playing the order the games lauched",
            "I recommend starting with 3, then play 5, then play 4. Skip 1-2, they suck.",
            "just play them in the order they came out.",
            "Only thing I will say is to get ready for shit control schemes. They seem to plague the Metal Gear series unfortunately. I love MGS3 but hate push X to aim and get ready to shoot lol. Otherwise, the series is great and I would recommend it whole heartedly"

Kaz tried to martydom him and ended up being one of his biggest simps.\n\nHe has been shot at with missiles and guns of every caliber imaginable, he has been shocked with electricity, poisoned, nuked, his helicopter was shot down. He somehow survived being in silo while icbm was launched.\n\n\nAnd after surviving all that, and much more. This kid comes and kills him with a lighter and a spray bottle.\n\nI want to experience that boss fight. \n\nFrom both sides. I want to feel what its like to trick BB until you get to scroch him and see all legendary soldier shit raining down on you like a force of nature.\n\nAND i want to experience the fight as BB. Similar to boss fight vs Eli, but snake is armed to the teeth, slippery little fuck that you cant quite get a bead on ever and eventually he just gets you.",
