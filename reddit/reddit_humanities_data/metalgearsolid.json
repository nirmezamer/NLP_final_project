        "content": "Hello\n\nFrequently Asked Questions are pretty darn frequent these days!  Liking or Not Liking the Master Collection is also a very frequent topic.  \n\nTo address this we're taking two steps:\n\n1) We are updating the [FAQ](https://old.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/wiki/faq) in terms of technical/objective information.  There's probably a bit more we could change, add, and remove as we go, which we will, but for now this gives us something to point people to when we remove frequently asked questions.  If you're feeling generous or helpful, you could also leave a link to the FAQ on someone's repetitious post, or even answer it, when you report it.  Feel free to leave suggestions for the FAQ!\n\n2) Asking you to have your say here on the Master Collection debate.  Nobody wants to stifle genuine discussion or archival of what's been changed, what's been messed up, what's been done well, what could have been done better etc.  So please take the opportunity to answer the question 'What's the deal with the Master Collection?' in this thread.  Posts about this or that comparison, change, or whatever are getting repetitive with, more importantly, the exact same debates playing out over and over in the comment threads.  Nobody is going to change their mind and nobody is learning anything new any more.  \n\n*We aren't completely going to remove these posts outright because it's still an important topic*, but we will prune them for the most active, or the stuff that isn't just turning into more shitfights, whatever.  This thread will be a resource we can point to so that the information itself isn't buried, but the front page isn't just the same argument over and over again.  Please post your comparisons, videos, links to threads you've already made and so on here, as well as your well-reasoned, calm and polite written appraisals of the Master Collection Volume 1.",

            "Master Collection Versions\n\nPS5 Version: Pretty good. Seems to be the version with the most work put into it, as it is the only version to have properly rendered textures.\n\nSeries X Version: Many rendering issues. If possible, play the HD Collection through backwards compatibility instead.\n\nSwitch Version: Has frequent rendering and framerate issues. Go with a different version if possible.\n\nSteam Version (No Mods): Has the most problems of them all. Refer to the pinned bug/glitch mega thread for more info. Also, if you have weaker specs, purchase at your own risk, as MG1&2 and MGS2&3 may not run.\n\nSteam Version (With Mods): Extremely high quality experience. Easily the best version if you\u2019re willing to put in the work.",
            "START AT METAL GEAR ORIGINAL, PLAY MG2, THEN MGS1, THEN MGS2, THEN MGS3, THEN PEACEWALKER, THEN 4, THEN 5, BOOM YOURE DONE\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMASTER COLLECTION IS GREAT",
            "Honestly, the Master Collection (on PS5 anyway) is pretty good. If you really wanna hate yourself, start with the MSX games, but if you want to enjoy life, I'd just start with MGS1. They explain what happens in MG1&2, so it's not that bad. I recommend to play in release order, so that the story unfolds as it was being written, and once you finish 3 you could go back and play MG 1 and 2.",
            "I can only attest to the PS5 version of the Master Collection, so...\n\nIt's totally serviceable and fine. If you've never played the MGS series before and you want to dive in, then it's a perfectly fine and convenient way to play. Sure, some might gripe about the resolutions or framerate of a PS1 game, but none of these things will have an impact whatsoever on your enjoyment of the series. \n\nYou still get to experience the stealth gameplay, awesome voice acting, superb presentation, awkward controls, and ridiculous plots of all these games. None of the minor technical issues of these ports will be noticeable to you, honestly.\n\nThe technical issues for the PS5 version of the collection are mostly noticed by purists who have played these games to death and can spot a minor difference a mile away. Again, for me personally, none of these issues REALLY matter all that much (except for missing analog controls for MGS1. Seriously wtf?)",
            "I can't speak for the other platforms or versions but so far, Snake Eater on PS4 is basically the HD version with altered controls. CQC actually works  without being a pain in the arse!",
            "I often reply to these post by giving them a link to [this comprehensive google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19kZ0dNwTP7ll5JS-dzNsumHOGSr47dqPB_63IGjuIT8/edit#gid=0) I made to help newcommers. It is always very much appreciated and some users even asked that I submit it for the FAQ so that's probably the right time to do it. I'd be more than honored if you were add it to this sub's FAQ.",
            "My experience so far playing the Master Collection on Steam (with an Xbox Series controller, if you care to know):\n\n8-direction movement and slight input delay are hardly ideal in MGS1, but otherwise I don't think it's a *bad* way to play it, just one that takes getting used to. I'd still rather put up with control quirks than compromised content like in the old PC port. And hey, patches are on the way, so maybe they'll get fixed. In the meantime though, it's my understanding that the versions of the game on any PlayStation system from before the PS4 are better options if you have them (I do not.)\n\nMGS3 has really given me nothing to complain about, especially knowing I can boost resolution and texture filtering myself if I really want to. It feels like out of the main 3 games here, this is the one they knew they wanted to get right, and I'd basically say they have. I hear the Switch version isn't that bad either in spite of the limitations--guess it's the apology for the 3DS version, lol.\n\nHaven't touched MGS2 yet, may return to update about firsthand findings there when I have.",
            "I don't know if this really fits here, but it didn't feel like it was worth a whole thread. \n\nI'm getting the urge to do an MGS5 replay. I haven't played it since it came out. Considering legacy collection Volume 2 is likely to include it, should I wait? Do we think Konami is going to be able to bring the resolution and frame rate up to modern standards, considering how badly they bungled Volume 1? Planning on playing on PS5, as I still have my MGSV and GZ discs from PS4. \n\nAdditionally, is there any chance in hell they finish the game with this re-release?",
            "MGS V Phantom Pain will make you question yourself, MGS 4 will give you deppresion, Metal Gear Rising will make your adrenaline rush etc... be ready for awesome adventure.",
            "Start with Metal Gear (1987). The objectively correct order to experience any series with a cohesive plot is to go in the order they were released."
