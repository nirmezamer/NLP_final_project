        "content": "Hello! I know there are a lot of sellers on here, and I wanted to share some data I have complied of my most recent purchases through TCGplayer. \n\nMy goal was to see if there were any common denominators between sellers with which I had discrepancies regarding my order. So far, I don\u2019t believe I have found any. Once I made this little chart, I thought I would share it to share my perspective as a buyer. Whenever a card is missing from an order or the order is seemingly lost in the mail, I now have anxiety about messaging sellers because of some expressed sentiments I\u2019ve read of sellers dealing with an influx of messages from buyers having similar issues and suspecting they are scammers. \nMy order history going further back than my most recent purchase has an arguably worst discrepancy ratio. One purchase, consisting of 11 shops, had 2 orders not have a card and 2 orders never showed up (I\u2019d prefer a single card missing to the entire order missing). \n\nUltimately, I wanted to share this little spreadsheet, from the viewpoint of a buyer who sends a lot of \u201cmissing from order\u201d and \u201cwhere is my order\u201d messages in earnest- and sincerely wishes I didn\u2019t have to. I really have no financial incentive to get pennies refunded back to my credit card and whenever an order doesn\u2019t come in, I always try to ask for any possibility to get the cards over a refund (same with missing cards but most sellers prefer to just refund the cost of the card, which I don\u2019t necessarily fault them for). I have been very appreciative of the sellers who have communicated kindly with me, and I hope they don\u2019t think I am being dishonest as result of an increasing amount of buyers claiming orders are going missing. \n________________________\n\n\nOkay! On to the data!\nI placed one order for:\n- 406 cards totaling $109.28 \n- On May 28th. \n(I optimize my own cart over a period of days to achieve better savings, it is a painstaking process, but one I treat with care for such a large order).\n\n- 15 sellers were in this one order, all of which are certified with TCGplayer and have 99 to 100 positive feedback\n- the sellers were blurred because I do not want to promote any negativity to any one seller\n- I am located in Louisiana for reference as distance from the other states (trying to see if further away means longer shipping times or not)\n- I forgot to add the number of cards in each order and had to draw it in (sorry)\n\nPlease let me know if any of this data is helpful or useful in any way. Also *please let me know if there is any other data you would be interested in seeing* like if I had ordered from them before, how long they took to respond to a message, the types of cards missing, etc. :)",

The priority is to move cards from Sellers hands into Buyers hands! Of course cards that require tracking require a little more packing and shipping care, but if it's listed for sale in a store, it gets the same care as any other card in the store.",

            "I have a little whitelist/blacklist going myself for sellers that I really wish I could send to them. I do this sometimes as well, where I will do a bulk order of a couple hundred dollars across 3-5 sellers. Almost every time, most of the sellers are prompt and the packages arrive on time and then there's one dumbass that takes 3+ weeks longer to ship than everyone else. Almost a guarantee they immediately marked the order \"shipped\" but it doesn't get picked up for two more weeks, why is this a super common thing it should be reportable. I just want to tell these sellers \"you guys do realize EVERYONE else has set standards that you are failing miserably to meet, maybe work on that?\"",
            "I think you're data will be skewed by having such low dollar amounts and such high number of cards per order. \n\nLike one of those lines shows you paid $6 for 50 cards. I'd roll my eyes and not care much about that order as a seller too. \n\nIf you buy enough that the package is tracked the person packing the order will care more. I didn't have any problems in my mg3 orders.",

It's first one in, first one out. All of my stuff listed is categorized and organized for easy pick and ship. NO ONE has any excuse for bad customer service on this platform. Of course, emergencies happen. That's when a simple message to the buyer explaining that one has happened is necessary.",
            "The real value to me when I\u2019m selling is the possibility of a positive review and that isn\u2019t at all influenced by the price of the card so I always  make sure to ship cads with care no matter the price.",
