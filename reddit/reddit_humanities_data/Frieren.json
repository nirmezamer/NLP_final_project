Several people swarmed up to stop him and fortunately no one was killed.\n\nToday, they received awards from officials, and one young man that participated in the effort to stop the attacker dead ass said in his interview, in front of all the reporters, \"It's what Himmel the Hero would have done\".\n\nGuy is amazing!
