            "I'd also advise to evaluate string gauge and make sure your action is set appropriately. Playing steel cables with an action you could drive a truck through isn't doing your fingers any favors. Additionally, be mindful of fretting pressure. If your guitar is set up appropriately, work on using the lightest touch possible to fret clear notes. You don't see many proficient guitarists strangling their guitar (there are notably huge exceptions here, but they've conditioned long enough that it's not a problem).",
            "Me neither. Ive had some horrible pain in my finger tips, like I have road rash, or splinters, but never split them til they bled\n\nIve seen people with really dry skin though who have cracks in their fingers. I could imagine the guitar strings could cut those open",

            "As a dude who owns one, a did a couple for friends (luthier).\n\nYes it is. That is one of the high end clones with nibs and correct bridge. 300$ range.\n\nBut you can always tell by the clear coat, or at least to an trained eye. Poly is much more clear and sparkly, which gibson don use. While Nitro has more of an amber-luster look, if that makes sense.\n\nAlso, you would be able to tell by the serial, which is why there prolly isn't any clear image of the back of the headstock. The toggle switch is also wrong.\n\nBut a properly setup Chibson, is nothing to scoff about. Mine has gotten all hardware upgraded, and stainless steel frets. It plays and sounds like a dream.\n\nAnd there is no weight relief so its heavy af (good thing for me) and the neck is a baseball bat. Like, thicker than most genuine Les Pauls I tried."
