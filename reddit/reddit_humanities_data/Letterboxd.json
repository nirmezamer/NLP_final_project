            "I feel like I\u2019ve met a ton of great people thru this monthly profile share, so going again for June!\n\n[https://boxd.it/5Vsrp](https://boxd.it/5Vsrp)\n\nI try to watch at least three movies per week, and write a review for every movie I watch (some long some short depending on vibes). Last month, I changed up my four faves to be the most recent 4.5+ watches (new or rewatch) so that\u2019s been fun. I love scrolling thru reviews after I watch a movie, so I tend to be pretty engaging with other accounts.",
            "I think I've been using letterboxd for over a year now, and my watching habits are a bit sporadic but currently my top four are:\n\nFellowship of the Ring (2001)\n\nTwister (1996)\n\nJoyland (2019)\n\nThe Harder They Fall (2021)\n\nAs for June First Watches, I watched Brokeback Mountain for the first time, and Saving Face just yesterday, both where really good but in my personally opinion I enjoyed Saving Face more. \n\nI try to write long reviews but sometimes I just don't have much to say so it'll fall into a quip (usually with movies i've seen before)  but for others i can talk a lot. So if that's something you're into follow me? I guess?\n\n[https://boxd.it/5EgPZ](https://boxd.it/5EgPZ)",
            "Howdy, [here's my profile](https://letterboxd.com/chupakaibra/)! I'm a cartoonist and I tend to watch animated films, horror movies, and whatever else strikes my fancy. I prefer lighter movies so you'll usually see me log family films, campy/comedy-focused horror, and stuff that's in cinemas.\n\nI've been busy so haven't had too much time to log a ton of movies in the last few months but my favorite first-time watch of 2024 right now is probably *Ghostwatch* or *Late Night With The Devil*.\n\nI almost always follow back!\n\nRight now my Top 4 is just some random top favorites of mine:\n\n* *Small Soldiers*\n* *Who Framed Roger Rabbit?*\n* *Theater Camp*\n* *Malignant*",

Best thing to do is vote up any comments you see with no upvotes to counter it. I have done so. It is pretty silly really, someone is down voting people to begin with.",

            "My profile: https://boxd.it/6Wrcf (will follow back)\n\nSucker for a good horror/thriller, I love girlhood and friendship centred movies, psychological dramas and and genuinely good comedies. I\u2019m trying to get more into romance and action as genres and expand my list of classic/cult movies, so I\u2019d love mutuals that have as wide and random a taste as mine. I\u2019m active with reading/liking reviews because I love to add movies to my watchlist and take about 3 months to watch them. I also now have a lot more time to get through my watchlist after finally graduating!\n\nMy reviews are short/average length as I try and always do them spoiler free and essentially just brain dump what I thought (I take the \u201cdiary\u201d very literally). My star ratings tend to be very subjective, even if I thought the movie was very well done from a technical standpoint, I will rate based on my enjoyment whilst watching. \n\nWould love to follow other active users who just bring good vibes and thoughts to my feed! My only request is please don\u2019t follow me just to unfollow me as soon I return it so your ratio is really high :)",

I really just use Letterboxd as a movie diary so you're not going to find any philosophical life-altering reviews but hopefully you'll enjoy my rambling! Here's my profile https://boxd.it/1caIV. \n\nRecently saw \"I Saw The TV Glow\" and was overwhelmed with how much it made me feel. Would definitely recommend that!",

These are perfectly average movies.\n\nBut for something original: Now You See Me. Maybe one of the most mediocre films ever made. Forgettable but not offensive. Enjoyable enough to have on at a party, but I've never heard anyone say \"that was great\" about it.\n\nTl;Dr: Now You See Me",

            "For everyone debating whether a 3.1 average or a 2.5 average rating is \u201cmediocre\u201d, I\u2019d like you to know that individual ratings and average ratings differ in definitions. For example, if I give a film a 2.5, I\u2019d say that\u2019s an average film, however a film with a 2.5 average rating I\u2019d consider to be, according to the average, \u201cbad\u201d, because out of every single person that has given that film a rating, more people tended towards a bad rating. I mean, often times for a 2.5 average film the most given scores are 3 (6/10) and 2 (4/10), with the next most given score then actually being 2.5 (5/10). Meaning a lot more people have to dislike a film for it to have a generally lower average rating. What that means for me, is that the definitions of my personal ratings I give are completely different from the average score, though they don\u2019t vary vastly. A 3.1 average score, for example, I\u2019d think of as mediocre, whilst a 3/5 score that I give a film would mean I thought of it as enjoyable.",
