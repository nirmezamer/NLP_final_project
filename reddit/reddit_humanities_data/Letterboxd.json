Best thing to do is vote up any comments you see with no upvotes to counter it. I have done so. It is pretty silly really, someone is down voting people to begin with.",

            "The downvote users have been an odd plague on this sub for months now, it's entirely discouraged quality participation and left every post with a complaint or a joke or an insult at the top. Not sure if it's because this sub took off super fast or something, but it definitely caught a bug in these new and negative lurkers.\n\nAgreed on the upvote train though. I also find the block button has become effective after using it continuously for months.",

            "The lowest rated movie that I've given a 10/10 is Under The Skin (2013). Average rating: 3.6\nMy mind can't comprehend why it doesn't have a higher rating. Maybe the marketing was bad or maybe people who like Scarlett Johansson's popular roles didn't like this movie and just watched it for her. It is not for everyone for sure, but people who like these kind of movies also generally like this one.",
