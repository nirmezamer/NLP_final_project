            "Wow, this actually seems like a really solid meta analysis! Very thorough overview of the research, but with a perspective that understands whats actually relevant for trans youth and their care providers. Even covers a little history!\n\nI just wish the author would find an editor qualified for academic / technical articles It really sticks out on a piece like this if there are issues with tone, typos, etc. Still a great read though.",
            "Thank you for sharing this. 2 of my 4 kids are asking for puberty blockers. The only thing holding us back is the fact that we live in the middle of nowhere and our local doctor insists we need to see an endo.",
            "I was talking to a very openminded and intelligent classmate in my nursing program and she thought that doctors were giving testosterone or estrogen to teenagers because the media doesn't differentiate between hormone blockers and hormone therapies. When I informed her which meds were used and that the purpose was to postpone the most dramatic effects of puberty change until they could as an adult legally make their own decisions, she was like, \"wait, why would anyone disagree with this?\".",
            "Is this applicable to adults transitioning? Eg. GnRh in lieu of spironolactone?",
            "This research slaps. I'm Ftm and have had to argue with my parents in a lot of minor transrelated issues. They have stopped being catty when they realize I can actually  cute this kind of stuff about how much it improves lives <3 thanks so much for sharing!",

            "Interesting.  I don't think they had this when I transitioned as a teen in the late 80's.  I just took my mom's Provera and popped very strong Spanish Hormones.  It seemed to stunt my growth and physical appearance.  I know doctors have told me my bone structure never matured into a male.  Basically I got stunted as a teen and never grew and my shoulders never broadened and have my SRS at 20 years old just cemented everything.  I stayed a smaller gal.",
            "Thank you for this! I live in Ohio where anti trans legislation is rearing its ugly head. I shared this with a couple allies in the Ohio House ",
            "When the Mayo clinic gives puberty blockers to kids for medical reasons, they test the kids bone density very frequently. That doesn't seem like a \"minor\" bone density issue. Also, I've seen a couple of transwomen who did not have enough penis growth to make a vagina and the doctor used part of their colon. Are either of these possibilities explained when considering blockers?"

        "content": "I knew coming out wouldn\u2019t be easy, but this has just broken me\n\nSorry for the rant and if this is the wrong place, I just have no one else to tell.\n\nI\u2019m 29, amab, and about 6 months ago I came to the realisation that I\u2019m trans, after years of just lying to myself that it\u2019s just a kink and I can just indulge in private.\n\nAll 6 months I\u2019ve been filled with guilt, not so much for who I am. But for the fact that I didn\u2019t know how to tell my wife, the woman I love more than anything. Guilty that I had been hiding a part of me this big. \nThe guilt got even worse just over three months ago, when my wife gave me the best news in the world. We\u2019re having a baby. But I just felt terrible that I was keeping this secret from her, and that guilt was really starting to interfere with the happiness in other parts of my life.\n\nLast Saturday was my 29th birthday, and at the end of the day I had finally found the courage to tell her what I\u2019ve been feeling and going through.\nI\u2019m not great with words but I eventually got it out, \nI told her how bad I felt and that I wish I\u2019d have been able to tell her before she got pregnant, not because I wouldn\u2019t want to have a baby, just m honestly so excited for that.But because it hurt me hiding it so long so long from her.\nShe misinterpreted what I had said. Thought I didn\u2019t want this baby, she put her walls up, stopped talking, and then left.\nFor a bout two hours she didn\u2019t come home, I ended up having the first panic attack of my life, I thought I\u2019d ruined everything.\nShe came back just after midnight, I got her to open up and she told me how she thought I don\u2019t want to have this baby.\nEventually we were able to clear up that miscommunication and that I just wanted her to know about his part of me, and we went to bed together.\n\nThe rest of the week was quiet as we didn\u2019t see much of each other due to opposite work schedules. Thursday night we were able to have another long talk.\nWe were talking more about what I wanted, how far I wanted to go with this, it was hard for her because how sudden it felt, which I understand, I\u2019ve had a long time to think about this, she hasn\u2019t, and I want to give her all the time she needed.\nShe was worried that I might want to be with a man instead of her, which I told her is silly. I only want her.\nShe told me she\u2019d miss her big strong man, which I understand, and that our child would need a strong father figure, which I feel like I can still be, after all I\u2019ll still be the same person.\nBut she got quiet again and shut me out.\n\nFriday just broke me, barely a word to me after I got home.\nAfter a long time trying she finally started to talk, she told me her frustrations, that it was all so sudden, and that it felt like I always had answers ready to go for all the questions she had, which I did because I\u2019ve thought about this non stop for months. And I am trying so hard to open myself up and be completely honest with her.\n\nAnd then she said it.\n\nShe hates that she\u2019s pregnant now.\n\nIt broke me.\n\nI\u2019m at a point where I have to choose between my wife, my family, my home, my whole life as it is, or being myself.\n\nI can\u2019t make this choice, I can\u2019t sacrifice everything.\nI can\u2019t be that selfish. I can\u2019t loose her.\n\nSo i have to put all this behind me somehow, move forward and find away to accept myself as I currently am, a man.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nI\u2019m broken.\n\n",

            "I identify with this so much. Except for the pregnancy this has been my last couple of weeks. Theres been a lot of crying on both our parts and Im not sure our relationship is gonna make it. Which is killing me because I really do love her so much. Shes my best friend and I hate myself for putting her through this after so many years together. I cant imagine the added stress of knowing you have a child on the way as well. Im really sorry youre going through this and I wish for the sake of both of us I had good advice to give but I just dont. If you need a sympathetic ear though feel free to reach out. Im here to listen if you need someone. ",
            "Give her time. A lot of it.\n\nIf you're okay with it, tell her she can have a say in how much happens and when. I realize you might _not_ be okay with this. But it also might be something that'll make her more comfortable while she processes. It'll also make her feel like ner needs are important too, and they are. In the end, it might not limit you after all. She could soften and be accepting.",
            "That's a really tough situation, and it's important to remember that you're not alone in feeling this way",
            "You seem to have r/translater problems.  We also have some things in common if you wanna chat. I might have some insight, but I don't want to offend you and post it publicly.",
            "Wow! That is a lot for you and your wife. I didnt have a relationship when I began to come out and transition, but I did have a teen to explain it to. So I have it easier in so many ways and not at all the same experience. Please reach out to those here with similar experiences, scrolling through the comments it looks like youve made some new friends.\n\nIt also seems like from your description that she seems blindsided and you two may not be having the best communication right now. This is just a suggestion and it might not fit, but consider couples therapy and offer to slow down, let her catch up and make some smaller decisions together to start with - as you put it, youve thought about it for a long time, she hasnt. This situation does not make you selfish or broken, but it does mean the two of you are not only not on the same page, youre in different libraries looking at different books. Your situation is very tough, but not insurmountable. Its going to require some healing and patience for and from both of you.",
            "Hi op, let me know if you need to chat. Im in a different situation from you in that Im 50 and my kids are grown, but I came out to my wife 6 months ago and its been really hard. I might have destroyed a 25 year marriage. \n\nSo far Ive tried to take things slow in my transition, didnt come out to anyone else, didnt ask her to change my name or pronouns. My depression and dysphoria got too bad and I had to start HRT but I was micro dosing it for 4 months.",
            "I feel you, sister. Some days are just...ugh",
            "You both should be seeing a therapist, not the same one but preferably ones that know each other and have a working relationship.",
            "She will need a lot of time to process it. You took years to do so. She is now having to deal with shame and embarrassment, fear you're into men, loss of her social circles, etc. \n\nYou may consider marriage counselling with someone who is familiar with transgender marriages. If the marriage was solid before your reveal, you have a good chance of making it work, as many others have, including myself. I wish you both all the best."

And if she doesn't come around, it won't hurt as bad because you've already created that space to guard yourself."
