            "Wow, this actually seems like a really solid meta analysis! Very thorough overview of the research, but with a perspective that understands what\u2019s actually relevant for trans youth and their care providers. Even covers a little history!\n\nI just wish the author would find an editor qualified for academic / technical articles\u2026 It really sticks out on a piece like this if there are issues with tone, typos, etc. Still a great read though.",
            "Thank you for sharing this. 2 of my 4 kids are asking for puberty blockers. The only thing holding us back is the fact that we live in the middle of nowhere and our local doctor insists we need to see an endo.",
            "I was talking to a very openminded and intelligent classmate in my nursing program and she thought that doctors were giving testosterone or estrogen to teenagers because the media doesn't differentiate between hormone blockers and hormone therapies. When I informed her which meds were used and that the purpose was to postpone the most dramatic effects of puberty change until they could as an adult legally make their own decisions, she was like, \"wait, why would anyone disagree with this?\".",
            "Is this applicable to adults transitioning? Eg. GnRh in lieu of spironolactone?",
            "This research slaps. I'm Ftm and have had to argue with my parents in a lot of minor transrelated issues. They have stopped being catty when they realize I can actually  cute this kind of stuff about how much it improves lives <3 thanks so much for sharing!",

            "Interesting.  I don't think they had this when I transitioned as a teen in the late 80's.  I just took my mom's Provera and popped very strong Spanish Hormones.  It seemed to stunt my growth and physical appearance.  I know doctors have told me my bone structure never matured into a male.  Basically I got stunted as a teen and never grew and my shoulders never broadened and have my SRS at 20 years old just cemented everything.  I stayed a smaller gal.",
            "Thank you for this! I live in Ohio where anti trans legislation is rearing its ugly head. I shared this with a couple allies in the Ohio House \u2764\ufe0f",
            "When the Mayo clinic gives puberty blockers to kids for medical reasons, they test the kids bone density very frequently. That doesn't seem like a \"minor\" bone density issue. Also, I've seen a couple of transwomen who did not have enough penis growth to make a vagina and the doctor used part of their colon. Are either of these possibilities explained when considering blockers?"

        "content": "I knew coming out wouldn\u2019t be easy, but this has just broken me\n\nSorry for the rant and if this is the wrong place, I just have no one else to tell.\n\nI\u2019m 29, amab, and about 6 months ago I came to the realisation that I\u2019m trans, after years of just lying to myself that it\u2019s just a kink and I can just indulge in private.\n\nAll 6 months I\u2019ve been filled with guilt, not so much for who I am. But for the fact that I didn\u2019t know how to tell my wife, the woman I love more than anything. Guilty that I had been hiding a part of me this big. \nThe guilt got even worse just over three months ago, when my wife gave me the best news in the world. We\u2019re having a baby. But I just felt terrible that I was keeping this secret from her, and that guilt was really starting to interfere with the happiness in other parts of my life.\n\nLast Saturday was my 29th birthday, and at the end of the day I had finally found the courage to tell her what I\u2019ve been feeling and going through.\nI\u2019m not great with words but I eventually got it out, \nI told her how bad I felt and that I wish I\u2019d have been able to tell her before she got pregnant, not because I wouldn\u2019t want to have a baby, just m honestly so excited for that.But because it hurt me hiding it so long so long from her.\nShe misinterpreted what I had said. Thought I didn\u2019t want this baby, she put her walls up, stopped talking, and then left.\nFor a bout two hours she didn\u2019t come home, I ended up having the first panic attack of my life, I thought I\u2019d ruined everything.\nShe came back just after midnight, I got her to open up and she told me how she thought I don\u2019t want to have this baby.\nEventually we were able to clear up that miscommunication and that I just wanted her to know about his part of me, and we went to bed together.\n\nThe rest of the week was quiet as we didn\u2019t see much of each other due to opposite work schedules. Thursday night we were able to have another long talk.\nWe were talking more about what I wanted, how far I wanted to go with this, it was hard for her because how sudden it felt, which I understand, I\u2019ve had a long time to think about this, she hasn\u2019t, and I want to give her all the time she needed.\nShe was worried that I might want to be with a man instead of her, which I told her is silly. I only want her.\nShe told me she\u2019d miss her big strong man, which I understand, and that our child would need a strong father figure, which I feel like I can still be, after all I\u2019ll still be the same person.\nBut she got quiet again and shut me out.\n\nFriday just broke me, barely a word to me after I got home.\nAfter a long time trying she finally started to talk, she told me her frustrations, that it was all so sudden, and that it felt like I always had answers ready to go for all the questions she had, which I did because I\u2019ve thought about this non stop for months. And I am trying so hard to open myself up and be completely honest with her.\n\nAnd then she said it.\n\nShe hates that she\u2019s pregnant now.\n\nIt broke me.\n\nI\u2019m at a point where I have to choose between my wife, my family, my home, my whole life as it is, or being myself.\n\nI can\u2019t make this choice, I can\u2019t sacrifice everything.\nI can\u2019t be that selfish. I can\u2019t loose her.\n\nSo i have to put all this behind me somehow, move forward and find away to accept myself as I currently am, a man.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nI\u2019m broken.\n\n",

            "I can't imagine what it's like in your situation, that's really hard, and I'm sorry it's such a big weight to carry.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0I know it probably feels like the walls are caving in on you, but based on what you've written here, you're jumping to conclusions. It's really hard for your wife right now, but has she said you need to choose between transitioning and her?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0You said yourself that she's only had a small amount of time to think about things while you've had months. Give her that time, if you can. And give yourself some time, too. The best answers to tough situations are rarely simple, maybe you two can work out a gradual process that helps you both adjust.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIt's certainly possible she'll be completely opposed to it all, but if she's a good, caring partner, then she should want what makes you happy, too.\u00a0 I wish you luck with this difficult process, and I hope you can find joy in transition like so many of us have.",

            "That's a really tough situation, and it's important to remember that you're not alone in feeling this way",
            "Give her time. A lot of it.\n\nIf you're okay with it, tell her she can have a say in how much happens and when. I realize you might _not_ be okay with this. But it also might be something that'll make her more comfortable while she processes. It'll also make her feel like ner needs are important too, and they are. In the end, it might not limit you after all. She could soften and be accepting.",
            "girl, this hurt to read I hope you're doing okay\n\nthe comment about \"missing her big strong man\" definitely stings. coming out can be distressing for our partners, my girlfriend who is pan was also similarly concerned about my sexuality changing, and admittedly we had a rough initial talk which was exacerbated by the fact she was in a different country at the time. we were able to work it out and are in a better spot now than we ever were previously.\n\na couple of things, I think you need to ask her if she can see herself being happy in a relationship with a woman, I think you need to ask yourself if she is the right person to support you, and if the answer to both those questions is an enthusiastic yes, couples therapy\n\nand well, I think you know what you need to do if that's not the case",
            "I did the same thing a long time ago, my partner and I were separated and ACA made it easier to get care (never felt I was enough under the old guidance that forced us to only fuck men to be valid) I had started dating someone that let me start exploring things and I researched it. \n\nWhen we reconciled I pushed it all down, and it destroyed me inside and made me a shit dad, who was struggling with alcohol and suicidal ideation. Once I got on hormones all that kinda just went away because I was finally accepting it and the hormones stopped a lot of the background anxiety and depression I had become accustomed to over my life.\n\nMy kiddo is better off with a loving mother over a dead father.",
            "I'm sorry for you. I have two kids, parenting is great. I came out to my wife recently and she wants a third. \n\nI'd politely remind you that families are different. You don't have to be a man to be a father figure. (I don't consider myself a mother).  My dad is gay, I had two dads in the later half of my childhood. Some families only have one parent. \n\nI bottled these feelings up for 7 years of my son's life. My dad tried to be straight for 14 years of my life. You can't deny who you are, it's been shown not to work or shown not to work. \n\nYou did the right thing coming out. The truth will set you free. It's not going to be easy, but keep working at it. \n\nI hope your wife can work through her issues and accept you.  Pregnancy hormones aren't going to make this easier on her.",
            "You seem to have r/translater problems.  We also have some things in common if you wanna chat. I might have some insight, but I don't want to offend you and post it publicly.",
            "Wow! That is a lot for you and your wife. I didn\u2019t have a relationship when I began to come out and transition, but I did have a teen to explain it to. So I have it easier in so many ways and not at all the same experience. Please reach out to those here with similar experiences, scrolling through the comments it looks like you\u2019ve made some new friends.\n\nIt also seems like from your description that she seems blindsided and you two may not be having the best communication right now. This is just a suggestion and it might not fit, but consider couple\u2019s therapy and offer to slow down, let her catch up and make some smaller decisions together to start with - as you put it, you\u2019ve thought about it for a long time, she hasn\u2019t. This situation does not make you selfish or broken, but it does mean the two of you are not only not on the same page, you\u2019re in different libraries looking at different books. Your situation is very tough, but not insurmountable. It\u2019s going to require some healing and patience for and from both of you.",
            "Someone has to be honest so I\u2019ll be it\u2026 I\u2019m gonna defend your wife with this post; and it\u2019s not because I want you to suffer or not be your true self but\u2026.. (seems like you already feel bad) \n\nThe timing was shitty as hell. I mean\u2026 she just told you about the child and was obviously happy\u2026 \n\nI tell people all the time- the moment you decide to transition- you yourself become the biggest priority in your own life for a time period. It takes so much out of you. You need to decide what\u2019s the most important thing to you and if that\u2019s your wife then You are going to have to make some choices."

Totally can see someone routinely going through charts seeing certain things and Siring and going oh shit and it being truly genuine.\n\nBut, then again, I\u2019ve been gendered both ways by people for as long as I can remember. I have some friends who are very straight, very stereotypical masculine and they were always confused by how I acted and presented and thought that something might be wrong - which I view as them trying to make sure their buddy is okay because that\u2019s how they mean it - as narrow sighted as their overall view might be.\n\nThey\u2019d always tell me how to attract someone (to them cis woman), and I\u2019d always go \u201ci appreciate what you\u2019re trying to do, but the person I attract and want to attract is very different from who is attracted to you - so we\u2019re going for different things, and I\u2019m doing what I\u2019m doing because the person who I want to attract loves this that I\u2019m (doing/beings/wearing/presenting etc).\n\nI remember once saying \u201csome of the hottest women I\u2019ve ever seen were trans women in Tokyo\u201d and they usually think I\u2019m being weird or not seeing something and I just go \u201cwell, then you haven\u2019t met enough or realized who you were flirting with was trans,\u201d to recognize that you can be perfectly straight cis male and be attracted to a trans woman and still maintain your \u201cstraightness,\u201d because you\u2019re still attracted to a woman.\n\nBut that\u2019s very strange for most people.
