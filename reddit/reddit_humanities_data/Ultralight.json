            "I had my first black bear encounter backpacking this weekend.  My doggie and I had just broken camp, hiking along a ridge with really thick underbrush, when I hard a loud crashing through the underbrush, and realized it was a medium-sized black bear (maybe a yearling?) charging at us through the underbrush; maybe 20 yards away.  As soon as my brain had come to grips with what was happening, I saw another similarly-sized black bear charging at us from another direction.  The 2nd bear got to within about 10ft of us, before they both turned and disappeared back into the underbrush and were gone.  Maybe I yelled at them; maybe my dog barked at them; TBH I'm not sure.\n\nI'm not sure what, if any, lessons to take away from this experience.  I don't carry bear spray, and even if I had, I don't think I could have deployed it effectively.  From the time I saw the 1st bear until the 2nd bear was right by me was maybe 20 seconds (maybe less?  Hard to judge time when my adrenaline's flowing).  I guess the biggest takeaways for me are a reminder to be aware of your surroundings, and the importance of food safety in bear country.  I had camped less than a mile from where this occurred, so it seems likely that the bears could have wandered by my campsite during the night.  I had done a reasonably good bear hang the previous night, but TBH, I don't always.  Maybe it's a sign that I should bite the bullet and buy a bear can.",

        "content": "It\u2019s awesome to see this community thriving and increasing curiosity with the Ultralight lifestyle. I see a lot of fair questions about gear that come from non-UL folks, folks aspiring to UL, or simply lightweight backpackers looking for recs. It seems this sub has become something of a big tent forum, perhaps to the chagrin of some. \n\nOften, when an OP self-identifies a base weight in the teens without much desire to shakedown, folks are quick to recommend the r/lightweight sub. As a member of both subs, it\u2019s clear there is a exponentially larger and more active community in UL. In fact, the community is currently 10x: nearly 700k in UL vs just over 7k in lightweight. r/lightweight sees relatively little engagement on most posts, so it\u2019s just not nearly as robust of a resource. \n\nI\u2019d wager this is inversely proportional to the *actual* ratio of lightweight to ultralight hikers on the trail, and this sub actually has a huge contingent of non-UL members.\n\n1) In your view, what the allure of this sub? what makes r/ultralight so much more robust than many other backpacking-focused subs?\n\n2) Is lightweight just a waypoint on the way to ultralight OR is lightweight still the end goal for most folks in the backcountry? \n\nEdit: correction r/ultralight has 100x the followers as r/lightweight",

            "I'm not UL and might not ever be. But this sub is an amazing resource for shaving weight. I think applying the tips and tricks I gather here allow me to get my weight down in certain areas while still carrying other luxuries.\n\nBy getting my shelter and sleep system down in weight maybe that allows me to bring a chair or other comforts.\n\nEDIT: I feel like r/lightweight exists solely to post lighterpack  lists that don't get ridiculed or laughed at",
            "The people who are willing to look at all their gear through the ultralight lens are the ones who hold the most expertise in shedding weight, which is something a lot of people are trying to do, even if they're not trying to hit the ultralight level. If we make the community too broad, the people with that expertise will get bored/annoyed and leave and the value of this community as a knowledge hub declines significantly. It doesn't matter that many of the subscribers here rarely actually go sub 10lbs base weight (raises hand). It does matter that we value that expertise and we don't \"waste\" it by cluttering this sub with questions that fly in the face of ultralight ethos. Going ultralight is a joy and sharing that knowledge is a joy. No one is being forced to do either. Being asked 10x per week which tent you should choose, out of a set of tents that no one with ultralight ambitions would ever consider, erodes the sharing joy. Mods are always trying to find the right balance, and they're volunteers too. And, fwiw, being constantly told how they should run things to meet everyone's needs robs their joy also. (Thanks for all you do, mods)",
            "Anyone can throw money at lighter versions of what they already have. What makes r/ultralight special is thinking about entire systems of gear and optimizing for interactions between different gear in different environments.\n\nWhat gear is *truly* necessary? Is it still necessary if you change something else about your setup? How can you combine what you already have to cover a different use?\n\nI\u2019m reminded of a thruhiker that went through a shakedown. The person performing the shakedown questioned the need for a pot-scraper. The thruhiker in question threw his spoon into the \u201cunnecessary\u201d pile and said the pot-scraper was a better spoon than the spoon was a pot-scraper. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to agree with this specific scenario, the point is reframing your thought process allows for some counter-intuitive setups that just may work better for you than following convention.",

            "I'll be honest: I have never backpacked in my life. Where I live it's just not as easy/alluring as in countries like the US. However, this subreddit has been invaluable in providing information for improving my day hikes and, especially, for shaving a lot of weight from my backpack when traveling. This is probably the first comment I've made on this sub, because I actually don't have anything to contribute. A lot of people here are already extremely knowledgeable.",
            "My last overnight trip I walked 20 miles to my camp spot carrying 18kg. Lightweight I ain't.\n\nI read this sub to fantasise about UL gear that I might buy, to inform my own judgements about the balance between weight and luxuries, and because it's a community of people who also enjoy the outdoors.\n\nI've learned a lot about materials and kit from being here, although I can't see myself ever getting below 8kg or so, particularly because I like to drink a few beers and eat a homemade curry after a day in the hills and I'm addicted to snivel gear.\n\nGiven that I have osteoarthritis in both ankles that surgery so far hasn't really mitigated, I will probably move towards a more lightweight setup as finances allow - the bone-on-bone pain probably wouldn't be so bad if I reduced the voluntary weight on my shoulders.\n\nI'm not UL so I just lurk so I don't detract from the 4lb Gods.",
            "Moderators here are the biggest allure.\n\nDon't look at my lighterpack because you might find a chair.",
            "The allure of this sub is that r/lightweight is dead",
            "This is a tricky one and these views on it might ruffle some feathers BUT another factor that shouldn't be overlooked is UL being a big cool sexy trend. What sounds more cool to you: ultralight or lightweight?\n\nAn unintended not unavoidable side effect of the big tent dynamic (in all subcultures that become popular) is that you'll have lots of folks show up and try to redefine and \"expand\" what UL means and insist that their lightweight or even heavyweight ethos and methods are in fact UL in order to claim the coveted moniker and status for themselves. I'm not going to elaborate on this but iykyk lol.\n\nI'm all for being inclusive and open but it's a slippery slope since the values, methods, and culture will inevitably become heavily appropriated and watered down due to the popular appeal of UL. And from a sociological perspective we've seen this time and again in countless historical moments and social movements.",
            "1. The people with the most backpacking knowledge are here. Those who are inclined to go, \"Meh, 15 pounds is fine,\" will tend not to develop the encyclopedic knowledge of backpacking gear, materials, techniques, philosophy, etc. that some users here have. This sub will always draw the most questions because it's capable of giving the best answers. It's also notable that knowledgeable people continue to post here because it's aggressively and appropriately moderated.\n\n2. I think lightweight is neither an endpoint nor a waypoint. It's more a solution to a problem (pack hurts) for people who have no interest in getting really nerdy about gear. Most people will do a few pack-lightening moves, go, \"Okay, hey, the pack's pretty light for my 10-mile days, and I'm having fun,\" and leave it at that. I think that's 100% fine, and I'm totally happy to answer questions and help people out who aren't as fanatical as I am."
