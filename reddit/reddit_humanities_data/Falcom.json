        "content": "Let's be honest. We've been getting so many of these \"I want to start Trails but I don't know where to start\" (which is usually thinly veiled euphemism for \"I don't want to play 2D games, can I start with Cold Steel 1, instead of starting with the first game which is common sense?\") that it's getting rather annoying, and the fact we don't have a pinned post or an FAQ is frankly embarassing. So I decided to do the community service and create a comprehensive, complete guide to Trails and Ys.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/39j5vky7z05c1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6c97737402f97e65b4d397b6b8b09700019ebe19\n\n**Trails series**\n\nUnlike other long-running JRPG series like Final Fantasy or Tales series, **Trails series has a single continuous plot that starts from Trails in the Sky**. Despite what the marketing may tell you, each of these games--with perhaps a few exceptions--expects the players to have played the previous games. The plot points from the previous games feature heavily in the side and main plot of the successive titles. The characters from the previous games often show up in later games not just as a cameo, but as significant characters both as playable and non-playable characters.\n\nTrails series consists of several arcs. Each arc deals with a single region with their own plot points and main party. **However, these arcs are not standalone**; because of how intricately connected the world of Trails is, what happens in one arc heavily influences what happens in the other and vice-versa. Most common comparsion is the MCU, where they all share a single universe and events of one film affect events of another film with completely different cast of characters. **It is absolutely NOT recommended to start in the middle of an arc**. I will go over each arc here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Trails in the Sky** \\- There are three games here, FC, SC and The 3rd. Think of FC and SC as two parts of a single game (like Kill Bill Vol. 1 and Vol. 2) and The 3rd as the epilogue (each arc is considered one game in Falcom's internal numbering system). **This is the only place you can start without any compromises**. This is the correct place to start. The problem is, the official Western localized version of Sky is only available on **PC and PSP**. While it runs on practically any PC that is still running now (I ran it on a netbook that came out in 2012, so yes, it will run on just about anything), not everyone has a PC. Being it on PSP means you can also play it on Vita.\n\n**Trails from Zero/Trails to Azure** \\- This duology, also known as the Crossbell Arc, takes place in a new region, with a new main protagonist and main party, one year after the events of Sky The 3rd. The first half of Zero does start off as a standalone experience, so it's good at easing you into the series. However, **the two main characters from the Sky Trilogy feature heavily in these games, and they play a crucial plot point in Zero**. Their story also picks up right after what happens in The 3rd, and the game more or less expects the players to know it. These games are also concurrent with the next arc, Trails of Cold Steel, meaning they happen roughly at the same time as Cold Steel 1 and Cold Steel 2. There are some references to what's happening in Cold Steel, especially in Azure, but it's bare-bones at this point since these games were made BEFORE the Cold Steel games. Some people argue that Azure spoils the twist of Cold Steel 2, but honestly, it's not that big of a deal since that twist really only is the starting point for the involved character in their own arc (and it's pretty predictable too). What is clear is that **these games are intended to be played before Cold Steel**, even though they happen at the same time. The games are on **PC, PS4 and Switch**, with PC and Switch versions being the superior versions. There is also Chinese/Korean only version on Steam published by Cloud Leopard Emporium, so if you are buying the games on Steam, be careful to buy the version you can understand (this extends to all the other games other than Sky).\n\n**Trails of Cold Steel 1 and 2** \\- Now, this is what throws people off. Cold Steel arc (or Erebonia Arc, which is the region it takes place) has 4 games, and Cold Steel 1 was the first game to be made in full 3D engine. The first Cold Steel game was also made in mind as the \"new\" starting point of the series. This does not mean it's a reboot; it still has tons of references to the previous games, and a lot of things that gets mentioned in the in-game newspapers are referring to what is happening in Zero and Azure. But at least **the main plot of Trails of Cold Steel 1 is completely standalone affair, and you do not need to have played the previous games**. **This is the second best starting point of the games**. The issue is that Trails of Cold Steel 1 ends with a cliffhanger that goes straight into Trails of Cold Steel 2, and **Cold Steel 2 is NOT a standalone game**. The expectation was that when CS1 was released, people would go back and play the previous five games before starting CS2. A lot of references do start to get noticeable, and if you haven't played the previous games, you get the feeling you are missing something, especially with Azure. Still, **it's generally accepted (at least in the West) that playing CS2 without playing anything other than CS1 is good enough**. I would say that is true... until the Epilogue. **The Epilogue of CS2 (which is sizable) is NOT meant to be played without having played Azure**, because it spoils the one of the biggest twists of Azure AND it picks up right after what happened in Azure. Cold Steel 1 and 2 are available on **Vita, PC, PS3 and PS4 (remaster)**. The Switch versions are Japan-only.\n\n**Trails of Cold Steel 3 and 4** \\- I've separated these two from the first two games because while they are still part of the Erebonian Arc, they also happen roughly 1 year after the epilogue of CS2, and while the main protagonist is the same, the main party is not. CS3 was also the first game localized by NISA in the West, and so there was some marketing by NISA that you could start here. **CS3 is NOT the place to start Trails series**. In fact, **if you started with CS1, you are required to play the previous games (or at least watch the summaries of them) before starting CS3 since it very much deals with Crossbell and its characters**. And CS4 is more or less culmination of all the games up to that point, including Sky Trilogy. These games are available on **PS4, PC and Switch**.\n\n**Trails into Reverie** \\- While it looks like it's a standalone game, it actually is an epilogue for both Trails of Cold Steel 4 and Trails to Azure, with Trails in the Sky also being heavily featured. You simply cannot start with this. You will not understand a single thing. This is available on **PS4, PC and Switch**.\n\n**Trails through Daybreak** \\- Not yet out in the West yet, Daybreak currently has 2 games, with another one coming at some point--we do not know how many games it will have. **Daybreak is supposed to be the start of the the latter half of the series, and is designed similarly as Cold Steel 1 that it's more or less standalone**. While characters from previous games do appear again, their arcs are more or less wrapped up or is not that crucial to the main story. Reverie has some background short stories in it that sets up the story in Daybreak, but as far as I know, they are not mandatory. **However, Daybreak 2 requires playing the previous games** (especially Zero and Reverie). These games will be available on **PS4, PS5, PC and Switch**. We don't know what platform the next entry in this arc will be on, and the Western versions of Daybreak 2 may skip Switch and PS4, depending on when it comes out.\n\n**The Legend of Nayuta: Boundless Trails** \\- While it has \"Trails\" in its title, **it is currently unrelated to the rest of the Trails series**. The reason why it's \"currently unrelated\" is that while the in-game story has no actual connection to the lore of the Trails series, Falcom always leave things vague in terms of possible connections in future whenever this question is brought up in their interviews.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn summary: to get a full Trails experience, **starting from Trails in the Sky FC is the only way to experience this series without compromises.** Characters from Sky continuously show up in later arcs, often as significant characters, and you do miss a lot from the references since the biggest strength of this series is the worldbuilding and the continuously story.\n\nIf you cannot play Sky Trilogy because you lack the means to do so, **starting from Trails from Zero after watching summaries for the Sky Trilogy is the next best option**. This way, you more or less are still starting from the beginning with sufficient knowledge--even though you will not get the personal connection to Sky characters, which does diminish the impact of their re-appearance in later games.\n\n**Starting from Trails of Cold Steel 1 itself is good, only if you are willing to go back and play or experience the previous games in some way or other after playing Cold Steel 1**. You can play CS2 until the main final boss but before the epilogue, since the very first moment of the epilogue heavily spoils the ending of Azure. **Cold Steel 3 expects the players to have played all the previous games, since both Sky Trilogy and Crossbell Arc characters and plot points feature heavily in CS3 and CS4**. And Reverie, well, you will not understand what's going on at all if you start from there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the end of the day, **the only way to really experience this series fully and in the intended way is to play all the main series titles in the release order**. There is no way going around it. Any deviation from this is a compromise and will not give you a full experience since the main plot continues throughout the entire series. **If you start from another game, it is still recommened that you go back and play (or at least watch the summaries of) the games you skipped before continuing**, because these games build upon each other.\n\nYou can start from something other than the release order. A lot of people, especially outside of Japan, did. But it's also true that you won't get the best experience if you don't play the series in release order, and some of you may come to regret it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/73ehyuc9z05c1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0b88a354e267c38c1d86bc7c640e9ebda5bc67b3\n\n**Ys Series**\n\nThankfully, Ys series, the other flagship series of Falcom, is much more lenient when it comes to this issue. If Trails series is the MCU, Ys series is more like the Indiana Jones series: **each new entry is very much standalone**, and they all have their own, independent world-altering crisis that the main character has to deal with, in a region that is completely isolated from other regions. In fact, Ys series is not chronological, as the in-game explanation is that each game is \"an adaptation\" of the main character's own journals. Technically, we already know how the story of Ys series ends--Adol, the main character, has numerous adventures, leaves them in writing in journals, and \"goes missing\" at the age 63 or so while searching for the North Pole. There are SOME hints about the greater force at work in this world, but they are bread crumbs, and they don't really connect to the main story of other games.\n\nThe main issue with Ys series is not \"where to start\" and more of \"which is canon,\" because of the series' convoluted history. For example, there are four Ys 4 titles, and only one of them is canon. Thankfully, it's mostly streamlined if you only have access to Steam: basically, if it's on Steam, it's canon.\n\nBecause how wildly different each \"engine\" is, Ys is grouped not as a story arc, but with gameplay design. There are basically 4 \"groups\" (tho it can depend on who you ask).\n\n**Ys I & II Chronicles** \\- These are the remaster of the remakes of the first two games in the series. These two are grouped together because they are actually only purchasable together. They are also the only games where the story is directly connected--Ys 2 is the direct sequel to Ys 1, and they deal with the same region and same phenomenon. In fact they are the only games that actually takes place in Ys (it's a place name), and the rest of the series actually has nothing to do with Ys.\n\n**Ys VI engine games** \\- These include Ys VI, Ys -Oath in Felghana- and Ys Origin. Ys VI was the first game Falcom began actually making up consistent lore for the franchise. Because of that, there are some references to this game in later titles, though the main plot of this is completely standalone (it's also the only game that takes place in a different continent). Oath in Felghana is remake of Ys III, and is also very much standalone. Ys Origin is a prequel to Ys I and II, but takes place a long time before it, with its main story being more or less standalone as well. However, it is recommended you play Ys Origin after you have played Ys I and II for the best emotional engagement with its story (it's good).\n\n**Ys SEVEN and its iterations** \\- These include Ys SEVEN, Ys Memories of Celceta, Ys VIII and Ys IX. However, because these titles are far apart in terms of release dates, there are significant differences when it comes to how they play. The consistency is from that they are all party-based, skill-based games. Plot-wise, all these games are standalone. While Ys Memories of Celecta is a \"remake\" of Ys IV, it is also the only Ys IV made by Falcom, and therefore the only one considered canon.\n\n**Ys X** \\- The latest entry (not out in the West yet) has done away with the party system. It takes place after Ys II and before Ys Memories of Celceta.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn summary: **you can start with any game, as long as it's not Ys II, which should only be played after Ys I**. It is recommended that you play Ys Origin after Ys I and II but it's not necessary. You can skip games if you don't like a certain gameplay style (the \"bump attack system\" for Ys I and II is not for everyone, though I think they still hold up). There are some lore connections to each other and to the larger lore (especially after Ys VI), but the \"order\" is not really important at all.\n\nNote that I have not included Ys V here. That is because it's the \"black sheep\" of the franchise. It's on SNES and there is a fan translated version of it, but it is not considered great, and every time Falcom teases a new Ys game, there is always a call for its remake (other than the PS2 one by Taito which is forgotten for a good reason). Even the Falcom CEO said remaking Ys V is something he wants to do before he retires from the company.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Start with Trails in the Sky FC for Trails series, start with anything on Steam (except for Ys II) for Ys series.",
