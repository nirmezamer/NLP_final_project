            "MBKHD doesn't get access to people like Tim Cook because he is overly critical of their products.",
            "Louis raised valid points. But yeah I guess mkbhd needs access to Tim Cook to side step his fellow creators and this was the price to pay, all influencers are just shills of some brand that you dont realize until you see them post a blatantly obvious video like this. Fuck apple for creating that atmosphere and fuck them for normalising that behaviour and having others copy that to replicate their success\n\nLouis needs to call out videos like these because they do give people a false impression of apples stance towards true repair accessibility. In the end I understand some dont like his overly negative outlook of everything but hes probably frustrated because he has been fighting for years against this bullshit with only a few major wins recently. I respect the man for what hes given us. I hope mkbhd takes the feedback from his comments section from that video and evaluates what he wants. An interview with pre-scripted answers to questions we dont care about and know the PR answers to will not be of any value in the end anyway. So if he doesnt sit with Tim each year that doesnt bother me, Id still watch his reviews. But Id stop watching if I feel like he caters way too much to them to the point the reviews leave out obvious issues (we already know this for a long time now) so yeah he needs to think clearly and decide before he alienates a core part of his audience",
            "I mean, he's not wrong.\n\nI am curious what tech he personally uses though, since almost every company can have holes poked in their systems. Google Pixels are possibly the least reliable smartphones I've ever used, to brutal levels, Samsungs have some issues too, etc. I see he has a ThinkPad in the video, which makes sense to me. Generally somewhat reliable. I'm curious what the rest of his tech looks like.",
            "MKBHD lost the plot a long time back. The reason I enjoyed his videos was he was always providing a fresh perspective on gadgets and actually used products before providing reviews. But nowadays he's just reviewing Apple and Samsung. Coz thats gonna get him most views.",
            "speaking the truth is not really firing shots",
            "I cant take Louis Rossman any more seriously than I can take MKBHD. I just watch videos to see whats up. I stopped watching Rossman because he constantly has a stick up his ass.",
            "It is an ad after all, so naturally Marques is going to say only good things about it without any push back.",
            "As someone that doesn't follow Rossmann and came into this video kinda as an outsider, he really has a hate boner for Apple. I also don't really understand the hatred thrown at MKBHD whether you like him or not. \n\nMKBHD had an interview with Apple, someone who is in the tech space but not in the repair space that Rossmann is, and Rossmann basically wanted MKBHD to grill Apple on their repair policies and since he didn't he calls it propaganda?? I just don't understand it.",
            "I get that MKBHD attacks tech from a more consumer side than Rossman who looks at it more on the technological side. But with the reach MKBHD has I wish he would call out some of these companies practices more than he currently does. I feel like some of his Tesla videos especially the one where his car couldn't make a left turn and had to get repaired shortly after he bought it wasn't as negative as the video should be. I'm not looking for him to bash the company or companies for any reasons but with a reach like his I feel like he should be bringing up legitimate concerns that consumers have and be a good advocate.",
