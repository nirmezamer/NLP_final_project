I had stumbled across this subreddit a couple of months prior, and I thought that the discomfort that it caused was \"the spirit\" warning me about lies, turns out it was just cognitive dissonance.\n\nTo my surprise, the responses to my post were not rude or demeaning at all! I also didn't know that there were ex-bishops and ex-stake presidents here, that kind of blew me away. Some people even prophesied that I would come back in a couple of years, and those prophesies have come true.\n\nI had a different account back then and I lost the password so I can't find the post, but if anyone wants to go searching for it, it's from the first half of 2019, probably sometime between April and June.\n\nAnyways, I cringe a little bit thinking about it now, but I'm just happy to be out and join this community!",
