        "content": "I\u2019m fairly new to the Dark Souls series, and please don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014I love *Dark Souls II* as it was my first Souls game. However, after playing *Dark Souls I*, I now understand what people meant when they said that *Dark Souls II* was a downgrade.\n\n*Dark Souls I* is mostly excellent. I did have some unpleasant and frustrating experiences with the game as well. For example, Sen\u2019s Fortress was really annoying with all its traps, and I tried to rush through it, which only led to getting trapped even more. The Tomb of Giants also had some frustrating enemies, particularly the Skeletal Dogs\u2014I died to them more times than I died to Nito.\n\nThe Abysswalker Artorias and the Lord of Cinder were quite challenging, and I think they broke some of their own rules a bit. I started the DLC only after defeating the four main bosses, and I noticed that Artorias and the Lord had many attacks with lingering hitboxes that are hard to dodge. To avoid their splash attacks, you need to be both fairly far from the attack and dodge at just the right time. This is mostly true for Artorias; dodging the Lord\u2019s attacks was a bit easier, but I still haven\u2019t encountered many other bosses with similar lingering attacks that counter the dodge mechanic.\n\nAside from these challenges, I\u2019d say about 90% of the game was perfect. The location design was *chef\u2019s kiss*. Anor Londo was gorgeous with its oversized, tall white structures. The Painted World of Ariamis felt like it was frozen in time and forgotten. The Crystal Cave made me want to buy a couple of amethyst geodes, and New Londo Ruins was my favorite\u2014its flooded city ruins with mountains of corpses at the bottom reminded me of the Dead Men of Dunharrow from *The Lord of the Rings*.\n\nIn *Dark Souls II*, I liked Majula and the design of Shrine of Amana, but that's about it. The other locations in DS2 now feel rather dull in comparison.\n\n   ",

            "I like DS2 too, but the downgrade of map design was rough. (I played DS1 first)",
            "Just a friendly request, please man, call Gwyn by his name",
            "I disagree with the assessment of ds2. I respect that people like the first game better. I played ds1 first and loved it. I found all the running around a bit tedious. The rolling in only 4 directions suck as well. Mostly, i love the rpg mechanics better in ds2. While many people are not a fan of agility stat, i thought it a cool feature and wish they kept it going forward because the constant rolling around is a bit silly to me.",
            "DS2 is the best Dark Souls!",
            "I love DS2 in his own way but yeah after DS1 it sure feels a bit off, im with you man ",
            "I have more hours in DS2 than 1 & 3 combined. The reason? Compared to DS1, the PvP was great. Many hours were spent at the duel arena. Many more hours were spent making new builds to use in the arena. The actual game is a B-, while I'd put 1 & 3 at A and A-. (Elden Ring and Bloodborne I'd rank A+, just for comparison's sake.)\n\nBut some of the most fun I've had in souls was scaring the shit out of people during duels by using a ring to appear as a human instead of a phantom, combined with the red eyes ring, and power stanced Bone Fists. Many people would gesture and message to appreciate the build. Good times.",
            "While DS2 is my least favorite soulsborne game, id say its still in my top 20 games all time. I only plays SOTFS version. I think I read something before that people were hating on the original and said SOTFS was a huge improvement.",
            "The biggest problem DS2 has is that DS1 existed which in my opinion is the greatest game of all time. \nToday we also got other FROM games and DS2 is often viewed as the poorest sibling. If this was the only FROM game everyone would just love it.",
            "I played Demon's first so DkS1 was never the eye opener that it was for many people. Of course I enjoyed it, but for me DkS1 and 2 are the weakest of all Souls games"

I love how perfect the level design is, the colors, the lighting, the nostalgia that I can feel without even having played it at the time (until it came out I was 3 years old) and that feeling still passes. I love how the bosses are simple, not that difficult, but they work really well. My favorites so far are O&S, Sif and Queelag. O&S have such a magnificent design and the battle flows so well (unlike Ds2's  duo fights). Sif has such a simple design, but it's such a good idea and so well executed that it's incredible, a wolf with a sword that has an impressive lore. Queelag was pretty easy compared to the area that she is (fuck blighttown) but she has a very good design. Anor Londo is my favorite place so far.",
