Complete silence during the process, very respectful atmosphere. If not, they will stop in their tracks and yell at you as a warning. \n\nThe tomb is guarded 24hrs and is considered one of the highest honors in the military. Very strict guidelines that have to be followed. This is a ceremonial process, but has actual checks/processes.",

When I was leaving for another job after a decade, at my farewell speech one of my senior managers mentioned, how initially the entire floor felt when I used to walk in. I was like oh damn! And started to sink into my seat \ud83d\ude29.  To my surprise, he went onto say, within a few months he realised the positive energy was rubbing off when I had taken a four week holiday and everyone kept asking him about me and if I was okay? He further went on to mention how this chirpy attitude first thing in the morning helped some perk up and this is one of the things he and colleagues on his floor are going to miss the most! \n\nWhilst this may have been rehearsed (I don\u2019t know) I read one or two comments along those lines. I am sharing this with all of you with hope that some of us may be able to appreciate the little gestures that bring and/or enhance positivity around us.

The kid who comes positive every day gets the benefit of the doubt from his peers and his teachers. He makes a mistake and it goes so much better for him.",
