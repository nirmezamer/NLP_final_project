            "Don\u2019t quite understand your example that you tried to layout, but think about it like this. \n\nA fully diminished seventh chord is built of only minor 3rds. So technically there is no root. Any inversion you use it can be the root position. Therefore any note in the chord can be the leading tone to the new key you want to go to. Meaning any note of the diminished 7th chord can resolve to the new tonic a half step up. \n\nSo you would be modulating from the key you started in to the new key you chose to resolve to."

            "There is a pull directly from ii to I, there is a camp of theorists that say ii has a dominant function similar to V.\u00a0\n\nvii has the same function as V.

            "ii can go to I just fine, and often does. It's just that ii V I has a rise in tension before the resolution compared to ii I because V contains the leading tone of the key. \n\nThe vii dim chord does show up fairly often in jazz standards and some of the genres that gave us jazz standards (show tunes, film scores, etc.), usually as a ii-7b5 V7 i (minor ii V i with extensions).\n\nIt's probably not common in pop music because most pop musicians who try using it one day go \"eww, stinky!\" because of the tritone with the root.",
            ">What I don't understand is why it doesn't seem to be a pull from ii directly to I since one would expect for (2 4 6) be straightforwardly attracted to (1 3 5) even more than to (5 7 2).\n\nOne would not expect that, because your premise is wrong. Let's look at C major. Every note of Dm is a whole step away from C, whereas G shares a note with C its second note is half a step away from C. \n\n>Also why vii\u00b0, which on the other hand feels a strong pull similar to V -> I by sharing 5 7, is so rarely used in pop music?\n\nCause it's too cheesy. Diminished chords evoke a \"Classical\" mood which doesn't really fit most pop songs. You can find diminished chords in the form of m7b5, which is called half diminished (seventh).",
            "The most important thing is dominant-tonic resolution is the resolution of the leading tone. Scale degree 7 resolves to 1. You don't have this resolution in ii-I. Also, everything moving in parallel is not harmonically very strong. It ends up sounding like a single voice with doublings instead of actual harmony.\n\nFunctional harmony is the result of multiple simultaneous melodies. It shouldn't be approached too vertically - you need to understand the voice leading for it to truly make sense.\n\nIt all comes down to different scale degrees having different levels of stability. The most stable scale degrees are 1 3 5 - the notes in the tonic triad. The other scale degrees are unstable and have a tendency to resolve to the notes in the tonic triad. 2 resolves down to 1, 4 resolves down to 3, 6 resolves down to 5, and 7 resolves up to 1. The strongest resolution is 7-1 - the leading tone resolving to the tonic.\n\nHere's how dominant-tonic works. Instead of thinking of it as two vertical chords (triad built on scale degree 5 going to triad built on scale degree 1), you can see it as a combination of many different melodic resolutions.\n\n7-1\n\n4-3 (this makes it a V7)\n\n2-1\n\n5-5\n\n5-1\n\nThe only resolution that is typically not part of the dominant-tonic progression is 6-5. But you can add that too if you use the vii\u00f87. This simply isn't as common. Probably it has to do with the bass. In bass, leaps are actually stronger than steps. Strongest bass motion is descending 5ths. Why leaping down a 5th in the bass is so strong might have to do with the consonance of the 5th - it's the first overtone that's a different note from the fundamental. So, going 5-1 clearly establishes the 1 as the \"fundamental\". The role of the 5 is to stabilize the 1.\n\n>Also why vii\u00b0, which on the other hand feels a strong pull similar to V -> I by sharing 5 7, is so rarely used in pop music? Could it be because the hard part is actually to get to vii\u00b0 first?\n\nNot only in pop music, but also in classical music.\n\nAs I said, the 5-1 bass is stronger than a stepwise resolution in bass (7-1 or 2-1). This is why the V chord is more important.\n\nAlso, the diminished triad results in a bit of an awkward voice leading when you write for 4 or more parts. In C major, B resolves to C, F resolves to E, D typically resolves to C. Notice how this results in an incomplete C major chord. When you add a 4th voice, it just makes sense to add a G instead of doubling one of the notes in the diminished chord. Really, the question is, why would you use the vii\u00b0 when writing for 4 or more parts? Remember that originally people didn't approach harmony from the perspective of roman numerals and inversions. They approached it melodically. Bdim-C in 4 or more parts just doesn't lead to natural sounding melodic resolutions, so when people added a 4th part, they naturally added a G.\n\nThe point is, people didn't approach it as \"let's write a vii\u00b0-I progression\". Instead, they approahed it as \"let's write melodies that lead to a nice resolution\". They knew different possible melodic resolutions and simply combined those. They didn't worry about it being a vii\u00b0-I or whatever. It was simply a combination of different melodic resolutions. The \"chords\" that emerged from those melodic resolutions were originally not super important. \"Chord progression\" based thinking is a more modern thing. People only started thinking more consciously in \"chord progressions\" once the basic patterns had already been established.\n\n[Here's a good video](https://youtu.be/jaCRUdxTRSM?si=qUVylB28SNXZa1GD) that shows the origin of these patterns.\n\nThis doesn't mean it's never used. It just makes it less useful than other progressions. And this is why it didn't become an important part of the \"harmonic language\", and that's also why you don't see it in pop music. Pop music is a more ear-based style any way, so people just pick up patterns that they hear in music. Since vii\u00b0-I isn't one of those patterns, people naturally don't even consider using it. (Also, diminished triads are awkward to play on guitar, and they simply aren't part of the standard \"guitar vocabulary\" - that's another reason why they are rare in pop, because guitar is a really common songwriting tool for pop musicians.)"
