I tried tracking with a metronome set at 55, 82.5, and 110 BPM since I only know of double time and... 1 1/2 time? Basically, I need help understanding how to calculate the intervals between one tempo and the octave above it. This is what I've found so far through research, though likely inaccurate:\n\nMinor Second: 1.06 times the BPM\n\nMajor Second: 1.12 times the BPM\n\nMinor Third: 1.2 times the BPM\n\nPerfect Fourth: 1.25 times the BPM\n\nPerfect Third: 1.33 times the BPM\n\nPerfect Fifth: 1.5 times the BPM\n\nMajor Sixth: 1.67 times the BPM\n\nMinor Seventh: 1.78 times the BPM\n\nMajor Seventh: 1.88 times the BPM\n\nOctave: twice the BPM\n\nAnd what's the deal with Dotted and Triplets? Can I track 1/8D vocals?",

            "To answer your first question, the only real way to get better at singing is to practice it and, ideally, have a teacher who can help guide you.\n\nSecond, for a slow tempo it's not unusual to have a click that's playing twice as fast as the base tempo. So it would count \"one and two and three and four\" instead of \"one two three four\".\n\nNow, on to the other part of your question. It's not common to need to relate changes in pitch to changes in tempo outside of something like recording at one speed and then \"speeding up the tape\" to get the final result. If you have a reason to do that then great but I would be very wary of using it as \"crutch\" to avoid singing at the original tempo.\n\nAnyway, for twelve-tone equal temperament the formula is your original tempo multiplied by 2 to the power of the number of semitones up dividided by 12. So a perfect fifth would be 2 to the power of 7/12 which is 1.4983 and so on. If you're using just intonation then a perfect fifth would indeed be 3:2 which is 1.5.",
            "Your \"perfect fourth\" is actually a \"major 3rd\", an your \"perfect third\" is a perfect 4th.\n\nYou  (for how pitch increases in analog recording as speed increases) figures are correct, but they relate to simple integer ratios, and our tuning system is 12-TET.   E.g., a \"natural\" major 3rd is 5:4 (equivalent to 1.25 x the lower frequency), but a tuned (tempered) major 3rd is 14 cents sharp of that.   A \"natural\" minor 3rd is 6:5, while a tuned one is 16 cents sharp of that.\n\nI don't know if such a difference will affect what you are doing, though.  In fact, I don't really know why you need to know these pitch differences.  In digital recording you can keep the pitch the same whatever speed you are at.   And what are \"1/8D\" vocals?  What's the relevance of \"dotted and triplets\"?"

            "You need to learn to feel phrases. Beat one at the top of an 8 bar phrase should feel like a BIG 1. Construct the phrasing of the lines you are playing with intentionality around larger metrical groupings. Make the end of an 8 bar phrase make sense and feel like it's the end of an 8 bar phrase. Even without a dominant chord to create a cadence, you can still cadence with your melodic note choices. This comes with experience and practice.",
            "Count out loud, each measure just say the number. Then when that's comfortable, do it every other measure, then every four. Eventually you'll kinda have what 32 measures feels like in your bones. Plus, the melody and what the band is doing sort of helps. It's usually pretty obvious that the end of a section is being wrapped up, either through the drum fills or what the other players are doing. If you want to do it without cues, set a loop and play over it for a while",

I don't know why that suddenly fixed everything - but it did.    Pauses are totally fine too - like Miles Davis does it. Throwing in an accidental here and there doesn't hurt either."
