Was thinking about a really expensive way to make my thesis. \"Rent\" an MD (uni proff of anatomy) and make an arthroscopic investigation (a video) of what happens when the heelhook is done. Yes, I will be grabbing and doing a heelhook to a poor human body, a corpse, for the sake of science. My idea is to have a whole knee diagnosis from the proff and a live arthroscopic view, so see what happens. (The arthroscopy is also needed to see if the ligaments are intact before the interaction with them) My idea is to do an outside one on a leg and an inside one on the other. The objective is to learn what kind of damage it will do to help surgeons what to expect after that kind of stress on the knee and for physiotherapist to understand the bio dynamics of the injury for a conservative approach to persons who suffered this type of sport injury. Am I crazy? Some adevice about it?",

It looks different because he's diving through, but if the thing that moves the guy is you pulling his arm with both hands around until he leaves his feet, it doesn't seem to fit the bill of fireman's carry."

        "content": "Will try to keep it brief but will expand if people have questions. Well established gym in Toronto breaking up. Head coach is leaving, starting a new gym nearby and literally everyone is going with him. Owner has hired McDojo Bullshido instructors who made their first appearances this week. Hilarity ensued. \n\nShould note that students had no notice at all about the new instructors coming in, and the outgoing staff only found out two hours before classes were set to start.\u00a0First was the women's no gi class. The new woman's \"instructor\" is being promoted as a ADCC gold medalist but turns out that was a beginner division and the medal was won by walkover. New instructor didn't know how to do a forward shrimp, refused to try the technique being taught by the outgoing instructor (entry to truck) and then pulled a new student off to the side and made her do pushups. She then showed some very sloppy armbars from side control while the regular instructor (a brown belt) was trying to teach the regular class. The students were shocked at how rude she was and left asking WTF just happened? \n\nFor the advanced class the new no gi/MMA coach arrived with some of his existing students. \"Sensei Mike\" proclaimed the new direction of the no gi classes would be self defense, MMA and no gi grappling. He proudly noted he had two rules.   \n  \n1. Never apologize because it shows you're at fault   \n2. Never help anyone get up because it's \"Weak Samurai Energy\" \n\nHe then showed a double overhook butterfly sweep and an armbar from rubber guard. Even people who had been training for 3 months could tell there was no detail, little experience or expertise. Sensei Mike then refused to roll with anyone and even paired up his own students with those from the gym. Awkward all around. He walked around like mere mortals couldn't understand how great he was.\n\nWe can find no history or BJJ lineage for this new no gi coach even though the profile states 2x Canadian BJJ champion. Appears to be some sort of Krav Maga or a traditional Jiujitsu background His YouTube page shows ridiculous knife disarms,  \"grappling\" techniques in slow motion with no resistance/realism like this gem \n\n[https://youtube.com/shorts/qy9eNMoIDNA?si=AB9h5G-jp4moVXrI](https://youtube.com/shorts/qy9eNMoIDNA?si=AB9h5G-jp4moVXrI)\n\nStudents planning to stay for the two week crossover before the new gym is ready were mass cancelling after one night but the gym phone number now directly connects to Sensei Mike's cell phone and so people calling to cancel in horror get hung up on. \n\nIn the end the actual community will live on in a great new space, but it's hard to imagine a more ridiculous ending to a very well known gym. I expect it bleeds out very quickly.\n\n",
