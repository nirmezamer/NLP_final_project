Natural Resources Defense Council precedent that required courts to give deference to federal agencies when creating regulations based on an ambiguous law. Congress routinely enacts open-ended laws that give latitude to agencies to work out \u2014 and adjust \u2014 the details to new circumstances.\n\n>\u201cChevron is overruled,\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in his majority opinion. \u201cCourts must exercise their independent judgment in deciding whether an agency has acted within its statutory authority.\u201d\n\nFederal Agencies cannot invent regulation out of thin air now, and must have Congress actually do their jobs to pass laws.",

This means all ATF determinations and opinions effectively no longer carry the weight of law, courts will still consider them but this opens the floodgates to challenging all kinds of things that are ATF rules and not explicitly in federal statute. For instance import regulations on firearms, opinions on certain accessories, etc.\n\nYesterday they also blew up Administrative State enforcement authority which could decimate Biden\u2019s zero tolerance FFL policy.\n\nIt\u2019s a big fucking deal.",

Witnessing this in conjunction with losing a few friends to suicide, I\u2019m hoping to also use this trip to spread mens mental health awareness, though I\u2019m not sure how to come about it.\nThese amazing companies have graciously sponsored me so far to keep the trip afloat! \n\nFluvanna County Firearms (some ammo and support from @mad_minute_tacticians and @juice_tactician)\nOvert Industries (sponsored a barrel for me to test, class and .300 black out)\nEgundirect (provided food and shelter for Goop and I)\nShalotek (DLVIP for 10% off \ud83d\ude01, I don\u2019t benefit, I just like spreading the love)\nLiberty and Co\nOn My Own time Lawn Care (payed me to pick up trash which was actually really fun and provided a place for us)\n@Tangslangs (Instagram) (gave discount to support my new build put together entirely by friends) \nRedacted images for the sick pictures provided! \n\n\nI also decided create and trademark a logo based on my dog \ud83d\ude06 one of the best purchases ever made! I\u2019ve made some funny shirts and patches that I\u2019m thinking about selling and putting towards a charity or cause, though I\u2019m not too sure!\n\nCome support, reach out or just enjoy the trip with me! \ud83d\ude00 The more wholesome homies I can get, the more love I can spread! \n@justsomedudewithgoop\n\nLastly, if you find yourself in a crisis, PLEASE reach out or call 988. \nIf a friend is reaching out, please listen to them and avoid shoveling \u201cyou know what you should do bro\u201d at them. Just listen, inquire, and validate (took me awhile to learn myself)\n\nAlso the pic with my arms crossed, the leash wasn\u2019t tight my dog was being dramatic cause it was hot \ud83d\ude06\n\nTLDR: shooting with wholesome homies cross country with my dog Goop and spreading mens mental health awareness.
