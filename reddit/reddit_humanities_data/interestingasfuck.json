You're doing something inherently risky in the first place so having backups for backups is important. 1% chance you need it but bascally if you're in that 1% you want to have your backups ready to go and a plan rehearsed because if you don't you're 100% dead.\n\nHere for instance is an inflatable paddle board that could have a puncture or could get a puncture (A paddle board there in the ocean would be like catnip to a shark and sharks investigate with their teeth) and I guarantee you his boat is further away than he thinks, can he swim that far? who knows. All I know is that he doesn't have to be so far from the boat to get excercise and if a seacock breaks or something else happens on the boat while he's not there then the boat is going down and probably taking his liferaft with it.  \n\nEven in the doldrums a breeze can pick up quickly, like in an instant, his boat has more surface area than he does and his mast without sail is enough to push the boat and it can move more quickly than he can, it could be over the horizon while his back is turned. \n\nstupid stupid stupid.",

I've heard stories that it sounds like a train and the canyon becomes dark. \n\n  \nIn 2015 [7 people](https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/exploration-survival/special-report-keyhole-seven/) went into keyhole canyon in Zions. None of them made it out alive. What is sobering to think is that the canyon is probably one of the shortest in Utah (3 rappels and only 1200 feet long). You can do the entire thing in 20-30 minutes. Despite being such a short canyon, they couldn't outrun the water.",
