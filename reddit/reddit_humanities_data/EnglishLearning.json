The answer to the question of \"What is a hamburger made from pork called?\" is >!pork burger!<, much like a hamburger made from turkey would be a >!turkey burger!<. It doesn't have anything to do with the etymology; it's about the current usage. \n\nAnother fun example of this is \"helicopter.\" \"Helicopter\" is made of the constituent parts \"helico-\" from the Greek \"helix\" meaning \"spiral,\" and \"-pter\" from the Greek \"pteron\" meaning \"wing.\" However, it makes more sense intuitively for English speakers to divide the word into \"heli-\" and \"-copter,\" and thus we get words like \"quadcopter,\" \"gyrocopter,\" and \"roflcopter.\"",
