            "Biden just participated in the first debate of this election season, and is widely considered to have done poorly. So with that context, \"cooked\" probably means \"finished\", i.e. that his campaign is a lost cause.\n\nAsking \"chat\" a question would be a reference to streamers and such. It's possible there's some additional level or humor here (e.g. if \"chat, am i cooked?\" is associated with a specific person), but if so I'm not aware of it.",

            "I would like to add that the reason why \"please, explain me the meme\" doesn't work is that the verb \"explain\" is weird when it comes to indirect pronouns. Most other verbs allow you to either use either \"to me\" or just \"me\" (e.g. he gave me the letter &  he gave the letter to me). However, for some reason the verb \"explain\" only works with the \"to me\" and not in the other way.",
            "Its legit, the 81 year old president of the most powerful country in the world tweets like hes a streamer and publicly revealed that he has doubts that he will win the next election (despite the fact that doing so would certainly hurt his chances of winning).",

It's a pretty quick and traumatizing thing to witness because it can often feel like quick, anonymous murder and the murderer just leaves.",

            "It's a little play on words. A \"sprite\" in high fantasy and I believe even in Greek mythology, is a little woodland creature, I think similar to a fairy. And the verb \"to smite\" means to attack, often with the intention to badly harm or kill someone. So because the character who is saying it is a fantasy mushroom guy, and he's telling his I guess army to attack, he says \"sprite them\" just to make the situation more cartoony and humorous.",
            "Sprite is a somewhat old-fashioned or literary word for a fairy.  The use of the word as a noun here appears to be an invention of this movie and follows a modern trend of using nouns as verbs for humorous effect.  By using sprite as a verb the creature is saying lets do to them what sprites do.",

            "There might be another play on words. In animation and video games, sprites are the two dimensional representation of characters, particularly used for background and game world objects.
