        "content": "I saw Appropriate tonight through Audience Rewards, and the moment I sat down (side orchestra, middle of the row), the woman behind me started grumbling about how tall I was (I'm 6'1\" and admittedly tall, but what can I do?) I didn't lose my temper and let it go, but she was incredibly rude.  She stated how it was rude that I even chose that seat (which I didn't anyway) and had no consideration for the people sitting behind me.  She said I should at least have the decency to crouch.  \n\nUnfortunately, she started up with my mom at intermission (who was with me and sitting next to me). She told her I was ruining the show for her by blocking her view and requested I switch seats with her.  Just because she was so obnoxious though, I didn't switch (too spiteful?).  I would have happily done it otherwise if she asked me politely. But I never acknowledged her and politely told an usher what was happening and how it was disrespectful and out of my control.  The usher was a pro!  They approached her with a booster seat and said that everyone was there to see the show and that being disrespectful would not be tolerated.  She was fuming afterward and made more remarks upon my sitting back down in front of her, but I did my best to ignore it for the sake of enjoying the show.\n\n\nI deal with this all the time unfortunately (and I see other tall people here with similar posts).  And I'm not insensitive.  I know I'm tall.  But this was the rudest, most selfish patron I've dealt with in this matter.  It took a lot for me not to tell her off. I'm in the seat that was assigned to me.  And despite my tallness, I myself have been blocked many times and just lived with it.\n\nShout out to this amazing usher!",

You can\u2019t help where you were sat/your height, but I\u2019m very glad you had an usher on your side! I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with this obnoxious experience but I hope you didn\u2019t let it taint the show for you.\n\n(I\u2019m 5\u20191 and small, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever even thought to act like this if a taller patron sat in front of me. Doesn\u2019t hurt to ask for a booster or just\u2026 tip my neck up a little, lol. Some people were raised in another dimension, I swear.)",

Ushers found me an excellent seat further down for the second act. I figure between the really good seat and standing, cost of my ticket evened out.  There have been times when I notice the person behind me is a kid and can't see well (I'm not that tall but some of the theaters really aren't well designed on the floor), and I offer to switch seats.",

I\u2019m glad to hear that the usher was so helpful\n\nI am not tall and I hate when my view is blocked, so I sit in the first row or on the center aisle of a side section. I plan in advance to make that happen bc it\u2019s such a priority for me. I\u2019d never hold it against someone if they\u2019re blocking my view; it\u2019s just the luck of the draw",

I rushed this Friday.\n\n**Rush experience**\n- As I posted in the rush line headcount thread, there were 6 at 6:55, 7 at 7:05, 9 at 7:15, 10 at 7:20, 11 at 7:45, 12 at 7:50, 13 at 8, 14 at 8:40, 15 at 8:45, and ultimately at least 20 more by 10 when the box office opened.\n- I was offered a partial view rush ticket, no seat choice given. It was far side orchestra G.\n\n**Seat**\n- I was worried that it would be too far to the side. It was actually a great seat for partial view/rush. Though I could only see the edge of the chaise longue on stage right, anything that happened there was unambiguous and only a minor bother. Visually, I lost less than 5% of the action, and none of it was important or hurt my experience of the show.\n- I\u2019m short (5 feet) and I could see the actors clearly. This is rare for me at a Broadway theatre. I did grab a seat booster in case but I would have been pretty good either way. I could see the actors\u2019 faces at all times (unless on the chaise longue) and often saw the stage and actors\u2019 feet, the sightline was that good.\n- The rake in the orch seems pretty fair, and it\u2019s a small theatre so even the back row isn\u2019t far. Row G was both close to the actors but far enough away that the side obstruction was less severe than the rows in front.\n- Seeing the show from the far side, I\u2019d say the side orch in general is a great value. No need to pay extra for center if it costs much more, in my eyes.\n- I spotted at least 10 seats in my far side orch area which were rush seats, since they were filled with people from the line and their guests.\n\n**The show**\n- I knew it would be unique and funny and ridiculous. I mostly kept myself in the dark and it both matched what I pictured but managed to surprise me at times. I\u2019d be happy to see it again.\n- The best live experiences are when the audience is excited and totally onboard, and this crowd was. They were on the same wavelength as the show, in on its joke, and laughed hard, enjoying themselves every minute.\n\n**Overall**\n- 10/10 for the rush price, rush seat, and show/crowd. Completely worth it, and probably the best value for the show.",
