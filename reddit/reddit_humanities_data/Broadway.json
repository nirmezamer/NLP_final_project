        "content": "I saw Appropriate tonight through Audience Rewards, and the moment I sat down (side orchestra, middle of the row), the woman behind me started grumbling about how tall I was (I'm 6'1\" and admittedly tall, but what can I do?) I didn't lose my temper and let it go, but she was incredibly rude.  She stated how it was rude that I even chose that seat (which I didn't anyway) and had no consideration for the people sitting behind me.  She said I should at least have the decency to crouch.  \n\nUnfortunately, she started up with my mom at intermission (who was with me and sitting next to me). She told her I was ruining the show for her by blocking her view and requested I switch seats with her.  Just because she was so obnoxious though, I didn't switch (too spiteful?).  I would have happily done it otherwise if she asked me politely. But I never acknowledged her and politely told an usher what was happening and how it was disrespectful and out of my control.  The usher was a pro!  They approached her with a booster seat and said that everyone was there to see the show and that being disrespectful would not be tolerated.  She was fuming afterward and made more remarks upon my sitting back down in front of her, but I did my best to ignore it for the sake of enjoying the show.\n\n\nI deal with this all the time unfortunately (and I see other tall people here with similar posts).  And I'm not insensitive.  I know I'm tall.  But this was the rudest, most selfish patron I've dealt with in this matter.  It took a lot for me not to tell her off. I'm in the seat that was assigned to me.  And despite my tallness, I myself have been blocked many times and just lived with it.\n\nShout out to this amazing usher!",

            "What the actual hell is wrong with people? Do they truly not know how to behave in public? You can\u2019t help where you were sat/your height, but I\u2019m very glad you had an usher on your side! I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with this obnoxious experience but I hope you didn\u2019t let it taint the show for you.\n\n(I\u2019m 5\u20191 and small, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever even thought to act like this if a taller patron sat in front of me. Doesn\u2019t hurt to ask for a booster or just\u2026 tip my neck up a little, lol. Some people were raised in another dimension, I swear.)",
            "As a 5\u2019 tall person I\u2019m appalled that she behaved this way. I definitely always hope that I don\u2019t have a tall person in front of me. But when I do get one I simply get a booster or if it\u2019s winter use my coat as a booster. Part of theater is sharing space with others. I\u2019m very happy the ushers handled it so well!",
            "I'm 6'3. Once when seeing Freestyle Love Supreme on broadway I got a tap on the shoulder after I had been seated a while. I turned around and this young kid started playfully giving me shit and asked if we could switch seats.\n\nThat kid was Young Sheldon Iain Armitage. I happily switched.",
            "As a 6\u20192 theater goer, I am always so nervous about this happening and I\u2019m very grateful that it hasn\u2019t (yet). I\u2019m really sorry this happened to you but major shoutout to for handling this peacefully!",
            "Saw Music Man last year, two people in front of me blocked 1/3 of the stage on my right no matter how I leaned. I just stood at the back of the theatre for the first half. Ushers found me an excellent seat further down for the second act. I figure between the really good seat and standing, cost of my ticket evened out.  There have been times when I notice the person behind me is a kid and can't see well (I'm not that tall but some of the theaters really aren't well designed on the floor), and I offer to switch seats.",
            "It really sucks when a fellow audience member\u2019s behavior gets close to ruining your experience of a show. I\u2019m glad to hear that the usher was so helpful\n\nI am not tall and I hate when my view is blocked, so I sit in the first row or on the center aisle of a side section. I plan in advance to make that happen bc it\u2019s such a priority for me. I\u2019d never hold it against someone if they\u2019re blocking my view; it\u2019s just the luck of the draw",
            "I\u2019m 5ft and can never see a thing. You know whose problem that is? Mine. I was born short, others are born tall",
            "Unbelievable. I would never talk to some like she did. What are you supposed to do? Shrink? If she really can't see, she could have asked if she could move (if seats were available) or lean to the side, like we all do. Life goes on. I'm sorry you had to deal with that.",
            "It sucks to be behind someone tall. I have gotten a booster seat a few times, asked an usher to move me to an empty seat, or moved to an empty seat during intermission. Someone\u2019s height isn\u2019t in their control.",
            "I'm so sorry that happened to you. As a short person I'm deeply ashamed that a similarly vertically challenged theater goer didn't just shut up and grab a booster seat as I have many times. I can't believe she asked you to crouch."

It\u2019s not groundbreaking or awe-inspiring like some others I love, but if you\u2019re not expecting too much, then it\u2019s really quite enjoyable. \ud83d\ude02 Only Tea is a favorite (and having seen it at Papermill makes me love it since it was very funny), I love For Better or Worse (and the new ending is interesting although very Disney-fied, lol, especially with the door lyrics), and the lyric change to For Her is also nice. I still can\u2019t tell which I like better. But, I\u2019d say altogether, I enjoy it for what it is and definitely enjoy Eva and Jeremy\u2019s singing.",
