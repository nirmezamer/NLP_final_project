            "this is a kit im putting on presale modeled after the auto 9 from Robocop, its going to be a one and done run. the only way ill do another run is if the NFA gets overturned and Beretta starts selling m93r's and the chances of that are slim.\u00a0\n\n\npresales start now and you can cancel up to when it ships for a full refund. i am only taking preorders until January 12th ill then put in for the final order with shipping around April. so what gets ordered is what gets ordered. if i do get a large amount of orders within the first month or so i will start production early and do 2 runs so people arnt sitting around waiting. i cannot guarantee there will be extras for sale afterwards but if there are X amount of orders ill likely round it up to the nearst 10th, so 28=30, 52=60, ect. so if youve ever wanted an Auto 9 this is as close as youll get short of shelling out 80k for a real m93r then moding it.\u00a0\n\n\nthe kit includes grips and all of the hardware youll need to get an M9A1 converted. this doesnt convert to automatic its just cosmetic. the kits will be numbered and im working on getting it to use the 92 gts frame as its a closer representation of the m93r with the frame mounted safety/decocker. im also working to get this to accept a 22lr conversion kit. the kit i tested has a higher front sight area on the slide. no guarantees of either of these coming to fruition but i felt it noteworthy i will update accordingly.\n\n\nive posted a link below of the prototype breakdown and test firing so you can see it in action. i have to link youtube and youll have to go to the rumble or odysee link in the description as reddit automatically removes rumble links from comments and posts.\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/M-r6uobyFLo?si=IREq3yKsQuf1xa1m",
