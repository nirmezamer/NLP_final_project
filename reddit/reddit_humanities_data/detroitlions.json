Kelce\u2019s mind immediately went to LaPorta.\n\n\u201cLaPorta had a fucking year, dude\u201d Kelce told the Bussin\u2019 With The Boys crew. \u201cLaPorta had a year last year. I\u2019m pumped on seeing where he goes his second year because his first year, he killed it.\u201d\n\n... \u201cDude, LaPorta is a fuckin\u2019 stud. LaPorta is nasty,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cThose Iowa guys. They\u2019re all here. They\u2019ve got it figured it out.\u201d",

            "Not exactly apples to apples but with the broken lottery system the NBA has in place, I\u2019d say the Pistons. At least when you\u2019re the worst team in the NFL you get the chance to draft the best player who can make an immediate impact and spark a rebuild. In the NBA you can be the worst team in the league and instead of landing the number 1 overall pick, your best odds are landing the 5th pick, as we\u2019ve seen with our Detroit Pistons. That coupled with bad ownership and a bad front office and you get a team who hasn\u2019t won a playoff game in 15 years smh",
            "Pistons. Holmes had Stafford to trade and squeezed so much value out of that trade. Langdon has nothing and the ownership is a clown car.",
            "It's the Pistons and it's not even close. \n\nIt's the nature of the league. Unless you have a top 5 player in the NBA you can't be a contender. The Pistons don't have any avenue to achieve this.",
            "Not sure but I think the Pistons today could end up being in worse shape in hindsight a few years from now than the Lions when Holmes took over.  We thought things were looking up after last season & then this most recent season happened & we were somehow even worse.  If we don't take a step forward this season, I am never watching basketball again.  At least when the Lions were bad, the worst season in league history only involved sitting through 16 losses.....as opposed to watching the Pistons lose 68 times in a single season.  That is brutal bc you are reminded how bad they are every other day when they lose again, rather than just once a week.",
            "Pistons by a mile. It\u2019s insane to me that the lions played 63 less games than Pistons last year and had more wins.",
            "The debate starts and ends here:\n\nThe Lions had Sheila > The Pistons have Gores",
            "Impossible to compare.\n\nThe Lions lost their star QB and had to replace a huge percentage of a large roster.\n\nThe NBA not only has a smaller roster, but more heavily relies on just a few of those players. You typically need at least one superstar or two star quality players. The NBA has completely ruined the development process for players because they\u2019re coming out at 18 or 19 still incredibly raw and they need so much time put in just to even see if they\u2019re worth moving on with for the longterm. When players went to college longer, it was easier to project or see early success. Not a single one of the Pistons\u2019 recent high picks can be counted on going forward with a high level of certainty. If Cade develops more and the Pistons get lucky and one other guy turns into a star, they\u2019re close to good. That\u2019s all it takes since role players are easier to find.\n\nBasketball team building requires more luck IMO.",
            "The Pistons are way more broken than the Lions were at the end of the Matt Patricia/Quinn era. Ownership is way worse too. Also, a special shout out to the Tigers under Chris Illitch\u2019s ownership. He seems to only care about the Wings and does not give a shit/completley clueless about running the Tigers.",
            "I\u2019d have to say the Pistons.  They have the worst roster in the NBA by a wide margin and only 1 good player on the team.  The Lions had a bad roster too but had several good players such as Decker, Ragnow, and Jackson, the starting core of a good O Line.  Plus they had Stafford.  So there\u2019s no way you could say the Lions were in worse shape.",
            "I'd say the Pistons are in worse shape. The Lions had a winning team 3 years before Holmes got here, and had Matt Stafford. The Matt Stafford trade gave BH some big bullets, along with Goff who as it turns out is franchise qb and not a journeyman type as most thought. \n\nThe Pistons are seemingly in shambles, with agents basically ignoring them. They have Cade but it seems like he has less value than Stafford did."
