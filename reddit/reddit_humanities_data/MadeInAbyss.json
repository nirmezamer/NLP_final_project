            "So with what we just learned about souls does this imply that Riko might not be the \u201creal\u201d Riko but rather a different soul that filled Riko\u2019s corpse back when she died as an infant? Im not entirely sure what the implications of that would be. Is it someone else\u2019s soul that was basically reincarnated, or is it a soul literally created by the abyss?",
            "Faputa is slowly turning into a furret",
            "I have no shame in admitting that I didn't understand anything but I still loved it",
            "I really do love that even this white whistle doesn\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on down here. Even for all she\u2019s see. And explored, the abyss is still a mystery to her and even the few things she thought she had confirmed, might actually be completely wrong. \n\nI\u2019m not even sure if we as the readers will ever get a real answer",
            "They mention that when something dies and is revived the original host of the body is gone and the new occupant is a totally different soul\u2026\n\nThat means that Riko\u2019s original soul went to wander the abyss and the Riko we know and love is artificial, right? Wonder if we\u2019re going to see a return of her OG soul in the way of it being a time loop Liza or maybe it got turned into Reg?",
            "Faputa was drawn criminally cutely this chapter",
            "All imma say about this arc so far is, get ready for the bangers Kevin Penkin is gonna put out if he works on the soundtrack for season 3\n\nI have no doubt theyre gonna hit hard and im almost as excited for the music as i am for the season",
            "Damn, almost 6 months of waiting and the chapter was gone in a few minutes, this is truly one of the hardest mangas to being a fan of.\n\nCant wait for the next chapter.",
            "Good to have a nice sciencey explanation for how Kiyui survived the Birthday Disease.  Getting taken offshore separated him from the soul, freeing him from the effects of the rumor's power that's projected through it.\n\nAnd now we are compelled by new questions regarding the exceptions through their acknowledgement.  Great writing!",
            "So who's on the \"abyss is a living thing\" train?"

Coincidence, or could i-\n\n    Riko: [Is it here because the ground it was on got swallowed up a long time ago...? Did the whole city get turned into a fossil? Or is it a mirage created by the crystals?]\n\nHey, heyyy! Stop speculating! That's my job! :(\n\n    Riko: Come to think of it, we three plus one made it down here just fine, didn't we?\n\nI mean, aside from Reg's arm and belly-button, sure!\n\n    Riko: \"Turbinid-dragon.\"\n\nI just realized its tail is curled in the way people's hair curls under the repeated effects of the curse. Or how mizoujack eggs look. Or how>!everything on the 7th layer seems spiraley, like the Eye and most of the scenary.!< So... Uzumaki was a prequel to Made in Abyss all along, huh...?\n\n    Reg: If you do a good job then... we might get to see it again.\n\nAnd in just a few panels we learn they were trying to induce a foodgasm out of Nanachi yet again. It pays off - that tailwag is adorable.\n\n    Riko: At any rate... I feel I've eaten this before somewhere. [...] I remember now! At the orphanage... On cave raiding memorial day, a foreign... what was it again? I forget, but this tastes like that bottled thing we cooked up!\n\nI'm assuming she just means the tastes were similar. It doesn't seem very likely someone would have brought back one of these fellows from the 6th layer. Or do foreign delvers know something we don't...?\n\n    Riko: He's a pervert who used to peep at me when I got strung up naked.\n\n... ... ...Naw. This is too mild to ring the tsukushi-moment bell. Or am I just getting desensitized? >\\_>\n\n    Nanachi: Sure, but... can't we do something about the name \"Team Riko\"? Isn't it too plain?\n\n\"Team Large Forehead and Glasses\"?\n\n    Nanachi: Let's just believe... that it'll definitely reach them.\n\nThis would be funny if it weren't so disappointing for the group.\n\nBut it begs the question. If communicators exist in this world, why not just setup and maintain some kind of communicator relay station across the first 5 layers (and beyond, if someone happened to carry the equipment with them on their last dive...)? Delvers could easily send and receive messages from the surface and ditch this super-unreliable mail balloon nonsense. We've seen instances of communication occurring across layers (albeit poorly; think Reg and Nanachi during Ido Front) so this should work, and the benefits would easily outweigh the effort of maintaining and repairing these relays.\n\n    Riko: Prushka's gone...! Even though I was wearing her... Where...?\n\nIt's fine. Knowing Tsukushi, she's probably just gone outside to exercise some waste-voiding bodily function; we'll be given the details shortly.\n\n    Nanachi: ...and got through Reg's arm trap with ease.\n\nTo be fair, it's not a very good trap. Anything person-sized or smaller exercising the least bit of caution could make it through.\n\n    Riko: ... ...Uh, does that thing... have its butt sewn shut...?\n    Reg: What are these...? There's hair stuffed into them...\n\nSigh, screw it. The series has had way more objectionable stuff but my hand's been hovering over the bell ever since Riko reminded me of kids being strung up naked as punishment.\n\n\\*DING!\\* **TSUKUSHI MOMENTS**: 32\n\nI stumbled on an interesting explanation of what the deal with this is, for what it's worth...\n\n>!Simply put, these creatures' bodily fluids mess with the force field. They hunt by \"masking\" their prey so predators won't read the force field and steal them away. Because it affects the prey's \"signal\" through the force field and not the prey itself, just some hairs and such is good enough for the effect to take. Faputa is using this property of Dread-Owles to mask the party from predators and keep them safe.!<\n\n\n\n# Chapter 40 [1-12]\n\n    Reg: ...It looks like the carcass of some creature.\n\n>!How very astute of you, Reg. >\\_>; Knowing what Iruburu is, I'm curious who built that bridge. The entrance was ground-level and the villagers can't leave. I'd have assumed Faputa, but it was there when she was born. Which pretty much just leaves the Interference Units. I'm guessing they built the \"bridge\" to be able to come and go from the village once it grew too tall to enter from the ground.!<\n\n    Reg: Nngh! Well...? Am I inside yet?\n\nOkay. Immediately after this, the entrance looks like some lady-parts. I mean look at [this](https://i.imgur.com/q3w9LBQ.png)! The highlights are **not** my own.>!Knowing this is Irumyuui's baby-hole only makes this worse.!<There's absolutely no way I can just let this one slip by un-dinged.\n\n\\*DING!\\* **TSUKUSHI MOMENTS**: 33\n\n    The Depths' Sixth Layer - Village of the Hollows\n\nAnd another awesome full-age establishing shot. :D\n\n    Reg: Who're... these guys...?!\n\nSigh. Of course, the middle one>!(Juroimoh)!<has a chest-pussy with arrows pointing to it.>!And he can pull out a long, slimy phallic object from it.!<\n\n\\*DING!\\* **TSUKUSHI MOMENTS**: 34\n\n    ???: ENnu sosu. -krii... krriii...- ENnu HONdINDEbuu sosu...\n\n\\[Kaja has entered the chatroom.\\]\n\n    Majikaja: One who is good at it is doing the stone.\n\n...I'll hold off on the bell but I have to point out that this is a very poor choice of words given>!Poriyon's... uh... experience with it.!<"
