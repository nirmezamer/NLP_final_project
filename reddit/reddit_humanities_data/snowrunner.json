            "That's new for this season. Going in and out of the quarries here is best done slowly and sticking to the wall whenever possible. It's a bit of a pain, but this way, you'll prevent vehicle damage as well as watch your distance from the edge so as to prevent getting caught by those collapsing edges. I've squeezed everything from the Derry 4520 to the P16 with the wide five slot trailer down those quarries like that, despite the fact that it takes about an hour both ways.",
