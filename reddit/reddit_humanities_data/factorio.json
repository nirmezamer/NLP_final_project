I'm a train noob and also a circuit noob so using this blueprint is very confusing to me.",

            "Why are the settings for the craft hotkeys (1, 5, and all) limited to mouse control only? I recently bought an \"mmo-style\" mouse with 12 thumb buttons which need to be assigned keyboard inputs; it defaults to numpad but i've since changed it to the right side of the keyboard, and while trying to rebind the controls, i realized my previous muscle memory is no longer an option.\n\nDon't get me wrong, im sure im not the most typical use case, but can someone help me understand the design intentions behind preventing anything but the M1-M5 keys being used for these binds?",
            "Does anyone use the colored space belts in SE/ K2SE? You find some of them in the wrecked space station, they are great since the standard belts can only go underground for a very short distance. But you can't unlock them before way into late game, when most of your space factory is complete anyway. What is the purpose of that?\n\nAny idea how that may be adjustable in the .lua files?",
            "Hello! I did the vanilla version couple of years ago and then Krastorio 2 mod a year ago. Now I want to put some hours in to the game during the summer. What mod should I go with next if I want a bit more challenging game? Thank you!"

        "content": "I like when a game tries to be realistic, and too much magic kills the immersion (beacons, I'm looking at you!)\n\nBut I'm OK with Fluids 2.0 because they are actually somewhat realistic. Maybe even more realistic then previous fluids, if we assume that the surface is flat.\n\nHere is the diagram:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s2oed6tv1h9d1.png?width=1590&format=png&auto=webp&s=d70a4d0acfe48127853e4a8b129c2d80ef4ca78a\n\nLiquid is moved along the pipe due to gravity, so the level of liquid in the pipe is more or less always even (if we neglect liquid viscosity and a couple other effects).\n\nPump on the left just pours the liquid to the top of pipe-reservoir. The flow rate is not limited as long as pipe-reservoir is not full.\n\nPump on the right can pull liquid only at the rate proportional to the level of liquid in the pipe-reservoir.\n\nThat's it, it explains liquids 2.0 model.\n\nWell, except for underground pipes, but here I need to suspend disbelief a little.",

            "It's more realistic for various reasons.  In the old physics, the fluid level of two neighboring pipes is balanced every tick, an effect that propagates 1 square per tick, or about 60 m/s.  In real life, pressure propagates along the system at the speed of sound (about 1481 m/s in fresh water), so as long as you're pumping with a tight seal, you will be displacing a lot of water downstream very quickly.  At those speeds, it should be basically instantaneous.",
            "I think the assumption the surface is flat no matter the circumstances is exactly the one people take issue with. You can connect a ton of machines through a single pipe bottleneck and still get full throughput.\n\nRealistically such a bottleneck would cause a very quick drop in fluid level",

You mean pressure itself in the laws of physics goes at the speed of sound correct? I don't think water can move that fast without causing a lot of problems."
