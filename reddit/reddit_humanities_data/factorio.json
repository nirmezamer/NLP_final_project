            "Longtime player but been away for a while and seeing a lot of excitement building for v2.0. Do we have even a rough ballpark estimate of when that may release?",
            "Asked this in the last thread and got no response.\n\nI'm using Space Exploration and LTN, with the mod to allow space elevator LTN deliveries. Every now and then I get a 'train out of fuel' warning which lasts only a second or two. It disappears before I can click it and find out where the train is, and I can never see any stopped trains in the network. All my depots refuel trains with nuclear fuel and the network isn't very large - they should never run out of fuel in normal circumstances.\n\nWhat's causing these alerts?",
            "I\u2019m not exactly sure how to word this question, but it\u2019s something I\u2019ve wondered about with Factorio but also other games like Transport Fever 2, Big Pharma, Kerbal Space Program, etc. I really love games about engineering and system-building, but I feel like I\u2019m lacking in some kind of basic mindset or skills that make people good at these games.\n\nIt\u2019s exciting and fun in the early game, but I often hit a wall as things get more complex. Tutorials tend to ruin the fun, but without them it feels like trying to play a really complicated board game without the rule book.\n\nI guess I\u2019m wondering if I should take a basic class in engineering or problem solving or something, just to develop the brain skills that make these games \u201cclick\u201d for others. Are many players here engineers or have STEM backgrounds? Did you enjoy math in school and end up taking advanced stuff like calculus? What about coding? Any other things you have learned or done that gave you skills that translate to Factorio?\n\nTL;DR - Have you found that any math or engineering classes you\u2019ve taken irl helped you in Factorio? Would you recommend anything like that for someone who loves the game but struggles with the figuring out the more complex parts?",
            "Is there a way to use spidertrons as artillery deployers? Walk them out behind enemy lines, stamp a blueprint, and run away kind of thing? I'm guessing no but not sure if I'm missing something obvious.",
            "If I offload my game to a beefy headless server, will I be able to play the game on lesser hardware as a client or does my local client need to do a load of processing too?\n\nI realise there's a trainload of \"it depends\" regarding the specs, network, etc - the essence of my question is: am I actually offloading any heavy lifting to the server or am I just running the game in two places instead of one?",
            "In a vanilla base where all resources are transported through train in city blocks, is there a way I could have a module build that doesn't drain my chips from science? Ie. A priority system.\n\nI am open to solutions with or without circuit networks.",
            "so, I started 2nd world, launched 2 rockets with satellites and still do not understand how I can finish this world. I am playing with peaceful mode on. Am I supposed to play with biters?  \nI am a new player. I have some modes but space exploration is off. I don't think I have something like changing anything related to finishing the game",
            "I'm looking for a new modded experience.\u00a0\n\n\nI have previously played through Nullius and Industrial Revolution 3.\n\n\nI recently attempted SE+KR2 but bounced off, removed KR2 and bounced off SE alone shortly after reaching space science in Nauvis orbit.\n\n\nI'm looking for similar overhauls. Does anyone have any recommendations?",
            "In unmodded. \nI feel like when I look at a machine's stats/recipie it only shows a cycle. Not more important stats like how many gears/min is needed.\n\nIs there some tooltip I'm missing that shows per/min or per/second cost machine will use/make?"

            "If you can now cram any amount of fluid into a pipe network (within the 100 fluid per tick per pipe restrictions) nuclear plants in particular should now be much easier to design. You should be able to cram all or at least most of your intake water into a single pipe network, and all or most of your steam into a single pipe network.\n\nIt simplifies the fluid puzzle quite a bit, but I'll happily take this over the old opaque weirdness.",

Thanks raiguard!\n\nWhen players have to look up a wiki to play well, that's a sign that something with the game design is off. (And I like stardew valley, but my point stands). The new system has a bit less realism, but also a lot less of the unrealistic surprises, and I'm looking forward to it. Pull rate could be scaled down relative to the length or size of the segment to bring a bit of realism back, but I doubt that's necessary.\n\nBut this left me wondering: if segments can no longer contain different fluids, what happens in 2.0 when bots connect segments with different fluids? Does the bot keep hovering as if waiting for someone to clear a cliff or tree?\n\n/edit: and will this system be used for heat pipes as well, or does the old system live on?\n\n/edit: and how do boiler-chains and other passthrough-machines work? Do they become part of the segment? Do they use the old logic?",

This build emptys and fills the main base sushi Pipe (Connection to base at bottom) once a second with a new fluid.  \nEach fluid need to be connected to a storage tank farm, with these connections being at the top of this build.  \nThe emptying process is done in 2 stages, to get a greater amount of pumpes working. The first stage is the bottom half, emptying the main base sushi pipe into the 2nd stage at the top where the fluid get sorted to their individual storages. This 2 stage apporoach greatly increases the pipes with access to the main sushi pipe thus empting it faster, and can get away with few pipes for individual fluids, becasue the 2nd stage sushi pipe segment is much smaller thus the pumps can work faster.",
