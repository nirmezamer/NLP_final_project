        "content": "Greetings Summoners!\n\nWith every new patch Riot introduces to balance out champions and items there are some unforeseen issues that creep up and cause disruption during gameplay. We have noticed that these issues which eventually get fixed clutter up the subreddit immediately following the patch.\n\nWe want to avoid this by having a single Megathread which will be posted after every patch so that you guys can report the various issues in one place. This allows Riot to easily keep track of the bugs by providing a central hub and also allows other users to confirm that they might have encountered.\n\n**Note only bugs caused by the** [14.12](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/news/game-updates/patch-14-12-notes/) **Patch should be reported below.**\n\nPrerequisites to be noted before reporting a bug\n\n***\n\n1. A bug will ideally be accompanied with a screenshot or a video. This provides credibility to your report.\n2. Steps to recreate the bugs should be submitted if possible. This helps Rioters recreate the bug and helps them find the cause behind it.\n3. The bug must have been caused by the latest patch.\n\n***\n\n**Format when reporting a bug:** When reporting a bug, please provide as much information as you can about your computer.\n\n\u2022 **Server**: The server you encountered the bug (NA, EUW, EUNE, TR, RU, BR, LAS, LAN etc)\n\n\u2022 **Type of Bug**: Client Bug, In Game Bug etc\n\n\u2022 **Description**: Describe what was the bug that occurred.\n\n\u2022 **Video / Screenshot**: Insert screenshot (F12 in game) or Video of the bug occurring.\n\n\u2022 **Steps to reproduce**: Provide the steps necessary if someone else had to reproduce the bug.\n\n\u2022 **Expected result**: What should have been the result when you follow the steps mentioned above.\n\n\u2022 **Observed result**: What was the result you obtained when you followed the steps mentioned above?\n\n\u2022 **Reproduction rate**:  If you try to recreate the bug how successful are you in causing it to occur?

            "- **Server:**  NA  \n- **Type of Bug:** Game Client   \n- **Description:**  After end of each game, the client begins to slow down. After each game there is a cumulative increase in load times for: end game screen, from end game screen to rest of the client(home/matchmaking/store/etc..., future champ selects start to lagg. The lagg in champ selects after 3-5 games accumulates the lagg that it can take as long as 5-15 seconds when switching your ban picks or champ select picks, also it effects the load times for switching summoners spells and opening up rune page to edit them. Given how one has only 30 seconds to pick a ban, if you mistakenly wait too long it will be impossible to ban a champ. Also, this lagg effects the input for 'lock in' champ which can boot you out of the lobby because due to late champ selection the game cannot receive the input for 'lock in.' Another note: while observing in champ select lobby, and you're lagging, when switching between champ picks/bans very fast ( 0.25 - 0.5 seconds or faster, normal type for switching) the game client will provide an error message of some sorts that says along the lines of \"could't load or couldn't connect or couldn't complete action.\" I observed the best temporary solution is to close client and re-logg between games. This is an ongoing problem since 14.11 and is still an issue on 14.12. The problem is exactly the same as it was in 14.11.  \n- **Video / Screenshot:**   \n- **Steps to reproduce:**  Play 1 matchmaking, observe. Don't log off, play 2nd matchamking game, observe. Don't log off. Repeat until the lagg is impossible to deal with.  \n- **Expected result:**    No lagg in the above mentioned scenarios/menus\n- **Observed result: Compounded lagg**   \n- **Reproduction rate:** 100% but it takes a lot of time to reproduce (assuming 5+ games and not re-logging between them.)   \n- **System specs:** WIN 10.0.19045 Build 19045 Pro N,  B760 AORUS Elite AX, i7-13700k, UHD Graphics 770, NVIDIA Geforece GTX 1080.",

        "content": "\"Your rank denotes your true skill level.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat used to hold true, but now I don't feel like it does.\n\nIt used to be that way, so there was motivation to climb. \n\nFor the past five years I've been streaming, I've always aimed for challenger.\n\nThat's because you can only get to challenger if you deserve it.\n\nBut now I say it's the same in challenger as it's in master or grandmaster. \n\nWhy? Because I did hit challenger, and found that it wasn't what I imagined it would be like.\n\nEven in challenger bad players are still bad, good players are still good, just like in master and grandmaster.\n\nSoloq rank is no longer an effective quantifier for a person's skill level. \n\nAnd that's an unsolvable problem. \n\n\"new account-low rank duo\" has already seen to that, by mixing up all the players. \n\nExcept for the very top where the pros are, the rank doesn't matter. \n\nI don't know what started it, but some of the factors were:\n\n\"new account mmr boosting- low rank duo\" and \"gambling sites betting on soloq games\" and \"wintrading\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut the single biggest factor is where the game has been nudged toward in the recent years. \n\nYou pick overpowered champs, and basically run it down until you can kill everyone.\n\nThat's how the game state has been for far too long, and now people don't know any macro. \n\nThey don't know how to teamfight. \n\nFor example, carries need to know when they should prioritize the front line, or when they should dive the squishies.\n\nBut nowadays you just whale on the thing in front of you, and they melt because there's no real tank in today's game.\n\nYou pick an overpowered champ, target the carries and then it's over. \n\nAnd so your mechanics improve but your knowledge of the game deteriorates.\n\nNow when you fall behind, you don't know how to bide your time and recover. \n\nInstead you do the same thing you always do, you target the carries, but then get killed and say \"oh well\"\n\nYou're basically a Pachycephalosaurus.\n\nThat's what it's been like for the past 2, 3 years. You forget the macro.\n\nThe only ones that have retained the macro knowhow are the pros. \n\nThe soloq players who try to play through macro get tired of all these Pachycephalosaurus ramming their heads. \n\nJax jumps in, spins the thing, and you're like \"wtf is he doing\"\n\nThen he gets a triple kill and then a quadra. You're like \"is that how the game should be played?\"\n\nBut if the same player goes up against a better player, he goes 0/7.\n\nEvery game you ram your skull into the other Pachycephalosaurus.\n\nIf his skull breaks, you win. If yours breaks, he wins. \n\nThat decides the entire game for all the other players, and the ones trying to play normally get frustrated because the game's out of their hands. \n\nThis in turn mixes up all the players of varying skill levels.\n\nSo good players can end up in lower ranks while bad players can end up in higher ranks, depending on luck.\n\nWhen I hit challenger and high GM, it didn't really feel like they were much better.\n\nThere were so many OTPs. If top lost, it was the jungler's fault. People didn't take champion matchups into consideration.\n\nAnd the bizarre thing is, in other games if you get banned on one account, all your other accounts in that game get banned or suspended\n\nBut that's not the case in league. Why is that?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAmbition is a retired pro, S7 Worlds winner and of 2013 All-Stars fame. He now streams full time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsource: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be3hsaXP-Eg",

You're like \"is that how the game should played?\"\n\n>But if the same player goes up against a better player, he goes 0/7.\n\nAs a returning player who quit back in S4, this is so true. I'm still struggling to get comfortable with the game when it comes to mechanics and overall feel of the champions. Many of the ones I used to play changed, etc...\n\nBut the amount of times in SoloQ I see some Sett, Sylas, Jax, w/e, go in 1v3 and think to myself that the guy is griefing but he ends up with a triple is staggering. So much so that I feel my biggest struggle currently is to know when to or not to fight. Sometimes I would not help because in my mind, no way we win that 2v4. But in fact we did...\n\nBut then the next game I say fuck it and I do go for the 2v4, then we get destroyed. It's quite frustrating.\n\nThat being said, as a mechanical player, I do prefer the current state of the game compared to how it was. The only issue with it is that it makes it much harder for a new player to get good. You can learn macro relatively quickly, especially with how much amazing resources is available nowadays. Knowing when you can 1v2/3/4 takes MUCH longer, assuming you even get there.\n\nI somewhat dread the assassins changes though, as champions like LB are already stupidly strong, it will make midlane a coinflip every game.",

And i absolutely agree that SoloQ for sure doesn't feel good anymore to play. D1 up to Master 400LP there is barely any difference, at 600LP it's gm already. I have never been GM but managed to reach as far as 450LP master, but i can tell you in the past i could feel a massive difference between 100LP master and 300LP master. Hell even between d1 and d3, you could clearly feel a big difference in the game. But Now? hardly.\n\nSometimes you have better players, and sometimes worse. Every 3-game you feel like you play with absolute Boosted Players ingame and you literally refuse to believe that they got into x Elo on their own just because by how bad they Play that Game but then you check their op:gg and it's a legit account and you are literally life questioning how this is even possible when they play that bad.\n\nAnyways:\n\nA very big problem is that nowadays you can just win lane, get some plates, a few solo Kills early-game and now you can oompa loompa urself entire mid/lategame with coinflip rng engages aram mid fights, and playing sidelane is unneeded. I see so many adc players barely hitting 200Cs in 30Minutes nowadays while back in the Day everybody got flamed as an Ebay Player that didn't had at least 200CS and it was super rare to see also. I still have the same opinion that i had after season 9. \"When riot decided to increase gold generation with the invention of Tower Plates, they also fcked up the entire strategy part of the Game\". The biggest problem is that plates are a massive Gold Boost, so massive, they accelerate you so hard, that playing Side-lanes properly after the laning-phase is just not needet anymore, they push you easely into 1-shot range when you win Lane, and then all you have to do, is to perma flip and hope it works in your favor. While back in the day, it was too risky, to go aram mid, because 1 wrong engage, could literally mean, \"you will not be able to kill the enemy anymore for the next 5+minutes because now you got pushed out of 1-shot range and ur main gold generation was from minions, so now you lost a certain amount of minions and it was just super hard to get back into 1-shot range, because you can't just randomly get a 600Gold bounty, or a 700Gold tower, that would be able to push you back into 1-shot range.\n\nSo the guy playing sidelane macro would have completely taking over the Game. Playing side-lanes in old league generally had the effect that the entire game, gets slowed down as a whole, and is more about strategy, while nowadays it just feels like, it's 80-90% about mechanics and perma fighting trying to kill the enemies before they kill you. it's so sad how this game has changed. But it's w.e i said this a million times, that i hate the plate system, that it ruins mid-game build up, and that it is just unhealthy as a whole for SoloQ and the Game in general, and should have been removed or nerft massively a long time ago, but every time i say smth about this, people on reddit usually downvote me and tell me \"this is not true, you have no clue about the game yada yada yada\" even tho i'm high elo since 8+ Years (diamond since s7) - (master since s9) and play this game since season 4. What can i even do at this point? riot isn't listening, community never listens, and whatever i say is apparently always wrong.",
            "Imo the game got balanced towards making you feel like the \"main character\". It makes sense, players like feeling good, and it's one of the reason why league is so popular. But the macro side of things has really taken a toll because of this, and not everyone can be the main character, so you either destroy them or get destroyed.",
            "i think the balancing recently has been really shit. because playing meta at a high level is far too important. like this start of season was beyond disgusting with just corki, trist, brand and whatever else was flavor of month. like u go to top of ladder on opgg and EVERYONE is playing these champs. what the fuck? i wish game was less meta dependant somehow.",
            "World Champion basically saying \"Champ Diff\" and I agree. Some champions are main characters, the rest of us are just background extras for them to punch down."
