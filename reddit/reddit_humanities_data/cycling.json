            "You asked for it\u2026 \n\nWritten 1/27/2021:\n\nI have a story to tell, it\u2019s a bit strange, but it is a 100% true story that happened to me this morning. By the end you will be laughing at my expense and perhaps even questioning your understanding of causality and order in the universe. \n\nThe story started about 4:30 this morning, when I woke up for my planned early bike ride. After drinking coffee and grabbing a small bite to eat, I went through my mental safety checklist on my bicycle, preparing for a rather routine solo weekend ride.\n\nI love to ride early in the morning before the sun rises. Today, I started probably an hour and a half before daylight. The first few miles were rather uneventful and I was lost in thought, half listening to a podcast on my headphones.\n\nGoing west from my house on the Camp Chase bike trail, you go through Battelle Darby Metro Park after about 5 miles and then the trail is strikingly flat and straight for the next 40 miles. I planned to go about 20 miles before turning around to return home.\n\nSoon after passing through the park, I smelled a strong scent of skunk in the air. I said to myself (perhaps even aloud), \u201cI sure hope I don\u2019t have any encounters with a skunk!\u201d. \n\nI remember chuckling out loud at what a disaster that could be, even going so far to visualize it in my mind\u2019s eye, seeing the skunk on the trail in front of me. \n\nIn this vision, the skunk was paralyzed by my bicycle headlight and I somehow ran it over with my bike. I imagined the speed bump like sensation of both tires going over the skunk and even conjured the metallic-like acrid scent that I remembered from when my dog got sprayed by a skunk last spring.\n\nThis imagination of the encounter with the skunk was so powerful on a sensory level, I specifically started a new podcast episode to listen to, as a way to cleanse my mind and focus on something else. I remember thinking at the time how powerful human imagination can be that I was noticeably unsettled by the mental wandering.\n\nFast forward about half an hour, I was another 6-7 miles down the trail and it was still pretty dark. I was listening to the guys from Radiolab talk about the art of poetry translation and not at all thinking about the earlier vision of encoutering the skunk. \n\nSuddenly, in front of me, I saw a glint of white moving across the trail. Moving at around 15 miles an hour, a large skunk was suddenly directly in front of me. \n\nWhat happened next was so surreal.... so strange, I have difficulty finding the words to explain it. All of this occurred in what I\u2019m estimating is under two seconds...\n\nThe skunk stopped in the middle of the trail and looked directly at me. I could see my headlight reflected in his eyes. He started leaning in one direction as if he was going to take off and then flinched in the other direction. \n\nSimultaneously, I\u2019m thinking of the earlier vision. I wanted to avoid running him over and hurting him but also was trying to deduce which direction his body is oriented, so I could ride in front of him, rather than behind him. I was assuming the close encounter would initiate a spray response, even if I didn\u2019t hit him, so I was consciously trying to avoid the part of his body from which the spray comes.\n\nIf you don\u2019t ride bikes a lot, you probably can\u2019t imagine how this could happen.  Experienced cyclists know not to make any sudden or jerky movements. Doing anything too sudden with steering will almost certainly result in a bad wreck. I was moving at full cruising speed when this happened, so I was very aware that an accident could result in serious injury to me.\n\nSo, in that split-second, I was waiting for the skunk to show me where he was going, so I could gently steer my bike in the other direction. I was holding my line in the middle of the 8 foot wide paved trail, tense and ready to respond to avoid the skunk\u2019s path.\n\nAs the foreshadowing (and precognition???) has suggested,  I ended up rolling right over the skunk, neither of us ducking away in our unplanned game of chicken. \n\nIt happened precisely like I imagined it some time and several miles before. It felt exactly the same on the bike and, just like I imagined, the pungent smell immediately filled the air and my nostrils.\n\nI was so shocked by the experience, I kept pedaling for a couple more miles with the new day sun rising behind me. As I pedaled on, it became clear that I was not unscathed. Some of the spray had hit my bike and the right side of my body. I didn\u2019t notice how bad it was until I tried to take a drink of the water bottle from its cage on the downtube. It wasn\u2019t a direct shot, merely a glancing blow, but it was enough to make me gag when I lifted the bottle to my face.\n\nAs I sit now, I\u2019ve already taken a shower and all of my clothes are piled outside. My wife and kid are actively avoiding me, because I clearly smell terrible. \n\nI should mention that after I turned around to come home, I passed by the area where the incident happened and there was no sign of the skunk. I am not sure if he survived or merely made it off of the trail to die in the foliage. It sure did smell extra terrible right at the spot it happened though.\n\nNow, one can just take away from the story that it is the time of year that skunks are active and that a skunk and I had the bad luck of meeting one another on the bike trail. However, I am much more shaken up by the vision that preceded the incident. \n\nDid I remember something before it happened? Did my imagination summon the skunk, while he had no choice but to play a role in my make-believe vision made real? \n\nI mean... the two incidents seem so obviously linked but the relationship is one that I cannot discern because it does not follow the pattern of my understanding of how the universe works. \n\nI will be interested in hearing what other people think... besides everyone feeling terrible for my family for having to live with me right now. \n\nWTF just happened to me?  \ud83e\udda8+\ud83d\udeb4\ud83c\udffb=\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

I have a speed meter hooked onto my rear wheel so I have at least one objective metric at each training session to gauge progress.\n\nSometimes I've found that even though I could even give a speech rather comfortably, I can feel a little bit of a burn in my legs, meaning they\u2019re clearly fatiguing, albeit very slowly, from pedaling at that speed (signifying lactic acid buildup, which is precisely when you're out of zone 2 AFAIK). The fatigue is mild enough to get to the end session, but sometimes by the end I feel like my legs wouldn't really be up for another 45. I should note that I also lift weights and do things like barbell squats throughout the week, and the effect is especially noticeable when I've hopped on the bike with already tired legs.\n\nSo I'm a bit confused. Am I still in zone 2, or should I make sure that my legs are taxed so little that I could go on for hours?\n\n",
