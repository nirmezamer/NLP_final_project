            "Depends on the situation, but probably yes. If the alternative is doing nothing, it helps a lot. If youre already cycling a lot, the effect will be smaller and if its replacing time spent on the bike it probably doesnt help. \n\nTl;dr it helps build an aerobic base, if you already have a strong one its effect will be small.",

My plan was to stick to the gravel towpaths, but because of the trail being closed on my way back, and no proper detour offered.\n\nI had to ride maybe 5 miles on a 2 lane road with a 40mph speed limit to get back. It wasn\u2019t that busy, and feel I was making a pretty fair pace at around 20-25mph. \n\nI was doing fine for the entire trip, letting cars pass when I was able too. Unfortunately, a motorcycle felt I wasn\u2019t doing enough and pulls up next to me and starts chewing me out because they think I shouldn\u2019t be riding on the road. \n\nI try to explain to them that the trail was closed and this was the only way to get back to where I started but they didn\u2019t want to listen. They then proceeded to tell me \u201cYou don\u2019t have a license to ride on road, we do\u201d, and ended off the conversation with flipping me off and speeding away. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure what else I really could have done in this situation, and I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong at all. I couldn\u2019t go backtrack because it would have added significant time and miles to my ride. Could I have done anything different or were the motorcycle just straight up assholes?\n\n\n",

        "content": "I bought a road bike and have been riding it for almost a year. At first, I couldn\u00b4t ride for more than 40 mins and I would come back with my glutes (or ass, or sitbones, or i dont know) totally wrecked.\n\nI can ride it 3 to 4 times a week due to the climate, daily duties, and days of rest.\n\nalmost a year later, I have made some progress:\n\n-my average speed in every ride has increased; it was less than 20 km/h (15 mph); now I average 23 km/h or a bit more some days, from the start to finish, in which I have to ride like 3 km in and 3 km out of town, where I go very slowly because of traffic lights and cars, and I do it at 15 km/h (10 mp/h) maybe.\n\n-I have broken personal records in every segment I did month after month.\n\n-even lost some weight (however, I am still overweight), and I think because of the weight loss and smaller belly, I can ride all the time on the hoods. At first, I would ride most of the time on the handlebar tops (or ramps?) and hold the hoods almost exclusively for breaking. I feel way more flexible than I did a year ago.\n\nHOWEVER, and this is the actual question of the post, I'm capable of riding for 30 minutes without any issues, and after that, I start to feel uncomfortable and feel some pain/numbness, untill I'm 60 minutes into the ride I feel like I can't go on anymore. Is the same thing if I have been riding for 1 hour for 3 days consecutively or if I haven't ridden at all for 5 days, so my guess is that it is not something related to fatigue or accumulated fatigue. I have 3 bibs (a \"cheap but good\" that was the first one I got, a good one I bought after some time into cycling, and a better one that my mother gifted me), and any of them is the same. I have managed to ride for 90 minutes, but my glutes (I think, maybe harmstrings?) were ruined for like 2 days after.\n\nMy legs almost never feel tired, neither during the ride nor after, even if I ride hard they don't feel fatigued at all, but my butt pain slows me down.\n\nI don't feel any hot spots on my feet, and I also don't feel any discomfort in my hands or neck; it is just my ass.\n\nIf I ride out of the saddle for, say, 30 seconds to let the blood flow down there, the pain doesn't disappear, but at least I soothe the pain for 5 minutes.\n\nThere is a Gran Fondo at the end of the year; probably the distance of the short one will be something like 65 to 80 km long (40 to 50 miles).\n\nI want to do it as a personal challenge, but how the hell am I going to complete around 70 km if I can't ride for more than 90 minutes? at a pace of 23 km/h, that's not much more than 30 km, not even a half of the distance I want to cover in 5 months from now.\n\nI have never done a bike fit, but I know I should.\n\nAs I said, I'm overweight, maybe I'm like 16 kg (35 lbs), maybe I'm too heavy? Maybe my sitbones have some \"sharp\" shape? Maybe the shape of the seat is not correct? I never felt any chafing, and the bibs are not worn out in any particular spot that could indicate a chafing that im not feeling in my skin.\n\nI always loved riding bicycles recreationally, I have had different ones over the years but never anything serious, I'm not new to cycling, but I'm new to doing it like a sport (I never did any sport before, but I worked in construction, so it was a physically demanding job. I know it is not a sport, but I think I will inevitably have at least more strength than a person sitting on a chair in front of a computer all day)\n\nWell, this post ended up being pretty long, sorry if you read all of it!",

            "Bike fit. It's a weight distribution issue most likely so it might be you need to get your saddle higher or fit a longer stem to push more weight forward.\n\nI say this as an overweight cyclist who like you struggled to do much over an hour. In some ways the heavier you are the more important it is to get your fit right because you'll likely have a lesser number of comfy positions",

            "Check the angle and fore-aft position of your saddle. Small adjustments can make a big difference.",
            "I hate this and have felt your pain.  The pain and numbness we get is from compression of the pudendal nerve while sitting and more importantly tilting the pelvis while cycling.  As others have said, a good bike fit is important so you can find a position on the bike where your pelvis is behind the saddle when you are pedaling.  I bet you are sitting upright in your saddle.  Essentially we should be cantilevered over the top tube.  When we are riding, pedaling force reduces pressure on your butt slightly.  Next step would be a proper saddle that hits your sit bones optimally and has enough surface area to distribute the load.  A saddle with a cut out or a shorter nose may help.  I do think a very good quality bib short with enough padding in the skinny part in the middle (the perineal part) is really important.  So, to recap, you have two things to spend money on!  A good bike fitting and very good bib shorts.",

A trained, experienced instructor might be able to help you get over the hump. Sometimes, we get these weird mental blocks or blind spots that keep us from doing a thing and it takes someone else to spot it and help you out.",
            "problem with many absolute beginners is failing to reach a speed where the bike stabilises itself, largely due to nervousness.  Best way to bet used to rolling and steering is find a slight slope, and with pedals off and seat low enough so both feet can be on ground, then start at top of slope pushing off with feet a few times so you start rolling down.  Dont stress, just focus on staying in a straight line, use brakes to moderate pace if you have to, and with your feet down you can stop with brakes anytime and you have your feet ready to hold you upright.  after a few goes you can put pedals on and try pedalling while rolling down.  Over time you will get comfortable with the speed, braking, and steering",

            "There are 2 parts to learning to ride that are hard to pick up at the same time, balancing and propelling, which is why working on just balance first (no pedals and slight downhill) to learn how to shift one's body weight slightly and make small adjustments with the handlebars. Pedaling and pushing oneself with feet have bigger shifts in body weight, so make learning to balance much harder. If you have hurt yourself \"pretty bad\" then does that mean you are starting with your torso nearly horizontal? Most of us learn with our torsos fairly vertical, which also helps with control/safety when stopping. So maybe the bike you are using is too long and/or too tall for you to learn on? The other thing is to eliminate that you have a balance problem, which you could test with a yoga pose that has you balance on 1 leg. If you can do the pose on each leg, your balance sense is enough to learn to ride a bike.",
            "You've already got some great advice from previous comments. Don't look at the moving wheel or down at the frame, keep your head up and  your eyes on something stationary as you start to pedal, importantly relax!! If you're too tense your body will cease up and you won't be able to achieve a smooth rhythm of pedaling. If you're really struggling try looking for an adult beginners course. I don't know where you are in the world but I know the UK has Ridability that offers free courses.",
            "They sell bikes without pedals for Toddlers. They just scoot along whilst learning to balance. Once you get over the fear part and relax it will come."
