Come to find out when I went in person to verify myself, the lady never put my stuff through, she just made a note on my account that I have been verified in person. The lady said I had indicators on my account which is why I haven\u2019t seen any movement with my refund. Idk what she did but she worked it out for me.\u00a0",

That\u2019s when they put in my first request (whatever that means) then I heard back May 15th that they needed my last 2 pay stubs so I sent those over the same day. They emailed me to confirm they received those and sent them to my TAS agent. But I had to call TAS myself to get the name of my TAS agent they gave me her name and her phone number I\u2019ve called 5 times left her a voicemail each time and her recording states that due to an increase in cases it could take her up to 2 weeks to respond to voicemails\u2026 it\u2019s been a month and haven\u2019t heard from her. I\u2019m sick of waiting I need this money for my small business. These people are all a joke but I\u2019m not laughing anymore.",
