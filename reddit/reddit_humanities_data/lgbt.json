Protest is important, and voices must be heard. The greatest way to make your voice heard is to vote. Make certain your voter registration is clear so no one can mess with your vote when you arrive at the polling place. Talk this up and make sure everyone you know votes as well. \n\nI'm a bit of a pain in the butt when it comes to this but I ask everyone I know if their voter registration is clear for them to not be disappointed when they show up. This is too important to ignore. Never in the history of this country have individual rights been more under attack. LGBTQ, women's health choices, EDI, - you name it and it's all at risk.

            "Hi all!\n\nI've been an ally for a long time. More recently for grad school I've taken the time out to write about policies concerning the LGBT community. It's such a rollercoaster to see the birth of advocacy from the underground and then thrown straight into the public's eyes with the stonewall riots. It's interesting because the LGBT community embodies everything I love about anti establishment, raging against the machine and bucking the system. More recently with the equality act standardizing anti discrimination laws it's like the LGBT community is finally legally accepted in the United States. It's like the goal is achieved and the fight is over... but is it? What more can be done for advocacy and acceptance? I'm just rambling that's it. Thanks!",
            "I really don't understand / am frustrated by all the States that are trying to fight against the Title IX changes.

How can they just \"Decide\" that they aren't going to respect the update?",

The republican party's justification for doing this would be part of a dying religion, that will seal it's death of the party and religion if they did that.

We don't have much money and the only jobs me and my sibling have had are cashier. We don't have anywhere we can stay in another country long term. I'm scared that if Trump gets elected something bad will happen to us. We could get shot in public, sent to conversion therapy, sent to prison... none of the options are good. My siblings mental health is already fragile. I'm not doing well either but I'm a bit more resilient, but still really worried. I hope Trump doesn't get elected. I wish I had a good plan for if he does. Any ideas for me? Or if Trump gets elected, are we just completely f**ked?"

        "content": "Recently, there's been this video making the rounds online of a young lesbian woman discussing why she doesn't like Pride, and how she feels it's silly to be *\"proud of something I didn't choose, I was born with by chance.\"*\n\nThis video is getting posted a lot by right-wing groups as evidence that 'even the gays don't like Pride anymore' and how we should just shut up, get rid of Pride Month, just stop trying to be 'in your face' about our identity and be 'normal'.\n\nThis really concerns me. I've seen it in younger LGBTQ+ people, too.\n\nIt feels as if a lot of queer people of today seem to not grasp that we (especially us Millennial and older LGBTQ+ people) didn't make our sexuality/identity our identity - the world did. So much of the crap I took growing up was because I was perceived as gay - it followed me all through into early college. And even in the workplace, I was pushed out because I was gay, actually.\n\nThis was as recent as 2017. I'm not the only one. And it still goes on.\n\nI think that this weird throughline of thought where younger LGBTQ+ feel Pride is 'gross', making a big deal out of something normal and such is really ignorant of what we all went through. The reason they feel 'normal' is because of the hard work their LGBTQ+ elders did for them. That progress is not guaranteed to stick around.\n\nAnd this idea that we shouldn't feel proud? Look, we HAVE to feel proud because many of us - and many still do - face a world where we were SHAMED for being who we are. And we felt shame. So the idea that we feel pride for who we are isn't based on some narcissism - it's based on reclamation of ourselves.\n\nIt's based on finally accepting ourselves as okay as we are. \n\nI'm not letting go of that. And with how there's a bit of a tide shift on LGBTQ+ acceptance (seriously, it's getting uglier again out there, folks) - we will continue to need Pride, I guarantee you.\n\nIt reminds me of a lot of critique of racial injustice activists being told they 'make everything about race' - but that's the thing - no they did not! They're responding to a world that did that to them already. Period.\n\nI worry, that's all.",

I grew up in a very homophobic household where being gay was treated as something sexual and wrong so I was not told that gay people even existed until I was 11. I would feel shame when I would look at YouTube video thumbnails of girls kissing because I thought there was something bad about it.\n\nIm still stuck in the same place as before and would like nothing more than to be able to go to Pride, to finally be at a place with other people who wont look at me and see something wrong. Theyll just see me as what I am, a girl who just so happens to like other girls.",

Its gross, ok? I don't think its ok to drink beer and eat sausage around children, and don't even get me started on all the freaks wearing their lederhosen around, PERVERTS!!!! We as a society should ban Oktoberfest!!!! \" \n\nTo the LGBTQ kids not appreciating all the hardwork previous generations done to give them their rights, well, that sucks honestly. Shit, I'm only 32, and I remember being pelted with rocks by kids in my school for being bi and the administration doing nothing to stop it, even threatening to suspend me for bringing it up because something, something ZERO tolerance, since I was pelted by rocks, I was involved with the assault, so therefore I was also guilty and deserving of punishment.

I live in a town with tons of lgbt friendly businesses, and our local pride booked a ton of events, and not a single one of them was at a venue with a gender neutral bathroom. I don't know how they managed that, it feels like you would have to be trying.",
            "I understand the sentiment, but this is all purely anecdotal. A single video that is \"making the rounds\" does not encapsulate the entire sentiment of an entire community. The LGBT community is not a monolith, and while many of us feel and vote and love the same way, there will always be those who vote differently, or who dislike Pride, etc. \n\nI've been out for 2+ decades, and have met countless LGBT people: the vast majority of whom still love and celebrate Pride. I suggest celebrating Pride in whatever fashion ***you*** wish, and to not be derailed by a single video.",
            "I too am feeling less enthusiastic about pride, but it's because my local one this year was 1/2 civility politics to placate a mayor that openly hates us and the other 1/2 wanted to drown out all things LGBT+ and make it about Palestine instead. I'm all for the latter issue, but the strategy of trying to convince queer people to not vote in this election is effectively cheering on two genocides instead of one and that was the entirety of their rhetoric. Very depressing."
