            "I know my comment will probably be at the bottom as time past by, but thank you for making this thread. \n\nAs someone who is unfortunately in FL and done a semester abroad in Sydney, Australia, the climate of Florida and Australia, is completely different than what I used to be dealing with for the past few years in FL. The US scares me more and more as time past by, and idk how it got so badly (more than usual, specifically for LGBTQIA+ Rights) in terms of bills passed and hatred that is not only promoting by news stations and social media but the misinformation that may or may not effected people's close relationships with family, friends, loved ones and their communities. \n\nThe news of Anti LGBTQIA+ Bills makes me heavily cautious for the future and our safety, BUT, This is a GOOD resource in creating this thread for people who lived in America or those in other countries following US news that can still be informed in real time without bringing the energy towards the rest of the subreddit (with exception of huge development which is TBD). I will be following this thread and hopeful of some positive news that can surprised us between now and in the future. \n\nMost likely, we all are gonna be watching closely for the US November 2024 Election which everyone's mind is towards the possibility of Project 2025 starting up IF Trump is re elected again, which is scary thought to think, however, the best thing that ANYONE can do currently is to make a plan to VOTE. \n\nCheck your registration status and update any information IF you're ELIGIBLE to vote within your local district and states website. Make a habit of doing so when your information needs to be updated/according to your states voting regulations that may says you need to do for every cycle. DO NOT ONLY VOTE when it's the Presidential Elections BUT make the TIME to do so CONSISTENTLY within your LOCAL COUNTIES and STATES. The politicians we have in the House and Senate effects on what type of policies and other federal bills gets viewed and have attention towards. DO YOUR RESEARCH ON THE CANDIDATES, DO NOT PICK BLINDLY since then you be wasting your vote and you don't want that. \n\nEVERY SINGLE VOTE MATTERS, and we all need to be properly represented for changes to happen and that can't happen if we throw in the towel. Some things are out of our control such as the Current Supreme Court Justice which is a completely different story or other things that would take away the theme of LGBT subreddit (no need to list them & being vague for that reason) HOWEVER, Voting is pretty much the ONLY thing we can attempt to do via Mail in or by in person without putting ourselves in Danger by advocating or protesting. \n\nThe November 2024 Election will have effects on a global scale whatever we want to acknowledge it or not. It wouldn't be just a USA problem but it will have the potential of giving a green light to politicians in proposing other copy cat/similar policies or bills to pass in their own countries (such as Alberta, Canada) within the LGBTQIA+ Community or have unrepairable results of other global/national issues beyond what we can currently speculate. \n\nDo your part (IF ELIGIBLE) to VOTE and if you can't, that's cool, but try to start thinking of how your current states law is for LGBTQIA+ and think of survival, in other words, of alternative plans. If you are a LGBTQIA+ Youth or a Young Adult that wants to go into university or trade school, Start looking up places that will not limit your rights but can also give out federal aid or scholarships for you to attend. Check out other subreddits such as Student Loans, or your potential uni state and college to get more information beyond what you may learn online thru research. Determine if the amount of loans throughout the duration of your program (including dorms or off campus accomodations if escaping from bad living situations) is acceptable for your career paths. Don't go hundreds of thousands in debt if you not gonna see pay offs from it, and you can figure that out through other subreddits like Career Guidance, Career Advice, and potentially more.\n\nFor LGBTQIA+ Adults, IF you are capable of moving states without having to deal with financial, family obligations, work & career opportunities or other similar circumstances, then that would be suggested IF the state you live in is bad or on the verge to be down the toilet. But moving is difficult and expensive, so I suggest during a major pros/cons before doing so since it's not a decision to make easily especially if you have dependents, and others to consider within your decision but not everyone has that ability to do so unfortunately (I certainly can't for at least a few more years) and if you decide to stay in your state, do what you can to be safe that should be everyone's priority no matter what decisions they are making related to being apart of the LGBTQIA+ Community.\n\nAnyways, once again thank you Mods for creating this thread and I hope my comments can help a couple of users be motivated to vote, keep in mind their options for safety and potentially career advancement in a different state (if theirs are not good) and just overall being mindful of the current regulations without being overwhelmed until we have more concrete information as time gets closer for the November Election.",

            "A comment from og thread:\n\n\nPlease note that this decision by the court REFUSED the transgender woman's request to be recognized as the child's \"mother\". It forced her to be recognized as the \"father\", otherwise the child would not get benefits.  \n  \nThis was not what the parent wanted, and is the default way in cases like this as Japan does not recognize same-sex marriage.\n\nSocial media is strange. Another thread about this exact case framed it as \"court refuses to recognize transgender woman as the mother\", and people were criticizing Japan as being backward.\n\nBut in this thread, they are getting praise...?",
            "Not a great thing, the court official recognized her as misgendered against her wishes",
            "Maybe someone can fill me in on this, because I was under the impression that if you want to change your gender marker in Japan you need to be unmarried and have no children under 18. The article says she changed her gender marker soon *after* the birth of her first daughter, a daughter which she was apparently recognized as the \"father\" of at that time. Did the law change at some point or what's going on here?",
            "Here\u2019s the full article for context:\n\n\u201cJapan's top court on Friday recognized a transgender woman as the \"father\" of her 3-year-old daughter conceived using her frozen sperm and born to her female partner after legally transitioning, in the first such ruling.\n\nScrapping a high court ruling, the Supreme Court recognized the parent-child relationship of the woman in her 40s, who was assigned male at birth and underwent gender reassignment surgery in 2018, and her second daughter, born in 2020, using sperm preserved before her transition.\n\n\"If a child cannot seek recognition because of a gender change, he or she cannot receive support as a dependent or become an heir. This is clearly contrary to the child's welfare and interests,\" the ruling said.\n\nThe Tokyo High Court ruling in August 2022 said the trans woman can only be recognized as the parent to her first daughter born before the legal gender change, but not after, resulting in different parent-child relationship statuses for the daughters.\n\nThe decision came despite both children being confirmed as biological children of the woman and her partner through DNA tests.\n\nThe woman applied for recognition as a parent of two daughters at a local government after switching from male to female in 2018 between the two births but was rejected.\n\nThe family then sought a legal remedy, filing a lawsuit with a Tokyo Family Court in 2021, but the court did not recognize the woman as a parent for both daughters.\n\nJapan does not recognize same-sex marriage. The country's law on gender dysphoria requires surgery to remove a person's reproductive capabilities to register a gender change, but a top court decision in 2023 said that was unconstitutional.\u201d",
            "Did they get it right though? They\u2019re recognising her as the child\u2019s father, and not mother like she\u2019d petitioned. \n\nIt\u2019s better than having no legal relationship to her kids, but it still means it is impossible for Japanese kids to have more than one legal parent sharing a gender.",
            "People don't read past the headlines internet 101. Also people like Japan until they remember it's conservative.",
            "Probably a result of Japans koseki system being outdated as fuck as it still is not possible for same sex couples to be in it. Japan is one of those countries where it truly baffles me that its not legal yet to be in a queer marriage.",
            "She's still legally the child's father",
            ">The country's law on gender dysphoria requires surgery to remove a person's reproductive capabilities to register a gender change  \\[...\\]\n\nAnd that's textbook eugenics. Mind you, Finland had the same requirement until last year, much like equal marriage rights started to be rolled out, with some earlier exceptions, only around ten years ago, so it's not like Japan's that much behind countries generally seen as progressive. It's still eugenics, though."
