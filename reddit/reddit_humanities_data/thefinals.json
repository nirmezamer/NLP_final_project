All low effort rant posts will likely be redirected to here. We get a lot of comments in here, so please consider reading and replying to/upvoting comments already made that share your sentiment instead of burying them with tons of new individual ones. You have a voice here, but it's louder when you put them all together in the same spot.\n\nSome things the Megathread covers (but not limited to):\n\n* Lag\n* SBMM\n* Contracts\n* Toxic Players\n* Cheaters\n* Bad Teammates\n* Player Count\n\nAs always, please be respectful when you talk to each other.\n\nSee you in The Finals!",

            "I don't want to be repetitive but please remove the mandatory TAA and (if possible) add TSR. This is why the game looks terrible on the non rtx computers. I beg you.\n\nEdit at 5 upvote: Pay attention to the arrival of the latest versions of resolution upscaling technologies. So the FPS problem that many people complain about can be solved to some extent.",
            "Anyone else having issues with the 15 eliminations with launchers or shotguns?",
            "I have way more crashes and loading screen locks than some weeks ago. Hope Embark knows and works on it.",
            "deflect box too small. buff dual swords plox",
            "I'm honestly getting so fed up with the game punishing players for being loyal. If you play terminal attack, and someone leaves, the entire lobby is penalized. If you play world tour and your teammates leave, you're stuck in a lobby alone and are forced to either lose or leave and take a penalty yourself. Its to the point where its almost not fun.",
            "It's wild how irrelevant heavy is in TA, it fills a few niche roles but just fails to keep up with a XP/lh1/sniper sonar grenade light in every single way. \n\nWhat can embark even do at this point? Rebuff heavy? Nerf light? Nothing about the last 6 months of this game has been remotely balanced around TA.",
            "I want to leave feedback about TA ranked: As a non player of that mode, I enjoyed it plenty however it felt too long! No stakes at all after the 5th round. I find casual better in that regard.",
            "How are randoms so bad? At least when i solo queue i get people that have teh gamesense of a potato.",
            "what the actual HELL happened with the hit reg? i am actually shocked how could you bring the game to this state with a few updates. I actually sprayed like 20-30 bullets into a STANDING body without any single shot being registered. I swear to god, it was the best FPS shooter ever, but with a one simple update they somehow ruined it.",
            "What is the meta? Im new and want to at least be helpful."

            "I feel it's a great addition. My patented tactic of running in the complete opposite direction of melee/flamethrower heavies until they're off my tail no longer works, and that's a good thing. The big boys needed some way to get close to enemies and this does just that perfectly",
            "my flamethrower is finally usable in other mods than power shift :).. I love that feeling when finally catch that annoying light dashing around me.. it's like finally slap a mosquito after all night of buzz and bites",
            "It's pretty cool, but something I absolutely hate is that it can pull you around objects. The amount of times I've broken LoS with a heavy completely and then get pulled around (through??) a wall is too damn high",
            "I personally hate the idea of an unavoidable insta kill",
            "great! as a medium player it may be annoying ,sure. but Heavy mains deserve this, it looks like a lot of fun too haha",
            "Wave emote while hooking is FOUL lol",
