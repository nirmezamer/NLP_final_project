        "content": "Original post: https://old.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/dyxhsw/modpost_graduate_admissions_is_a_grueling_process/\n\nMore recent post:\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/lakb6l/admissionsrejections_season_can_be_really_hard/\n\n\nMany if not most of those previous numbers are still valid, but please continue to contribute and build a new database for helplines.\n\nWhether you get in, don't get in, get in and then lose your funding, don't get funding at all, or whatever, everyone has risk at having a crisis when they need to talk. I personally used one of these helplines after losing funding as a graduate student during the '08 recession when I was in a really bad way. There is no shame in calling them. At. All.\n\nWhy is this necessary to post and share and sticky? As /u/ThrowawayHistory20 said in a previous thread:\n>Many of us seeking admission to top tier grad schools, and just grad schools in general, grew up our whole lives hearing \u201cwow you\u2019re so smart!\u201d Or \u201cyou\u2019re so good at X field!\u201d from parents, teachers, friends, etc. That then causes many of us, myself included, to internalize this belief that being smart or good at our field or just knowing a lot of things is what makes us valuable. It can help drive us to be good at our field (though in a toxic way because it\u2019s driven by a fear that if we fall behind, we lose the thing that make us valuable), but it also makes rejection very rough.\n\n>We know logically that when we get rejected from a top school in a competitive field that it means \u201cyou were a well qualified applicant, but there were too many well qualified applicants for us to take everyone,\u201d but it can feel more like \u201cyou\u2019re not good enough at the one thing you\u2019re good at and the one thing that gives you value as a human being.\u201d\n\nAgain, please share any additional resources and/or helplines here.\n\nArchived Helpline Info:\n\nIn the US, you can call 988 for crisis support, or 1-877-GRAD-HLP for support specific to graduate students/grad school issues.\n\nText 'HELP' to 741741 in the United States, or 686868 in Canada.\n\nAustralian folks can call 13 11 14.\n\nIn the UK, text 85258.\n\nIn Brazil, The CVV number is 188.\n\nIn India, call 022 2754 6669.",

            "I just got rejected. It was my first time applying as I\u2019m 42 and finishing my undergraduate degree currently. I can\u2019t help but feel it\u2019s because I\u2019m older and changing careers. It\u2019s really humbling and definitely not a good experience",
            "I wnated to say, I really massively respect the dedication, focus and insane tenacity and skill of all people who seek to do a Masters or PhD. Your passion for the field and your ability and willingness to care for every detail, and the reams of article drafts you have to pour over... when universities say they stand on the shoulders of giants, they are standing on yours too! \n\nThis includes folks who are not commencing a Masters or PhD this cycle. Whether you try again (I hope you do!! Damn the application fees) or apply your skills and virtues elsewhere, the world needs your gifts and is the better for it.",
            "One of the tougher issues is getting admission and being denied a visa to go to school. For some of us in developing countries, the trauma is sometimes twofold. 1. Getting for the admission process hurdle and 2. Getting over the visa application process hurdle.",
            "Applied to twelve PhD programs, rejected from ten of them, still haven't heard back from two. I thought I was a strong enough candidate to at least get an interview, but I guess not. All that time and money down the drain and now I don't know what to do. I'm trying to bounce back and am applying to jobs and researching master's programs. Trying to see it as a blessing because I'm not so sure I even want a PhD anymore. I just feel so guilty like I'm letting my family down because I would have been the first in my family to go to grad school and I took a post-bacc year to focus on strengthening my profile and applying and now.....all that time and money gone. Sigh. Can't talk to my friends about it because they've been getting good news and I don't want to make them feel like they can't celebrate it with me. So I'm just venting here. I knew my program was competitive, but geez. Wasn't expecting this sudden life crisis lol",

            "Pretty sure i got rejected from my masters programs. Saw people post about their acceptances on grad cafe but i haven't heard back lol.",

            "As someone who got rejected from all 10 PhD programs two years ago (worked on masters in meantime), I just want to give some solidarity to whoever needs it. I've been putting off working on my applications this year because even though I know getting rejected isn't a comment on my abilities or on myself, it still hurt and it still left some scars. \n\nI just want to tell anyone who needs to hear that they're not alone. We'll get through this. It might take time, but we'll get through this.",

It\u2019s definitely fulfilling and heart-warming to see helpful people out there who give their two cents to the ones in trouble. This post is about me, and I really wish that anyone who is reading this gets something good out of it and does something beyond their limits.\n\nToday marks one of the most memorable days in my life. One must be wondering that this dude might have gotten into Harvard or Stanford, or this dude\u2019s cracked. Well, neither, or maybe the latter depending on your level of tolerance. \n\nI applied to colleges just a couple of months back and I\u2019m satisfied with the admits that I have but I\u2019ve realised that a degree is not going to define me whatsoever. Nor is it going to give me an edge over others. My purpose and passion will. This cascades down to the mental awareness I have which further links to a lot of neurological effects. No matter whatever corner of the world I go to, I\u2019m gonna put my best foot forward. Help people, add meaning to their lives and be the greatest of all time. \n\nTo the people applying to colleges, please remember why you\u2019re doing it. In a world full of cyber-zombies, be the light and invent things which the world has never seen before. I want to gain respect of my loved ones and the people I help, which transcends the materialistic aspects. I want to take the lead. Sure wealth is important, but it wouldn\u2019t be possible without having a meaning to your job. I\u2019m gonna go work a 9-5, gain required skills, work the job that I despise without any complaints, not get irritated by that annoying coworker and later build an empire of my own. All of this will be worth the hustle while I can keep my mental health in check. I want to be the greatest the world has ever seen. ",

        "content": "I'm from the US and I'm having a hard time figuring out what schools to target because the programs I am interested are heavily international. I have talked to a few applicants/current students to get an idea of their profile/stats and see if I should bother applying to the program or if my profile doesn't stack up.\n\nI only have 3 people who I can get LoRs from, and I don't want to ask them for more than 8-10. Therefore, I was looking through the list of programs I am interested in and decided to not apply to more than 1 or 2 at top schools (M7 business schools)\n\nHowever, I have also heard from some people including my own family, who were former international Ph.D. students, that it is easier for US citizens who have US degrees to get into US grad programs. So they think I should apply to the top programs even if my profile isn't necessarily as good as some of the people I've talked to (who are international). Is this actually true, or would I be wasting application fees and letters of rec?

However, this doesn't mean that your residency makes up for a mediocre or average profile. You're still required to be as competitive as the international candidates.",
            "Yes, it\u2019s easier for US residents.\n\nAlso, you shouldn\u2019t limit your applications due to your letter-writers. Just ask them to submit their letter to Interfolio, which can then forward the letter anywhere you want.",

Plus having education from a US school with a known reputation is less of a gamble than some international institutions. Some STEM programs get a lot of military funding for research and only US students can work on certain projects. I know at least one top 25 engineering program that will basicslly take any American with a pulse and engineering undergrad degree",
