            "That is so weird to segment your product line by being able to update the firmware or not. \n\nIf it was a cost saving measure then MSI has exposed themselves to the risk of not being able to fix bugs that are found later. This hurts the MSI brand.",
            "Is it possible the UPX or URX will have the ability to disable DSC in the future? Disabling DSC with hdmi 2.1 allows 4k 120hz 10bpc while still allowing DSR/DLDSR to be functional with Nvidia cards. This is perfect for single player and older games that have the headroom to utilize DSR for much better picture quality when you dont need super high refresh rate. The price is right and the monitors look great, but not having the ability to use DLDSR by disabling DSC is a deal breaker for me unfortunately",
            "The MAG line should be discontinued after this year. For the majority of the time since their announcement, it was difficult to understand the differences between the models. Now that I know the MAG line won't have updatable firmware, I don't see why any knowledgeable consumer would want one.",
            "So just so I understand since Im new to buying monitors. If I buy the MAG 271QPX I will never get a software updates so any issues it comes with I will just have to deal with?",
            "When will MSI EU is making an statement like this? And tell us why the price is so damn high?",
            "Remember when dell said you couldnt firmware update the dw because of the NVIDIA chip yet now you can this sounds like an upsell but if its not. Hope MSI higher is ready to eat all the Best Buy total tech/warranty returns down the line for things that could have been fixed via firmware updates. Not mad at OP he is just the messenger but hope he relays this up the chain since saving a couple bucks here is likely to cost you thousands more down the line",

We will be updating this post in the meantime and provide you with additional information after the embargo lifts on May 30th.***\n\n**World's First Glossy Gaming Display**\n\nThe ROG Strix OLED XG27AQDMG is the world\u2019s first gaming monitor to feature a glossy WOLED display. Combined with the latest third generation ROG OLED technologies, the XG27AQDMG showcases vibrant colors, sharper images, and the darkest black hues under any lighting conditions; it also provides up to 20% brighter visuals compared to previous generation ROG monitors.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9uwo6wkwon1d1.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=616783d6e1a090cd1408360bf7395f985e0b427d\n\nAs an OLED gaming display, the ROG Strix XG27AQDM features a 240Hz refresh rate, sub-1ms response time (0.03ms GTG), BFI support through Extreme Low Motion Blur (ELMB), Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) Support, and NVIDIA G-Sync Compatibility and FreeSync Premium support to ensure that your gameplay is fast and smooth.\n\nFactory calibrated, the display covers 99% DCI-P3 and 135% sRGB, color accurate within Delta E < 2, true 10-bit color, HDR10, is certified for DisplayHDR TrueBlack 400 and maintains a brightness of 275 nits (100% APL) in SDR. The calibration report can be accessed through the OSD as an e-report. As a third-gen WOLED, the display also features the Clear Pixel Edge algorithm to provide crystal-clear text.\n\n**ASPECT RATIO**\n\nFor gamers who typically use smaller monitors, the XG27AQDMG is able to display a 4:3 aspect ratio image, or a full-screen 4:3 aspect with deep black OLED borders around the image. For FPS players, playing on a full-screen 4:3 aspect ratio makes in-game targets or character models look slightly larger, making them easier to hit.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1mjfvwmkcs2d1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb5912caeb6902a67c66776a9012360b2771e3c9\n\n**ROG OLED Anti-Flicker Technology**\n\nOne concern OLED gaming displays generate is flicker that occurs when VRR is enabled, due to the way OLED pixels are electrically controlled. This flicker is further amplified by significant refresh-rate fluctuations and the human eye\u2019s sensitivity to changes in brightness, especially in darker scenes. To combat this, new ROG Anti-Flicker technology offers three anti-flicker levels (Strong / Middle / Off) that stabilizes the refresh rate within a carefully optimized range. This minimizes flicker perception to ensure smoother, more enjoyable viewing experiences.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7ku3nwqxon1d1.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b8b04ccf984bb3b960dad86d2470d293dcbb591\n\n**Cooling Design and ASUS OLED Care**\n\nAs seen with recent ROG OLED Gaming monitors, the ROG Strix XG27AQDMG is designed with features to extend the life of the OLED display and reduce the potential risk for burn-in. The XG27AQDMG includes a custom passive heatsink, a power adapter removed from the display to reduce overall temperature, ASUS OLED Care features, and a microfiber cleaning cloth. ASUS OLED Care includes pixel cleaning, screen saver, screen move, and logo brightness adjustment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v387ike5pn1d1.jpg?width=1276&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=985863717845888941ddbceae26e4fb418ce19b4\n\n**ROG XG S Series**\n\nThe XG27AQDMG is part of our latest ROG Strix XG S Series displays, which have a consistent design theme in mind \u2013 utility, small footprint, ergonomics and connectivity. Starting with the design, the monitor features a small footprint with a compact stand base, preserving valuable desk space and conveniently providing a space to place your cell phone or mobile device while gaming. It also features a full range of ergonomic motion with tilt, swivel, pivot, height adjustment, VESA mount support, and a 1/4\" tripod socket on top of the stand. Lastly, the display provides DisplayPort 1.4 (DSC), 2x HDMI (v2.0), and a USB hub (2x USB 3.2 Gen1 Type-A).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x4ya6n8hpn1d1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=99105488839bfc48fee29ace212e54c10078a373\n\n**Specs and Features:**\n\n* 27\u201d (26.5\u201d viewable) QHD (2560x1440) Glossy WOLED with 240Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms (GTG) response time\n* Equipped with the latest third-generation WOLED technology - including META and Clear Pixel Edge - to provide brighter full-white windows, clearer text, and improved motion clarity\n* Factory calibrated, 275 nits (100% APL) in SDR, 135% sRGB, 99% DCP-P3, true 10-bit, HDR10, DisplayHDR 400 True Black certified\n* Variable Refresh Rate, G-Sync Compatibility, and FreeSync Premium support for supersmooth, tear free visuals with low-latency\n* ASUS-exclusive Extreme Low Motion Blur (ELMB) technology enables even crisper and clearer motion in fast-paced games\n* ROG-exclusive OLED Anti-flicker technology helps reduce the flicker during refresh-rate fluctuations\n* Highly-efficient custom passive heatsink, advanced airflow design, ASUS OLED Care features to reduce temperatures and risk of burn-in\n* Extensive connectivity options include 1x DisplayPort 1.4 (DSC), 2x HDMI 2.0, earphone jack and 2x USB 3.2 Gen1 Type-A\n* Stand includes 1/4\" threaded mount to mount a camera, mic, light, or anything else your battlestation needs\n* ROG Gaming AI technology with Dynamic shadow boost, Dynamic cross-hair, and Display Alignment (helps quickly align this display to another monitor) to enhance users' experience in gaming\n* ASUS DisplayWidget Center allows you to quickly and easily adjust OLED care functions and monitor settings in your OS with a mouse\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ogy8yo7f1t2d1.jpg?width=952&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4d1693cea5e7a7757d1fa697e64280d1c1b64b54\n\n* ASUS AuraSync support\n* Supports Firmware Updating\n* 3 Year Warranty (including panel burn-in)\n\n**US Pricing and Availability:**\n\n* US Availability \u2013 May 30th, 2024\n* Price (USD) - $749 (MSRP), with launch exclusive pricing at $699 at Newegg, Microcenter, and the ASUS eShop (limited offer)\n* Product Page - [https://rog.asus.com/us/monitors/27-to-31-5-inches/rog-strix-oled-xg27aqdmg/](https://rog.asus.com/us/monitors/27-to-31-5-inches/rog-strix-oled-xg27aqdmg/)\n\n**FAQ**\n\n*Q. Is the WOLED panel the same as the ROG Swift PG27AQDM?*\n\nA. Yes, it uses the same WOLED panel, but has a native glossy implementation.\n\n*Q. Which version of MLA does it use?*\n\nA. The ROG Strix XG27AQDMG uses third-gen MLA -\n\n* PG27AQDM - 2nd Gen MLA\n* XG27AQDMG - 3rd Gen MLA\n\nQ. *Is the glossy WOLED panel on the ROG Strix XG27AQDMG similar to the Dough Spectrum OLED?*\n\nA. Although they both use the same panel as the PG27AQDM, there are some important differences:\n\n* ROG Strix XG27AQDMG - uses an exclusive native glossy WOLED panel based on the PG27AQDM directly from LG Display.\n* Dough Spectrum - uses the matte version of the WOLED panel based on the PG27AQDM, and then uses a third-party glass cover to provide a glossy appearance. Use of the glass cover can prevent heat from dissipating normally, leading to higher temperatures in the display.\n\n*Q. Does the XG27AQDMG offer the same DCI-P3 and sRGB coverage as the PG27AQDM?*\n\nA. Yes, the color gamut coverage is the same as the PG27AQDM.\n\n*Q. Does this monitor support black frame insertion (BFI)?*\n\nA. Yes, the model supports BFI in the form of Extreme Low Motion Blur (ELMB). BFI is limited to 120Hz and ideally suited for gamers who cannot sustain an ultra-high FPS/refresh rate value ( i.e. 240Hz ) or using a console. In these situations, with ELMB active the effective motion clarity is close to that of 240Hz native operation.\n\n***Usage insight tip***\u00a0\u2013 When utilizing this mode you will see a reduction in panel luminance. This is inherent to the design of ELMB/BFI.\n\nQ. Does HDMI 2.0 affect console functionality?\n\nA. No, HDMI 2.0 does not affect console functionality, and in fact supports Auto-Low Latency Mode (ALLM) and Variable Refresh Rate (VRR).\n\n**MISC.**\n\nAs noted above, we will be adding to this page, so if you have some questions or wonder about specific measurements or features that appear to be missing, it's likely that we simply can't post them yet. However, feel free to ask about them below.\n\nEdit - 5/20 to add more content, FAQ, and update pricing information.\n\nEdit - 5/26 to add additional clarity and context to a number of features, specs, and FAQ\n\nEdit - 5/31 to update product page link.",

            "The only issue is you'd have to deal with ASUS for warranties. Remember when my last ASUS monitor died, took them 3-4 months to replace it after dealing with them trying to swap it for something that was 25% of the cost. Then you add on the headache of their overseas call centers who'd rather hang up on you than actually resolve problems. Had a Dell monitor die on me and they did an advanced RMA and had a new one at my door within 2 business days of calling. Think I'll wait for a company that cares about customers to release one.",

            "I really wanted to love this monitor. Jumped at the $200 off deal on Newegg but couldn't get past the coating. It's not \"as bad\" as traditional matte but leaves a lot to be desired compared to the C2/C3 glossy finish.",
            "In the US its on display at Best Buy stores. Hopefully they will do the same at Currys. 1 thing I noticed is that the color looks flat and toned down. Its not popping out and vibrant like QD-OLEDS. One will probably not notice it unless you have used QD-OLEDS for a long time. I guess its an okay trade off for the 480hz 1080p dual mode when playing FPS games.",
            "Mouse and keyboard implies a PC, but you play all your games on console? I guess you chose the display for the form factor rather than the refresh rate. Though QD-OLED might have been preferable if you have no need for a 480 Hz toggle."
