I had 1 room left and I tell them the price. She asks me to hold the room. I hold the room and a couple show up 25 minutes later. They had a 5 minute trip.\n\nI'm again asked the price, I tell them the price which is the same one I quoted the other agent. They ask for a discount, because they are checking in so late and they were the last to check in. I tell them I have 1 more reservation left. That my boss wouldn't be happy with me giving a discount on our last room. (I had already had 2 calls asking for rooms while I waited for them to come in, so i knew i could sell the room.)\n\nThey then asked for a late check out, I offered 1130 am. Again they said they were checking in late. We are sold out Saturday,  with alot of requests for early check in. I told them I could go as late as 1130.\n\nThey then complained about the other property,  saying they were beyond dirty and accepted pets. I told them we accepted pets, but they are on a floor that doesn't normally have pets, but I couldn't guarantee a pet hadn't been in the room due to pet shows or sneaked in pets. They weren\u2019t happy,  but still took the room.\n\nThen an 1 hour and 10 minutes later I get the male half of the couple coming down. He says the above statement about the room being disgusting. \n\nNone of the complaints he says is about cleanliness. Missing screen on window, missing lock on window. (He is on the 2nd floor.) \n\nTV remote not working. \n\nGrout is coming up in tub. (We are slowly replacing the grout because my boss hired cheap when getting the tubs replaced and they did a bad job.) He then complained about our maintenance man not doing a good job, not keeping up the maintenance.  I told him we are working on issues that happen due to regular wear and tear.\n\nKnowing he was looking for a discount and he started the conversation with the room being disgusting. I decided to go with the nuclear option, I offered to check him out without charge and they could leave. He said he would get back to me after speaking to the wife. \n\nI replaced the TV remote, it was dead, not even new batteries could revive it. I haven't heard from him 3 hours later. I guess the room wasn't that disgusting. \n\nEdit left a sentence unfinished \n\n",

        "content": "I work at a hotel that is part of a larger chain. Over a year ago, a man called our hotel front desk and went on and on and on about our online reviews (We have not been able to retain any housekeepers who can do a quality job, so we unfortunately have lots of reviews about rooms being dirty). Despite reading all these reviews, he chose to book at our hotel anyway, and then called to inform me that he needs an incentive to stay with us, like free breakfast and free parking. He also mentioned he is a Super Special Top Level Rewards Member many times. (He\u2019s actually not the rewards member; his son-in-law is, and his son-in-law books rooms for him.)\n\nI am the FOM, and I was supposed to be in our weekly managers\u2019 meeting when I took this phone call at the desk (a great mistake). So I was already deeply irritated that this man wouldn\u2019t shut up, and yet I maintained my composure and my professionalism and told him again and again what his Super Special Top Level Rewards Member benefits are, which do not include free breakfast and parking. I believe I even told him he was welcome to book at another hotel in our brand if he was not satisfied with our reviews online. Yet he chose to book our hotel anyway.\n\nI finally got off the phone, fuming and having promised him nothing. Later, he called again and got my general manager Mark (all names in this story are fake), who made the mistake of telling this guest that he would accommodate these requests. I gave Mark my honest opinion about that decision, but the deed was done. I ended up being the one checking the guest in when the day arrived, and I begrudgingly gave him his complimentary breakfast vouchers and marked his parking pass as comped.\n\nThat was over a year ago. Since then, this guest has stayed with us 2 more times. In that time, Mark quit, we got a new GM, Bryan, who subsequently got fired, and then Mark came back to us.\n\nIn March, this guest called again, asking about booking and receiving free breakfast and free parking. My sweet front desk agent Ella took the call. Ella hates giving anyone anything free anyway, even when I tell her she should. So even though she hung up the call and I wasn\u2019t there to hear it, I am positive she was telling the truth when she said she promised him nothing. I told her she did the right thing, and that by continuing to give him things he was not entitled to, we were going to create a monster out of him. I then created a profile note detailing exactly what the Super Special Top Level Rewards Member benefits are and what they are not so that no one would give him contrary information.\n\nFast forward to the past couple weeks. This guest called multiple times prior to his stay to secure a promise of free breakfast and free parking. Every time, he was told no. However, now he knows some of our names, so he started name dropping. \u201cBryan promised me this when I booked.\u201d Bryan never spoke to this man on the phone, and furthermore, Ella was the one who originally booked his reservation, one week before Bryan got fired. That reservation was cancelled, and this guest rebooked in May, when Mark was with us, and he furthermore rebooked through central reservations, so no one there would have promised him that. \n\nThen it was \u201cSnurtz promised me this.\u201d No the f I did not. Then he told the FDA who checked him in that Tina, another FDA, made that promise. A server in the restaurant came to me one morning at the desk and asked if this guest should have a voucher, because he said he was guaranteed free breakfast. I laughed and told him absolutely not.\n\nI was off for the weekend, but I read all the shift communications in my email, and there were several mentions that this guest said he was promised breakfast and parking, with Mark responding in ALL CAPS AND BOLD FONT that he was not to be given ANYTHING and that he had personally spoken to him and made this clear.\n\nThe guest opened a customer care case with corporate, insisting he had been promised these free amenities that we refused to honor. Mark responded that we do not offer free breakfast or free parking, and corporate closed the case.\n\nToday, we got a review from this guest\u2019s son-in-law, who owns the Super Special Top Level Rewards Member account, saying that while our staff is friendly (thank you for at least admitting that), he still had the issue that his FIL was PROMISED free breakfast and parking, and how embarrassing it was for him that his FIL ended up paying about $180 in incidentals for those two things.\n\nI had the pleasure of sending back the following review response, after letting Mark read and approve it:\n\nDear [Rewards Member],\n\nThank you for taking the time to leave your feedback with us. I would just like to clarify that at no point was your father-in-law ever promised free parking or free breakfast. He was offered those benefits as a courtesy on a previous stay, but not on this stay.\n\nI spoke to your father-in-law personally several times, as did my general manager and several of my staff, and no one promised to accommodate these requests. He spoke to several different employees, dropping a different person's name each time (including a former general manager who no longer works at this property and left us before this reservation was made) and insisting that they had promised him those benefits. When those employees were asked, they denied agreeing to any accommodation.\n\n[Super Special Top Level] Rewards members are entitled to the following benefits, as detailed on [brand]\u2019s website:\n\n- Welcome gift\n- Complimentary upgrade based on availability\n- Early check-in/late check-out upon request\n\nBreakfast and parking are not benefits [brand] offers to their [Super Special Top Level] members, even upon request. There is a note on your profile in our system detailing what benefits you are entitled to.\n\nWhile we appreciate your business and loyalty as a regular guest of [brand] Hotels, we ask that you please be mindful of what is guaranteed to our [brand] members. If you have any questions or concerns, you can reach out to me or [Mark], General Manager, at any time. We are happy to be of assistance.\n\nI hope you have a wonderful day.\n\nSincerely,\n[Snurtz]\nFront Office Manager",

My co-workers and I at one of my prior properties had to deal with a guy who had a Local Negotated Rate (LNR) with us which usually averaged at $70 durning the off season and about $100 during the peak season and it was all listed in the contract.  Well this guy when making his reservations always demanded to have one of 2 rooms and then get mad when we had some else staying in those two particular rooms.  One day, I think my GM finally had enough of him and got with our regional manager and they finally got him to realize that he was in no place to be bullying the front desk agents about a room when we had guests who were paying anywhere between $250 and $400 a night for that exact same room type and that those guest will have priorty over him when it comes to room request because he eventually stop harassing everyone at the desk about what room he was in.",
