        "content": "I work at a hotel that is part of a larger chain. Over a year ago, a man called our hotel front desk and went on and on and on about our online reviews (We have not been able to retain any housekeepers who can do a quality job, so we unfortunately have lots of reviews about rooms being dirty). Despite reading all these reviews, he chose to book at our hotel anyway, and then called to inform me that he needs an incentive to stay with us, like free breakfast and free parking. He also mentioned he is a Super Special Top Level Rewards Member many times. (He\u2019s actually not the rewards member; his son-in-law is, and his son-in-law books rooms for him.)\n\nI am the FOM, and I was supposed to be in our weekly managers\u2019 meeting when I took this phone call at the desk (a great mistake). So I was already deeply irritated that this man wouldn\u2019t shut up, and yet I maintained my composure and my professionalism and told him again and again what his Super Special Top Level Rewards Member benefits are, which do not include free breakfast and parking. I believe I even told him he was welcome to book at another hotel in our brand if he was not satisfied with our reviews online. Yet he chose to book our hotel anyway.\n\nI finally got off the phone, fuming and having promised him nothing. Later, he called again and got my general manager Mark (all names in this story are fake), who made the mistake of telling this guest that he would accommodate these requests. I gave Mark my honest opinion about that decision, but the deed was done. I ended up being the one checking the guest in when the day arrived, and I begrudgingly gave him his complimentary breakfast vouchers and marked his parking pass as comped.\n\nThat was over a year ago. Since then, this guest has stayed with us 2 more times. In that time, Mark quit, we got a new GM, Bryan, who subsequently got fired, and then Mark came back to us.\n\nIn March, this guest called again, asking about booking and receiving free breakfast and free parking. My sweet front desk agent Ella took the call. Ella hates giving anyone anything free anyway, even when I tell her she should. So even though she hung up the call and I wasn\u2019t there to hear it, I am positive she was telling the truth when she said she promised him nothing. I told her she did the right thing, and that by continuing to give him things he was not entitled to, we were going to create a monster out of him. I then created a profile note detailing exactly what the Super Special Top Level Rewards Member benefits are and what they are not so that no one would give him contrary information.\n\nFast forward to the past couple weeks. This guest called multiple times prior to his stay to secure a promise of free breakfast and free parking. Every time, he was told no. However, now he knows some of our names, so he started name dropping. \u201cBryan promised me this when I booked.\u201d Bryan never spoke to this man on the phone, and furthermore, Ella was the one who originally booked his reservation, one week before Bryan got fired. That reservation was cancelled, and this guest rebooked in May, when Mark was with us, and he furthermore rebooked through central reservations, so no one there would have promised him that. \n\nThen it was \u201cSnurtz promised me this.\u201d No the f I did not. Then he told the FDA who checked him in that Tina, another FDA, made that promise. A server in the restaurant came to me one morning at the desk and asked if this guest should have a voucher, because he said he was guaranteed free breakfast. I laughed and told him absolutely not.\n\nI was off for the weekend, but I read all the shift communications in my email, and there were several mentions that this guest said he was promised breakfast and parking, with Mark responding in ALL CAPS AND BOLD FONT that he was not to be given ANYTHING and that he had personally spoken to him and made this clear.\n\nThe guest opened a customer care case with corporate, insisting he had been promised these free amenities that we refused to honor. Mark responded that we do not offer free breakfast or free parking, and corporate closed the case.\n\nToday, we got a review from this guest\u2019s son-in-law, who owns the Super Special Top Level Rewards Member account, saying that while our staff is friendly (thank you for at least admitting that), he still had the issue that his FIL was PROMISED free breakfast and parking, and how embarrassing it was for him that his FIL ended up paying about $180 in incidentals for those two things.\n\nI had the pleasure of sending back the following review response, after letting Mark read and approve it:\n\nDear [Rewards Member],\n\nThank you for taking the time to leave your feedback with us. I would just like to clarify that at no point was your father-in-law ever promised free parking or free breakfast. He was offered those benefits as a courtesy on a previous stay, but not on this stay.\n\nI spoke to your father-in-law personally several times, as did my general manager and several of my staff, and no one promised to accommodate these requests. He spoke to several different employees, dropping a different person's name each time (including a former general manager who no longer works at this property and left us before this reservation was made) and insisting that they had promised him those benefits. When those employees were asked, they denied agreeing to any accommodation.\n\n[Super Special Top Level] Rewards members are entitled to the following benefits, as detailed on [brand]\u2019s website:\n\n- Welcome gift\n- Complimentary upgrade based on availability\n- Early check-in/late check-out upon request\n\nBreakfast and parking are not benefits [brand] offers to their [Super Special Top Level] members, even upon request. There is a note on your profile in our system detailing what benefits you are entitled to.\n\nWhile we appreciate your business and loyalty as a regular guest of [brand] Hotels, we ask that you please be mindful of what is guaranteed to our [brand] members. If you have any questions or concerns, you can reach out to me or [Mark], General Manager, at any time. We are happy to be of assistance.\n\nI hope you have a wonderful day.\n\nSincerely,\n[Snurtz]\nFront Office Manager",

The delivery person is not allowed to go to a guest\u2019s room. This ensures the safety of both our guests and the delivery person themselves.\n\nIt ain\u2019t hard. We have an elevator. I call the room whenever the delivery person arrives. Hell, if I know someone is disabled/has severe mobility issues or if it\u2019s a single mom with multiple young kids, I\u2019ll take it up myself when I have a minute. But I\u2019m often the only staff member in the building on my shift, so it\u2019s not like I can run back and forth for every Joe Schmoe who\u2019s too lazy to get their pizza from the lobby. \n\nWhen Ben first arrived to check in, he was annoying af. Loud, impatient, arrogant. You could tell he was full of himself. And he clearly looked down on customer service workers. Check-in was fine. He went to his room without a problem.\n\nLater that night, around 10pm, the pizza guy shows up and asks if he\u2019s allowed to go up to the guest\u2019s room. I said no, I have to call them and have them come down to the lobby. Poor guy looked really nervous and bounced on the ball of his foot for a second before saying, \u201cBen tipped us and left a note saying that the tip was specifically so we\u2019d bring it to his room\u2026 can you.. can you tell him that it\u2019s not, I mean\u2026.\u201d\n\nI got the idea and reassured him that yes, I\u2019d tell Ben it was the hotel\u2019s policy and not the delivery guy\u2019s decision. That\u2019s a pretty reasonable request. He said thanks and left. He left the receipt on top of the box. I caught a glimpse of it, and Ben\u2019s note printed on it was rude as all shit smh. \u201cI gave you a tip, so don\u2019t act like you\u2019re lazy. Just bring it to my room.\u201d Wooow. \n\nI called Ben\u2019s room to let him know that his food was in the lobby whenever he was ready to come get it. He interrupted me and said, \u201cI TOLD them to bring it to my room!! That\u2019s why I gave them that ridiculous freaking tip!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the hotel\u2019s policy, not the delivery guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is ridiculous. He was seriously too lazy to bring it to my room??\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. Like I said, it\u2019s the hotel\u2019s security policy that says delivery drivers are not permitted to go up to a guest\u2019s room.\u201d\n\nHe grumbled about it and eventually said he\u2019d be down in a few minutes. And when he got off the elevator, he immediately started in on, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to get dressed and come down here to get my food. This is ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for the inconvenience. It\u2019s the hotel\u2019s policy that we follow to ensure the security of our guests and the delivery drivers.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou tell me why, out of ALL the [hotel brand name]s I\u2019ve stayed in, YOU\u2019RE the only one who\u2019s had a problem with it??\u201d And I assume he meant \u201cyou\u201d as in the hotel and not me specifically.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure, the policies probably vary from location to location.\u201d\n\nHe looked like he was gonna lose it for a second there before he asked if the GM had a business card I could give him.\n\nI said yes, and as I was pulling one out of the desk drawer, I started to say, \u201cthe GM will be in tomorrow from 7am t-\u201c\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care. I\u2019ll be writing him an email.\u201d And then he turned around and went back to his room. \n\nOookay. You go ahead and complain to the manager. Complain about how his employees are\u2026 *\\*checks notes*\\*\u2026 following the hotel\u2019s policies. \ud83e\udd28\n\nHe did write an email. And all it said was, \u201cI will place a google review which is forthcoming.\u201d Like wtf. Thanks for the warning? Should we expect your fucking carrier pigeon, my liege?\n\nAnd then he left a bad review. Rated us extra badly under the \u201cstaff service\u201d section specifically. He said he\u2019s stayed at hotels all across the country and has never had this problem before. He said he\u2019d never stay here again and would be posting about us online so everyone else knows that we deliberately inconvenience our guests lolol. \n\nThe manager replied and told him he was welcome to stay somewhere else and that the staff was following hotel policy for his safety. \u00af\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af Side note, I\u2019ve never had a woman complain about this policy.
