            "did LW pull used to cleanse or did I just imagine that?",
            "I don't know if any Blizz employees regularly read this or not but, if so, can you please give me some hope that you are reworking the tank role? I have played tank since early Overwatch 1 and I don't think I've ever hated the experience this much before. It is honestly heartbreaking. It feels like most games I'm performing as best as I can and it's just never enough. It feels like I have no impact at all in the game and that I might as well not play. Can you give any kind of hope for a reworked tank role?",
            "It never did, but I've seen quite some ppl that think it does",
            "Makes you invulnerable during the pull so if you're pulsed, the pulse can explode while pulling and will do nothing.",
            "I don't know what you mean by reworking, but there's not anything along those lines in the recent Blizzard AMA. However, there will be a new patch tomorrow and QP Hacked is testing out pickable passives soon",

        "content": "Flats definitely pulls the biggest numbers on Twitch, having significantly more viewers than a lot of other creators (as I'm writing this, the only people who come close to his amount of viewership are aspen and super). and I think that to the more casual/young player base, he's treated as a massive voice of authority, and people get the impression that he's some awakened ow player that knows everything.\n\nNow onto my issue: He's probably the biggest doom and gloom person I'm ever seen surrounding the game of overwatch, and I'm slightly worried that because of his massive audience blizz will make bad changes because the flats community wants it, not because the overwatch community needs it.\n\nI get it, because he's a tank player he's kinda suffered a lot the past couple years, but i swear he just can't be positive about anything. I wonder if he feels like he needs to keep up his negative personality because it increases numbers or something else. I don't play tank, so maybe i just don't get how terrible it feels to play tank for the entire lifetime of overwatch, but it seems excessive.\n\nThe biggest example I have was [his reaction video to the S11 balance changes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBB1BDioZZg). In my opinion, and going off of other posts that I've seen here, the patch was a massive W. Well-designed heroes like Dva and JQ are buffed, Hog is nerfed and Orisa is still probably going to be bad after the 1 second spin change. Cass/Soj changes are amazing and make them way healthier. The reaper changes make him a better flanker but don't change his tank matchups. Kiri changes were also good.\n\nNow if you watch the full reaction, there's so much negative, possibly rage-baity things he says to get people to complain about the game in the comments, which frankly pissed me off a little bit. For example, when he read the notes for the new flashbang, he sounded like he hated it, even though it's a million times better than the steaming pile of garbage that was mag grenade. Putting \"TANKBUSTERS BUFFED\" in the title of the video and complaining about that when the patch makes reaper less tank-buster and stuff like that. He made the Orisa change sound so much worse than it actually is.\n\nThe moment that made me write out this post was when he talked about the Sojourn changes. Anyone who actually read the notes can immediately tell that this is a massive nerf. The main reason she was running competitive play was because her rail was OP, and the compensating buffs don't come close to covering the huge rail nerf. But what did flats say? \"So nerf, buff, buff, buff. 1 nerf and 3 buffs. \\*sighs and facepalms like crazy\\* you're killing me here. this looks like a low Elo buff.\"\n\nI have read so many comments that just follow the logic of \"3 is more than 1 blizzard why the hell are you buffing Sojourn\" and I'm kinda tired of it, so I'm making this post to talk about it.\n\nWhat do y'all think, do you think I could be exaggerating a little bit, these are just my thoughts.",

            "The reason his audience is so big is because he spams shitty tiktoks and ig reels and it pulls in the untapped market of the massive ow casual audience. Also because they\u2019re casual, they can\u2019t tell he\u2019s shit at the game and has zero clue what he\u2019s talking about. (Im his number 1 hater btw)",
            "From his videos starting a few  month ago, it's seems to me he is burnt out of OW.  He doesn't enjoy playing anymore and that's a sad place to be.",
            "Flats is in the phase of not wanting to play OW anymore, but has too because it\u2019s his job. I kind of get it because that would be a sad place to be for some. It\u2019s a pretty bad burn out, so I feel like he will be like that unless something big happens in the game. I stopped watching him because his content was just constant negativity. Nothing against people criticizing OW or anything like that, but it felt like it was all he was doing for a good bit and I just got bored. Tbh I\u2019d rather watch super. Dude is still good at the game and complains about it sometimes, but he doesn\u2019t spend 2 hours complaining doing react Andy. He just says \u201cthis game is fucking trash lmao\u201d and queues ranked and moves on. \n\nNot sure if Blizz would only pay attention to him or something like that since he is not the only big creator.",
            "Yeah, I completely stopped watching this guy after seeing his reaction to the patch notes. It's just a completely ridiculous reaction to a really good patch. At this point, he has to be feeding into the hate, seeing how many more views and how much more income he likely generates from it.",
            "It isn't because he's a tank player, it's because he really doesn't want to play Overwatch anymore but feels like he has to because he's scared his viewership will disappear if he leaves the game.",
            "Don't excuse his awful attitude because he's a tank player. Emongg is also a tank player and is a complete joy to watch plus he plays Overwatch 20x more than flats does (he just reacts to random stuff/plays other games while somehow still crying about OW)",
            "He\u2019s OWs Asmongold",
            "His takes are generally pretty bad and his stance on things flip flop based on who he\u2019s talking to.",
            "I can't even stand him when I watch other people's stream with him in it. Anyone watched somnus's stream yesterday? He was arguing about english dialect or something. I couldn't even stay around. Just did my chores around my apartment.",
            "I swear there's this guy called GSraider who as always is a 6v6er and complains about tank and how entire ow streamer community are blizzard shills, got to the comment section and read to most braindead takes of all time, then it finally started to make sense on which type of community these guys attract.  \nThe takes in question :\n\n1. Bastion/torb are 2 of the most powerful dps in the game\n2. You cannot counter zen's discord orb\n\nI don't even know what to say"

The hero is more cheezy than orisa.\n\nAnother one of the most successful tank is Dva since S9 and people talk around here like Dva is bad and needs buffs.
