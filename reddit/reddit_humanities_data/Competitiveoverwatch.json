            "How can I approach my friend with advice on how to improve if all he does is feed and walk into a 1v5?",
            "Anyone know if theres any reduced-price Faceit League codes out there anymore? With season two coming up I was just curious if any of the codes for season one were still eligible or if theres new codes (like the student codes for 90, 100% off)?",
            "Can we at least not get the reversal penalty when we lose with a leaver on our team?",
            "Does your friend want to improve? Because I know some people who don't find the game fun if they have to learn/put in effort, but also complain that they're losing as they make the same mistakes over and over.\n\nThere's not much hope for them if that's the case, but you can try framing it as, \"Hey, you would probably enjoy the game a lot more and die less if you just did x or y\" (pushing with the team/staying in LOS/etc). But if they aggressively don't care, you have to put up with it or not play with them.",
            "sit down and watch a replay together if you can it really helps contextualize those gameplay decisions",
            "We're talking to Faceit about it right now",
            "Haven't heard of anything like this. Closest would be Jake's online course in that it's up to date, comprehensive and (presumably) high quality, but it's in video format and paid.\n\nMost of the Overwatch knowledge is intuited through lots of gameplay, it's really hard to write down stuff that is useful and stands the test of time",
            "Is there an available list of wrotten, relatively up to date guides or materials? I know watching videos is popular, but I really like referencable materials.\n\n  \nhero guides, team comp guides, positioning, anything.",
            "Thats awesome, thanks."

She hard enables a lot of the more annoying spam/poke dps like pharah, 76, soj, and to an extent junkrat/torb/bastion. Now you\u2019re getting spammmed to death by 150 damage direct rockets from across the map with no falloff, or you\u2019re going to have a pocketed 76 perma in your back line. She\u2019s near unkillable if you\u2019re not a hitscan, even if you are she can just zip away at mach 10. I personally hate playing against poke so maybe that\u2019s why i hate her. the weird thing is I don\u2019t think she\u2019s objectively that good, just really fucking annoying to play against.",

            "Give me Mercy streak protection over loss streak protection any day. Mercy Lifeweaver is like having UN peacekeepers spectating your game.",
            "the single best thing that ever happened to me in this game was swapping to pc. not because of the raging cheating/boosting problem, or the abandoned balance, or the clunky controls. its because i went from seeing mercy in like 90 out of 100 games into seeing her 50 out of those 100 games. god i hate that brainless, annoying hero",
            "I hate playing with mercy as much as I hate the doom one tricks throwing it down mid Or the turbo feeding tracers.",

            "This is why I keep screaming for Blizzard to rework her again and both make her take a little more skill (and she doesn't need to be made to aim for that to happen) *and* give the poor gal a little more personal impact in exchange.\n\nJust about no one is happy with her current status. Considering she's one of (if not *the*) most popular heroes in the game, a little TLC to get her healthy is very much in order imo.",
            "I feel like a really good change would be to nerf her health and buff her mobility. Her mobility is the most fun part but the devs make her less fun to play because of it. Shes also very annoying to play against and it feels like a waste of time shooting at her.\n\nIdk if this is a good idea or not but I know the devs tried to make her more punishable without really making anyone happy, and theyve partially reverted their changes anyway",

            "Its good that theyre acknowledging it I think. But I truly dont think it will be anything more than reiterating the challenges they had with 6v6 that led to 5v5 in the first place. The amount of work it would take to go back to 6v6 is just not worth the gamble. There is just no way the tank population would somehow double if they went back.",
            "As a 6v6 fan, its fully dead. There has never been a chance of it coming back and the changes theyve made to the tank role since then have only made it harder to justify even in extreme situations.\n\nThat being said I do think addressing it is smart and hopefully it leads to them taking lessons from what did work in 6v6 and trying to reapply it to the current game.",
            "Oh god the forums are going to be utterly insufferable.  Thank christ I stopped going there lmao.  The 6v6 spam was just utterly cringe as fk.\n\nI never want it back, the games were insufferable.  If they ever do in the future just keep it in arcade and out of ranked.  Keep both sides happy.",
            "They most likely won't entertain the idea more than just talk (hopefully) but holy shit it's going to be insufferable dealing with 6v6 whiners for a while longer. Ugh.",
            "I know its super controversial but I personally much prefer 5v5 tanking. Sure there is a lot of annoyance with counterpicking but I really just enjoy how much more my play impacts the game.",
            "As much as I think 6v6 could work, I do NOT want to go back to my 25+ min dps ques"
