            "Hello, everyone!\n\nWe are in the unique & exciting position to potentially be the recipient of a community grant from Reddit. We\u2019re not sure if our application will be successful, or how much money we\u2019ll get. But, we wanted your input since this will directly impact you, the user. \n\nSome give-away ideas we are tossing around:\n\n-\tOne month of therapy from an online therapy source, such as Better Help.\n-\tA copy of a book on relationships from an author such as Kerry Cohen, who was our frequent guest during the Reddit Talks era\n-\tA game designed to help you and your partner grow closer \n-\tDonating to a charity or charities voted on by our users, most likely ones that help victims of domestic violence, as we sadly saw an explosion of domestic violence-themed posts during the COVID-19 lockdowns. \n\n\nAgain, I cannot guarantee our grant request will be successful but since this will directly impact you, we wanted to get your feedback. Please take a minute to fill out this survey. It's completely anonymous, neither myself or anyone else on the moderation/admin team will see who answered what.\n\nI wanted also to take this time to thank all 8.87 (!) million of you! You are what makes this subreddit so amazing. We may not be the biggest subreddit, but I'd like to think we're the most caring. It is because of our amazing userbase that we're even being considered."

        "content": "I last posted a variation of this a little over 5 years ago. We're a little overdue for a repost.\n\n---\n\nYou know how every Uber rating is right on the verge of 5 stars unless something's particularly off? Everyone's all \"A+++ would ride again.\" Same for eBay, Amazon, etc.\n\nYou can think of /r/relationship_advice comments in much the same way, only inverted. Just about every post here talking about a problem is going to be a magnet for \"break up with them\" and \"get rid of them\" comments. Two things to keep front of mind when you're submitting:\n\n1. The vast majority of people posting here are posting because they've got a challenge they probably haven't been able to resolve on their own. \n\n2. In many cases, these challenges are either insurmountable or exceedingly difficult to manage. \n\nThe majority of commenters aren't *necessarily* cynical/assholes, but combine both a one-sided account of what happened\u2014your account\u2014with each commenter's own potential history, grievances, etc., and the resulting brew is pretty dark, meaning that every post will get drenched in comments suggesting ending the dynamic. \n\nThe number of serious comments suggesting _an alternative to ending things_ is a good way to tell whether or not there's merit to, well, ending things. I'll carry that Uber analogy a bit further:\n\n* Let's say you're asking about behavior that's so bad, the red flag's basically bleeding. Nearly every single comment will tell you to run, and you're having a hard time finding well-reasoned counter-arguments to it. Sounds like running is good advice. **Zero stars** on our inverted Uber scale; the relationship is cooked.\n\n* Together but your s/o cheated on you once? Most comments will probably tell you to run because \"once a cheater, always a cheater.\" Some comments might suggest you should stay and work it out, but the details of how the cheating happened might vary the number of these comments. Great; **One or Two Stars.**\n\n* Married but your s/o got drunk and made out with someone else, felt awful about it, immediately left the event where they met that other person and told you what happened and apologized with no prior history of cheating? Many people might _still_ tell you to leave (same reason), but odds are good that a fair number of people might suggest staying. Awesome; **Two, maybe even three stars.**\n\n* Good relationship with your S/O but they forget to treat you in the love language you normally need to thrive? Maybe they forget to bring you token flowers/trinkets or other signs of appreciation but otherwise everything's pretty good? Many comments will probably be advice on how to communicate; there'll probably still be a good number of people suggesting you should just leave, but you can take these with a grain of salt. **Three to four stars.**\n\n* Everything's rosey and you're looking for a way to celebrate your s/o's special promotion, anniversary, birthday, or something else? There'll be a few trolls who tell you to break up for asking the subreddit for advice, but it sounds like the relationship is **four to five stars.**\n\nYou can apply this to any type of relationship question asked here. Platonic, professional, and other relationships that aren't exactly romantic, this still works. You get the idea.\n\nBasically, the people telling you to leave probably outnumber the people with less jaded opinions by an order of magnitude because many, many people have had shitty experiences that dominate their memories, so the best way to consider most advice here is to see whether other advice shines through the cosmic negativity background. If everyone's telling you to break up, that's probably what you should do, but if 1/4 of the comments are telling you another way, you'd benefit by giving that 25% a chance.\n\n---\n\n##TL;DR: \n\nThe vast majority of comments will tell you to end things. It's a side effect of the fact that many people reading either have a very dim view of relationships or just do it for the drama. The more people tell you to consider something _other_ than running, the more value there is in trying that other approach, whatever it is.\n\n(inspired to repost this thanks to [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1dc05p7/had_to_end_my_birthday_party_early_because_a_1/l7vtsis/?context=3) by u/NotAmericanDontCare.

            "the comments here are toxic",
            "Also there seems to be an overreliance on arbitrary \"rules\" like \"age gap bad\" (obviously some age gaps really are bad but five years in your 20s shouldn't be such a big deal IMO) or \"high school sweethearts bad.\" It's true that sometimes certain things like that can cause problems, but if the post isn't asking about something that is very obviously related to one of these \"rules,\" there shouldn't be so much focus on stuff like \"you're dating your high school sweetheart, that's Bad, break up.\"",
            "I'd just tag on that posters pay attention to all advice posted, regardless of the upvotes/downvotes. The hivemind here can be brutal. \n\nThis is PARTICULARLY problematic when advice gets legal advice adjacent. Sometimes the right thing to do and the smart thing to do, don't line up. This sub will upvote the moral choice, every time (alright, I guess this is a little hyperbolic). Don't treat any of the advice you read here as wise/informed. Read it with a critical eye: the repercussions of acting on our advice will be yours to deal with. Read our advice as relationship advice ONLY: there's good reason why we aren't allowed to give advice on legal matters.\n\nTake the advice as if it's coming from your salty, newly single bff that considered using ivermectin for non-FDA approved reasons. We aren't experts and most of us have been burned.",
            "Kind of solid advise. When you ask strangers for advise who dont know you they can only advise based on what info you give and its very hard for them, for us, not to connect those sittuations to similar of our own. This is unavoidable prohection.\n\n\nBut at the same time, just because the mob says thr same thing dont make the mob always right.\u00a0",
            "**100% this!**\n\nHalf the posters here also are just looking for support on how to \"be right\". Think of the kind of person who comes to a website to get ammunition to bring into the relationship. You can see the poster going to their Partner, \"See, reddit agrees with me! You are abusing me and toxic. We are incompatible and I am perfect. So F off. Wait, you are mad and hate that I went to reddit to win an argument using bullshit logic? But they say I will be better off alone. I am so lonely. I am going to go to reddit and get revenge.\"\n\nYou can smell the villain arc in so many posts. If the post isn't asking for advice about their own behavior, assume they are using anything you say as a way to fight their partner.",
            "noticed that too",
            "Absolutely. I see so many comments  that say things like \"call the police\" about things that aren't illegal, like - as much as you might WANT some things to be illegal doesn't mean they actually are. And even if it might technically meet the definition doesn't mean it's actually likely to get a result or be helpful."

        "content": "It\u2019s gonna be a long one\u2026\u2026.\n\nTLDR: Yesterday I thought I was accompanying my husband to his neurologist appointment. On the way down he told me that not only did he have a one time affair with a man, he contracted HIV from this person and found out the week prior from blood work from a unrelated medical procedure.  We were in fact not on the way to the neurology, we were actually on our way to the HIV clinic.\n\n\nI (38F) have been married to husband (51M) for 16 years, together for 20. He had 2 children when we met that I adopted later. We have one biological child together. We have had a solid 20 years, in love, good partners, good parents, good sex, we of course argue, but it\u2019s always been respectful and never crossed any boundaries, just overall a great marriage. Of course I wouldn\u2019t be on here if that was the end of it\u2026\n\nHusband has MS. He was diagnosed in 2021, but lesions were first found in 2012. He has a \u201cpresumptive\u201d diagnosis because his lumbar punctures have always been \u201cnormal\u201d. The last year, he seemed to be progressing really quick. His doctor also started transitioning to retirement so we moved to a new doctor within the same practice. He had a routine MRI earlier this year and the doctor called to tell us results and it was weird? She mentioned a lot of non-ms \u201cissues\u201d and ended up saying she wanted another LP and more labs. LP was mid May. \n\nDuring the last year, but really about 7 months, I noticed my husband started acting different. He was hiding his phone in weird ways (like had a procedure and refused to let me hold his phone?), was kinda holding it to the side so I couldn\u2019t see his screen, just overall I felt like something was off. He did go on Prozac at this time and told me he was anxious about results, etc. To try to be a good supportive partner I chalked it up to anxiety, stress, depression. We discussed his phone and that I thought he was hiding something from me and he said he was not, reassured me, I moved on. He\u2019s also always been kinda weird about doctor\u2019s appointment and me going with him. It\u2019s always bothered me bc I want to be supportive and as he has progressed, I\u2019m moving in to a caretaker role and it\u2019s not even that I want to be there, but I have to know what\u2019s going on with him to be able to care for him. \n\nEarlier this week, he told me his neurology appt was Friday, doctor wanted to talk to him in person. I\u2019ve been spiraling. I was sure this was not going to be good news. He said at one point he didn\u2019t want to me to go. He even said he needed to stop by the office after work so he\u2019d just let me know what the doctor said. All week I assured him that I loved him and that he wasn\u2019t a burden, no matter the results. I felt like he was opening up, he agreed to start therapy. He then agreed to let me go with him to doctor appt.\n\nYesterday, we are at the hospital area, neurology is to the right, other hospital parts to the left. I try to turn in to the parking garage and he told me to keep going. He then is asking if I really love him, do I mean what I say about always being with him, etc. he then said that he had got some results back about 8 days ago. And that the results were going to affect me also. He said his blood results showed he was HIV+ and that he made a huge mistake 6 years ago and had a one time sexual encounter with a male. (Side note: we are both bi-sexual. We are very open to new sexual experiences, but it\u2019s him and I only. We don\u2019t swap or have other partners. I\u2019ve always felt very safe with him.)\n\nHe was not bringing me to his neurologist, we were at an HIV clinic. Obviously, finding out my husband cheated, had HIV, I likely have HIV all in about 20 mins was  a really bad way for him to come clean.\n\nThanks for sticking along, but there\u2019s more. \n\nI had an HIV test done, obviously assuming I was positive. But I was not. I\u2019m negative. How?  If he had an affair 6 years ago, that\u2019s the only person and only time, we had a decent sex life (unprotected sex twice a week?) from the time of the affair up until ~January. Late 2023/early 2024 his depression kicked in (I thought) and he has not had an interest in sex. Really he\u2019s had no interest in me. We\u2019ve had sex twice since December. I admit, I\u2019m not well versed on HIV. I learned a lot yesterday. I know that is harder to contract HIV in PiV, but 5 years of PiV and I\u2019m still negative? I\u2019m going to my gyn next week for std testing and a check up. I will be asking lots of question. \n\nI feel like a fool. I\u2019m hurt and very angry. This is still so raw. I gave him chances yesterday to come clean with ALL of it. Any omissions or lies I find out about today or later is immediate divorce and he\u2019s aware of this. I just feel like it\u2019s not adding up. My heart hurts, I want to continue building the life we have, grow old together. But I don\u2019t know if I can move forward and actually forgive him. The betrayal is killing me. I feel dumb for even considering staying. We will start couples therapy next week, I\u2019ll continue my regular therapy, he\u2019s agreed to see a therapist. But none of that matters if I can\u2019t trust him.",

My facial expressions during sex are not flattering\u2014I have since been very mindful of my face and making sure I try to look attractive \n2. Not being vocal enough\u2014I have tried moaning more which didn\u2019t help because of point #3\u2026 \n3. I don\u2019t talk enough\u2014which I fixed by telling him how good he feels, which positions feel good, what spot to say in, when I feel like I\u2019m going to finish which didn\u2019t help because of point #4\u2026 \n4. I don\u2019t move enough. This one I really really struggle with. Like when I am in missionary I try kissing him, try putting my legs around his shoulders, try pulling him in and moving him up and down against me. When we are doggy style I literally just cannot force my body to move, some women may be able to relate but that position is just paralyzing to me but I am able to arch my back all the way! And when I am on top he doesn\u2019t like when I grind back and forth which is really the only way I finish, and doesn\u2019t like when I bounce up and down because he says it hurts. All in all he says I\u2019m not very \u201cgraceful\u201d. His ultimate criticism is that I am not \u201cworking with him enough\u201d and moving with him but I just can\u2019t figure out what that means because this brings me to point #5 \n5. I don\u2019t have rhythm he says. So when I try to rotate my hips against him or also move when we are in missionary or side lying he says that I am not moving right and ruining the flow. \n\nI truly am starting to feel bad. He says that he loves me so much and that I shouldn\u2019t feel so ashamed but I really don\u2019t hear anything positive at all except for that I am attractive. There\u2019s been many criticisms from the beginning and I barely finish myself because I\u2019m so focused on making him happy. The only thing I know that I am good at is head which he doesn\u2019t let me do anymore because he wants sex to last longer. \n\nI genuinely wish there was like a tutorial or something, we were both virgins and I truly don\u2019t have experience. I feel like I\u2019ll never live up to his expectations and really need advice. I know some comments may say to not stay with him if he makes me feel this way but that is not an option for me right now. Sex tips are so appreciated, thank you! ",

            "I wonder how much of that is you being a bit unresponsive, or him being too deep into porn bullshits lol It sounds like rather than working together to make it more fun for both of you, he's just criticizing your every move...",
            "Why do you even want to have sex with him? This would make me dryer than the Sahara",
            "Most people enjoy seeing and relishing their partner's real, genuine orgasm face and would never want you to fake that or make it more \"photogenic\". Sex when love is involved is about the intimacy between the partners. \n\nHonestly, I'd ask him where he got these conceptions and expectations about what sex should be and look like, when you're the only person he's ever had sex with.\n\nIf he says porn, then you could remind him that they are professional entertainers and ask how he'd feel if you couldn't enjoy a night out with him, because he doesn't look and dress like a GQ model",
            "Tell him you\u2019re not his hand and y\u2019all aren\u2019t in a porn video",
            "Next time y\u2019all have sex, you should say : \u201charder, deeper, faster!\u201d \n\u201cyou came already?\u201d \nPretty sure he wouldn\u2019t like that either.",
            "A person who criticized me this much about my most vulnerable moments would never see me naked again ever. EVER. \n\nThe usual 'sex tips' are TALK TO YOUR PARTNER - figure out together what you like, what works for you, for them, for you both. (https://www.scarleteen.com/read/relationships/yes-no-maybe-so-sexual-inventory-stocklist) \n\nBUT NOT WITH THIS DUDE, THIS DUDE IS JUST AN ASSHOLE.",
            "I think there is way way too much stress here. It\u2019s about having fun and enjoying each other. What you described is as tiresome as operating a tractor. With all that on your mind, it\u2019s no wonder you\u2019re not having fun. \u201cMove this way, don\u2019t move that way, don\u2019t forget to moan, wait don\u2019t make that face, go slower, faster\u2026.\u201d \n\nI would talk to your partner and explain that you are trying, but all this starting to make sex less fun. Ask if it\u2019s really a big deal if you just act \u201cnatural\u201d for a while as sometimes rhythm and movement can come naturally",
            "As a seasoned old lady in my 30s - sounds like your fiance has a porn problem and is trying to shift the blame onto you. How would he feel if you critiqued everything he did in bed? You sure you want to marry someone like that?",
            "Real sex is not like in porn videos. He wants to stage scenes with you.\n\nWhen he says move like this move like that it feels like he is reanacting stuff that he saw"
