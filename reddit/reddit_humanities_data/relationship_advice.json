            "Hello, everyone!\n\nWe are in the unique & exciting position to potentially be the recipient of a community grant from Reddit. Were not sure if our application will be successful, or how much money well get. But, we wanted your input since this will directly impact you, the user. \n\nSome give-away ideas we are tossing around:\n\n-\tOne month of therapy from an online therapy source, such as Better Help.\n-\tA copy of a book on relationships from an author such as Kerry Cohen, who was our frequent guest during the Reddit Talks era\n-\tA game designed to help you and your partner grow closer \n-\tDonating to a charity or charities voted on by our users, most likely ones that help victims of domestic violence, as we sadly saw an explosion of domestic violence-themed posts during the COVID-19 lockdowns. \n\n\nAgain, I cannot guarantee our grant request will be successful but since this will directly impact you, we wanted to get your feedback. Please take a minute to fill out this survey. It's completely anonymous, neither myself or anyone else on the moderation/admin team will see who answered what.\n\nI wanted also to take this time to thank all 8.87 (!) million of you! You are what makes this subreddit so amazing. We may not be the biggest subreddit, but I'd like to think we're the most caring. It is because of our amazing userbase that we're even being considered."

        "content": "I last posted a variation of this a little over 5 years ago. We're a little overdue for a repost.\n\n---\n\nYou know how every Uber rating is right on the verge of 5 stars unless something's particularly off? Everyone's all \"A+++ would ride again.\" Same for eBay, Amazon, etc.\n\nYou can think of /r/relationship_advice comments in much the same way, only inverted. Just about every post here talking about a problem is going to be a magnet for \"break up with them\" and \"get rid of them\" comments. Two things to keep front of mind when you're submitting:\n\n1. The vast majority of people posting here are posting because they've got a challenge they probably haven't been able to resolve on their own. \n\n2. In many cases, these challenges are either insurmountable or exceedingly difficult to manage. \n\nThe majority of commenters aren't *necessarily* cynical/assholes, but combine both a one-sided account of what happened\u2014your account\u2014with each commenter's own potential history, grievances, etc., and the resulting brew is pretty dark, meaning that every post will get drenched in comments suggesting ending the dynamic. \n\nThe number of serious comments suggesting _an alternative to ending things_ is a good way to tell whether or not there's merit to, well, ending things. I'll carry that Uber analogy a bit further:\n\n* Let's say you're asking about behavior that's so bad, the red flag's basically bleeding. Nearly every single comment will tell you to run, and you're having a hard time finding well-reasoned counter-arguments to it. Sounds like running is good advice. **Zero stars** on our inverted Uber scale; the relationship is cooked.\n\n* Together but your s/o cheated on you once? Most comments will probably tell you to run because \"once a cheater, always a cheater.\" Some comments might suggest you should stay and work it out, but the details of how the cheating happened might vary the number of these comments. Great; **One or Two Stars.**\n\n* Married but your s/o got drunk and made out with someone else, felt awful about it, immediately left the event where they met that other person and told you what happened and apologized with no prior history of cheating? Many people might _still_ tell you to leave (same reason), but odds are good that a fair number of people might suggest staying. Awesome; **Two, maybe even three stars.**\n\n* Good relationship with your S/O but they forget to treat you in the love language you normally need to thrive? Maybe they forget to bring you token flowers/trinkets or other signs of appreciation but otherwise everything's pretty good? Many comments will probably be advice on how to communicate; there'll probably still be a good number of people suggesting you should just leave, but you can take these with a grain of salt. **Three to four stars.**\n\n* Everything's rosey and you're looking for a way to celebrate your s/o's special promotion, anniversary, birthday, or something else? There'll be a few trolls who tell you to break up for asking the subreddit for advice, but it sounds like the relationship is **four to five stars.**\n\nYou can apply this to any type of relationship question asked here. Platonic, professional, and other relationships that aren't exactly romantic, this still works. You get the idea.\n\nBasically, the people telling you to leave probably outnumber the people with less jaded opinions by an order of magnitude because many, many people have had shitty experiences that dominate their memories, so the best way to consider most advice here is to see whether other advice shines through the cosmic negativity background. If everyone's telling you to break up, that's probably what you should do, but if 1/4 of the comments are telling you another way, you'd benefit by giving that 25% a chance.\n\n---\n\n##TL;DR: \n\nThe vast majority of comments will tell you to end things. It's a side effect of the fact that many people reading either have a very dim view of relationships or just do it for the drama. The more people tell you to consider something _other_ than running, the more value there is in trying that other approach, whatever it is.\n\n(inspired to repost this thanks to [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1dc05p7/had_to_end_my_birthday_party_early_because_a_1/l7vtsis/?context=3) by u/NotAmericanDontCare.

This sub will upvote the moral choice, every time (alright, I guess this is a little hyperbolic). Don't treat any of the advice you read here as wise/informed.

Read our advice as relationship advice ONLY: there's good reason why we aren't allowed to give advice on legal matters.\n\nTake the advice as if it's coming from your salty, newly single bff that considered using ivermectin for non-FDA approved reasons. We aren't experts and most of us have been burned.",
            "**100% this!**\n\nHalf the posters here also are just looking for support on how to \"be right\". Think of the kind of person who comes to a website to get ammunition to bring into the relationship. You can see the poster going to their Partner, \"See, reddit agrees with me! You are abusing me and toxic. We are incompatible and I am perfect. So F off. Wait, you are mad and hate that I went to reddit to win an argument using bullshit logic? But they say I will be better off alone. I am so lonely. I am going to go to reddit and get revenge.\"\n\nYou can smell the villain arc in so many posts. If the post isn't asking for advice about their own behavior, assume they are using anything you say as a way to fight their partner."

        "content": "I (28F) have been with my husband (27M) for six years, married for four years, and we have two kids (3F, almost 1F). Everything in our relationship is perfect for us. He\u2019s the best husband and father to our kids that I could have asked for. I am absolutely in love with him and his actions and words have always shown me that he feels the same way. There\u2019s no better feeling than going to sleep in his arms every night.\n\nLast weekend, my husband and I had some friends over and we were having a barbecue. We were all outside in the backyard, surrounding my husband who was on the grill. As the food got closer to being ready to eat, we all started sitting at our backyard table. Once the food was all ready and at the table, my husband went inside to use the washroom and get another case of beer. I didn\u2019t realize that my best friend (28F) had followed him. When he was coming back out, my best friend hid behind the wall separating our kitchen and living room and surprised him by pulling him and forcing a kiss. My husband immediately pushed her back and yelled wtf. She immediately started crying and ran out of the house and left. My husband came back into the backyard and asked to speak to me privately and immediately told me what had just happened. I was shocked and told him that it would be okay and that we could talk after everyone else left. I managed to put on appearances for the next couple of hours but I was mentally distraught.\n\nAfter everyone left, my husband sat me down and told me what happened and showed me the footage from our living room camera. It was exactly as my husband has described it. My best friend of 10 years, the person who I treated as my literal sister, forcibly kissed my husband. After the third date with my husband, she was the one I told that I was going to marry him. She knows how much I love him and how strong our relationship is and still she chose to try to come in the middle. For fuck\u2019s sake, our 3 year old calls her \u201cAunty\u201d. \n\nMy best friend tried showing up the next day \u201cjust to talk\u201d and my husband had to hold me back from beating the shit out of her and he kicked her out and told her to not come back. It\u2019s been almost a week now and I\u2019m nowhere close to moving on. I don\u2019t blame my husband one bit. He\u2019s completely innocent in this and if anything, he\u2019s the victim. I\u2019ve been lying down on my husband\u2019s chest and just crying every day and night. I\u2019m so angry and frustrated and don\u2019t know what to do. My husband has been amazing and like always, he just gets it and understands how I\u2019m feeling. He brought me flowers almost every day and cooked my favorite meals multiple times in the last few days. I love and appreciate him all the more for it. I just don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to move on and trust any of my friends again after this.\n",

I thought I had a good relationship with his fiance too. We went on trips together, never had any drama between us and golf together quite a bit. Our friend group has about 5 of us that have all been close friends since middle school. They all were invited except for me. I didn't get an invite when they sent them out last fall and I thought it was just well understood I would be there. Both of their families are multimillionaires so money is no issue. They have about 150 people on the guest list and even invited some local celebrities and politicians to the wedding that they hardly know. The whole year leading up to this we had all been in a group chat talking about the bachelor party, wedding venue and other wedding related topics. We speak every day and workout together every night after work. I asked him a week ago at the gym if it would be alright to bring my girlfriend of 2 months, that both of them had met several times to the wedding. \n\nHe said that I was on the waiting list and RSVP's were finished several months ago, and unfortunately I didn't get in. I didn't really know what to say. I kind of laughed and thought he was joking but he had an embarrassed look on his face. I knew then that he was serious, and asked him why. He just said that he didn't think it would be that important to me. I just said it's ok I understand and finished working out with him, trying to hide my emotion but I doubt I did a good job. \n\nWhen I left the gym I was upset, this was a guy that I really cared about and thought was my best friend. He messaged me asking to workout a few times throughout the week as though nothing was wrong but I just made up excuses and said I couldn't. I left the group chat and all of my friends started messaging me asking what happened. They couldn't believe I wasn't invited and had all thought I would be one of the groomsmen. He still texts me asking me to hangout and sends me funny videos on Instagram like nothing is wrong. The bachelor party is next week and I already gave my share to the best man for the airbnb, as he also thought I was going. \n\nI guess what I'm asking is do I just keep being friends with this group like it's no big deal or do I cut them off?

We're both excited about the possibilities, but we're torn on how to use it.  \n  \nMy wife is dead set on using the money for a big family vacation. She\u2019s been dreaming about a trip to Europe... something really special for us and the kids. She says it would be an unforgettable experience... a chance to create lasting memories... and a well-deserved break from our busy lives. She\u2019s extremely passionate about this idea... and isn\u2019t willing to compromise.  \n  \nOn the other hand, I\u2019m thinking about using the money to upgrade our house. Our dishwasher is on its last legs... our bathroom could use some work... and there are a few other upgrades that would make our home more comfortable and increase its value. These improvements would benefit us long-term, and I feel they are more practical.  \n  \nThe tension is really starting to build. She\u2019s very emotional about this... saying we deserve this vacation after all the hard work we\u2019ve put in. She won\u2019t budge on her stance, and it\u2019s causing friction between us. I understand her perspective, but the practical side of me can\u2019t ignore the long-term benefits of investing in our home.  \n  \nI\u2019ve suggested a compromise... maybe splitting the money between a smaller vacation and some home upgrades... but she feels we should go all-in on one option to really make the most of it.  \n  \nI\u2019m torn because I want to support her dream of a fantastic vacation... but I also think about the long-term benefits of investing in our home. I\u2019m hoping to hear from others who might have faced similar decisions.

They really arent that much, even with installation. The bathroom can wait if its still functional. \n\nI promise you, its worth it to make your wife happy on this one. Next step is to avoid the pitfalls of traveling with kids & avoiding that making your vacation miserable. Meaning, your wife is not the cruise director of the vacation.
