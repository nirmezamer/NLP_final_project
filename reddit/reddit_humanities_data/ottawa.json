I\u2019m looking at my balance today and I\u2019m shocked. \nThe only \u00ab\u00a0fun\u00a0\u00bb thing we spend money on are 2 gym membership we use regularly. And Netflix. My kids aren\u2019t even in any sport or extracurricular that cost money. They go to free activities. \nWe are going out with friends tonight and I feel like cancelling. Still 8 days till my pay check.\nWe own one car (not sure how the expense will climb with gas with more days in the office - right now we are hybrid).\n\nI have not had go live pay check to pay check for a long time. I\u2019ll have to go to the bank to stop the Rrsp or something. How is it that a 2 income family with relatively few expenses has to watch that bank account has to cancel on plans with friends? \n\nBtw I know eating out is not a necessity but I\u2019m giving this as context. Before covid we could eat out and even take trips. If we\u2019re now struggling I can\u2019t imagine what others less fortunate are doing. \n\nIt\u2019s like the money that comes is just flying out.\n\nI don\u2019t know how other families are doing it. My heart goes out to anyone looking for a job.\n\nI woke up this morning very early because the anxiety is messing with my sleep and my health. I really hope anyone looking for a job or in a worse position finds some relief.\n\nI\u2019m in constant fear of one of us losing our jobs. I\u2019ve gone from an ambitious member of society to a submissive employee doing what im told out of fear of losing a job.\n\n",

I recently graduated and started my new, relatively well-playing full-time job... And my god. Nothing seems affordable. I, like many others, would like to live in an affordable apartment that isn't a shithole, but NOPE. Go fuck yourself. There's no in-between. As someone who's never experienced living on their own, I was hoping to get that experience with a 1-bedroom apartment in the downtown Ottawa area (or nearby), but that seems like a distant dream at this point. And it doesn't even seem to only be a problem downtown... It's just as bad in other neighboring communities. You really have to find a needle in the haystack in terms of a good deal. It's unbelievably infuriating. I should've had the foresight to buy a property for 3 blueberries and some pocket lint 30 years ago. Guess I'll just have to get gouged for every penny I have and not save up for a house.\n\nAnyways, thanks for listening to my rant.\n\nTo everyone out there looking for an apartment, or currently renting in this insane market, godspeed to y'all.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for the comments. Good and bad. As sad as it sounds, it does make me feel a bit better knowing a lot of other people seem to be in a similar boat. Felt good to let it all out. Time to keep looking and try to find that gem. ",

In Ottawa in most places we\u2019ve applied to we were the only applicants and some places had been empty for months.
