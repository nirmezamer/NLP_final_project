            "This is actually good, because then the ladies have the porto-potties all to themselves. No more waiting 15 minutes with your legs crossed",
            "Can we get these for Bluesfest please?",
            "I thoroughly enjoy the little \"men's room\" decal on the side. Is anyone really trying to rock up to these things with a vagina? \ud83d\ude02",
            "The ones one Amsterdam have a metal swirl around it that covers most of the mid torso\n\nThat said, the ones in Amsterdam are also just a wall with a drain lmao so win some you lose some aha",
            "They had these at the Montreal Grand Prix and it was full to the brim, overflowing. Super nasty",
            "Am I allowed to poop in the tube?",
            "Google \"Whizdom\".  In short, it is a tube that slips over your wang and down your pantleg. Just stand over any street grate and let the piss flow!! Ahhhh! 5 more Budlights please.",

            "Wow, did they get this notice today? Don't allow them any time to contact anyone during the long weekend... crooks.",
            "New fear unlocked. If my building pulled this shit I'd probably kill myself.",

            "This is legal.   You can thank the Ford government.",
            "It absolutely is illegal. They might be offering $5000 as an incentive to sign a cash-for-keys N11 and end the tenancy (which is legal), but a N13 for renovation allows the tenant right of first refusal to move back in after the renovations (assuming the N13 is for renovation and not demolition) at the same rent as before. And yes, they have the right to a hearing at the LTB.",
            "It\u2019s called the Aspen Towers.",
            "Are most condos or dedicated rentals? I'm in an aged condo, with a good maintenance plan that's on top of these kinds of issues. \n\nBut. My condo fee is also high, it can be increased without a cap, and if needed I can be hit with a special assessment. None of that is true for a dedicated rental, they have no way of raising funds apart from an above-guideline rent increase, which still has a cap. Sounds like the old company just sold it, maybe foreseeing the near-future costs.",
            "I wonder what company bought it",
            "Some LLs and PM companies bank on a tenant not knowing their rights.\n\nAn N13 is a notice. A person can choose to leave but they can also fight it. Also, they have the right of first refusal and if they follow the steps needed to exercise that right, they have to get the unit back *at the rent they were paying*."
