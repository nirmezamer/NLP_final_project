            "Just offering my perspective as an Indigenous person: \n\nMany people are not aware of the history of the land they inhabit. There are many reasons for this that I won\u2019t get into here. \n\nLand acknowledgments are a step in the right direction towards acknowledging this history. They are an imperfect tool, as they often carry a sense of \u2018waving of the hand\u2019 to them and are, at times, incorrect in their information. \n\nI went to a tribal college. We had land acknowledgments. It was very simple as only one tribe had inhabited the land the college was on. There were a variety of perspectives on having one, but we wanted it, and fought for it. It was easier at a tribal college, as you can imagine, but it was still a fight. \n\nA few years ago, my former partner did an REU at a very influential and progressive biological research lab. They were very proud of the history of their location as an abandoned mining town that the intrepid settlers had bravely secured in the wilderness. \n\nThis was, of course, incorrect. The land they were on was inhabited by the Ute prior to settlers encroachment and forced relocation. My former partner procured the documentation for this and was met with a great deal of resistance. Now, they have a land acknowledgment (for whatever that\u2019s worth to you). \n\nI now work at a large public research university in the United States that is on land that was inhabited, in part, to my people. The public education in the state I am in is extremely misleading (this is intentional) regarding the nature of our forced removal. Few students and faculty are even aware that the history of this university includes bloody battles between settlers and the Indigenous peoples who lived here. \n\nI am one of three Indigenous faculty enrolled in federally recognized tribes here (the federal recognition is important). Late last year, I met with one of my fellow Indigenous folk for coffee. He is the former head of the anthropology department and also belongs to a tribe originally from the area where we now work. This university did not have a land acknowledgment, but after years of resistance, wanted to get with the times. \n\nHe told me he had been invited to the meeting to discuss it. He thought they wanted his help crafting it and was a little bit excited. We both had our reservations, but we were intrigued that it was happening. \n\nI met with him after that meeting. They only wanted him to verify that they were citing the correct treaties. The land acknowledgment itself was crafted by a team of non-Indigenous people. It was disappointing for both of us, but hey, at least they had a land acknowledgment now. \n\nSo I think you are, in some ways, correct. There are limitations and problems with these land acknowledgments, and who they\u2019re actually serving. \n\nEven so, from my own experiences and those of my peers, know that each time you hear one, it was fought for. That matters.",
            "I'm from Australia, and the indigenous beliefs and customs are going to be different from where you're from in Canada.\n\nAs others have pointed out, Indigenous people aren't a monolith. Australia, Canada, and the US are all comparable in size to Europe. Just as we don't expect a Portuguese person to have the same language and culture as a Lithuanian person, neither should we expect a person from Wajuk country to be the same as someone from Yuggera. Same goes in Canada: Gitxaala lands are a continent away from the Mi'kma'ki.\n\nThat's a very long way of saying: we're talking in very broad generalisations here. Things that are true of one indigenous group aren't necessarily true of another, and that's before we even get to individual differences between persons within that group.\n\nWith that in mind, there is a tendency across many of the indigenous cultures I've interacted with to have a religious connection to the land itself. \n\nLand acknowledgements are culturally important to people to whom land is religiously important. Just because something isn't important or offensive to you doesn't make it insignificant to someone else.\n\nIn Anglo-Western culture, we have certain rituals around death and burial. You may, understandably find it offensive if a person urinated on the gravestone of a loved one of yours. Anyone, regardless of if they participate in our culture, and bury their dead, marked with a stone or not, should understand that this is an offensive behaviour. You can understand why it would be offensive to spit on the holy book of another religion.\n\nThis doesn't mean we need to live our lives by the religious standards of others. I'm not a Christian, but I'll refrain from blasphemy while in a church for a wedding. I'm not going out of my way to be a jerk on purpose. I'm not going to bring pork to a mosque.\n\nWith that kind of cultural understanding in mind, consider that for some indigenous groups, the land itself *is* religious in the way that a church is religious. Taking two minutes to pay lip service to the cultural and religious heritage to a historically disinfranchised people isn't harming anyone. At worst, it's doing nothing. At best, it actually makes some people feel respected.\n\nI say lip service, because, so often these Acknowledgements Of Country feel insincere. Running through a script because it's become the accepted norm. A matter of procedure. Even this - a white politician trying to rush through a 15 second acknowledgement so as to seem like he actually cares, but really doesn't - isn't a bad thing. It shifts the Overton Window, just slightly. It keeps the ideas of Indigenous lands and their issues relevant in people's minds, even if just a little.\n\nIt's not a magic wand that will go and magically fix all of the generational trauma inflicted upon the Aboriginal peoples of our countries. Telling a room full of white people that you acknowledge the land will not do much to address issues affecting the people being addressed, who often aren't even in the room. That doesn't make it pointless. It's still an ongoing reminder of past, present and future.\n\nThe indigenous people of my country face many problems. There are no simple solutions. These problems aren't going to just go away. Acknowledgments of country are for now, one tiny piece in a much larger puzzle as to how to heal some deep intergenerational wounds.",
            "I\u2019m always waiting for a First Nations person to stand up in the audience and say, \u201cIn that case I want a refund on my ticket.\u201d",
            "The reasons these land acknowledgements exist is because some natives wanted and asked for it. Natives disagree with each other, sure. It doesn't mean rich white or Asian people are telling everyone else what natives want.",
            "It's difficult to really comment on this without knowing which part of the world you live in, which you haven't specified. Context matters, and without knowing which location and which indigenous groups you're referring to I'm not sure anybody is going to be able to offer you much in the way of a meaningful debate.",
            "I see the benefit in that it is a response to 5-6 generations of indigenous erasure.\n\nWe also have a ton of immigration to north America who don't understand the context of how treaties were made, then broken.  They need to know so that they have an understanding as to the how and why indigenous communities still face so many challenges.\n\nI do agree with you in that these acknowledgments often feel like they are some sort of \"least amount of effort\" to show that we are a progressive society... We need more substantive change.",

            "Where do you live?\n\nIn Australia, the act of Welcoming to Country was and is a traditional way of declaring peace when people from one nation visit the land of another nation. It says \u201cWe, the caretakers of this land, invite you to be here and we trust that you won\u2019t seek to harm us or the land that sustains us\u201d. \n\nA Welcome can only be given by an individual of the nation who traditionally lived on the Country where the event takes place. They usually take the form of a short speech about the history of that place and the individual\u2019s family/nation. Sometimes there will be a smoking ceremony, which symbolically cleanses the area of bad spirits. \n\nFor large or official events, it is quite a powerful gesture of reconciliation to have that event sanctioned and blessed by someone with an unbroken connection to that Country going back tens of thousands of years. It reminds audiences that trust goes two ways and that non-Indigenous Australians have a duty to act with respect towards the land and its traditional people, and do what is within their capacity to work towards reconciliation. \n\nHere\u2019s a [video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZleZy8N0EFE&pp=ygUSd2VsY29tZSB0byBjb3VudHJ5) of a Welcome to Bundjalung Country (North-Eastern NSW).",

            "My experiences in real life differ drastically than those online.  \n  \n**Real life:**   \nSay it's a social gathering, someone gets offered food, vegetarian says , \"No thanks, I'm vegan/vegetarian\" in much the same way someone with a food allergy would say \"No thanks, I'm allergic to \\_\\_\\_\\_.\" They may get some questions why, but I've never had anyone try to counsel me on why I, personally, should or shouldn't be consuming meat. \n\nJust like them, though, I'm pretty up front about my food allergies (tree nuts), of course I'm going to be vocal about it, because consuming it could kill me, but you don't see people making the same jokes/memes out of it. \"A vegan walks into a bar....I only know because they told everyone.\" If I were a vegan, yeah, I'd be the same amount of vocal about it, \"hey, what ingredients does this have, i'm vegan.\"  For some reason, this upsets some people for reasons beyond my understanding. I've never seen a carnivore/omnivore actually get mad at a vegan/vegetarian in real life, I did experience a boss of mine make fun of a vegetarian coworker, but neither came off as preachy, and both seemed to take it in good fun.\n\n\n\n**Social media:**  \npeople seem to like this blanket feeling of anonymity, they don't care whose feelings they hurt by expressing their opinions in the psuhiest ways possible. \n\nUsing a popular group on facebook as an example, where people are creating floods of crappy AI images for every random thought they have. I see more posts making fun of vegans/vegetarians than I do the other way around, and normally these people seem to want to fight EVERYONE in the comments section. It's like they are offended and physically repulsed by someone who doesn't want to eat meat. It's like their entire existence is built on tryint to either make someone else mad or bully them.\n\nOn very rare occasions do I encounter a \"preachy\" vegan/vegetarian, that actually elaborates on WHY they do it (cruelty, slaughter practices, animal rights, etc)",

Also, they do not want me to bring my own food because they don't want the \"smell of meat\" in their home.  I acquiesce without complaint.\n\n* I've never personally met a vegan to make carnivorous food for their carnivorous guests.\n* I know many carnivorous allies who gladly make vegan food for their vegan guests.\n\nSo, there's that difference, and that can make one group feel much more \"rude\" and \"pushy\" than the other.  I know vegans have good reasons for why they refuse to prepare meat for others, but this \"refusal\" creates a perception of them treating others differently than they expect to be treated.",
            "I feel like this is some sort of weird straw-man where vegans and vegetarians are being lumped together and criticism of vegans is being treated as criticism of both vegans and vegetarians.

(To see that this is the case, look at the number of google search results for \"pushy vegans\" vs \"pushy vegetarians.\") And I think this reflects a real difference in how pushy/rude vegans and vegetarians are about their diets.",
            "I have to disagree. Vegans don\u2019t even like vegetarians. I have never seen anyone go to such lengths to make what other people eat their business. Go to r/vegan and see for yourself.",
            "Let's ignore the small amount of internet trolls or really extreme cases where someone is causing another person to be malnourished.\n\nA lot of people go vegan because they believe meat is morally wrong (either directly or indirectly due to climate change). If you went vegan because of these reasons, you believe someone else eating meat is morally wrong. It is logical to assume you have a moral duty to stop them from doing something morally wrong.\n\nA non vegan has no reason to change a vegan. The only time you tend to hear a non vegan doing stuff like that is mainly due to ignorance (which has lessened a ton over the years) or to be malicious.\n\nBig caveat that this probably varies based on your location. I live in a big liberal city which is very vegan friendly.\n\nI will also say that most vegans are not super aggressive about it. I did have the... pleasure of having a sibling who was a very aggressive vegan growing up. Thankfully they mellowed out. It did educate me a lot on vegan food though and i do consider myself 60% a vegan (i like dairy mostly). Part of this is because it is really important of me to support their beliefs when i cook for them, so i have cooked vegan quite frequently.\n\nAlso keep in mind that reddit is likely to overrepresent the really aggressive people or people who are just trolling.",

On the other hand if you\u2019re hosting a vegan they will certainly ask or request a vegan option. Source? Me when having people over my house.",
            "In my experience, vegans and vegetarians are both far less tolerant of ARFID. If I go to a carnivore friend\u2019s house and they want to serve me a meal - I just explain that I have ARFID and that it\u2019ll just be easier if I eat beforehand. Sometimes they try to ask a million questions about what I can and cannot eat to try to accommodate me. It comes from a good place but it drives me nuts cause it just adds to my anxiety. But they aren\u2019t *offended* that I want to eat beforehand and their responses are typically well intentioned and in good faith. \n\nWhen my vegan and vegetarian friends offer to cook for me and I explain it\u2019ll just be easier if I eat beforehand - they get offended and think I\u2019m making ARFID up to get out of eating vegan food. My friend\u2019s boyfriend actually refused to hang out with me because I wanted us all to get coffee (at a vegan friendly place) instead of having him cook for me. I went to coffee with my friend (without the boyfriend) and she drilled me for 20 minutes about what my problem is with vegan food (it\u2019s not vegan food per se that is the problem. It\u2019s just that I eat very limited things and it\u2019s easier for me to prep food myself). \n\nThat\u2019s just an anecdotal experience from someone with a pretty intense eating disorder. But it\u2019s another aspect of this topic that I think is worth exploring. I\u2019ve also experienced vegans telling me that their restrictions should be catered to over mine even though my restrictions are a diagnosed medical disorder and theirs are a choice (not saying we shouldn\u2019t cater to them too. I\u2019m saying - why not both?)."

To take an analogy, think about professional sports; the reason it's easier to play offense is you control the first cut and the defenders have to react to you.\n\nThe other variable is whether the person actually means to kill and is going to squeeze the trigger at the first moment of an action. I would think a robbery just wants to get the transaction done and isn't thinking to pull the trigger right away.\n\nEven in a situation like a home invasion, it's true that many home owners are killed over their own gun. It's because we think people will act like you do in videos or movies, but the part where someone is disarmed is because people aren't as primed to shoot to kill as you imagine and the difference in reaction time specifically in the disarming action. \n\nI think if you were just measuring someone's speed at pulling the trigger the first time they see a movement towards them then you're largely right -- it's also why I think cops who are involved in shootings, from what I understand, are trained to make that split second decision to shoot and do so.",

Always direct the muzzle away and then side step while advancing on them (to avoid exactly as you stated, a retreat to re-aim). You want to be past the gun and go for an eye gouge, head butt, upset to the solar plexus, elbow to the face/solar plexus, pressing kick to their front knee, etc. before you attempt to wrestle the gun from their arms because you need the gunman thinking about something else while you attempt to break their grip on the gun. \n\nTake downs are also effective at disarming a gunman because it's really hard to aim while falling, and being flattened to the ground will stun an attacker and slow their movements giving you enough time to get the gun out of their hands and the assailant into a hold.\n\nEven after years of drills I'm not confident in my ability against a practiced gunman and would likely comply to an armed person's commands.

It isn't about taking the pistol away, it's about grabbing it so it can't cycle, and in a capacity that it fires away from your direction. The pistol jams and becomes a very interesting paperweight and you turned a surrender into a fist fight.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThat all said, it's also taught if you're at gun point, don't attack unless your attacker is distracted, unless dying is your jam.

        "content": "TL;DR - the way that the UK passed the laws to make the Rwanda plan work undermines sending people to Rwanda as a deterrent against seeking asylum in the UK  \n  \nFor those not in the know, the UK's Rwanda plan was as follows:\n\n\"On 14 April 2022, the UK government announced that it was going to send certain people seeking asylum in the UK to the Republic of Rwanda, where the Rwandan government would decide their asylum claims. If their claims were successful, they would be granted asylum in Rwanda, not the UK.\"\n\n[The Migration Observatory](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/commentaries/qa-the-uks-policy-to-send-asylum-seekers-to-rwanda/#:~:text=On%2014%20April%202022%2C%20the,in%20Rwanda%2C%20not%20the%20UK)\n\nRead the link for a more detailed overview\n\nThe reason the policy is stupid is because it obviously is the UK shirking its responsibility when it comes to asylum. International human rights law is very clear on this point. Everyone has right to claim asylum wherever they like. It does not specify that you have to get to the nearest \"safe\" country or anything like that.\n\n[This is true in the UK as it is elsewhere](https://fullfact.org/immigration/can-refugees-enter-uk-illegally/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=advert&utm_campaign=immigration&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwydSzBhBOEiwAj0XN4ESq2_G0gADLf7T4JqAdesBOfkTmW9BOy0V6b-pyj6Ie-PYjXm2eqRoCqP8QAvD_BwE)\n\nHowever it is more than just stupid, it's self contradictory.\n\nThe logic behind the plan was a deterrence. The idea being that people would not want to seek asylum in the UK because they would end up getting sent to Rwanda instead. This only works as a deterrent if Rwanda is somehow a \"Bad\" place, somewhere that it would be bad to go to etc.\n\nWhen the UK's Supreme Court ruled on the initial Rwanda plan, they concluded that it would breach the UK's human rights obligations because Rwanda was not safe enough to have people effectively processed there (the Migration observatory link explains this in more depth).\n\nThe UK government's response to this was to then pass a law saying that for all official intents and purposes Rwanda was to be classified as \"Safe\". This was the government's way of circumventing the supreme court.\n\nLeaving aside the asinine nature of going about things this way, surely the fact that the UK Government has in fact specifically legislated that Rwanda is indeed \"safe\" now undermines the deterrence factor of the entire plan in the first place. After all, Rwanda is safe - so says the house of commons itself! So... how is that a deterrent. If you claim asylum in the UK, you will be sent somewhere else that's just as safe?\n\nSo... can someone explain how this policy ever made sense?\n\n",

            "Yeah but the people abusing the asylum system don't want to live in Rwanda. They want to live in the UK.\n\nYes sure most of the real asylum seekers won't care. But they are trying to deter the economic migrants posing as asylum seekers. Which is a decent chunk of them.\n\nFurthermore international law does not trump the countries domestic immigration law. If their immigration law says no migrants. Then that is what it is.\n\nYou will be seeing a lot of this in the near future. The experiment has been tried and it's an utter disaster.",
            "You may see it as immoral, but it was perfectly logical. A person is crossing to UK from France and France by all standards is a very safe country. Therefore we may assume that lack of safety is not their primary motivation for the journey. They take the boat because they want to live specifically in the UK for some different reason.\u00a0\n\n\nTherefore promising to send them to Rwanda is a perfect deterrent. They know they will not achieve their goal of living in the UK. And if Rwanda is truly safe, the channel crossing would neither improve nor decrease their safety. So there is a very little incentive to cross.\u00a0",
            "It\u2019s a deterrent for economic migrants that come under the guise of seeking asylum, this is not all asylum seekers but likely a significant enough portion of them. The point being that if your goal is to get into the UK for the economic benefits, then the possibility of ending up in Rwanda might discourage you from attempting in the first place as while Rwanda is not a bad place, it\u2019s definitely not on the level of the UK economically.",

Everyone has right to claim asylum wherever they like. It does not specify that you have to get to the nearest \"safe\" country or anything like that.\n\nThat's not true. The source you used relies on decision made in the UK, but that's not how international law regarding refugees works. \n\nThe UK can legally return the refugees to wherever they came from, assuming that was a safe country. \nThe responsibility is definitely on the \"nearest\". country because they can't send the refugees back (that would violate international law).",
            "I've read a good deal of the comments here, and I note that people are missing the most base point about all of this:\n\n    If you want *any* part of international law to apply anywhere, *every* part of international law must apply everywhere.\n\nYou don't get to pick and choose which parts you like for yourself and which parts you like for others. The UK trampling on this single part of international law loses its moral authority to call for any part of international law to Pply elsewhere, and they are doing it in the name of their citizens, **MOST** of whom disagree with the policy ^[1](https://www.britishfuture.org/rwanda-scheme-planes-taking-off-not-enough-to-count-as-success-says-public/)",
            "Not stupid at all. The vast majority of asylum seekers are themselves abusing the UK having passed through many safe countries to reach the UK. Asylum isn't a residency, free visa and benefits  menu for people to pick and choose where in the world they want to live. Illegal immigration to the UK from people transiting through Europe, appears to be out of control. If you don't do something serious about it now the consequences will eventually be really be a political lurch to the right and far worse than the Rwanda policy. You're almost certainly about to get a Labour government who will likely roll out the welcome mat like Blair did. Good luck with that.",
            "1st safe country,  Otherwise it is just shopping.",
            "The Rwanda policy makes perfect sense once you understand what it's purpose is, to display cruelty towards foreigners as an appeal to racist conservatives.\n\nIt's just another example of the adage about the cruelty being the point",

If they wanted to put them in Cornwall or Kigali, it\u2019s their decision and asylum seekers must follow their law.",
            "They claim the problem is illegal migrants and people smugglers, then come up with a policy that targets neither but actually goes after the actual asylum seekers. I wouldn\u2019t expect anything less of this absolute joke of a government that\u2019s thankfully soon to be gone, possibly forever.\n\nBecause let\u2019s be honest, the government and the people who support this ridiculous policy don\u2019t actually care about the distinction between asylum seekers and illegal migrants. They don\u2019t want either coming here. Basically the attitude is it\u2019s \u201cnot our problem\u201d."

There are innumerable instances of this.\n\nPolling outside known swing states can help determine how close to being a swing state (in past elections) a non-swing state (in future elections) is.\n\nEDIT: Didn't see this bit at the end:\n\n> the current projections are going to result in an incumbent losing while winning the popular vote for the first time.\n\nThis is not the first time the EC elected someone who didn't win the popular vote. It also occurred in 1876, 1888, 2000, and 2016.",
