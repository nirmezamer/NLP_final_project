        "content": "This isn\u2019t me criticising democratic ideas. In fact, it\u2019s the exact opposite. I think democrats tend to have amazing ideas, but they tend to sabotage their own ideas with terrible messaging. A good example of this is Defund The Police and ACAB (All Cops Are Bastards). Both of these sound like extreme statements and imply that democrats want to create a lawless society with no law enforcement, that is until you read more about it and find out that democrats want to reallocate police fundings into other areas. Another example is the term \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d in comparison to the term \u201cAll Lives Matter.\u201d Despite the second term often being a racist dog whistle, it\u2019s hard to argue that on the surface, it is a much more effective branding for an idea, as it implies that every single life matters, which would encompass people of colour. The term \u201cpro-life\u201d is also a much more effective term than \u201cpro-choice\u201d as it implies that republicans are protecting the sanctity of a life, whereas \u201cpro-choice\u201d on the surface just sounds more selfish. Despite democrats having much better ideas than republicans, I tend to think republicans are far better in how they brand their ideas. CMV.",

        "content": "I've been following the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for a while now, and I\u2019m furious because it\u2019s so clear that since Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated in 1995, Israel has been actively sabotaging any chance for a Palestinian state. Here\u2019s why this infuriates me:\n\n1. **Settlement Expansion**: Since Rabin's death, the increase in settlements in the West Bank has been outrageous. These land grabs are blatantly illegal under international law, and they crush any hope for a future Palestinian state. This land grabbing is still an ongoing blight on any peace efforts. [link ](https://www.timesofisrael.com/smotrich-recorded-describing-mega-dramatic-plan-for-civilian-control-over-west-bank/)\n2. **Political Shifts**: Israeli politics have veered sharply to the right. Leaders like Netanyahu don\u2019t even bother hiding their disdain for a two-state solution. Most of the ministers in power are so extreme that they\u2019re practically salivating at the thought of exiling the remaining Palestinians from their lands.\n3. **Military Operations**: The sheer number of military operations in Gaza and the West Bank since 1995 is staggering. These brutal operations have caused immense suffering and destruction, making the occupation even more entrenched. It feels like peace is a joke to them.\n4. **Legislative Actions**: Laws like the Nation-State Law from 2018 are an insult to any notion of a two-state solution. This legislation blatantly prioritizes Israel\u2019s Jewish identity over any Palestinian aspirations, effectively pushing them aside like they don\u2019t even matter.\n5. **Stagnant Peace Process**: Despite all the so-called peace talks and negotiations, nothing has changed. Settlement expansion and on-the-ground actions make it crystal clear that Israel isn\u2019t interested in any real agreement.\n6. **International Relations**: The Abraham Accords and other diplomatic moves are a slap in the face. They\u2019ve normalized relations with several Arab countries while completely ignoring the Palestinian issue. The focus has shifted so far away from solving the conflict with the Palestinians that it\u2019s sickening.\n\n  \n**Hebron Protocol (1997)**: Divided Hebron into H1 (Palestinian control) and H2 (Israeli control). This created a fragmented, unlivable mess for Palestinians.\n\n**Wye River Memorandum (1998)**: Promised redeployments but kept key areas under Israeli control, isolating Palestinian territories into non-contiguous blocks.\n\n**Camp David Summit (2000)**: Proposed a fragmented Palestinian state with Israeli settlement blocs and security zones, making any real statehood impossible.\n\n**Taba Summit (2001)**: Detailed more of the same\u2014fragmented Palestinian areas under a patchwork of control.\n\n**Road Map for Peace (2003)**: Phased plan kept Israel in control of significant West Bank areas, turning Palestine into disconnected cantons.\n\n**Annapolis Conference (2007)**: Yet another division proposal, with Israel retaining major settlement blocs, slicing up Palestinian territories.\n\n**Kerry Initiative (2013-2014)**: Proposed maps with land swaps left Palestinians with fragmented, non-contiguous territories.\n\n**Trump's \"Deal of the Century\" (2020)**: Outright insult\u2014annexing settlements and the Jordan Valley, leaving Palestinians with isolated enclaves under Israeli control.\n\n  \nEvery so-called peace deal fragments Palestinian land, making statehood a joke. It\u2019s clear that Israel is not interested in a viable Palestinian state.\n\nThe same goes for some Palestinian leaders who would like to see the distraction of the Jewish state. however, people here argue that Israel tried to make a deal or help Palestinians to have their own state and I call that bullshit.\n\npersonally, I would like Hamas to go and the Palestinian Authority (PA) to control Gaza so at the least the current Israeli government won't have a so-called \"asset\" terrorist group in the leadership there to use as a scapegoat to kill and dehumanise innocent people. \n\nAlso to add if they are currently doing god's work in Gaza then allow News media to do their work and let the world be the judge of that.\n\nadditional reference:\n\n1.

While the ideas of either person may be good or bad, they are easily some of the worst messengers for those ideas.\n\nI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this but I think RFK might actually have a shot at winning the presidency, although I wouldn\u2019t bet my money on that outcome. I am pretty confident that he might get close to Ross Perot\u2019s vote numbers when it comes to percentages. RFK may have issues with his voice, but even then, I think he has more mental acuity at this point than either Trump or Biden.\n\nI\u2019ll probably end up pulling the lever for the Libertarian candidate, Chase Oliver, even though I have some strong disagreements with his immigration and Social Security policy.

He\u2019s the incumbent and is running again. But we\u2019ve seen a Trump presidency and a Biden presidency and I know one is far more damaging than the other. At a certain point pragmatism beats out hoping for a perfect ideology.",

Biden will surround himself with subject matter experts and Trump will surround himself with nepotism hires and yes men (evidenced by his first term). RFK remains unfit as well with his conspiracy theory views.",
            "The way the debates are formatted now they do nothing but prove one politician is better at spewing out their rehearsed answer to questions.\n\nMy proposition is simple: one debate should be focused entirely on assessing the ability of the candidates to answer simple factual questions with known answers. \"what is nuclear energy\", \"Who is the prime minister of England\", \"How is the number of votes in the electoral college determined\", \"Where is DNA located in the cell\" etc. We'll find out real quick if either or both candidates is actually as mentally checked out as people are claiming. Questions pertaining to civics can be tricky as politicians should be an expert in that field, general knowledge questions should be set around high school level.",
            "I don\u2019t need to change your view because one of them will be president regardless of how you feel about them. They are both unfit, but for entirely different reasons. Biden is too old and is suffering from his age much worse than Trump is, but at least he is surrounded by qualified people with good intentions, allowing his administration to function on his behalf. Trump is simply the least qualified, least redeemable candidate to ever even attempt to run for office. Trump is actively damaging to US interests whereas Biden is an underwhelming status quo. \n\nSo the election is not about whether they are good candidates, it\u2019s about who is less terrible. That answer is as clear as it\u2019s ever been.",

The US system is set up in such a way to extremely hinder third parties once two primary  parties have been established.\n\nNot saying you shouldn't vote for who you think is best just that there's no realistic way for a third party to win.",

            "RFK absolutely does not have a shot, and Biden, while sleepy, will not do as much damage to American democracy as Trump will.  Biden at least has passed some decent infrastructure programs.  Trump will do nothing but grandstand and bitch for his whole presidency."

So, Kamala Harris should drop out as VP (no offence to her, but she is largely unpopular) and a a young/charismatic figure such as Gavin Newsom should step in and be the VP. This gives Democrats an out - they can \"vote for Biden\" while they are actually voting for the successor Newsom who can step in if Biden dies in the next 4 years (i.e. this would allay fears that Biden won't last 4 years and we have a good backup) and it positions Newsom to run in 2028 ahead of schedule. It would also free Newsom up to go full on attack dog and dominate the media as Biden's surrogate moreso than he is now and his vigor as part of the Biden/Newsom team would counteract Trump's vigor which is currently being measured against Biden in isolation.
