This is just to name a few as each has many more than that give options depending if you like golf, the lake, hills, and so many other features.",
            "It would be a lot of help to either get some insight from people who live in Dallas or have experience in this situation but I\u2019m currently waiting on my degree of criminology with no experience related to this field but would absolutely love to start a career in Dallas as I\u2019ve been interested in leaving there for many years. What are the odds of me either getting an internship/ job offer as a 21 year old female from Ireland. Any help is very appreciated",
            "El Paso is Texas' \"City Different\" (like Santa Fe) in that it is way out west all alone, at 3500' elevation (cooler and less humidity), no floods, no tornedos, no heat domes, less traffic, and all a round easier living. As climate change gets her claws into the rest of Texas and burns it to a crisp, El Paso may be the last habitable city in Texas.  The only thing we give up here is we have no H.E.B. grocery stores.... but we'll live with that.",

            "So the court decided that a bigoted judge is allowed to preside over those they are bigoted against, as long as it's from a place of religion. Conservatives apparently gotta have state sanctioned hate and will destroy the country for it.\u00a0",
