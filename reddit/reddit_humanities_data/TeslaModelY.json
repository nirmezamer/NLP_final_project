See? Pretty simple.\n\nThe reason I'm making this post is because 15 users (mainly accounts with less than 10 karma on Reddit) have been banned in the last day due to them spamming their referral code.\n\nIf you have any questions, please let me know.\n\nThanks.",

            "Before I purchased my Y, I was so hype to use a referral code so I just found the YouTuber I liked the most and used his. I was under the impression that the miles lasted forever but they don't, my 1000 mile expire in like 6 months. It's almost wasteful to acquire thousands of charger miles that will expire. I live fairly close (less than 5 miles) from a supercharger but have only used it once for 80 miles, so far.",
            "Honest question as I am new to Tesla-world (scoping the X and Y). Why is asking for a referral code not allowed? Doesn't it help people if you use one? I get not spamming if you have one but I'd think the reverse would be ok.",
            "Totally agree with this move by the mods.\n\nWould it make even more sense if we asked people to put their referral code in their Reddit profile\\*? Then if someone was being particularly helpful, a new buyer could use their referral code without asking/spamming and it'd be a lightweight thing.\n\n\\*I assume there is some way to do this. I am far from a Reddit power user.",
            "Why not have a thread where people can post their referral codes? Better than just giving it to influencers who are more biased than a regular Reddit poster.",
            "It\u2019s just an annoying post always putting out your referral code.  Or getting a message asking you to use his referral code to give to your advisor if you already purchased a Tesla.",
            "Question on referral code, i forgot to use my friend referral code when I order my Y. Anyway to add it back to my order, 1000 miles super charge sounds good lol",

This is out of the Dublin, CA location. \nFingers crossed, I\u2019ll update if we pick up tomorrow!\n\nUpdate - Looks like Tesla moved our appointment to 03/01/2024 due to needing payoff quote on our trade in.

Given a delivery window on 1/25/24.  Inspection was flawless.  No paint issues, panel gap issues, or anything that didn't work or appear as expected.\n\nTrunk cover, J1772 adapter, and license plate brackets were included - no mud flaps or PPF (but they were available for purchase).\n\nThis is my first Tesla, and I'm very happy with the experience.  370 mile drive home was trouble-free as well, charging at a Supercharger for the first time was completely intuitive and hassle-free.  Honestly I am shocked how quickly the car charges.  Now the wife wants one too.",
