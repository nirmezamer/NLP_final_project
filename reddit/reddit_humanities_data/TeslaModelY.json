See? Pretty simple.\n\nThe reason I'm making this post is because 15 users (mainly accounts with less than 10 karma on Reddit) have been banned in the last day due to them spamming their referral code.\n\nIf you have any questions, please let me know.\n\nThanks.",

            "Before I purchased my Y, I was so hype to use a referral code so I just found the YouTuber I liked the most and used his. I was under the impression that the miles lasted forever but they don't, my 1000 mile expire in like 6 months. It's almost wasteful to acquire thousands of charger miles that will expire. I live fairly close (less than 5 miles) from a supercharger but have only used it once for 80 miles, so far.",
            "Honest question as I am new to Tesla-world (scoping the X and Y). Why is asking for a referral code not allowed? Doesn't it help people if you use one? I get not spamming if you have one but I'd think the reverse would be ok.",

And it\u2019s not just the old styling, but they all look the same.  I\u2019m still have a hard time telling the Model 3 from the Model Y.\n\nIMO the biggest reason to skip paying $50,000 for a brand new 2024 model Y.. is that it looks exactly like a used 2020 model Y that can be found for $25,000 all over the market.",
