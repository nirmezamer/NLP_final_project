        "content": "It seems like more and more people are asking about if car sales is the right career for them.  Below are my observations on the industry and hopefully it helps you make a better decision.  \n\n  \nCar sales can be an extremely rewarding profession with professional growth opportunities and a wide variety of positions.  While this can come with above average pay, it also tends to come with below average benefits, above average hours worked, and inconsistent pay.  Hours and pay will vary by location, store pay plan, and store performance.  \n\nSalesperson Schedule and Pay Progression\n\n* Year 0-3, the first few years at any job tend to be the toughest, car sales is no different.  Many dealer groups offer 0 vacation time to new employees before the 1 year mark.  For the first 2-3 years, Green Peas (new salespeople) will likely work 50-70 hours per week, with many of them skipping their day off to work.  While this is not a requirement, car sales is very much \"get out what you put in\" and you have to be at the store to help customers.  Pay during this time may be all commission or a small base plus commission.  Either way, earnings will likely be <65-80k.  \n*  Year 3-5 is the next step.  The car salesperson should now start seeing repeat and referral business.  This not only means more sales, but also a chance at less work.  Since salespeople at this stage have more business coming in, they may start to work less and see the occasional 45 hour week.  Most weeks will be in the 50 hour range with some hitting 60.  At this stage, earnings will likely be in the <$90k range for the above average performer and <$130k for the great ones.  At most stores this is the point where someone may begin to be considered for a promotion.  \n*  Year 5+ is relatively steady.  The salesperson now has an established book of business with a strong sales base from repeat and referral business.  This will get better and better over time, but now is when the real difference starts to show.  People that are still in the business at this point will forever be able to make a career out of it.  At this point, the hours are much better with the occasional <40hr week with most weeks in the 45-50hr range.  While income is relatively unchanged, a new tier starts to emerge at >$150k.  While not at every store, they exist with some breaking $200k+.\n\nSalesperson Income Breakdown\n\n* 50% of sales people in the industry make <$65k.  This will not be their career and they will be on the chopping block if cuts need to be made.\n* 30% make <$90k.  These people can make a career out of car sales and will always have a job.\n* 18% make <$130k.  These people are above average performers and often the top salesperson at their store.\n* 2% make >$150k.  While not at every store, these salespeople have mastered the job.  They have great repeat and referral business.  They also tend to be more autonomous, closing their own deals and working as needed.  \n\nCar Sales Career Progression Track\n\nCareer growth at most stores follows a similar path with the majority of promotions coming from within.  It is rare that a store hires someone from another store and promotes them, the main exception to this is the jump to GSM and GM.\n\n* 3-5 years as a consistent high performer and a promotion to F&I becomes a real option.  F&I handle all of the paperwork and financing, they no longer have to go on test drives, but they are still selling in one form or another.  They tend to work long hours since they are the final touchpoint for a customer.  Depending on the store set up, this could mean 50-60 hour weeks.  Pay can range from $100k-$200k+.  \n* 2-4 years as a strong performer in F&I and a promotion to Sales Manager becomes and option (some stores will break off here with the option of a Used Car Manager, or Commercial/Fleet Manager).  Much like F&I the managers need to be present and will often work over 50 hours.  Pay can range from $120k-$250k+  \n* 2-6 years as a strong Sales Manager and promotion to GSM becomes an option.  At this stage you are leading the entire sales department, at many stores they may also be a floor manager that desks deals.  They likely work <50 hours a week unless they are filling in for someone.  Pay can range from $200k to over $400k.  \n* 4-6 years as a strong GSM and promotion to GM becomes an option.  This is the top position at most stores (save the occasional dealer principal/owner that also works).  They are experts at selling cars and usually have over a decade of strong performance in every position.  They can fill in any gaps as needed.  At some stores they may have also done some stints in Parts & Service just to experience them.  They usually work <45 hours a week.  Pay can range from $300k to $800k+\n\nIs Car Sales Right For You?\n\n* Do you enjoy talking to people?, While you do not need to be the life of the party, talking to strangers should not scare you.  \n* Are you capable of memorizing things like car features and available colors?  While you do not need to be an expert and know the torque setting of the nuts on the rear differential, you will be expected to have a general knowledge of available features on your brand's vehicles as well as things like available colors, interiors and the like.  \n* Are you able to regularly work long hours?  While later in the career the hours become more manageable, early on you are working all the time, and dinner will often be after 6pm.  \n* Are you able to manage your money?  While making this a career can be financially rewarding, it is inconsistent.  Some months might be $2k and others might be $10k, so you need to be able to save from the good months to survive the bad ones.  ",

First year I made $52k, year 2 came out to about $58k, I\u2019m tracking for $70k-$80k this year. I\u2019m realizing how much I still have to learn, but I\u2019m also a lot more confident and comfortable now than I used to be, I ask better questions and get my customers further through the process. I\u2019m also better about not getting in my own head and psyching myself out of sales. Got salesman of the month in February and April, definitely feeling good about my future.

            "It\u2019s wild to me a GM at a successful store could work less than 45 hours a week. Our GM works the same, if not more hours than us Sales Managers. I suppose for a large corporate store it\u2019s not surprising. I don\u2019t know how they would effectively lead.  GM isn\u2019t the top for us though. Top GMs go corporate so I suppose there\u2019s more incentive there.",

            "13 years here. Over 3500+ transactions. 90% of my business is repeat and referrals. (Now)\n\nHave worked with over 300+ sales people at the same place. 3 stores, etc. most people sold 10 cars a month. I\u2019ve never worked with a single person who averaged over 25, who wasn\u2019t heavily fed or extremely agressive and basically over promised and under delivered everything.\n\nOther than that, the OP covers lots of great points. I never would have told you in HS or college that I\u2019ve be in sales/selling cars. Luckily I know lots of people and have a good reputation.\n\nIgnoring COVID, the average car salesperson in America makes around $22 (really less) an hour\u2026.working over 50 hours a week. ($46,000) You have to decide if a 2-4 year slog of $2000-$5000 a month is worth it to you.\n\nIf you want to make it a long term thing you need to figure your market and your competition.  I couldn\u2019t work at a store with minimal traffic, low volume etc, would be too slow paced for me personally.  Without my repeat business, I\u2019d probably sell 8-10 cars a month\u2026.after selling for 13 years.",
            "I got out of the industry 6 months ago, and was in for 6 years. Started at 21 in BDC (something I think everyone should have experience in), and made way to Sales. I was in the $140-150k a year group. \n\nAs advice, please be aware not every dealership is the same, your pay, how many you sell, how many hours you work, is all dependent on so many things involving that dealership.\n\nYou can make garbage money at a store you would think has all their shit together, and you can make outstanding money at a place you wouldn\u2019t think you\u2019d ever make a dime at. All of this depends on management, how they run things, how much on marketing they spend, how much experience they have in the industry, etc.. etc..\n\nIt may take you 3-5 dealerships till you find the one that works for what you\u2019re looking for.\n\nI\u2019d recommend everyone try it out at least, sales is such a diverse skill to have which can lead you to many different areas, and you can use it for the rest of your life basically.",
            "Excellent analysis. I\u2019m a green pea in the biz (7 months so far) but have family and friends in the business and the progression is accurate.\n\nWhat I learned as a green pea is to make good money starting out you need to man the station as much as possible, for the chance a customer walks in/ calls to buy. You can be working 50-60 hours just for a customer to walk in. People who aren\u2019t buying this month can waste your time and buy next month or next 2+ months. While complete randoms will walk in and just buy without  driving a car.\n\nAnother thing to note is that typically around 10% or less of your clients will actually buy when starting out. I work in EVs so it is a very niche market. New incentives and ads have increased traffic for us. But for about 70 or so clients I\u2019ve had walk in and call up only 10 purchased this month, with around 4 slotted for next month. The amount of follow up resulting in being ghosted, blocked, no longer interested despite all the work can be infuriating. Get used to customer excuses of \u201clet me think this over\u201d to be the telltale sign of \u201cI can\u2019t afford this vehicle but I want to let you down gently instead/ lead you on instead of being straight forward with you\u201d.\n\nNext thing people need to realize is that a majority of customers are COMPLETE FUCKING MORONS. I tried to give people the benefit of the doubt when I started out, but good god the amount of idiots I deal with daily is fucking astounding. I can go on and on about how people want to be at an ultra low payment with nothing down on a 60k vehicle, or how customers don\u2019t want to pay taxes, or customers with bad credit leading me on, etc.\n\nYou need thick skin to work in car sales. Both your coworkers and customer can be assholes. There is a general mistrust of car salespeople, and those negative stereotypes are warranted. But the amount of asshole, greedy, slimy customers that walk in is just as equal. If you can\u2019t take being backed into a corner during negotiations by a customer, or being yelled and belittled by your boss weekly, don\u2019t work in car sales. \n\nThe paycheck is not consistent, I\u2019ve begun to believe it is mostly just luck now who walks in to buy because I do not have a referral base. And I still don\u2019t have a referral base after working here for 7 months. It\u2019s all fresh ups, and once my clients get what they want they never call up again.\n\nLastly, the market ebs and flows. Right now the market is dookie. Especially for EVs since there are charging fears and the fact that our vehicles are so damn expensive in this current recession. Two years ago used car sales was astronomical and people were trading in like crazy. Now? My job may go bust based on who gets elected in November\u2026\n\nIf you are thinking about doing car sales do your research before joining.",
            "Interesting. I've been selling for 7 years now, and I've been pretty consistent making that $65k. I am not a top performer consistently, I'll admit. I'm average to above average, but I don't show up an hour early and leave an hour late.\n\nI also don't really want to go into management. I kinda like the groove I've figured out, how to get customers to come back for me, and I earn enough. I'm sure I'd do well as a finance or sales manager, I just don't really want to.",
            "Nice write-up. As a 15+ year car guy, I think this is accurate."

The salesman refuses to disclose what the capitalized cost is for the vehicle and will only negotiate based on monthly payments and down payment. He said until we do the deal at the desk level he won't disclose how they've valued the car. Is this normal? \n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "I hear you but, but the salesmen was telling me I qualified for all of these incentives that took, say $5k off. But off WHAT? If I qualify for the incentives, negotiate the price of the car and then let the manufacturer deal with the incentives they are offering the dealerships. It's odd to say \"you got off $5k\" but then refuse to tell me what it's off OF.",
