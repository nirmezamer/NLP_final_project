        "content": "It seems like more and more people are asking about if car sales is the right career for them.  Below are my observations on the industry and hopefully it helps you make a better decision.  \n\n  \nCar sales can be an extremely rewarding profession with professional growth opportunities and a wide variety of positions.  While this can come with above average pay, it also tends to come with below average benefits, above average hours worked, and inconsistent pay.  Hours and pay will vary by location, store pay plan, and store performance.  \n\nSalesperson Schedule and Pay Progression\n\n* Year 0-3, the first few years at any job tend to be the toughest, car sales is no different.  Many dealer groups offer 0 vacation time to new employees before the 1 year mark.  For the first 2-3 years, Green Peas (new salespeople) will likely work 50-70 hours per week, with many of them skipping their day off to work.  While this is not a requirement, car sales is very much \"get out what you put in\" and you have to be at the store to help customers.  Pay during this time may be all commission or a small base plus commission.  Either way, earnings will likely be <65-80k.  \n*  Year 3-5 is the next step.  The car salesperson should now start seeing repeat and referral business.  This not only means more sales, but also a chance at less work.  Since salespeople at this stage have more business coming in, they may start to work less and see the occasional 45 hour week.  Most weeks will be in the 50 hour range with some hitting 60.  At this stage, earnings will likely be in the <$90k range for the above average performer and <$130k for the great ones.  At most stores this is the point where someone may begin to be considered for a promotion.  \n*  Year 5+ is relatively steady.  The salesperson now has an established book of business with a strong sales base from repeat and referral business.  This will get better and better over time, but now is when the real difference starts to show.  People that are still in the business at this point will forever be able to make a career out of it.  At this point, the hours are much better with the occasional <40hr week with most weeks in the 45-50hr range.  While income is relatively unchanged, a new tier starts to emerge at >$150k.  While not at every store, they exist with some breaking $200k+.\n\nSalesperson Income Breakdown\n\n* 50% of sales people in the industry make <$65k.  This will not be their career and they will be on the chopping block if cuts need to be made.\n* 30% make <$90k.  These people can make a career out of car sales and will always have a job.\n* 18% make <$130k.  These people are above average performers and often the top salesperson at their store.\n* 2% make >$150k.  While not at every store, these salespeople have mastered the job.  They have great repeat and referral business.  They also tend to be more autonomous, closing their own deals and working as needed.  \n\nCar Sales Career Progression Track\n\nCareer growth at most stores follows a similar path with the majority of promotions coming from within.  It is rare that a store hires someone from another store and promotes them, the main exception to this is the jump to GSM and GM.\n\n* 3-5 years as a consistent high performer and a promotion to F&I becomes a real option.  F&I handle all of the paperwork and financing, they no longer have to go on test drives, but they are still selling in one form or another.  They tend to work long hours since they are the final touchpoint for a customer.  Depending on the store set up, this could mean 50-60 hour weeks.  Pay can range from $100k-$200k+.  \n* 2-4 years as a strong performer in F&I and a promotion to Sales Manager becomes and option (some stores will break off here with the option of a Used Car Manager, or Commercial/Fleet Manager).  Much like F&I the managers need to be present and will often work over 50 hours.  Pay can range from $120k-$250k+  \n* 2-6 years as a strong Sales Manager and promotion to GSM becomes an option.  At this stage you are leading the entire sales department, at many stores they may also be a floor manager that desks deals.  They likely work <50 hours a week unless they are filling in for someone.  Pay can range from $200k to over $400k.  \n* 4-6 years as a strong GSM and promotion to GM becomes an option.  This is the top position at most stores (save the occasional dealer principal/owner that also works).  They are experts at selling cars and usually have over a decade of strong performance in every position.  They can fill in any gaps as needed.  At some stores they may have also done some stints in Parts & Service just to experience them.  They usually work <45 hours a week.  Pay can range from $300k to $800k+\n\nIs Car Sales Right For You?\n\n* Do you enjoy talking to people?, While you do not need to be the life of the party, talking to strangers should not scare you.  \n* Are you capable of memorizing things like car features and available colors?  While you do not need to be an expert and know the torque setting of the nuts on the rear differential, you will be expected to have a general knowledge of available features on your brand's vehicles as well as things like available colors, interiors and the like.  \n* Are you able to regularly work long hours?  While later in the career the hours become more manageable, early on you are working all the time, and dinner will often be after 6pm.  \n* Are you able to manage your money?  While making this a career can be financially rewarding, it is inconsistent.  Some months might be $2k and others might be $10k, so you need to be able to save from the good months to survive the bad ones.  ",

            "I\u2019m a little over 2 years in now and it\u2019s just now at the point where I\u2019m consistently hitting 10+ cars a month (10 or more is solid at my store, smallish town low volume Toyota pre owned). First year I made $52k, year 2 came out to about $58k, I\u2019m tracking for $70k-$80k this year. I\u2019m realizing how much I still have to learn, but I\u2019m also a lot more confident and comfortable now than I used to be, I ask better questions and get my customers further through the process. I\u2019m also better about not getting in my own head and psyching myself out of sales. Got salesman of the month in February and April, definitely feeling good about my future. I started at 19 and I\u2019ll be 22 this fall, still not sold on making a lifelong career out of the car business but blessed to be where I am right now.",
            "It\u2019s wild to me a GM at a successful store could work less than 45 hours a week. Our GM works the same, if not more hours than us Sales Managers. I suppose for a large corporate store it\u2019s not surprising. I don\u2019t know how they would effectively lead.  GM isn\u2019t the top for us though. Top GMs go corporate so I suppose there\u2019s more incentive there.",

            "Interesting. I've been selling for 7 years now, and I've been pretty consistent making that $65k. I am not a top performer consistently, I'll admit. I'm average to above average, but I don't show up an hour early and leave an hour late.\n\nI also don't really want to go into management. I kinda like the groove I've figured out, how to get customers to come back for me, and I earn enough. I'm sure I'd do well as a finance or sales manager, I just don't really want to.",
            "Nice write-up. As a 15+ year car guy, I think this is accurate.",
            "GSM in the UK are usually on 70-80k a year..\n300-800k is crazy money when you don\u2019t take the cost of living differences into account",
            "Well shit I sell furniture and made 140k last year on 35 hours a week. A luxury dealer wants me and I been debating for a few months now since a couple ppl I know supposedly makes well over 170k doing cars",
            "Great post. One of the last professions you can start at the bottom and work your way to the top. If you commit at the beginning (which most people don\u2019t) it can really pay off, especially with little to no edu."
