When me and my girlfriend got together she did not want to meet her at all, but I still decided to hang out, just me and her (I'm to blame on that one). When she would clearly become mad when I mentioned my girlfriend in conversation or send snapchats of us to everyone, that's when I set a boundary that I wouldn't hang out with her until she met my girlfriend. So she stopped talking to me up until recently.",
