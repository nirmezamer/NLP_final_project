            "I have size 15 feet. Do you have a recommendation for wide snowboards?",
            "It's interesting you say skateboarding - I have friends who do both and are adament that there is no crossover. I was skeptical of their response so good to hear that some think otherwise!\n\nYeah I think the Step Ons are just skill error and a bit of mental (as soon as the board starts moving I panic). I practice at home and on flats and it's not a problem at all, it's simply the fact that even with a slight incline the moment I get on one leg I start sliding.",
            "What do people think the best exercise is for off season/between trips for snowboarding?\n\nI've been pretty slack lately and my day trip on the weekend (Australia) has left me sore for the first time in a very long time despite only doing a few hours of the couple open easy runs.\n\nI've picked up mountain biking in the summer, but keen to know what you guys find are good exercises to keep your boarding muscles ready to go :) One only semi related thing I'll be working on is my arm strength - the older I've gotten, the harder it is to push myself up to stand on heel side.\n\nSecondary question, I have Step Ons which I love, they've made things so much quicker on and off lifts. But I still struggle at times stomping my other foot in to start my run - I can do it no dramas on flat ground, but I find my board starting to move when I lift my leg on even the slightest incline and I just can't stomp. For the record, I'm in Australia so powder doesn't exist to dig in to. A lot of it's probably the mental aspect, but I just can't consistently do it, and wondering if anyone has experience with improving that",
            "I would recommend getting on a skateboard in the summer, as the movements are very similar, also a great way to practice switch. \n\nWhen it comes to the step ons, seems like there is some user error still happening. TBH you just need to practice putting the bindings on, I have traditional straps and I always beat my step on friends as they are not as comfortable on the snowboard.\n\n  \nJust because something seems easier doesn't mean it works better. If you wouldn't wear a pair of slip on or Velcro soccer cleats, why are we looking for the snowboard version of Velcro. \n\nChange the way you approach the problems and you might find better solutions. \n\nThat or get the Nidecker supermatics step on binding"
