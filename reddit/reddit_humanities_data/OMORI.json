            "For people outside of the US and Japan, here are some free VPNs you can use to read the manga on the K MANGA app:\n\n[VPN recommendation](https://www.reddit.com/r/OMORI/s/sFA3fT0mRt)",
            ">!I did not expect RW to come first and HS after. Very interesting choice on the writer's part. I love it already so far though!<",
            "It's extremely fast-peaced imo, don't know if it's because it's the first chapter so it's kind of an introduction or if Mangas are usually like this but still really cool.",
            ">!the RW focus is completely unexpected, i thought we would have to wait like 6 months minimum before we got to sunny going out with kel. absolutely wild!<\n\nedit: >!there's all new dialogue and the circumstances of the plot beats seems very different too, in the game during 3 days left basil doesn't seem to notice sunny until after the aubrey fight but here basil notices sunny right away. AND AUBREY KICKS BASIL TO THE GROUND??? SO SO CRAZY!<",
            "Jesus the plot is moving faster than the speed of light.",
            ">!Idk if it's because of the faster pacing, but comparing this chapter to its equivalent in the game, I found it much less impactful and significantly less well-written. Like, by this point of the story, when I first played the game, I was HOOKED, while I wouldn't have felt much if I discovered the story in the way the manga is telling it. The introduction of the characters/plot/etc is so much better in the game (for now at least, maybe it'll get better in the next chapters since this is just the beginning).!<\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>!The drawings are sick though, the small tweaks in Something's design are epic!<",
            "Is it just me who kinda... didn't like it? The art is gorgeous and some of the panelling is really cool but if it's trying to tell the story of omori to a new unfamiliar audience it's very strange to begin with faraway town and to drop that Mari is dead before we even know anything about her, as well as having no knowledge about sunny or kel or basil or anyone for that matter. Mari's death isn't even outright stated until Aubrey talks to kel and sunny in the church later on in the game, which is a very impactful moment in how blunt it is, and Aubrey coming out and shouting it in the middle of a park after saying she was never even friends with Sunny (which isn't in the game, correct me if I'm wrong but she just kinda acts apathetic towards sunny in that first meeting in the park) seems very out of character, as well as going back into white space after Aubrey is stabbed doesn't adhere to the rules of sunny's retreat into head space established in game. Obviously it's interesting if it's meant for fans of the game with knowledge of the story, but still seems vastly inferior due to the character actions I mentioned. Is it just me?",
            "I worry the pacing of the manga is perhaps *too* fast. Manga does usually tend to have a brisk pace, but I feel like without prior knowledge of the game, some people might get completely lost.\n\nIn addition, the decision to start with Faraway and *then* go to Headspace seems like an odd choice: I feel that Faraway on the first day has a lot more impact *because* of the comparison to the Headspace versions of the characters.\n\nBut, I\u2019ll still stick through, to see how the rest goes! It may just be that I\u2019m way too old now and need things to move a bit slower ![img](emote|t5_31hpy|2470)\u2026",

Here are their pros and cons.\n\n[TunnelBear](https://www.tunnelbear.com/download): You can choose to connect to US server, but there's a 2000MB data limit that resets every month.\n\n[Proton](https://protonvpn.com/download): Unlimited data, but you cannot manually choose server. You have to press 'Change server' and pray it changes to US server, the button has a 1 minute 30 seconds cooldown. My first attempt took me 4 presses (6 minutes) to successfully connect to US.\n\n[hide.me](https://hide.me): 10GB limit, can choose US server, no need to make an account.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you've got other recommendations, feel free to comment below. Hope this helps!",
