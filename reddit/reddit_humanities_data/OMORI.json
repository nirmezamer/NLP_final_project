            "It's extremely fast-peaced imo, don't know if it's because it's the first chapter so it's kind of an introduction or if Mangas are usually like this but still really cool.",
            ">!the RW focus is completely unexpected, i thought we would have to wait like 6 months minimum before we got to sunny going out with kel. absolutely wild!<\n\nedit: >!there's all new dialogue and the circumstances of the plot beats seems very different too, in the game during 3 days left basil doesn't seem to notice sunny until after the aubrey fight but here basil notices sunny right away. AND AUBREY KICKS BASIL TO THE GROUND??? SO SO CRAZY!<",
            "Jesus the plot is moving faster than the speed of light.",
            "Is it just me who kinda... didn't like it? The art is gorgeous and some of the panelling is really cool but if it's trying to tell the story of omori to a new unfamiliar audience it's very strange to begin with faraway town and to drop that Mari is dead before we even know anything about her, as well as having no knowledge about sunny or kel or basil or anyone for that matter. Mari's death isn't even outright stated until Aubrey talks to kel and sunny in the church later on in the game, which is a very impactful moment in how blunt it is, and Aubrey coming out and shouting it in the middle of a park after saying she was never even friends with Sunny (which isn't in the game, correct me if I'm wrong but she just kinda acts apathetic towards sunny in that first meeting in the park) seems very out of character, as well as going back into white space after Aubrey is stabbed doesn't adhere to the rules of sunny's retreat into head space established in game. Obviously it's interesting if it's meant for fans of the game with knowledge of the story, but still seems vastly inferior due to the character actions I mentioned. Is it just me?",
            "anyone who can access it, can you post/send me screenshots pretty please?",
            "Not available in my region :'(",
            ">!The pacing is fast but understandable i guess. I just can't wait UNTIL WE SEE MANGA THE MAVERICK. THE BEST CHARACTER!<",
            "Its a bit jarring seeing how the narrative is switched up a bit but cant wait to see where this goes! Definitely faster paced.",
            "they fucking cooked ive been waiting for so long i could die happy right now"

Here are their pros and cons.\n\n[TunnelBear](https://www.tunnelbear.com/download): You can choose to connect to US server, but there's a 2000MB data limit that resets every month.\n\n[Proton](https://protonvpn.com/download): Unlimited data, but you cannot manually choose server. You have to press 'Change server' and pray it changes to US server, the button has a 1 minute 30 seconds cooldown. My first attempt took me 4 presses (6 minutes) to successfully connect to US.\n\n[hide.me](https://hide.me): 10GB limit, can choose US server, no need to make an account.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you've got other recommendations, feel free to comment below. Hope this helps!",

            "Since it had a lot of Earthbound influences, I wish it had the same feature as Earthbound where if you encounter an enemy who is significantly lower level than you, it just decides the fight automatically (you win) and get the XP in a single dialogue box. Prevents going to the battle screen often in enemy heavy areas where they're all way below your level.\n\nAnd diagonal movement too but I'm not too upset about that",

            "Headspace part gets really boring after you get to the real world, I wish It wasnt so stretched, though I know some ppl liked it, I still think that it basically becomes filler.

            "Simple words \n\nHUMPHREY THE WHALE",
            "sometimes the game doesn't say what triggers an exit from headspace, a good example is when you defeat sweetheart and jump to the hole, that's ok, it's clear that you can't go back, but at the end of the lost library there's two things you can do: go to a room with a piano or look trought a hole, where basil's \"toy box\" animation plays and you exit headspace, when i was there i wanted to explore everything before leaving but i missed the piano room for that issue :(",

            "The pacing for sweetheart's castle sucks but aside from that, the game is too easy. They really didnt test the \"observe\" move did they? It makes the entire game's combat an absolute joke. You can literally play through the Whole game toastless as long as you have the move.",
            "The pacing is really rough, especially after you go to the real world for the first time and realize the dream stuff has no real bearing in the real world. It made me impatient to get through the dream stuff, which didnt help that Sweethearts castle and Humphrey go on as long as they do. Its a shame because theyre genuinely enjoyable, but I do think a lot of the dream content should have just been cut/condensed."
