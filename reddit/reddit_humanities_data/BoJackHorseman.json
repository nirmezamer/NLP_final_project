            "He was, briefly, thought to be Hollyhock's dad and he was a disaster",
            "I feel like he would project his toxic personality to the kid a little bit but he would be trying to change like a struggle like what he did to hollyhock",
            "I think he COULD have been a great dad, had he dealt with his childhood trauma, did the work and had he decided to go for the girl and the normal life instead of chasing a career as an actor. But would he have been a good dad? No, not in the life he chose. In a different life, yes I think so. He has a caring side and he's fundamentally someone who wants to be good, but he's his own biggest enemy.",
            "Hed have had good moments and good spells but is ultimately too selfish and flawed to be a consistent care giver. Look at his relationship with Hollyhock",
            "He'd have good intentions but we all know he'd scar the hell out of a child",
            "If he stayed clean and didnt relapse, then yes. He couldve been.",
            "I think when he's focused he could be a good anything, the problem is he rarely ever focused on anything beyond himself long enough. Fatherhood requires a lot more attention than Bojack could ever muster.",
            "i feel like a big reason for making this specific episode was to show that he does have that side to him",
            "Maybe after the show, but not during the time he fantasized about it"
