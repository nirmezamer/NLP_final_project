            "Is this scene, and others from this episode (and the whole series) loosely based on Magnolia (a great Paul Thomas Anderson movie with Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Julianne Moore and Tom Cruise)?\n\nAnd is Magnolia itself a homage to Short Cuts (Robert Altman)?",

            "This whole episode was just HILARIOUS. I just realized that Bojack and Princess Caroline had completely DESTROYED that ENTIRE restaurant \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23to the point all the customers left",
            "It\u2019s such an interesting look into Bojack and Princess Carolyn\u2019s dysfunctional relationship while also being incredibly funny. That\u2019s what I love about Bojack, even when it\u2019s being comedic it still hits hard.",
