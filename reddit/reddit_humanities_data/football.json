            "I dont deny that France got off to a poor start at Euro 2024. But as a French, I think were still the favorite to win the trophy, and that well beat our Belgian friends next Monday in the Round of 16.\n\n What do you think?",
            "after seeing Federico Valverde briefly as well as the position he often plays in (CM, RW), I now start wanting him to have similar playstyle to that of David Beckham (adding RM as alternative position, utilizing accurate long pass from deeper wide position as well as occasional incisive run from the side of the field).",
            "Is this a serious question? There's only 1 answer to that as he's by far the greatest player in the history of the sport.",

            "Dude, I didnt say Ronaldo I said Rivaldo or Romario. I hope you dont mean to say that either of them are the greatest all time",
            "Yes I do. Romario is the greatest player of all time. Rivaldo OR Ronaldo ain't good enough to shine his boots"

        "content": "I think England is really overrated as being put as the biggest favourites of the tournament. Their CB line, goalkeeper and the central midfield isn't really that good. They still lack the creativity in the midfield and have problems in creating chances. This is the problem they've been having for a long time. I thought Jude might be that creative presence they need, but he is more offensively oriented and not that creative. His playmaker ability isn't on the top level like Kroos, De Bruyne, Modric few years ago or Pedri.\n\nAlso, while Harry is a fantastic attacker, he never won anything and he is a captain of the team. This is also a problem. \n\nI feel like France, Spain, Germany and Portugal have bigger chance to win. Although, England is now in the easier draw and thus might make it to the final again.",

            "What the fuck has Pickford done wrong?",
            "We wouldn't be favourite in a one off match against some of those teams.\n\nBut we have an easier path to the final, which is reflected in the odds. The other side of the draw has lots of strong teams and anyone can beat anyone, so that makes the odds longer.",
            "Because loads of England fans put money on it so the odds shorten so that if they do the bookies don't lose out too much. England are almost always favourites because of this even when we were much weaker and other countries were much stronger. However, England has one of the best squads in the Euros and although they're misfiring I don't think its stupid to make them one of the favourites of the tournament even if you take away the bookmakers trying to limit their losses",
            "Defensively theyve been the best team in the entire tournament.\n\nNo team has a lower xG against them than England.",
            "Just because Marc Guehi doesn't play for Madrod or city doesn't mean he's not THAT good. Man is class. He is up to the task.",
            "Side point but youre Massively overrating pedri lol",
            "Can we please have a moratorium on any England related posts until the game please? It's all getting very, very tiresome",
            "Because their side of the bracket is so easy compared to the other side and i think most people expect them to reach the final (me included)",
            "We are shit but defensive lines been fine, lowest xg conceded, at least put some effort into it pal",
            "The midfield is that good. The players are absolutely top quality. \n\nThe unknown is how badly coached they will be."
