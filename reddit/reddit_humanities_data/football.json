            "Can someone explain to me why football doesn\u2019t have a lead on-field referee with two in support. I think collaboration in the penalty area on potential fouls would be a good thing. Additional on-field refs would prevent the game from slowing down due to flopping.",

            "after seeing Federico Valverde briefly as well as the position he often plays in (CM, RW), I now start wanting him to have similar playstyle to that of David Beckham (adding RM as alternative position, utilizing accurate long pass from deeper wide position as well as occasional incisive run from the side of the field).",

        "content": "I think England is really overrated as being put as the biggest favourites of the tournament. Their CB line, goalkeeper and the central midfield isn't really that good. They still lack the creativity in the midfield and have problems in creating chances. This is the problem they've been having for a long time. I thought Jude might be that creative presence they need, but he is more offensively oriented and not that creative. His playmaker ability isn't on the top level like Kroos, De Bruyne, Modric few years ago or Pedri.\n\nAlso, while Harry is a fantastic attacker, he never won anything and he is a captain of the team. This is also a problem. \n\nI feel like France, Spain, Germany and Portugal have bigger chance to win. Although, England is now in the easier draw and thus might make it to the final again.",

            "Mostly it comes down to France, Spain, Germany and Portugal is on the same side of the cup brackett now. Which means all those 4 competes against each other for the final.\n\nEngland mostly only competes with Italy for their place in the final.\n\nThat means the odds are what they are at the moment. But that will change especially after semi finals are played.",
            "Their game approach is actually quite good for knockout games. It's extremely difficult scoring a goal against them, whereas they definitely got the individual quality to score at least one goal in 120 minutes basically out of nowhere.\nThis approach obviously doesn't work that well in a group stage setting against weaker teams who are happy with a draw after 90 minutes.\n\nSame could be said about France. However, in contrast to France, England got a much easier path to finals.",
            "Because loads of England fans put money on it so the odds shorten so that if they do the bookies don't lose out too much. England are almost always favourites because of this even when we were much weaker and other countries were much stronger. However, England has one of the best squads in the Euros and although they're misfiring I don't think its stupid to make them one of the favourites of the tournament even if you take away the bookmakers trying to limit their losses",
            "As an Englishman, I bet heavy against England on big games. \n\nIf we win, I am happy for the country. \n\nIf we lose, I am happy for a pocket. \n\nI like to make situations where I win either way. \n\nMicro Game Theory",
            "Because their side of the bracket is so easy compared to the other side and i think most people expect them to reach the final (me included)",
            "We wouldn't be favourite in a one off match against some of those teams.\n\nBut we have an easier path to the final, which is reflected in the odds. The other side of the draw has lots of strong teams and anyone can beat anyone, so that makes the odds longer.",
            "*English bookmakers. Each country is bet upon by local delusional people everywhere. Eventually, some of them turn out to be right, but the only real winner is the betting house.",
            "Can we please have a moratorium on any England related posts until the game please? It's all getting very, very tiresome",
            "A few reasons.\n\nWe are on the good side of the draw.\n\nBest defensive record \n\nThere's the hope the attacking side of our game might turn up lol",
            "Defensively they\u2019ve been the best team in the entire tournament.\n\nNo team has a lower xG against them than England."
