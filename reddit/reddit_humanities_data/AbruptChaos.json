The vast majority of them are not abruptly chaotic and therefore do \n\nLike the title says, the vast majority of fight videos are NOT AbruptChaos. We are not [r/FightPorn](https://www.reddit.com/r/FightPorn/) or [r/PublicFreakouts](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakouts/) / [r/ActualPublicFreakouts](https://www.reddit.com/r/ActualPublicFreakouts/) which is where those type of videos belong. Those posts dilute the quality of the sub and we inevitably remove them when they are reported.\n\nOn that topic, if you see a post that does NOT fit the sub, the best immediate action you can take is to downvote the sticky. It only takes a few of you and it will set off the alarm bells and we will come running.\n\nWe are taking active measures to improve the quality of the sub and we hope you can help us achieve our goal.",
