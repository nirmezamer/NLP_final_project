        "content": "The r/bodybuilding subreddit gets around 1000 new subscribers every day, so here's a quick intro to this sub:\n\nThis is a community specifically for competitive bodybuilding. It is NOT for general health and fitness, fat loss advice, how to bulk up, how to get started at the gym, or how to get into shape in general. If that's what you're looking for, go to these subreddits and read their quick start guides:\n\n[r/fitness Wiki link](https://thefitness.wiki/)\n\n[r/loseit Quick Start Quide](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/wiki/quick_start_guide)\n\n[r/gainit FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/wiki/index)\n\n- This subreddit is also NOT for general progress pictures, memes, or questions about whether you should bulk or cut. Those belong in r/progresspics, r/Brogress, r/GymMemes, r/swoleacceptance, and r/BulkOrCut. \n\n- Please take a moment to consider if you are in the right subreddit, there are also many subreddits for general fitness, lifting, powerlifting, homegyms, and lifestyle such as r/fitness, r/gym, r/weightroom, r/gainit, r/loseit, r/homegym, r/powerlifting. \n\n- With all of the above in mind, this is also not a place for the \"natty police\". Asking someone if they're natural or enhanced is okay, if they don't want to discuss it that is their decision, if you ask and they answer, any further pushing or accusations will be met with comment removal and bans regardless of how much you/everyone else believes their word. Take it to r/nattyorjuice if you want to act like that.\n\n- If you'd like to participate in r/bodybuilding specifically, but don't believe your question/post warrants a standalone post, it likely belongs in the pinned Daily Discussion thread (you can ask basically whatever you want here) or the weekly newbie thread.\n\n\nAs always, general reddiquette and Reddit rules apply. If you see someone breaking r/bodybuilding rules or Reddit's sitewide rules please report them by hitting the report button.\n\nIf you would like to ask before you post you're welcome to reply here or message the modmail, there have recently been some changes to automod and the posting rules have become a bit more lenient and it's much more moderator discretion than automod removal currently.\n\n_______\n\n**Update-- You will be temporarily banned if you post something that blatantly violates the rules and/or what this post is telling you. This is your warning, the ban will not be lifted**.",

I havent taken these many days off in a row in over year.  Its hard for me to lol.  But at the same time my body does feel like it might benefit from it",

It's for the best since you'll have a vacation to distract you from something you should be doing anyway but are unlikely to follow through with",

If one never has to take a few serious rest days in a row, then I kinda question how hard one trains.\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/1cZbv9Eyd4c?si=fi_9KwL3VSxGEiyM\n\n\nSomewhere in this video Mike Israetel talks about the special benefits of dedicated rest days.
