        "content": "The r/bodybuilding subreddit gets around 1000 new subscribers every day, so here's a quick intro to this sub:\n\nThis is a community specifically for competitive bodybuilding. It is NOT for general health and fitness, fat loss advice, how to bulk up, how to get started at the gym, or how to get into shape in general. If that's what you're looking for, go to these subreddits and read their quick start guides:\n\n[r/fitness Wiki link](https://thefitness.wiki/)\n\n[r/loseit Quick Start Quide](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/wiki/quick_start_guide)\n\n[r/gainit FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/wiki/index)\n\n- This subreddit is also NOT for general progress pictures, memes, or questions about whether you should bulk or cut. Those belong in r/progresspics, r/Brogress, r/GymMemes, r/swoleacceptance, and r/BulkOrCut. \n\n- Please take a moment to consider if you are in the right subreddit, there are also many subreddits for general fitness, lifting, powerlifting, homegyms, and lifestyle such as r/fitness, r/gym, r/weightroom, r/gainit, r/loseit, r/homegym, r/powerlifting. \n\n- With all of the above in mind, this is also not a place for the \"natty police\". Asking someone if they're natural or enhanced is okay, if they don't want to discuss it that is their decision, if you ask and they answer, any further pushing or accusations will be met with comment removal and bans regardless of how much you/everyone else believes their word. Take it to r/nattyorjuice if you want to act like that.\n\n- If you'd like to participate in r/bodybuilding specifically, but don't believe your question/post warrants a standalone post, it likely belongs in the pinned Daily Discussion thread (you can ask basically whatever you want here) or the weekly newbie thread.\n\n\nAs always, general reddiquette and Reddit rules apply. If you see someone breaking r/bodybuilding rules or Reddit's sitewide rules please report them by hitting the report button.\n\nIf you would like to ask before you post you're welcome to reply here or message the modmail, there have recently been some changes to automod and the posting rules have become a bit more lenient and it's much more moderator discretion than automod removal currently.\n\n_______\n\n**Update-- You will be temporarily banned if you post something that blatantly violates the rules and/or what this post is telling you. This is your warning, the ban will not be lifted**.",

I did a 7months off-season and I've gotten the strongest by far, but my strength has plummeted during this last 1-2 weeks. I can no longer do my top set on some of my best lifts (used to be able to do 6 reps of 140 lb incline dumbbells pause at bottom of chest) now I can barely squeeze out 8 reps on 130's. This is just one of example of my strength dropping off.\n\nThis is my first time doing a contest prep (I've done at least 7 years of bulk cut cycles but not a contest prep) and the strength loss is starting to worry me.",
            ">!Beginner--please be gentle. !<>!Advice!<\n\nHi everyone, \n\nI'm a 35-year-old female who started powerlifting about two/three years ago. I fell in love with it and have been measured in my approach when it's come to increasing weight. My trainer, who is so wonderful, competed in bodybuilding shows in the past and this year I decided I wanted to go for it and train for a competition. I was doing so well--I was killing it on macros, steadily lifting more, starting to see a body composition change (and saying shit to my friends like, \"Let me tell you about body composition!!!\") until a month ago. I hurt my lower back. I thought it was a tweak until a week later and I was in serious pain and couldn't move. An MRI showed that I had a mild bulging disc in my lower back (which is hilarious because it's mild and there's no nerve damage but damn, it hurts). My doctor told me that I shouldn't be doing anymore heavy lifting like deadlifting, squats, etc. I am heartbroken and unsure of what to do in terms of achieving my goals. I truly love/loved lifting. Have any of you done bodybuilding shows WITHOUT doing things like deadlifts/squats/etc? \n\nIt's been six weeks and it still hurts to move. It hurts to walk. And yes, I've fallen off the wagon, food-wise and am trying desperately to pick myself up. Any advice would be so appreciated. Thank you.",
