            "Bummer that this doesn't include the XL. I've been considering one for a few weeks, and free shipping or a gift card might have been enough to push me over the edge.",
            "Ah can I get this retroactively?",
            "In North America printedsolid.com is selling the Prusa products (since I guess Prusa owns them). \n\nHowever their price is $1299 shipped for an assembled MK3 and Prusa is selling it for $1099 with free shipping now. \n\nWhy would I buy from them rather than direct?",
            "No idea. I just finished assembling mine. Hoping we can get something. Have you reached out to prusa yet?",
            "They are geared more towards the commercial and educational market. Many business and schools require any purchase be made from a company that at minimum has a US presence. Their price is higher to reflect the shipping costs. Institutional sales are generally also much more time and labor intensive than a sale to a retail customer. No forms to fill out in triplicate and such."

            "Fast is nice but it\u2019s the temperatures it can reach allowing you to print engineering filaments that is its primary selling point.",
            "It's not as fast as the speed of the money going from my wallet to Prusa's bank if I buy this",
            "Faster than doing it by had I predict",
            "Fast enough to take $10k from your wallet before you know what happened.",
            "Deltas are notoriously fast. My Flsun claims speeds the filaments don\u2019t. Increasing temps beyond their limit with some junk pla or PETG hit 600 but there is a setting for 1200. I had a trilab2 it was too small. The Pro is not same chassis at all. I have the big delta to print 384mm tall Radar clamps. Made 3 sold 2. On test this summer. If the item takes off I\u2019d buy a pro. I\u2019m building a Doron Velta an April Fools joke but 60 days later it\u2019s a kit. Well 30 kits world wide. The Dorons brain power makes it a leading Delta instantly, a huge weakness in Flsun $15.00 cpu",
            "Movement? Fucking fast, its a delta with klipper after all. \n\nHotend? Not so much, the motion and cooling is capable of more, its a revo high temp. 22mm3/s with a 0,4mm nozzle, 30 to maybe 35mm3/s on a 0,6mm. Prusa themselves claim 1kg of filament per 8hours, with a density of 1,25g/cm3 this is about 28mm3/s, nozzle size unknown. Flow numbers are for the regular revo, revo high temp should have higher numbers at the same set temperature due to the different arrangement of thermistor, nozzle and heating element, revo high temp has the same component arrangement as a old v6. \n\nThese flow numbers are also only up to 300c, above you have to use the high temp nozzles (copper plus steel tip), obxidian hf and brass hf are only rated for 300c, diamondback nozzles aren't avaliable as high flow and also aren't rated for above 300c.\n\nTo have a comparison, a standard phaetus rapido or volcano both achieve 25mm3/s with a standard 0,4mm nozzle without cht technology.",
            "I'm more curious about the pricetag",
            "If anybody was wondering I got a quote for one of these for my work and it\u2019s about $10k all in. Priced pretty reasonably considering its speed and ability to print high temp materials like ultem",
            "Now that there is a Prusa with Klipper.. wonder when the XL will get it!",
            "Prusa is honestly the laughingstock of 3d printing and they always have been, putting 3d printed parts in their machines and charging ridiculous prices, you people are getting played for absolute fools and it\u2019s embarrassing."

            "I normally hate long YouTube videos, but he gives the complete steps in the first 3 minutes. Maybe the rest of the video has more nuance and tricks, but I was up and running with that.\n\nBasically make a shape, and that shape has 3 elements: volume, negative volume, and a \"handle\" volume to make scooting it around the plate more easy. Size the volumes appropriately (as per video. I tried it out of sync and it didn't work). Then, you give the shape the brim options, and then do \"inside only\" brim. If the volumes are the right size, then it creates a brim element on your bed within the shape, but not elsewhere.",
