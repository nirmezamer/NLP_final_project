        "content": "Hello everyone, I am currently looking for a solution to my problem. \n\nSometimes the Prusa MK4 only prints a gap in a layer. The rest of the print is fine, but the gap surrounds the entire object. The object is stable and it is not falling apart. \n\nI am not an expert, but I would like to understand the problem. Does anyone have some tips on what I can check to fix the problem? ",

            "To me this seems like the result of a partial clog that resolves itself during the print. Or does the gap always happen on the same vertical position? Otherwise maybe you could try a cold pull to see if that resolves the issue.",
            "Gotta say, that's one fancy looking kitty litter scoop",
            "this is a partial clog that happened on layer change retraction and fixed itself after the outer perimeter, probably during infill. you still have most of that layer, but the walls werent extruding at the time.",
            "From my point of it would kind of funny but also raise my question why. The gcode will be local generated and then transferred to connect. So what is the root cause. Strange.",
            "So prusaconnect is the reason, does it just not transfer correctly? I guess back to usb, but I\u2019ve also read elsewhere that the prusa usb has issues as well. I\u2019ve had to reformat it once since prusaconnect wasn\u2019t able to load anything in.",
            "It is strange. My suggestion is to use another usb2.0 drive and does not use prusa connect. I do not have time to analyze the issue.\n\nI am using octoprint until this is resolved, because I had randomly prints with these empty lines.",
            "Hmm well this problem is not always on the same vertical position so the partial clog could be the reason. \nThe problem started with a new silk filament. I will check the cold pull. \n\nThanks for the hint. \ud83d\udcaa",

            "It was already mentioned, but reduce your layer height in the area for the threads (height range modifier). Doing so provides more of an overlap from layer to layer. Pretty sure Prusa has a help article regarding this\u2026",
            "Printing threads depends on the printer. I fiddled a couple weeks with that but i assume you cant change the thread angle?\n\nFor this problem i would reduce speed, reduce layer height for the thread section and i would also use some internal brim. The tube form is funneling the head from the heat bed up there which is causing the threads to sag more. Edit: Or i guess you could throw like a paper towel in there halfway through. Just anything to help the filament cool faster so the threads dont sag and mess up",
            "Good advice but also contributing is that you have a sharp profile on that inner thread: would help to flatten that profile.",
            "I know you\u2019re trying to get the print to be perfect, but just in case the perfect is getting way of the good enough here: that adapter will probably work despite the flaws. If it doesn\u2019t fit, just snip off the erroneously straight parts.",
            "1 is barely helping mostly with overhangs - at least with my experiences. but 2 is the most simple and easy solution. this increases the surface area of each line to the one prior and thus should eliminate these 'shortcuts'.",
            "This right here. Solid advice.",
            "When I printed threads I've noticed this weird effect also. Only happens on the threads, rest of the print is perfect. Don't know what causes it but also the threads still work perfectly fine so I just ignore it. But you're not the only one at least!",
            "You're experiencing what I call 'shortcuts'. The bead of filament doesn't have enough to stick to as the nozzle rounds the bend so it takes a straight line instead. \n\nTwo things you can do.  \n1. Slow the print right down, maybe just the overhang speeds\n2. Reduce your layer height\n\nI would just do the layer height since the MK3S+ isn't a fast printer anyway, I don't know how much slower you can make it.",
            ">1 is barely helping mostly with overhangs - at least with my experiences\n\n\nYes because it only helps when they are classified as overhangs and not as outer perimeters, depending on angle and other configurations.",
            "Any info on what you are doing?\nHow about enabling supports?"
