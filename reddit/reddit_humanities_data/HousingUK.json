        "content": "We are currently in the process of purchasing a house and have completed most of the steps. We anticipate being able to exchange contracts in 1-2 weeks. However, my partner received a 3-month notice from work yesterday, which is very unfortunate timing because we really want this house and have not yet closed the deal.\n\nI have a stable job, but we need my partner\u2019s income for the mortgage. Since we are close to exchanging contracts and my partner has 3 months left at their job, our financial situation should remain unchanged until we complete the purchase (we expect to complete within 4-6 weeks).\n\nWe are very frustrated with the situation and feel lost about the best decision to make. My partner is actively seeking a new job and hopes to start before the 3 months are up. If the job search goes well, would it be better to inform our mortgage advisor of the situation? Or, since our financial situation will remain unchanged until we complete the purchase, should we keep quiet?\n\nWe can continue providing payroll evidence, but we are most worried about the final check from the bank in the last stage of the process.\n\nWe didn\u2019t expect this situation and are unsure what to do. \nIf anyone has good advice, please leave a comment.",

            "Honesty isnt always the best policy. This is one of those situations. Like someone else said, as long as you can afford the mortgage on one income then I would keep quiet about this one.",

            "Enjoy your new home and good luck with the new job. Be bold, be brave and say nothing!",
            "See if you can exchange and complete on the same day, and ask if the solicitor can have the funds drawn down ready the day before. \n\nIf your lender is going to a spot check, theyll do it just before the mortgage funds are drawn down, so you dont want to be in a position that youve exchanged but cant then get the mortgage to complete.",
            "If you can complete before the 3 months are up, and you're confident you can pay the mortgage for a while on one income, absolutely do not say anything.",
            "Keep your mouth shut and continue as normal with the assumption that your partner will find suitable employment in that 3 month period.",
            "Can you cover the mortgage on just your income in the short term? \n\nIf yes I would say nothing if no then do you want to take that chance? What if your partner doesnt get a job quickly?"

This is November 2023.\n\nThey told us that they really wanted a fast transaction to secure their home.. so we payed for a fast track service from our solicitors.. they hopped to be in by latest January.\n\nFebruary comes and the house that they was supposed to buy has some issues so they had to pull out.. it\u2019s now July 2024 and they still haven\u2019t found anything \n\nWe\u2019ve been looking for other houses but we can\u2019t find anything close to that house\u2026 what do we do!?!?  \n\nThe woman of the house we are buying is a interior designer, I\u2019m assuming they are being very very meticulous on what they want\u2026 but how long do we wait!!?!?\n\n ",
