            "Sorry you are going through this, I feel your pain and unfortunately it has all to do with a lot of FTB being huge pains in the a$$ and wanting the moon on a stick. We tried to sell our leasehold flat 2 years ago but the buyer was such a nightmare that we're scared to go down that road again. They put immense pressure on us to agree an exchange date and said the same thing about not getting a survey and then lo and behold, 4 months after we accepted their offer and got to  point where we could start thinking about exchange, they arranged one\n\nSome of the things she requested during the conveyancing process:\n\n**Month 2**\n\n1. Change to ground rent clause in lease, currently \u00a3125 a year but set to double every 25 years which of course we were happy to agree to but then came everything else.\n\n**Month 3**\n\n2.  Very nonchalantly asked if we'd consider leaving any furniture and turns out they wanted us to leave basically everything. We said no but they kept on asking and made us out to be unreasonable that we didn't want to give away all of our possessions as part of the sale.\n\n**Month 4**\n\n3. Then came the request for \u00a310K off for what they described as 'severe damage to the roof' needless to say it needed minor repairs and wasn't as bad as they were making out, our roofer estimated a true cost of about \u00a31.5k.\n\n**Month 5**\n\n4. Then when we wouldn't reduce the price over the roof repairs, they wanted to make it the freeholder's problem (our current lease states that any structural work is arranged and paid for by the 2 flats in the building) and asked for the lease to be changed to make FH liable for all repair obligations. Freeholder quoted additional \u00a37k for changing the lease which they expected us to pay for.\n\n**Month 6**\n\n5. They didn't like the fact that us and the flat downstairs arrange our own buildings insurance (as per lease) under one policy and wanted the lease changed to make FH arrange. That would have cost another few thousand plus they wanted us to change the lease of the other flat too which would have cost god knows how much.\n\n6. The final thing was they wanted a Fensa certificate for the windows that were installed over 20 years ago before we owned the property. Fair enough but we didn't have one so we offered indemnities, which they didn't want. They then contacted the Freeholder directly to ask for one which of course they didn't have, and then suddenly I was charged with \u00a31k for retrospective consent as the buyer told freeholder I had changed the windows without permission or the appropriate certification - this just wasn't true and took a lot of explaining plus meant we were out of pocket by another \u00a31k.\n\nThis whole sorry affair went on from May - Nov 22 when interest rates more than doubled. Weirdly, they were putting pressure on us to exchange to keep their mortgage offer while demanding more and more stuff, which we estimated would have cost us upwards of \u00a325k and taken about a year of back n forth with solicitors and the freeholder if we'd entertained it. In the end we told them where to go and remain scarred by the whole experience. They then tried to make us feel bad, saying they had moved out of their rented accommodation and couldn't afford to buy another place now due to the rises in interest rates. To which I said 'not my problem' and took the flat off the market. A classic case of 'fuck around, find out' we felt and yes, it made the chain collapse and no we didn't end up moving but it was made nigh on impossible when we were basically being asked to subsidise the whims of these utter twats.\n\nJust utter timewasting clowns. At the end of the day, I'm on the property ladder, they're not so imo, they lost out a lot more than I did. Instead we've just spend the past two years overpaying the mortgage and enjoying ourselves with the extra cash that staying in this flat affords us.",
            "Oh bless you. Its horrendous really, 12k is an significant figure so you can't swallow that. I had the sell of my flat fall through three times and now I'm also an accidental landlord. First time buyers got cold feet, second time had a French chap who wanted to rent it out and appeared to think it was my job to cover all his costs. Wanted me to update the electrical consumer unit for him, replace all the plumbing etc, told him to f off quite quickly. He actually sent me a letter giving me feedback on the property...\n\n\n\u00a0Then we had our final buyer who got herself in a twist about the gate to the communal garden not being locked. Then got fixated on whether the fence was secure enough because she had a dog. Then felt the property wasn't secure enough unlike her one in London. Looked her address up from memo of sale, property worth millions in Paddington. A small block in on the south coast not quite the same. She had money to burn so took it all the way to the end then said no. So yeah some buyers are impossibly difficult and we feel very anxious about trying to sell again. Feel for you.",
            "Not being weird but did they not notice for themselves what your windows were made of?! That's so funny in an awful forehead slapping kind of way. What dreadful people. Sorry you've had this happen. Good luck with it all down the line when you try again."
