        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nAll good things must come to an end. For the time being, r/everyoneknowsthat will remain active so you're free to still post here. However, since the search is practically over, we aim to one day archive this subreddit when we feel it has lost its purpose.\n\nWe have now opened the doors to r/christophersaintbooth and would like to welcome you all to join us there. Over there we can still talk about the history of the search, but it will be more focused on the Booth brothers and their music, and of course general music discussion, particularly the amazing music from the 1980s that have inspired them to create *Ulterior Motives*.\n\nSince Christopher became synonymous with *Ulterior Motives* after the song was found, the community is named after him, but of course we'll also celebrate co-creator of *Ulterior Motives* Philip Booth and his fantastic musicianship.\n\nThe new sub is brand new and still under construction. Like I mentioned before, it will be a slow transition, so you're still free to post here while we setup shop in the new subreddit. Any feedback or ideas are more than welcome to please send us a message if you have them.",
