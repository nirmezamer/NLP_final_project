            "> Don't show me vegan smoothies\n\n> Show me diets I can afford\n\nThe two aren't mutually exclusive.  \n\nVegan smoothies are cheap and easy to make.  Throw a few bananas, soymilk, maybe some peanut butter, blend it, you're done.\n\nBeans, potatoes, rice, tofu, veggies, grains, starches, etc... are generally some of the cheapest and healthiest stuff you can find in any given supermarket.  Just don't try and live off of Impossible Burgers & expensive pre-made frozen meals.  Take a few minutes in the kitchen, and it's not nearly as expensive as people claim it is.\n\nI'm having a giant healthy salad now that's: beans, cabbage, broccoli, carrots, celery, a diced jalapeno, and for salad dressing, I drizzled some olive oil and spices and squirted it with lemon juice.  Literally nothing about this is hard or expensive.",

It\u2019s super useful for beach towels or wet clothes/things and avoiding forgetting about it and finding a stinky bag of moldy stuff. I use them for mushroom foraging as well to spread spores.

(Also good for mushroom foraging and spreading spores btw)\n\nEdit 2 - holy cow I just saw the price on this stuff. I got all of the bags and the beeswax wraps for less than $40 (probably closer to 30 but I\u2019ll be generous). If you like and need this stuff, don\u2019t buy it all together like this.

There are groups that do anything that returns net funds, others prioritise higher net returns and work down the list until they have \"enough\".\n\nBlaming them because they don't get enough funds just by setting up a website where you can donate is shortsighted.

Microwave will heat that up and toast your bread. This is the same principle as the hot pockets where they give you a \"wrapper\" with a metal foil inside wrapping around the pocket to heat up the surface.\n\nThat is also why you are not suppose to put metal inside a microwave.
