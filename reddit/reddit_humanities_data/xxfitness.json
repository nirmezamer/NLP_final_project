        "content": "So I\u2019ll do squats with two legs but almost every other big move I\u2019ll do one limb at a time: split stance RDLs, one-legged hip thrusts. For arms I\u2019ll use dumbbells instead of bars so I\u2019ll move both arms together but they\u2019re still lifting separately. Mostly I do this because when I use barbells for arms I can feel my stronger arm compensating for my weak one. And for legs it\u2019s because I\u2019m scared of hurting myself with heavier weights: when I tried doing normal RDLs I would feel it in my back, but with split stance I don\u2019t.\n\nI\u2019m not looking to be a powerlifter so I don\u2019t care about maxing out strength gains. Just want to know if I\u2019m causing harm by avoiding the two-handed/legged exercises?",

            "There isnt a whole lot of harm but doing two arm/leg excersises is better for strength/muscle growth because you can go heavier. But given your goals you are fine",
            "No, youre fine. Its just more time-consuming. If you have significant imbalances then keep at it. But if youre talking about 2 reps difference, I would be very surprised that you could feel it in the other movements. Once youve fixed your imbalances itll probably be worth going back to trying out exercises that use both legs or arms.",
            "I actually just asked this question to my husband who is a PT because my left leg is significantly weaker than my right due to previous injuries. He says its important to mix both double and single limb in your routine. so he said it is better for me to do 1 day squats and then 1 day single leg squats. (I hit legs twice a week) 1 day RDL and the next time single leg deadlift",
            "I wouldn't worry too much about it unless you were wanting to train specific both arm/leg exercises. Usually single arm/leg exercises are more challenging for balance, core strength, co-ordination and all that good stuff. Plus they're usually suggested for muscle imbalances which is what you seem to experience. \n\nI would always recommend compounds for exercises to do for overall strength and development but if you enjoy your routine and are happy with what you get out of it then I don't see why there'd be any issues",
            "One possible negative would be from a bone density perspective. If you are only doing single-leg version of lower body exercises, you end up using 1/2 as much weight (or less) compared to the two-leg versions, and so you are only loading your bones half as much. It may be good to add in at least one two-leg lower body exercise, like a trap bar deadlift for example. Trap bar deadlifts are much safer than squats or regular deadlifts in my opinion.",
            "thanks! good to hear.\n\nIm mostly going for aesthetics I guess, so my butt might not grow so fast, but Id rather take it slow then wreck my back.",
            "thanks! good to hear. My arms are ridiculously imbalanced, Ive gone to a physio about it and they didnt even know what to do, so Ive just resorted to always using dumbbells.\n\nI do want to learn a proper RDL eventually but will wait til I can get an experts advice for my form because I dont need more back pain at my age.",
            "Interesting. We dont have a trap bar at my gym, but I guess Ill work on figuring out the two-leg movements",

I have been staring at the scale way too much, and seeing the +100kg (100,3kg, around 220lbs) feela awful\n\nAnd due to hormonal stuff I have been beating myself down about lot of stuff.

Done cardio 3-5 times per week, done HIIT only 3 times during this month. Weight difference is -200g (0,440lbs) \n\nNext week I am finally hitting the gym (our job gives us twice a year a specific \"bonus\" to an app where we can pay for gym/massages/etc, getting it in two days, will instantly pay gym for the next 6 months) that I have missed to much. \n\nI miss being strong. I WILL become strong!! Plan is to keep the kcal how it is for a little bit longer before I drop -100kcal - as 2300kcal is still clearly enough to make changes\n\nEDIT: also I CAN'T wait to start rebuilding my back/lats/arms",

            "I like to, whenever I get to failure on a certain exercise, grab the weight below it and do it until failure again and then rest for the set. Is that beneficial or am I not supposed to do that? I don't do on my leg day though as that would be quite the hassle l",
            "I feel pretty tired and just sooo unmotivated today. You guys think itd be worth it going to the gym anyway but taking it easy, eg lower weights and reps?",

            "Thats awesome! Nothing wrong with taking it easy, but the same thing happens to me often  even if Im not feeling like it, maybe I surprise myself once I get started. And either way, I feel good afterward, for getting some activity, and strengthening the habit!",
            "Glad you went! I was feeling the same way this morning, went anyway, and actually had a good workout",
            "Should I try to be sore after a workout?\n\nNewish to lifting and if I keep my weight/reps challenging but not THAT challenging I may get a little shakey at the end of my set, feel tired after my workout, and usually a twinge of soreness the next day. I can control my form perfectly and dont worry about actual failure during the movements. Im using maybe 50-80% of my strength for most of the reps. \n\n\nIf I bump up the weight it is more of a struggle/something I have to focus on more to keep my form. I may actually fail towards the end of my sets. I have to really use 85-95% of my strength to move the weight. Afterwards my muscles are like shakey jello and the next day Im crazy sore.\n\n\nWhich of these approaches sounds right? Am I still going to make progress lifting a little lower? Do I need to push that hard and be that sore to see much progress? Thanks!",
            "Those are called dropsets! They have pros and cons: straight sets whereby you rest and then pick up the same weight again are probably more effective and less fatiguing. However, if youre short on time and your volume is lower, dropsets are a useful intensifier to help you squeeze in more effective reps (reps close to failure) in less time (but they are more fatiguing to your body). It sounds like youre doing a mixture of both? If so, I wouldnt personally recommend that in most cases- youre going to accrue a lot of fatigue; and accumulated fatigue can cause injury down the line. \n\nIf youre doing: \n- a low volume program (and so using a more fatiguing intensifier isnt as likely to be an issue) \n- you like to be done quickly in the gym \n- you dont mind about absolutely maximising muscle gain (straight sets would be better for this)\n\nThen dropsets are a good choice; but its really best to stick to a program written by a knowledgeable professional as written, as they will manage your volume, effort and fatigue management for you.",
