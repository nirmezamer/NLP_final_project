Usually single arm/leg exercises are more challenging for balance, core strength, co-ordination and all that good stuff. Plus they're usually suggested for muscle imbalances which is what you seem to experience. \n\nI would always recommend compounds for exercises to do for overall strength and development but if you enjoy your routine and are happy with what you get out of it then I don't see why there'd be any issues",
