            "I've come to dislike how easy it is to disengage/run away in Smash and I think it's really the biggest weakness of Smash as a competitive game.\n\nIn pretty much every traditional fighting game, you move faster towards your opponent than you can move away from them (different forwards/backwards walk speed, dashing forwards goes much further than backdashing) and that forces interactions. Even if said interaction is \"I have to actively zone to keep my opponent away\", that typically carries more risk than playing keepaway in a game that isn't really designed to prevent disengaging.\n\nAnd top players might be able to capitalise on taking space, but honestly before top level it feels very easy to play extremely defensively and take back the space if your opponent isn't 100% airtight with a well timed roll through your opponent, or jump back to top plat, etc. Even for top players there is a reason Sonic is top tier and that's because spin dash makes it easy to swap sides (by being + on shield) so you can keep playing defensively forever.\n\nIt's fundamentally tied to the core concepts of Smash too, so I really don't see how you can solve that easily. Of course you can point to Melee and say \"well see if you make offense as strong as in Melee players will play offensively\" but that ship has long sailed and also even in Melee Puff is a thing.",
