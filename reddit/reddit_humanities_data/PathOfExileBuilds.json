            "Played cws dd for the past couple leagues. Still never sure how the interaction with desecrate and DD work.\n\nDo I need to find specific corpses before I enter maps? Do I have to hope kitavas herald gets blown up for a huge ignite?\n\nI'm a fulcrum chieftain for context",
            "About graveyard crafting: Do haunted mods work differently in terms of weighting? \n\nI tried doing a craft trying to fracture 2 \"normal\" prefixes and a haunted suffix (pure armour body with 2 armour prefixes and reduced crit damage taken), so I treated it like other crafts and put a -1 explicit, 300% to fracture, increased crit+defense and reduced other ones. \n\nCraft of Exile showed a 22% chance (it's more like 60% if I didn't care about which armour prefixes I got) of success and I did a 4 item craft. I got 3 items with triple armour prefixes and one with a mana haunted suffix.\n\nAm I just unlucky or there's something extra here? Yes, I had the correct ilvl and, yes, I had a haunted mod corpse.",
            "Desecrate summons corpses from the zone you're in and from your spectre pool (previous spectres you had). Monsters have a specific multiplier for spectre life, so you want to create a spectre pool with monster that have the greatest multipliers (like kitava's herald with 300%). Some T17 monsters have even greater multipliers (300% was the maximum for \"vanilla\" monsters until 3.24). Also, the bigger you spectre pool gets, the higher the chance of a corpse coming from there.\n\nYes, you are effectively hoping for a Kitava's Herald or some other big corpse to blow up but that's not uncommon if you're constantly using desecrate (e.g.: with CWS).",
            "As far as I'm aware, craft of exile has never accurately represented how tier restrictions cause weight to be shifted to the remaining tiers and I don't think the degree of weight shifting was ever fully worked out.\n\nSince haunted mods don't have tiers, I would expect their likelihood to be lower than what COE shows, since all of the non-haunted mods will have higher actual weights.\n\nIt also doesn't sound like your result was outside normal deviation.",
            "Understood so far so good. I've raise spectre on kitavas herald. A couple of those cage monsters on the tower part in act 6 and some monsters that were recommended in delve. I think the total I've raised was about 6 or 7. Should I raise 3 more from high health corpses to fill my desecrate pool to result in more consistent big ignites? And what are those? I can't seem to find a good list.\n\nEdit: changed level to health.",
            "The multiplier for Kitava's Herald is 360%, not that that detail is particularly relevant.\u00a0\n\n\nSome league specific monsters occasionally exceed that, and this league we have T17 specific monsters that intentionally exceed it.\n\n\nThere's a base chance of 15% to create a corpse of one of your saved spectres, but their corpses also get added to the pool of available corpses in the area with an even weighting, resulting in a higher chance to get a high HP spectre the more different types you've saved.\n\n\n/u/HeyChrisPena you could check out the CoC DD guides for this league, they should contain detailed instructions. IIRC the maximum is 11 spectres? Anyway, it's not as critical for ignite, since you only need to hit one high HP corpse, but the more you have, the greater your chance of hitting one earlier."

This is series now has a LOT of videos and is an amazing resource.\n\n[Path of Exile Build Archive](https://pobarchives.com/) - This site grabs PoBs from all over and compiles them together in a way that makes searching for builds very easy!\n\n/r/CorePathofExile - if you're looking for a more general place to talk about PoE outside of the main sub\n\n---\n\n---\n\n---\n\n# NOTE: A lot of these builds are 3.23/3.22 Builds. They may still be viable as some have been been left largely untouched. Just ignore anything that mentions leagues other than Necropolis. There may have been some changes with transfigured gems for these builds as well so make sure to check out the descriptions and pinned comments.\n\n# NOTE 2: This leagues mechanic is ***unskippable*** this means you will need to interact with it and it will be empowering enemies. Please pick your league starters carefully.\n\n---\n---\n---\n\n# Part 1: Top League Start Suggestions\n\nWe suggest these builds to players who want a good solid build, **new players** who want a build that will help carry them through content and for players looking for reliable league starters.\n\n**Please note** this index is sorted by skill alphabetically not by quality or power level.\n\n\n---\n\n## Detonate Dead\n\n**Build Description:** Detonate Dead (DD) is a spell that explodes a corpse dealing damage around it causing you to ignite enemies and proliferate that through packs for clearing. Since DD scales off corpse life it scales incredibly well simply by progressing in the game. This is a two button play style, so for those who want to press 1 attack this may not be the build for you. Though those that enjoy it you will be rewarded with an well rounded beast of a build that will take you through all content in the game. \n\n**Builds:**\n\n- [Tripolar Bear's Detonate Dead Elementalist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTltqILb790)\n- [Zizaran x ImExile's Detonate Dead Necromancer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdzzesMof4Y)\n\n---\n\n## Explosive Arrow\n\n**Build Description:** This build is a totem build with excellent DPS, an easy gear curve and great damage. Because this build is a totem build it\u2019s great for players who find boss mechanics difficult as, like minions, it does damage without you having to be constantly targeting the boss - simply place the totems down and dodge. This build is excellent in both trade and SSF with the primary weapon for this build is a multimod weapon that uses a base that you can farm ([Porcupine](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/The_Porcupine)) and is crafted with essences. This build does have two delays in its damage, there is a wait time as totems \u201carm\u201d themselves and a delay before the arrows explode.\n\n**Builds:**\n\n- [Palsteron's EA Elementalist](https://maxroll.gg/poe/build-guides/explosive-arrow-ballista-elementalist)\n- [Zizaran's EA Champion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7i4sJYUpU80) - The Champion version is a fair bit tankier than the Elementalist but has less damage, still plenty to do most content with little investment.\n- [SORO's EA Ignite Elementalist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXtvAleioLE)\n\n---\n\n## Explosive Trap\n\n**Build Description:** Explosive trap is a spell that throws a trap to create multiple explosions when triggered, it deals physical damage which is then converted into fire damage. This skill has *amazing* single target damage on poor to average gear meaning it will carry you through the early bosses with ease. This is a trap skill which means there is a delay between you throwing out the trap and it triggering, this is a playstyle you'll need to try out to see what you think of it. The upside to this though is that you can preload bosses, meaning you can throw a whole bunch of traps on bosses before the fight begins meaning they start combat with a chunk of their HP missing immediately. \n\n**Builds:**\n\n- [FealessDumb0's Explosive Trap Trickster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwRrcfcJSKI)\n\n- [Peuget2's Explosive Trap Trickerster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1KogiGjmEs)\n\n- [Zizaran's Explosive Trap Trickster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqtAFfLVnn8)\n\n- [Palsteron's Explosive Trap of Shrapnel Inquisitor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMQ1eW_dNVU)\n\n- [lifewithoutpants Explosive Trap Trickster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snuOLNEVQIw)\n\n---\n\n## Lightning Arrow\n\n**Build Description:** Lightning arrow (primarily with the Deadeye ascendency) is a bow skill that fires an arrow which causes enemies to be struck with a bolt of lightning, this can also hit other nearby enemies. This is a fast, active playstyle build that uses lightning arrow which has a very high clear speed to blast through maps. This skill is often paired with other skills to boost the single target. This build can feel a little squishy to play and requires a bit more positional play but in exchange provides a fun and fast playing experience.\n\n**Builds:**\n\n- [Crouching Tuna's Lightning Arrow Deadeye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zts3up1Kl6U)\n- [Fubgun's Lightning Arrow Deadeye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLzSRZyhN_M)\n- [Zizaran x Havoc's Lightning Arrow Deadeye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNK3YyJmkc)\n\n---\n\n## Toxic Rain\n\n**Build Description:** Toxic Rain is a skill where you fire a large number of arrows into the air which when they land create pools of toxic ground which deals chaos damage over time in the area. This skill, much like Explosive Arrow, is relatively straight forward to gear for with the craft for the primary weapon being very deterministic. This build is a great all rounder that will take you far.\n\n**Builds:**\n\n- [Peuget2's Toxic Rain Pathfinder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7cRYWvwxLY) - 3.24\n- [Palsteron's Toxic Rain Ballista Pathfinder](https://maxroll.gg/poe/build-guides/toxic-rain-ballista-pathfinder)\n- [Fezz's Toxic Rain Champion](https://poe-beginner-guide.com/) \n\n---\n\n---\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n# Part 2: Other League Starters\n\n**Warning:** Unlike the above section there are almost no requirements for builds to make this section, the builds listed here are not necessarily better/worse than the above but the restrictions based on ability to do certain end game content and ssf viability are not enforced in this section. **If you're a new player, we primarily recommend the above builds** but if you're more experienced we show these builds to add to the variety available. **Note: This leagues content is unskippable, please pick your league starters carefully.**\n\n### Absolution\n- [Ronarray's Absolution Guardian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDlPkLObgg4)\n\n### Archmage\n*Note: Getting it's own section in addition to builds going in their own skill sections to help searching.*\n\n- [Palsteron's Archmage Ball Lightning Hierophant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRzgay9ekqo)\n- [Conner Converse/onemanaleft Archmage Mjolner + Early Build](https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExileBuilds/comments/1bne3aj/mjolner_archmage_324_and_early_build_guide/)\n- [Zizaran x Goratha's \\(ArchMage\\) Ice Nova \\(of Frostbolts\\) Hierophant](https://youtu.be/9lZmy1RmOZ4?si=QxM2FHTVI37c5bR4)\n- [u/whitw0rth123's Archmage Ball Lightning Heirophant](https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExileBuilds/comments/1bldhmh/very_tanky_heirophant_going_archmage_ball/)\n\n### Armageddon Brand\n- [Jungroan's Automation Armageddon Brand Saboteur](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJEncb6tY)\n\n### Ball Lightning\n- [u/whitw0rth123's Archmage Ball Lightning Heirophant](https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExileBuilds/comments/1bldhmh/very_tanky_heirophant_going_archmage_ball/)\n\n### Blade Vortex\n- [Lolcohol's Poison Blade Vortex Pathfinder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUHcmqrrWsc)\n\n### Blink Arrow / Mirror Arrow\n\n- [D3adful Blink Arrow / Mirror Arrow Necromancer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-9wqIYXleU)\n\n### Cleave\n- [Woolie's Rage Cleave Berserker and Slayer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hQjqATpsbk)\n- [Ronarray's Rage Cleave Berserker](https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExileBuilds/comments/1bnq2yd/my_in_depth_cleave_berserker_league_starter_guide/)\n\n### Cremation\n- [Jungroan's Consuming Dark Cremation Pathfinder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zWjhDH_A8)\n\n### Corrupting Fever\n- [Tripolar Bear's Corrupting Fever Champion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrj42Kr3mBc)\n\n### Detonate Dead \n*Cast on Crit, doesn't feel quite right putting a CoC build in the beginner section*\n\n- [Rue x Ventrua's CoC Detonate Dead Inquisitor](https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExileBuilds/comments/1bodv0w/ventrua_1button_coc_dd_inquisitor_w_ruetoo_324/)\n\n### Elemental Hit\n- [SnooBAE85's Reverse Chill Elemental Hit Deadeye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbe8cYoTqVI)\n\n### Exsanguinate \n- [Crouching Tuna's Exsanguinate Mines Trickster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTTixqnBUyc)\n\n### Frost Blades\n- [Zish's Frost Blade Trickster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i0UaKkpuoE)\n\n### Frostblink\n- [Subtractem Forstblink Ignite Elementalist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb2PHGOuq3U)\n\n### Hexblast Mines\n- [Palsteron's Hexblast Mines Saboteur](https://maxroll.gg/poe/build-guides/hexblast-mines-saboteur-league-starter)\n- [Ventrua's Hexblast Trickstet -

I've seen recommendations for just rolling both with glyphic fossils and also essence rolling the burning damage then locking suffixes and either exalting or harvest reforging influenced. However, I haven't really found a consensus on which of these methods (or some other method) would be optimal.

            "I think your best bet is getting burning damage + essence first so your suffixes are done. Then lock suffixes and reforge influence with Harvest. That's roughly 1 in 5 chance of succes.",
            "Yes, but I'm currently trying to go past where the guide stops. Pohx is great but he only goes up to 2 link affixes (horror + burning/conc), saying \"You only need 2 of the 3 Modifiers to have a very good helm. Acquiring 3 is very unrealistic for newer players\". From what I've seen it's the same in his videos, and his build in those has horror+burning. My current helmet already has two link affixes (burning+conc) and I need all three for an upgrade, which adds an extra step at the end to roll conc. That extra step is what I'm asking about. Thanks anyways, Pohx has been a great resource so far!",
            "Absolutely agree that AoE is great, but I'm running level 5 awakened AoE in the sockets. That gives an extra +5% AoE relative to Shaper AoE and -30% from Conc for a net -25% AoE. In terms of damage, Awakened AoE gives +14% more and Conc gives +39% more (at level 20), totalling +53% more. If I were to swap to Shaper AoE I'd presumably run less duration in the socket, which gives 20% more (level 21), so going Conc gives +33% more. POB says that totals to -7,5% Full DPS and -27,5% RF DPS with 3.9m radius for Shaper AoE versus 3.2m for Conc. Personally, I find that my current radius is enough for my purposes, but thanks for the advice anyways, it's a lot easier for me to evaluate the option now that I've calculated it."

            "I realize the weapon used in this build is a rare craft and difficult to replicate. Here are two methods to craft easier versions:\n\nMethod One:\n\nStep 1: Grab two staves: one Shaper base and one Elder base. Ensure one has an experimental base with +1 to maximum Endurance and Power Charge implicit.\n\nStep 2: Roll \"Endurance Charge on Melee Stun Support\" on the Elder base and \"+1 to Maximum Endurance Charges\" on the Shaper base.\n\nStep 3: Use an Awakener's Orb to combine them.\n\nStep 4: Annul all modifiers except \"Endurance Charge on Melee Stun\" and \"+1 to Maximum Endurance Charges.\"\n\nStep 5: Craft \"Suffixes Cannot Be Changed\" or \"Prefixes Cannot Be Changed\" and use a Veiled Orb, hoping for a suffix modifier.\n\nStep 6: Unveil either \"Critical Strike Chance\" or \"Increased Attack Speed.\" If you unveil crit, craft attack speed; if you unveil attack speed, craft crit chance.\n\nMethod Two:\n\nThis method requires one of the mods to be fractured: either \"Endurance Charge on Melee Stun Support\" or \"+1 to Maximum Endurance Charges.\"\n\nStep 1: Follow Steps 1 and 2 from Method One.\n\nStep 2: Use Deafening Essence of Zeal until you roll either \"Endurance Charge on Melee Stun\" or \"+1 to Maximum Endurance Charges,\" depending on which one is fractured.\n\nStep 3: Craft \"Prefixes Cannot Be Changed\" or \"Suffixes Cannot Be Changed,\" based on the fractured mod.\n\nStep 4: Use a Veiled Orb and hope for a suffix, then unveil for crit chance.\n\nStep 5: Craft \"8% Quality to Socketed Gems\" and use a Harvest enchant for attack speed.",

Melee is already very hard to scale and something like vigilant strike is pinnacle of most ignored skills of poe. How do you expect to make it work without investing alot ?\n\nPlus i dont expect anyone to take this seriously anyways. and if anyone can create anything with that much investment i wonder why no one created something even close to this yet huh?",
