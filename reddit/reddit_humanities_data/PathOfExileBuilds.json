This is series now has a LOT of videos and is an amazing resource.\n\n[Path of Exile Build Archive](https://pobarchives.com/) - This site grabs PoBs from all over and compiles them together in a way that makes searching for builds very easy!\n\n/r/CorePathofExile - if you're looking for a more general place to talk about PoE outside of the main sub\n\n---\n\n---\n\n---\n\n# NOTE: A lot of these builds are 3.23/3.22 Builds. They may still be viable as some have been been left largely untouched. Just ignore anything that mentions leagues other than Necropolis. There may have been some changes with transfigured gems for these builds as well so make sure to check out the descriptions and pinned comments.\n\n# NOTE 2: This leagues mechanic is ***unskippable*** this means you will need to interact with it and it will be empowering enemies. Please pick your league starters carefully.\n\n---\n---\n---\n\n# Part 1: Top League Start Suggestions\n\nWe suggest these builds to players who want a good solid build, **new players** who want a build that will help carry them through content and for players looking for reliable league starters.\n\n**Please note** this index is sorted by skill alphabetically not by quality or power level.\n\n\n---\n\n## Detonate Dead\n\n**Build Description:** Detonate Dead (DD) is a spell that explodes a corpse dealing damage around it causing you to ignite enemies and proliferate that through packs for clearing. Since DD scales off corpse life it scales incredibly well simply by progressing in the game. This is a two button play style, so for those who want to press 1 attack this may not be the build for you. Though those that enjoy it you will be rewarded with an well rounded beast of a build that will take you through all content in the game. \n\n**Builds:**\n\n- [Tripolar Bear's Detonate Dead Elementalist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTltqILb790)\n- [Zizaran x ImExile's Detonate Dead Necromancer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdzzesMof4Y)\n\n---\n\n## Explosive Arrow\n\n**Build Description:** This build is a totem build with excellent DPS, an easy gear curve and great damage. Because this build is a totem build it\u2019s great for players who find boss mechanics difficult as, like minions, it does damage without you having to be constantly targeting the boss - simply place the totems down and dodge. This build is excellent in both trade and SSF with the primary weapon for this build is a multimod weapon that uses a base that you can farm ([Porcupine](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/The_Porcupine)) and is crafted with essences. This build does have two delays in its damage, there is a wait time as totems \u201carm\u201d themselves and a delay before the arrows explode.\n\n**Builds:**\n\n- [Palsteron's EA Elementalist](https://maxroll.gg/poe/build-guides/explosive-arrow-ballista-elementalist)\n- [Zizaran's EA Champion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7i4sJYUpU80) - The Champion version is a fair bit tankier than the Elementalist but has less damage, still plenty to do most content with little investment.\n- [SORO's EA Ignite Elementalist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXtvAleioLE)\n\n---\n\n## Explosive Trap\n\n**Build Description:** Explosive trap is a spell that throws a trap to create multiple explosions when triggered, it deals physical damage which is then converted into fire damage. This skill has *amazing* single target damage on poor to average gear meaning it will carry you through the early bosses with ease. This is a trap skill which means there is a delay between you throwing out the trap and it triggering, this is a playstyle you'll need to try out to see what you think of it. The upside to this though is that you can preload bosses, meaning you can throw a whole bunch of traps on bosses before the fight begins meaning they start combat with a chunk of their HP missing immediately. \n\n**Builds:**\n\n- [FealessDumb0's Explosive Trap Trickster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwRrcfcJSKI)\n\n- [Peuget2's Explosive Trap Trickerster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1KogiGjmEs)\n\n- [Zizaran's Explosive Trap Trickster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqtAFfLVnn8)\n\n- [Palsteron's Explosive Trap of Shrapnel Inquisitor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMQ1eW_dNVU)\n\n- [lifewithoutpants Explosive Trap Trickster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snuOLNEVQIw)\n\n---\n\n## Lightning Arrow\n\n**Build Description:** Lightning arrow (primarily with the Deadeye ascendency) is a bow skill that fires an arrow which causes enemies to be struck with a bolt of lightning, this can also hit other nearby enemies. This is a fast, active playstyle build that uses lightning arrow which has a very high clear speed to blast through maps. This skill is often paired with other skills to boost the single target. This build can feel a little squishy to play and requires a bit more positional play but in exchange provides a fun and fast playing experience.\n\n**Builds:**\n\n- [Crouching Tuna's Lightning Arrow Deadeye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zts3up1Kl6U)\n- [Fubgun's Lightning Arrow Deadeye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLzSRZyhN_M)\n- [Zizaran x Havoc's Lightning Arrow Deadeye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNK3YyJmkc)\n\n---\n\n## Toxic Rain\n\n**Build Description:** Toxic Rain is a skill where you fire a large number of arrows into the air which when they land create pools of toxic ground which deals chaos damage over time in the area. This skill, much like Explosive Arrow, is relatively straight forward to gear for with the craft for the primary weapon being very deterministic. This build is a great all rounder that will take you far.\n\n**Builds:**\n\n- [Peuget2's Toxic Rain Pathfinder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7cRYWvwxLY) - 3.24\n- [Palsteron's Toxic Rain Ballista Pathfinder](https://maxroll.gg/poe/build-guides/toxic-rain-ballista-pathfinder)\n- [Fezz's Toxic Rain Champion](https://poe-beginner-guide.com/) \n\n---\n\n---\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n# Part 2: Other League Starters\n\n**Warning:** Unlike the above section there are almost no requirements for builds to make this section, the builds listed here are not necessarily better/worse than the above but the restrictions based on ability to do certain end game content and ssf viability are not enforced in this section. **If you're a new player, we primarily recommend the above builds** but if you're more experienced we show these builds to add to the variety available. **Note: This leagues content is unskippable, please pick your league starters carefully.**\n\n### Absolution\n- [Ronarray's Absolution Guardian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDlPkLObgg4)\n\n### Archmage\n*Note: Getting it's own section in addition to builds going in their own skill sections to help searching.*\n\n- [Palsteron's Archmage Ball Lightning Hierophant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRzgay9ekqo)\n- [Conner Converse/onemanaleft Archmage Mjolner + Early Build](https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExileBuilds/comments/1bne3aj/mjolner_archmage_324_and_early_build_guide/)\n- [Zizaran x Goratha's \\(ArchMage\\) Ice Nova \\(of Frostbolts\\) Hierophant](https://youtu.be/9lZmy1RmOZ4?si=QxM2FHTVI37c5bR4)\n- [u/whitw0rth123's Archmage Ball Lightning Heirophant](https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExileBuilds/comments/1bldhmh/very_tanky_heirophant_going_archmage_ball/)\n\n### Armageddon Brand\n- [Jungroan's Automation Armageddon Brand Saboteur](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNXJEncb6tY)\n\n### Ball Lightning\n- [u/whitw0rth123's Archmage Ball Lightning Heirophant](https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExileBuilds/comments/1bldhmh/very_tanky_heirophant_going_archmage_ball/)\n\n### Blade Vortex\n- [Lolcohol's Poison Blade Vortex Pathfinder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUHcmqrrWsc)\n\n### Blink Arrow / Mirror Arrow\n\n- [D3adful Blink Arrow / Mirror Arrow Necromancer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-9wqIYXleU)\n\n### Cleave\n- [Woolie's Rage Cleave Berserker and Slayer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hQjqATpsbk)\n- [Ronarray's Rage Cleave Berserker](https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExileBuilds/comments/1bnq2yd/my_in_depth_cleave_berserker_league_starter_guide/)\n\n### Cremation\n- [Jungroan's Consuming Dark Cremation Pathfinder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7zWjhDH_A8)\n\n### Corrupting Fever\n- [Tripolar Bear's Corrupting Fever Champion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrj42Kr3mBc)\n\n### Detonate Dead \n*Cast on Crit, doesn't feel quite right putting a CoC build in the beginner section*\n\n- [Rue x Ventrua's CoC Detonate Dead Inquisitor](https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExileBuilds/comments/1bodv0w/ventrua_1button_coc_dd_inquisitor_w_ruetoo_324/)\n\n### Elemental Hit\n- [SnooBAE85's Reverse Chill Elemental Hit Deadeye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbe8cYoTqVI)\n\n### Exsanguinate \n- [Crouching Tuna's Exsanguinate Mines Trickster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTTixqnBUyc)\n\n### Frost Blades\n- [Zish's Frost Blade Trickster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i0UaKkpuoE)\n\n### Frostblink\n- [Subtractem Forstblink Ignite Elementalist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb2PHGOuq3U)\n\n### Hexblast Mines\n- [Palsteron's Hexblast Mines Saboteur](https://maxroll.gg/poe/build-guides/hexblast-mines-saboteur-league-starter)\n- [Ventrua's Hexblast Trickstet -
