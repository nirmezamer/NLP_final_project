        "content": "Dear r/NonPoliticalTwitter,\n\nFor those of you who\u2019ve never interacted with me, I am u/Aspect-Infinity. I\u2019ve been a member of the r/NonPoliticalTwitter moderator team for almost a year now. The opportunity to address you all for the first time on behalf of our team is a humbling honor. \n\nI want to talk to you about some very valid questions that have arisen throughout my tenure here regarding our rules and how we enforce them. I\u2019ve taken note of as many of these questions and concerns as possible so could escalate them to the rest of the team for discussion. This announcement is the result of that discussion and I\u2019m glad to issue some much-needed clarification on what we consider political content, what we consider inciting political discussion, and how we\u2019ve taken steps to address it. \n\nThis is gonna be a long thread so I encourage you to grab a snack while I go over this rule-by-rule. Let\u2019s begin!\n\n**\u201c 1. No Politics or Political Discussions/Commentary. - That's the point of the subreddit\u201d**\n\nThe most important and sacred rule we hold dear as a community. It\u2019s a reflection of why this subreddit was created in the first place, to create a space similar to Twitter where public discussion can flourish, without the toxicity of politics. One of the questions that has arisen is \u201cWhat do you consider political content/commentary?\u201d, and so, we\u2019re providing an answer to that.\n\n**We define political content as anything that has the potential to ignite political discussion, commentary, or discourse**. This potential is taken into consideration when we believe the content in question can be intentionally viewed through a political lens. \n\nLet's break it down further. We consider political commentary to refer to comments that try to insert a political angle where none existed before, or that shift the focus towards a political interpretation. We consider posts, comments, and even usernames as \"content\" within our subreddit. \n\n**Directly/Indirectly referencing political figures, policies, or movements:** \n\n* A tweet comparing two political candidates with derogatory and inflammatory labels\n* A post expressing strong opinions on a specific government policy and calling for action.\n* A comment on a non-political post that attempts to connect it to a political event or movement, regardless of relevance. \n* Posting a tweet sharing news articles about political events with clear commentary promoting a specific viewpoint.\n\n**Posts or comments encouraging debate or argument on political topics:** \n\n* A post asking users to choose sides on a contentious political issue.\n* A comment starting a debate about the merits of a political ideology.\n* Sharing controversial political cartoons or infographics designed to elicit strong reactions. \n* Encouraging users to vote for a specific candidate or party.\n\nStill confused? That\u2019s alright we have some examples! \n\n**Example A: (Non-Political Content)**\n\nA post containing a tweet memeing a celebrity known for their political views doing something funny. The humor focuses on the action, not their political stance. \n\n**Example B: (Political Content)**\n\nA Redditor makes a post with a tweet that features a masculine, caucasian man with a MAGA hat and a shotgun with the caption \u201cThis guy isn\u2019t playing with those liberals\u201d. This would be taken down because its primary focus is political (particularly the Second Amendment). \n\n\\--- \n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that we don\u2019t consider tweets focusing on sexuality, gender/gender identity/gender presentation, religion, or nationality inherently political. Although, should a subtext be present that is political we will take action. \n\nWe hope this clears up our stance and intention behind setting these rules in place, we encourage anyone with any questions to comment below, and we will respond. \n\nHappy New Year to you all!!\n\nYours,\n\nThe r/NonPoliticalTwitter Moderator Team",

            "Me again - Just wanted to remind everyone that I and possibly other moderators will be responding to questions or concerns here.  We ask that you remain respectful towards us and your fellow Redditors.",
            "One of my favorite subs bc yall don\u2019t allow political shenanigans in it. And yall do great!",
            "I gotta tell you, this is definitely one of my favorite subs. Absolutely love the job you guys are doing. Thank you. \n\nThis is where I go when I need a laugh. I am constantly sharing content with family, friends and others. I always seem to find something that picks me up. You have made some dark times better.",
            "This. I mod a small sub, r/Eevee to be exact. Just recently, mods decided to, and I quote from another moderator and a user on the sub, enforce \u201cmartial law\u201d >!not political lmao!< in order to get posts back in check. We were too nice about the NSFW rule and it caused a lot of trouble, though the full story doesn\u2019t matter here (if you care enough feel free to ask I guess lol, no offense otherwise).\n\nIt\u2019s what I imagine being a middle school teacher is like, people trying to cause trouble just for the sake of it. Sometimes, strict rules are just the best because if you give an inch, they won\u2019t take a mile they\u2019ll try to take the whole sub, and it\u2019ll ruin the fun for everyone. Hell, it\u2019ll ruin the sub for you because moderating posts from rogue users sucks. Ever since we banned a single person, everything has been easy, for mods and for users. Good job at the fight for keeping this an innocent safe space, even if some think it\u2019s strict! It\u2019s nice to have a place to hide from the world, yaknow? \n\n~ Eevee Mods",
            "I had one comment removed from here for being political.  I think it was super edge-case-y, but I do appreciate the hard-line approach because otherwise it's way too easy for that stuff to bleed through otherwise",
            "Ok cool\n\n![gif](giphy|MDJ9IbxxvDUQM)",
            "Just want to say that I really appreciate what the mods have done with this subreddit. I've seen so many subreddits ruined by political \"discussion.\" It just destroys the vibe, even when it's a political stance I agree with. It's nice to have a subreddit that's just here to have fun.",
            "> we don\u2019t consider tweets focusing on sexuality, gender/gender identity/gender presentation, religion, or nationality inherently political\n\n\nStrong disagree, if you're still taking input. Tweets focusing on those topics often involve people's socio-political views.",
            "I honestly have a ton of respect for the mod team on this sub.\n\nHonestly, it astounds me how many miserable redditors come to this sub and try their hardest to weasel around the rules and make the discussion political.\n\nI'm tired of mods who claim to be non-political and then also defend politically charged posts because \"this clearly isn't/shouldn't be political (and also I agree with it) so it stays up\"",
            "As you may guess from my post history, I actively like politics, but it's so refreshing to have a subreddit *with* genuinely funny stories, observations, and gags, and *without* uneccessary political commentary alongside it."
