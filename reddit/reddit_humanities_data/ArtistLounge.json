I have social media but I haven't posted in years. I'm in a band, so any original work I make for them is not entirely attributed to me, and doesn't draw attention. I have been able to hide behind the band for a long time, but it's not enough anymore and the band is breaking apart anyway.\n\nI want my art to be for me first and foremost, as a way to work things out, and also to track my growth/progress. But I also want to reach outwards, receive criticism and draw from my real life to write and make whatever I want. But online...? I mean my girlfriend is there, my sister, my MOTHER. Do I just start a private account and not tell anyone? Performing live would be impossible. I just want to be myself, but I don't want to know my audience personally. \n\n**Anybody else out there having this type of creative paralysis?

I put my art online openly but they don't see it because they don't look for it and i never mention it. especially if you use a pseudonym, you won't be recognized. Be yourself, don't feel obligated to tell them, it is completely ok to not reveal your identity online if it helps you circumvent your fear.",
            "Fear and notoriety is different for everybody, and they all experience it subjectively. Your reason for fear is different for mine. As an nsfw artist I'm expected to keep my art secret for many different reasons. My goal is to keep it away from minors. And although i don't *hide* it from then, i didn't advertise my stuff to those with conservative world views. \n\nNot trying to invalidate your reasons, but hopefully a different perspective will help you out.",
            "*may or may not help in regards to your question*\n\n\nHiding passion from your family or loved ones is pretty normal.\n\n\n\u00a0Another user asking the same type of question here was told it was likely because being judged by strangers hurts less then being judged by family.\n\n\nIn my own experience only one person in my family encourages me to draw & I mainly hide it from the rest because they think it's a waste of time/money to even bother.\n\n\nIn most cases I have found we are overreacting a bit out of not wanting unwarranted pressure to succeed or to look bad in front of them.\n\n\nFor things like writing it isn't uncommon for writers to publish under a pseudonym for anonymity so that could be a avenue you look into if you want to be recognized yet private from real life.\n\n\nI prefer keeping my accounts private from family so I would encourage the use of a account with no connection with your regular accounts if it does ease your anxiety.\n\n\nI will say I'd probably draw a lot more unhinged things if I didn't sometimes worry someone will decide to flip through my sketchbook,\u00a0\n\n\nSo while I don't change my art I do think hard if I'm going to draw anything embarrassing like nudity.\n\n\nMy best advice would be to embrace the potential embarrassment mentally prior to anything you put out there.\n\n\nThe biggest challenge is letting others judge your work without feeling hurt if it's seen unfavorably.",

That can feel like a box and it\u2019s uncomfortable for us and for them to see you outside of the box. It\u2019s ok to have social media accounts where certain people are blocked lol. But just be aware that if it comes up in conversation in front of them you may have some splaining to do.\n\nI knew a writer who quoted \u201cwrite as if your parents are dead.\u201d No idea where she got that from, but it applies.",
            "I'd suggest starting with a pseudonym or a \"character\" of sorts. I hear you about wanting to be yourself but via a pseudonym it's a lot easier to compartmentalise what parts of you and your art you want to be public and what you'd rather not. Going anonymous or varying degrees of anonymity isn't particularly uncommon in any creative field (Banksy is a very known example, and bands like Sleep Token and Daft Punk also come to mind just off the top of my head, and that's not even touching on the countless artists who run different pseudonyms for different work for many reasons).\n\nWhat I do creatively and some of the topics I cover are not a secret amongst my loved ones, and whilst (for example) i'd give my parents a heads up about something particularly vulgar, I also know that my family, friends and loved ones want to support what I do and i'm not going to stop them or hide from them (but not rub it in any faces either). They know my pseudonyms and can seek it out if they like, but no obligation to engage with it either if it isn't their thing. Of course everyone's situations are different and i'm also lucky to have chill family and friends too.\n\nI figure you're concerned about embarrassment or disapproval? If you don't mind me asking, is it more the content of your work or the level you're at? Or more of a general anxiety thing?\n\nEdit: spelling",
            "Hello, childhood trauma person here! I feel this 100%, I have stopped posting my art once (well meaning) family members joined insta, and I suspected they would show it to my mother. At this point insta stopped being a safe place for my pretty personal and therapeutic pieces. This is particularly sad, because I'm pretty open with friends and basically all folks except my immediate family.\n\nNeeding to hide and protect one's authentic self is also not only the case for an overly critical or unsupportive family, not at all! It still can be an unsafe environment, even if a family likes the art you make.\n\nYour feelings about this are 100% valid, and l encourage you to look for ways to show your art that feels safe. A pseudonym could be a good way, and maybe there are some friends that feel safe, too?\n\nAll the best <3",

Being a certain age isn't a standard of any sort, or a guarantee of anything, it's literally the passing of time. You can worry about a lot of  things when it comes to making art, like weather your portfolio will be good enough to win a job or get into school, which direction you want to take your art when you have multiple things you like, should you keep it a hobby or make it a career, do I want to get into a gallery, how do I take my art to the next level.

Each time I fail to achieve what I want to do though, the gap between my current skillset and the eventual success decreases.
