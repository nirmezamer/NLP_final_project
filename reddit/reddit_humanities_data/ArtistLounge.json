Please feel free to share - art-related or not. \n\nHow would you feel about a community discord sheet? One where everyone who has a discord can add, so those looking for discords can be redirected?

If it wasn't used, misused, or didn't work for some reason or another, then what would the new implementation look like?\n\nAs for what I've been up to outside of art and work, I've been preparing to install some chassis bracing on my car (we're a decent ways into track season!), taking some steps towards learning the Godot game engine, and I have been ramping up my fitness and gym activity. A diversity of experiences really helps one's creativity and artistic journey, in my opinion, so I aim to capitalize on it this summer.",

            "I\u2019m sorry that you went through this.\n\nBut yes unfortunately it\u2019s super common.\n\nIt\u2019s not just common online - it\u2019s common around you in real life as well. \n\nIf you do any kind of art people expect freebies. \n\nIf you are good at baking cakes or cookies friends \nand family will ask you to do that for free for them. If you are good at programming and know your way around pc people will ask for advice or want them to fix their devices for free.\n\nSo let this be a life lesson to value your time!\n\nno matter your skill and level. Only do projects that either pay you upfront at least half with a contract or you are absolutely okay to do it for free.\n\nBut don\u2019t sell yourself short. No ones time should be exploited. \nIf you do something as friendship favour ask yourself if that friend would do the same for you. Would that friend do whatever hobby they do for free for you.\nWould they give you their books for free because they are done reading? Would they come across the city to help you move for free?\n\nSome friend may be absolutely worth the effort because they already did countless of things for you. Bought you coffee or icecream just because they wanted to spend time with you and knew you were short on money. So sometimes if you want to make them a gift that\u2019s fine- but then expect that as soon as it leaves your hand they may resell it.  but if it\u2019s something they asked you to do - always put some kind of compensation and rules to it. \n\n\ni know we all fall into this trap because we believe they are better artists out there - and that\u2019s true they will always be better artist out there; but that doesn\u2019t mean your effort isn\u2019t worth appreciating. \n\nAfter all if it was easy why don\u2019t the people do it themselves? \n\nIt\u2019s still time, and recourses being used that cost you money and effort. And yeah, I hear you say : but I already have a tablet and the program and would use it anyway. But eventually it needs replacing, so it\u2019s not different from using traditional medium paint.\n\nAnd most importantly time has the most value here. Because time is something no matter how much you gain it will never come back to you. So don\u2019t waste your free time on things that don\u2019t feel good or rewarding after. \n\n\nI hope that helps :)\n\nGood luck on your journey onwards",

Each new artwork I produced feels super amateurish and doesn\u2019t feel like it should be at the level I\u2019m expecting myself to be.

            "Took a glance. To be frank and to not sugarcoat, you should go back to the foundations. Every aspect can be improved, from anatomy to poses to form construction to colors. Don\u2019t think of it as a step back, think of it as a potential huge step forward.",
            "go back to foundations and work from real life or decent reference.\u00a0",
            "Your art feels amateurish because you lack fundamentals. Instead of drawing from your imagination, draw items from real life. Chairs, food, the room you live in. Work to make your observational drawings as detailed as possible. You must train your eye to understand the nuances of physicality and reality before you can draw from your imagination.",
            "Strengthening base foundations pretty much ALWAYS helps if you go then return with those principles you practice in your art. Also are you drawing the same type of thing over and over? You might be kind of stuck in a rut and should try something new. Like, if you always draw people, work on architecture or animals or plants or something. Not that you will magically better at one of those things, but looking at different parts of the existing world and observing them and drawing them contributes to your overall skill and might also give you some new ideas or just lead you a different direction when you return to what you usually work on.",
            "Likely because it is. Anatomy would help a lot",
            "Not gonna sugarcoat it for you, your art looks like its amateurish because it is. I took a glance and saw you try to draw a bunch of very different topics from humans to monsters. My advice is to go back to the beginning, learn the fundamentals, do the boring stuff and then come back in all your artistic glory. I recommend scott robertsons how to draw book, you can look it up free on internet archive and its got  basically everything you re lacking atm. ( he made a sequel you can check out in a year or two as well). Best of luck!",

            "After glancing at your account, if you only focus on one thing to improve on - shadows and shading. The others are right, you should delve into basic fundamentals, which includes proper shading, but if you just want to focus one step at a time, that's what I would focus on first to easily see growth.",
            "Yup work on your foundations training, even manga artist- you can tell if they have had foundations training- you can just feel the sense of perspective, solid objects and believability in the poses and gestures. \n\nYes stylization is super fun. Art is about thinking- when you draw new things- and force yourself to draw say- complex things like a car why the part look this way to why things are solid or why all the lines converge.\n\nEven drawing a spoon in a glass of water- you have to notice the refraction of the light, the different thicknesses of glass- how objects distort behind the glass- through light science- these are advanced topics and knowledge you may not be there yet but just go out and have fun and study- them or whatever is most interesting to you- color, anatomy, perspective- gesture, mark making- form. \n\nArt is about thinking- when you are thinking about these new visual properties- believe me your drawings will change and get better reflecting your new found knowledge of the academic realism .",
