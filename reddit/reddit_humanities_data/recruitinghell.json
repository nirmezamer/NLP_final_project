I took this to my interview and they told me it was what pushed me over the edge in terms of my candidacy.\n\nI am *so* fucking excited. This is basically my dream career upgrade.

When I did ask, I often didn't make it to the next panel interview. So I stopped and reserved those questions for the deciding moment. \n\nMost job posts already cover the benefits, and you can do a salary search via Glassdoor to get an idea of the range of negotiating (higher end if you're in a metropolitan city, lower end if you're in a small town or more rural, somewhere in the middle if you'renot in a large city but have a ton of experience).",

            "It's probably different for your industry/area. I live in a geographically small but high COL area, and my skillset takes me to very small companies (10-20 employees) without much of an online presence. \n\nFor example, the company I just got hired with doesn't have a glassdoor presence at all. That means I pretty much need to know the entire pay and benefits breakdown up front before I even consider moving forward in the interview process, because they're the only ones who can give me that information.",
