            "When I did graphic design over 15 years ago I was looking for a steady job to keep everything afloat. I vaguely knew the owner of a big PC retailer and saw that he had an internship available for graphic design for pretty much every aspect of the business. I respected the company and was a customer up to that point and so I contacted the owner to see if he was up for switching the internship into a part time job. He seemed interested and put me in contact with the current person in charge of design. I've gotten the assignment to create a brand identity package for the website and social media, not a major overhaul but an upgrade of their work up to that point. It was to see if my skill was up to the task and after evaluation we'd follow up with terms and conditions. So I've put in a weeks worth, wanted to show my value as everything seemed trustworthy at that point. Ghosted for two weeks, did not even get a reply for my follow up email 4 days after delivery. After two weeks I got a message from the designer guy that they have revised their plans and won't go through with the job offering or any internship. A month later I see heavily inspired work done on the website that resembled my work. It wasn't an exact replica but you'd know if you'd seen what I've made for them. I contacted both again and only got a reply from the designer guy that it was a coincidence and in line with current trends and absolutely not based on what I've sent them. Felt a bit betrayed, but it was a battle not worth fighting. Lesson learnt.",

I also put an audio watermark in the presentation materials and a visual one in the presentation slides. \n\nI did not get an offer. But 2 months later, I did see the presentation at a trade conference. Watermarks and all.

Which might still be the case sometimes, but by no means all or even the majority.\n\nWhat a sensible employer would do would be to not boil experience down to a number of years and instead draw it from a CV and actually *gasp* talking to the candidate. In pure years I've got close to 15 years of experience in the industry. There will be truly gifted people with 5 who would be better options than me for most roles, just like there will be some with 30 who I'd be better than."

Recruiters are part of the jargon-generating machine! If they aren't familiar with the language used in an industry they should learn it, because they'll be expected to recognize it. \n\nThe complaint about math strikes me as similarly un-self-aware. If the recruiter and/or hiring company make that big a difference between 14 months and 36 months experience (the largest possible range in the example they give), they've removed the human factor from the equation. In my opinion, they should look deeper and see if the experience is relevant instead of just relying on a quantitative measure.",
