Aoi made one friend duringher childhood, but that friend was taken away from here after a misunderstanding, while Yusaku mostly kept to himself on purpose albeit he did have Kusanagi as an important figure in his life. I can't blame him for being the way he currently is, after all the Lost Incident was horrifying for everyone besides Specter.\n\nI'm honestly inclined to believe it was Aoi, she probably figured that she can fix him.",

            "Aoi, hands down.\n\nI admit that I'm a huge Vrains hater, but I legit do not think Yusaku really grows as a person throughout the show. He never actually heals from his trauma and his relationship with his friends is lukewarm at best. It's just Ai and Soulburner that attach themselves to Yusaku and he just accepts it. He never made the first move and since we never see them being friends and actually hang out we don't even see him send the first invite. So no, I think he's forever shy.\n\nAoi, on the other hand, we actively see her want to be a better person and understand the Lost Victims and even when she's getting shafted hard she doesn't give up and keeps wanting to help. It's because of that that I can see this translate into her real life where she wants to improve her self-confidence and be like Blue Angel where she can reach out to Yusaku and make the first move.",

I was going do the same thing with the rivals but I found the pic above and it gives me this idea. \n\nSo if hypothetically someone wants to play Yu-Gi-Oh card competitive with one of these archetypes who archetype it be and why? Yes rush duel characters are included. \nI asking for my reasons: \nOne I was curious about which rivals archetypes are competitively viable \nTwo: to between the protagonists and rivals which group have the better deck/archetypes for competitive Yu-Gi-Oh.\nThree: also thought it an fun question to ask. I someone who been off on with Yu-Gi-Oh since ARC V and barely an average player. I use anime decks of Jaden/judai and Yuma since I like both protagonists and series it a nice bonus learning those are the most competitively viable decks with the protags and i am basic like picking the main character in an game pretty much every time basic.

            "Varis bodies almost everyone on this list. Dragon Link is a long-standing competitive performer, as much as I dislike it. The closest one would arguably be Kaiba, even if only because Blue Eyes took Worlds.",
            "For me, RDA is my main deck, so Jack Atlas is definitely the best, IMO. But for second I'd have to go with Rokkets for how game warping Dragon-link became and how solid the strategy still is, even with all of its bans(could you imagine full power Dragon-link now holy).\nThird place would be Hero due to being such a fun fusion deck. Fourth would be Blue Eyes, because it's just a fun deck for beginners and casuals, sure you will be beaten plot by meta with this, but it's a great deck to start out the game with. Fifth would be Cyberse, due to the cracked staples of Linkuriboh, Pre-Errata firewall, and Accesscode Talker. Next would be Sychron, as while it doesn't have the consistency of RDA and the Resonators, it makes up for it with cracked as hell, near un breakable end boards thanks to Cosmic Quasar Dragon, Crimson Dragon, Barronne, Clear Wing, Accel Sychro Stardust and more. Next would be Utopia for how solid of an OTK strat. This is followed by Galaxy-Eyes, as with the new support, it makes it a lot better than it once was. After this are decks I have very little experience with, like any pendulum archetypes, Ojama, and Little Yugi's toy box deck. Then at last is Dark Magician. Why is it last? For the Master Duel DM wankers who play this. I am so sick of seeing Dark Magical Circle pick apart my entire field one card at a time when I have card effects set to Auto, so they were the bane of my early MD experience.",
            "Okay so for protag:\n\nYugi+ Atem is hard to take into account as their various sub archetypes seeing usage recently(millenium + toy) and magician souls is quite decent.\n\nHeroes is most cohensive strat if you also count the rival's edo phoenix destiny heroes card.\n\nSynchron I think is the weakest and also hard to take advantage of from its good synchro pool.The stardust synchro is good but really hard to summon and usually not worth the effort(until crimson dragon enabling easy access to lv12 accel synchro dragon).\n\nYuma only gives funny otk tools and s0.\nUtopia and the equip + otk gimmick is just okay,not as strong.\n\nPendulum is the strongest from the pend magician performapal and odd eyes card,the deck has strong easy to summon omni negate,ways to flood with advantage and looping potential with some of the pieces,and deck having easy time setting up hidden village lock.\n\nFirewall and cyberse deck is just okay,they can form decent board and easy otk but having to play too many brick and ending up using all the extra deck for link climb and no easy way to recur and recycle all the pieces unlike heroes(from their various gy effect) or pendulum(the mechanic ability to pendulum summon).\nFirewall and accesscode are ones of the most prominient link of the game\n\nFor rival:\nKaiba blue eyes is just bricky and what they do isn't impressive now and blue eyes does not give much generic cards to other strats.\n\nChazz,Kaiba Union has showing in the past and really strong support annoucement recently so the future is good.\n\nChazz LAD dragon sees heavy play in drulers format.\n\nRDA by Jack is quite strong as pure standard deck go but deck does not adapt its endboard well or having specific chokepoint on some cards.\n\nShark is good(mostly because toad is insane),some of the new shark card quite fine.\n\nKeito(galaxy eyes) does not have any efficient combo but his cards sees usage in other decks for endboard pieces(galaxy solider -> nova) and galaxy eyes dark matter dragon to combo.\n\nddd is strong near the end of pend era but the deck is archaic now as pend mechanic is nerfed and the mons it runs look like nerfed version of many modern cards.\n\nDragon link is really quite good with the generic light/dark dragon and many of the dragon mons in anime see plays in link era or even now because the effect on them are good and worth the mat(topologic,borrel card).",

            "Judai/Jaden, Yusei and probably Yuma close for the protags. Heroes need the support from non-hero cards to be truly successful but are always at events. Synchrons are just nuts, if you get your combos going it\u2019s GG. Yuma and his Utopia evolutions are pretty good also, not meta relevant or competitive but have some really high power when done right.\n\nVaris would be the best of the lot for the rivals. The strategy doesn\u2019t even compare to the rest of them, it\u2019s so much better. Synchro and Link boss monsters that would derail any other strategy, Borreload Dragon is insane both in design and application.",
            "well Yugi is the only choice; classic anime is good. Never seen the other generations neither I am interested in a series without yugi.",
            "I surprised that Synchrons placed high. My old post  people usually have placed synchrons middle of the road or a least third place behind heroes and utopia/onomatopoeia",
            "From worst to best (omitting Yuga and Luke) Protagonists:\n\n7: Yugi various toy related cards (weak and inconsistent)\n\n6: Yuya \u201cPerformapal\u201d (pendulums got nerfed HARD)\n\n5: Playmaker \u201cCyberse\u201d (firewall was also nerfed)\n\n4: Atem \u201cDark Magician\u201d (consistent but really low power ceiling)\n\n3: Judai \u201cHERO\u201d (really expensive + need lots of non-Judai HERO cards\n\n2: Yusei \u201cSynchrons\u201d\n\n1: Yuma \u201cUtopia/Number/Onomat\u201d \n\n1 & 2 are pretty interchangeable imo. I think Utopia has a higher ceiling but it also has less room for non engine.\n\nRivals are a lot harder to rank than protagonists because they are mostly weaker:\n\n7/6/5: Manjoume \u201cOjama\u201d is the definition of jank\n\n7/6/5: Reiji \u201cD/D(/D/D)\u201d MR3 pendulums are asinine\n\n7/6/5: Shark \u201cWater\u201d it\u2019s just random water attribute cards. The only good card in his deck is also a \u201cNumber\u201d monster\n\n4/3: Kaito \u201cGalaxy Eyes\u201d has some cool stuff but it\u2019s generally weak\n\n4/3: Varis \u201cRokkets\u201d not too sure about this archetype but they aren\u2019t relevant in this day and age. Putting it here cus I\u2019ve heard of it being decent in MR4\n\n2: Blue Eyes. Consistent and somewhat powerful. Still gets some play. Not enough to be relevant though.\n\n1: Atlas \u201cRed Dragon Archfiend\u201d Is the deck I\u2019m playing right now. It\u2019s really consistent, plays through interruptions if you\u2019re lucky. And has multiple board wipes and omnis that are easy to get turn one.\n\n\nIf you had to choose one of these archetypes to play, I\u2019d. Say that playing RDA would be best in the physical game (we just got a structure deck). Utopias are about the same price and just as strong, so you can also play that if you truly desire.",
