            "The panel of Goku saying he can rest easy knowing the earth will be safe once he's gone hit a lot harder than it should have",
            "easily my favorite chapter of the super manga so far",
            ">Bulma may lose interest if im gone too long.\n\nomg, hahaaa, dead.",
            "R.I.P Akira Toriyama. No other celebrity death has hit me this hard, i wish you were alive to see your creation Daima come to life.",
            "That final shot with the Son family ready to race and Piccolo waving back to the viewer? That made me immediately feel like it was a wave back to Toriyama.\n\nAnd there's no better array of characters to do so.",
            "I AM SO SO GLAD, it is Goku who noticed Broly and gave the advice.",
            "Such an amazing chapter, those last few made Mr feel kinda like a kid again, it really brought me back to the end of the Z series, when Toriyama said something like \"well this was it, hope you enjoyed, Goku's adventures haven't still came to an end but my telling of them did.\"\n\nFeelings hitting like a truck right now",
            "That little interaction between Pan and Goku was adorable",
            "I really think Toyotarou is really coming into his own. I absolutely LOVED the unconventional way he ended this chapter. The lack of dialogue led to some clever panelling, poses, and expressions that said so much without saying a word. Truly warmed my heart.",
            "I know this isn't the finale, but it certainly felt like a bitter sweet one. And Goku talking about being gone one day and officially passing on the mantle of Earth's guardianship to Gohan... God damn, what a send off to Toriyama-sensei!"

            "No Raditz so no saiyans, the Androids would have been weaker maybe Final form Frieza level, it's ridiculous how strong the androids were with just the datas of the saiyans (it makes no sense but anyway) but still far stronger than anything the Z fighters could handle at this point. Goku still dies of the heart virus, Gohan should remain the only Z fighter and if he achieves Ssj he should have been strong enough to deal with them (if he reaches future Gohan level anyway). Best case scenario, Namek would have been destroyed by Frieza because he didn't get his Dragon Balls. When Babidi arrives on earth, Dabra would have slaughtered any resistance left and Buu would have ended up killing Shin which would be the end of Beerus. \n\nZeno ends up destroying all the universes that participated in the ToP because nobody proposed a tournament. It's game over",
            "Depends which method of goku getting sent to earth is canon. If its frieza then eventually he'd show up to inspect his planet. If it's bardock desperate to save goku and launches him away then who knows",
            " I guess the android just kill everyone huh? Or would gero not have enough data since they didn't fight the saiyans?"

If Frieza wasn\u2019t screwing around he could\u2019ve easily killed Goku 10 times over long before he even went super saiyan. \n",
