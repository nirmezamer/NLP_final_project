            "That final shot with the Son family ready to race and Piccolo waving back to the viewer? That made me immediately feel like it was a wave back to Toriyama.\n\nAnd there's no better array of characters to do so.",
            "I AM SO SO GLAD, it is Goku who noticed Broly and gave the advice.",
            "Such an amazing chapter, those last few made Mr feel kinda like a kid again, it really brought me back to the end of the Z series, when Toriyama said something like \"well this was it, hope you enjoyed, Goku's adventures haven't still came to an end but my telling of them did.\"\n\nFeelings hitting like a truck right now",
            "That little interaction between Pan and Goku was adorable",
            "I really think Toyotarou is really coming into his own. I absolutely LOVED the unconventional way he ended this chapter. The lack of dialogue led to some clever panelling, poses, and expressions that said so much without saying a word.\u00a0 Truly warmed my heart.\u00a0\u00a0"

So subbed only shows have just one English track, which only for those who are deaf or hard of hearing.\n\n\nIf they go back and dub the show, they will remove the only sub track, meaning it would only be dubtitles via CC\n\n\nEdit, it launch with a dub and only English CC.
