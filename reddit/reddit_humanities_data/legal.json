My \"name\" is Swim and I've been a criminal\nAnd civil rights attorney in NY for over a decade! \n\nI've been asked to help moderate the sub and hopefully restore a little bit of the reliability and professionalism of this sub! In that spirit, I'm going to be adding and changing some rules (especially in regards to kindness and mutual respect which has been lacking and the absence of which will no longer be tolerated at all) in the sub, as well as adding a flair system for verification of actual attorneys who want to participate and/or answer questions.  I only ask for your patience as I get up to speed. \n\nPlease feel free to drop any questions/problems/concerns in this thread and provided they are asked in a civil and polite manner, I'll get back to you ASAP! \n\nPlease note that as ever, but especially in this context: I am a lawyer but I'm not YOUR lawyer.  Any opinions I express are my own personal opinions and not legal advice/opinions. Nothing I say or that is posted in this sub is legal advice and each and every topic discussed should be discussed with a professional attorney licensed in your jurisdiction. ",

        "content": "My first real reddit post I guess.\n\nSome context: My (23F) dad is historically known to transfer money from my account to his. I finally got a bank account around the time I turned 18 in 2019 and it was under his account, so he could easily do this. I didn't know anything about filing taxes at 18 either. I got my first job at a Wendy's and finally started making...and losing money.\n\nFast forward to tax time, 2020, my dad asks for my W-2s and for my ID to file me as a dependent with a tax preparer. I trusted him and handed over the documents. In hindsight, I didn't know this wasn't required for me to be filed as a dependent...\n\nFast forward to now, I'm finally filing taxes on my own and asked about my AGI for 2022. Knowing I personally didn't file, I selected the corresponding answer. I got an error telling me I DID file for 2022. I had to do a lot of digging and found I could get transcripts on the IRS site from 2020 up to 2022...This set off alarms in my head. All transcripts showed I received some form of refund each year. I didn't see any of this money in my checking account. I immediately suspected my dad.\n\nI got copies of those filed 1040 forms from 2019, 2020, and 2022. For some reason I forgot to ask for 2021 (oops). All of them did not have my checking account number listed. I emailed the tax preparation company and asked if they had written permission to file on my behalf. They told me permission was granted by me giving my W-2s, ID, and giving verbal confirmation (my dad would call me in the middle of my school day to ask permission for filing me as a dependent?).They also cited Publication 929, stating I could be filed by a parent.\n\nMy issue here though is:\n\na) I was under the impression I was being filed as a dependent, not independent by my dad. He constantly told me I was a dependent and guilted me when I tried to express independence at home\n\nb) I made more than $15k in 2019 (2020 1040), so to my understanding, I was NOT a dependent so Publication 929 does not apply?\n\nc) The money never touched my account...ever. Uhm tax fraud?!?\n\nd) Does me giving my dad the forms and my ID and the verbal approval count as \"permission\"? Even if I was under the impression it was for him to file me under his taxes? Or is this total BS?\n\nWanted to especially verify point b. Does it apply at all here in my situation? I continued to make more money in 2020 through now.\n\nIm not sure I want to take legal action...any advice here is appreciated. My relationship with my parents is strained because of this abuse and codependency I grew up with.\n\nTo ease minds:\n\nI did move out in January and created my own checking account late 2022 after a loan refund was taken from my account (the last straw). I see now what I grew up in wasn't normal or healthy at all. I'm very upset at my dad and haven't talked to him about it. I haven't responded to the tax preparer's email about them referencing Preparation 929 or pointed out to them that the checking account on the documents is not mine. Didn't want to show all my cards yet.\n\n**EDIT:** Thx for all the advice here! I have a LOT to think about concerning my next steps with my dad. Will give updates where I can, but ofc, I don't to monitor this thread too closely either and get stuck in here. My credit freeze warriors: I 100% hear you and will ice-it-up!",

I still remember her saying, \"This is a real shitty thing you're doing to your mom.\"\n\nMe:  \"Do you mean me accurately filing my taxes? Is that the shitty that I'm doing?

BUT they can not take your refund without your permission, that is tax fraud. \n\nI would start with talking to my parents and asking about the refunds. Have the transcripts with you as proof as they may try to gaslight you. Kindly ask for the money to be paid back.

The refund your dad is getting is tax you have overpaid to the government over the course of the year, plus the deduction he's getting by claiming you as a dependent. I'm not a tax attorney or a lawyer, but in your shoes I'd decrease my withholding by whatever legal amount I could. But you probably already moved out, and that's oddly easier than computing taxes in the US.",

And believe me, the IRS doesn't mess around. Just know that ahead of time that if you go this route, your relationship with your parents is done. Personally, I can't see how you could ever be in the same room with them going forward after finding this out.\n\nGood luck.",

        "content": "TLDR: Texas resident seeking advice on liability for someone\u2019s dog injuring ours in our fenced in backyard. Should the dog owner be responsible for paying our vet bills?\n\nI\u2019m a Texas resident and was curious what kind of liability there is on my neighbors part for vet bills caused by their dog and mine fighting in my yard.  My wife and 1 year old were in our backyard with the dog when the neighbors opened their back door and let their dog out (they went back inside and missed the whole thing).  The neighbors dog immediately came to the fence and jumped over.  My dog ran at him and they started fighting.  I broke the fight up and my dog suffered several bit puncture wounds to his front leg.  We took him to the vet because he was in a lot of pain and wouldn\u2019t walk on the leg.  We went back to the vet 2 days later because it was swollen worse than ever and he still wouldn\u2019t walk on it.  We got some X-rays done to identify any possible fracture and a culture to check for effectiveness of the antibiotics being used.  They actually put him on an additional antibiotic and when the culture came back a few days later they said that one of the 3 types of bacteria identified was resistant to the first antibiotic so the new one was a good call.  After the incident I spoke with the family who owned the dog and they expressed a desire to pay for the vet bills and wanted to avoid losing the dog.  I let them know what the monthly cost would be as we used a care credit card and got no interest for 6 months if paid in full.  They didn\u2019t indicate at the time it not being affordable and now that I have asked for the first payment which is due in a few days they said \u201csorry we can\u2019t afford to pay it.\u201d  I told them I\u2019m trying to see what I can find out about them repayment term being extended to a different promotion to make the payment lower, but I don\u2019t want to have to ask them for a monthly payment for the next 2-3 years either.\nWhat are my options here?  I feel like they should be held responsible for the payment of these bills as we wouldn\u2019t have been in this situation if it weren\u2019t for their dog coming onto our property and injuring our dog.\nAlso of note, their dog has jumped into our yard countless times when our dog is and isn\u2019t out there and is not friendly to our attempts to return him.  He\u2019s never attacked us or anything but he barks at us and won\u2019t let us near him.  On a couple of previous occasions our dogs have gotten into scuffles when he has come into the yard but it has never been this serious.  They usually hook the dog on a run when he goes out but it \u201cbroke the day before\u201d.\nReally frustrating situation as the 2 visits amounted to just over $2000.",

He got defensive and said that she tips him well and answers all of her calls and is making a lot of money working with her. \n\nThere was an incident a few days ago where she wanted him to transport her to another city via car. I told my bf that he cannot do that and it\u2019s again, inappropriate. She went ahead and sent him a grand and told him that would get some money now and the rest after he takes her to where she wanted to go. He said no and she eventually stopped and told him to keep the money. \n\nToday, he didn\u2019t answer any of her calls until\nMidday. She called called him angry and asked why he blocked her. He said it was the last straw and blocked her.
