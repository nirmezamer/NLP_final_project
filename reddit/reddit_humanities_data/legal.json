In that spirit, I'm going to be adding and changing some rules (especially in regards to kindness and mutual respect which has been lacking and the absence of which will no longer be tolerated at all) in the sub, as well as adding a flair system for verification of actual attorneys who want to participate and/or answer questions.  I only ask for your patience as I get up to speed. \n\nPlease feel free to drop any questions/problems/concerns in this thread and provided they are asked in a civil and polite manner, I'll get back to you ASAP! \n\nPlease note that as ever, but especially in this context: I am a lawyer but I'm not YOUR lawyer.  Any opinions I express are my own personal opinions and not legal advice/opinions.

Thanks for your volunteer efforts in stewarding the r/legal and larger reddit community! \n\nA suggestion: when people want to suggest \"find/hire an attorney\" can they also strive to give guidance on what kind of lawyer, practicing what kind of law? And perhaps what search terms or certifications to look for? Or maybe there can be a pinned post for that?\n\nIANAL, but I've heard from lawyers that they're like doctors - you don't go to a cardiologist for a podiatrist issue. And maybe visiting a Nurse or Physician Assistant is enough for certain situations, versus a board certified surgeon that takes forever to book an appointment with. Perhaps there are equivalent levels of certification that can be explained to help folks understand their options, while in most cases a barred JD is required. \n\ntl;dr help people take the next step and get the right advice for their situation, after \"hire a lawyer\" is the recommendation.\n\nEdit: for typos",

        "content": "My first real reddit post I guess.\n\nSome context: My (23F) dad is historically known to transfer money from my account to his. I finally got a bank account around the time I turned 18 in 2019 and it was under his account, so he could easily do this. I didn't know anything about filing taxes at 18 either. I got my first job at a Wendy's and finally started making...and losing money.\n\nFast forward to tax time, 2020, my dad asks for my W-2s and for my ID to file me as a dependent with a tax preparer. I trusted him and handed over the documents. In hindsight, I didn't know this wasn't required for me to be filed as a dependent...\n\nFast forward to now, I'm finally filing taxes on my own and asked about my AGI for 2022. Knowing I personally didn't file, I selected the corresponding answer. I got an error telling me I DID file for 2022. I had to do a lot of digging and found I could get transcripts on the IRS site from 2020 up to 2022...This set off alarms in my head. All transcripts showed I received some form of refund each year. I didn't see any of this money in my checking account. I immediately suspected my dad.\n\nI got copies of those filed 1040 forms from 2019, 2020, and 2022. For some reason I forgot to ask for 2021 (oops). All of them did not have my checking account number listed. I emailed the tax preparation company and asked if they had written permission to file on my behalf. They told me permission was granted by me giving my W-2s, ID, and giving verbal confirmation (my dad would call me in the middle of my school day to ask permission for filing me as a dependent?).They also cited Publication 929, stating I could be filed by a parent.\n\nMy issue here though is:\n\na) I was under the impression I was being filed as a dependent, not independent by my dad. He constantly told me I was a dependent and guilted me when I tried to express independence at home\n\nb) I made more than $15k in 2019 (2020 1040), so to my understanding, I was NOT a dependent so Publication 929 does not apply?\n\nc) The money never touched my account...ever. Uhm tax fraud?!?\n\nd) Does me giving my dad the forms and my ID and the verbal approval count as \"permission\"? Even if I was under the impression it was for him to file me under his taxes? Or is this total BS?\n\nWanted to especially verify point b. Does it apply at all here in my situation? I continued to make more money in 2020 through now.\n\nIm not sure I want to take legal action...any advice here is appreciated. My relationship with my parents is strained because of this abuse and codependency I grew up with.\n\nTo ease minds:\n\nI did move out in January and created my own checking account late 2022 after a loan refund was taken from my account (the last straw). I see now what I grew up in wasn't normal or healthy at all. I'm very upset at my dad and haven't talked to him about it. I haven't responded to the tax preparer's email about them referencing Preparation 929 or pointed out to them that the checking account on the documents is not mine. Didn't want to show all my cards yet.\n\n**EDIT:** Thx for all the advice here! I have a LOT to think about concerning my next steps with my dad. Will give updates where I can, but ofc, I don't to monitor this thread too closely either and get stuck in here. My credit freeze warriors: I 100% hear you and will ice-it-up!",

            "My mother tried something similar after I moved out and was declared emancipated for Fafsa purposes. Her accountant called me angry because when I filed my tax return stating that I had lived independently for the entire year, it triggered an investigation, and she had to pay it back. The accountant knew better and was being looked at for falsifying records. I still remember her saying, \"This is a real shitty thing you're doing to your mom.\"\n\nMe:  \"Do you mean me accurately filing my taxes? Is that the shitty that I'm doing? Or is it denying her the chance to commit fraud and to steal from me? Is that the shitty thing???\"",

You are unlikely to get your money back from him, ever.\n\nMoving forward, file your own taxes, and make sure you have no financial entanglement with your dad.",
            "Filing as a dependent is on your Fathers Tax Return! You still have to file your own tax return separately you just state on your return that someone claimed you as a dependent. It makes a difference on how much you get back but is still a separate filing. We do this every year for my sons but they get the money. Because we pay most of their expenses and for college we claim them as dependents. Again the dependent filing is on your father return only and is only legal if he covered the majority of your expenses. He can file for you, we have our tax preparer file for our son\u2019s but is with their permission but their refunds go to them. It is stealing on your father\u2019s part if he took your return without permission. Not sure it\u2019s fraud since you gave him permission to file for you, although you really didn\u2019t understand what he was doing.\n\nI would suggest you find a tax preparer in your area and have them walk you through everything. Not H&R Block or one of the quickie places. Someone local and experienced. They can walk you through what your options are with the past filings and explain it all. Making 15K it\u2019s probably not worth having them file for you long term. You can use turbo tax for free if you don\u2019t own a home or have lots of itemized deductions. The tax preparer if they are honest will explain deductions and all of the other issues and suggest the same. \n\nTo me it\u2019s sounds like your dad definitely stole from you and maybe committed fraud.  Good luck!",
            "My understanding from a quick Google is they could have the tax prep company file your taxes on your behalf since it looks like you gave permission. BUT they can not take your refund without your permission, that is tax fraud. \n\nI would start with talking to my parents and asking about the refunds. Have the transcripts with you as proof as they may try to gaslight you. Kindly ask for the money to be paid back. If they give you grief, the usual we let you live here, we provided you with food, clothing, or whatever then it will be up to you to decide how hard you want to push the issue.",

You may be able to do something about the tax returns, but you need to think about what outcome you want here. What is the total dollar amount of the returns that were deposited into his account? Do you want to pursue criminal charges? If it's within small claims limit you could bring a small claims suit, but even if you win in small claims most states small claims court don't have a mechanism to enforce judgements, so you would have to figure out how to get the money from him if he doesn't pay. This process varies by state, but you will probably end up paying more money to put a lien on property or if your state allows it have the sheriff confiscate property in the value of the debt. A civil suit in regular court would be easier to enforce judgement but hiring a lawyer will probably cost a substantial portion of the money he took, leaving you with some satisfaction but probably not any money.",

            "You may be able to adjust your withholding so that there is no refund at the end of the year. The refund your dad is getting is tax you have overpaid to the government over the course of the year, plus the deduction he's getting by claiming you as a dependent. I'm not a tax attorney or a lawyer, but in your shoes I'd decrease my withholding by whatever legal amount I could. But you probably already moved out, and that's oddly easier than computing taxes in the US."

He had a customer who would tip him well that he often did orders for. He then started to do orders off of the app and she would send him an x amount of money to go run errands for her, basically. (She\u2019s an older wealthy woman in her 50s) \n\nShe began to get obsessed with him over the past few weeks. Would randomly call him during the night and the evenings they talk for hours on the phone. She appears to have mental health issues and is an alcoholic. I told my bf the relationship was inappropriate and he should limit his contact with her. He got defensive and said that she tips him well and answers all of her calls and is making a lot of money working with her. \n\nThere was an incident a few days ago where she wanted him to transport her to another city via car. I told my bf that he cannot do that and it\u2019s again, inappropriate. She went ahead and sent him a grand and told him that would get some money now and the rest after he takes her to where she wanted to go. He said no and she eventually stopped and told him to keep the money. \n\nToday, he didn\u2019t answer any of her calls until\nMidday. She called called him angry and asked why he blocked her. He said it was the last straw and blocked her. (The previous nights she would call him drunk and talk about her trauma with him) \n\nFast forward to a few hours ago someone sent us a screen grab of an instagram story with a picture of my bf and my son. They called him a child molester and offered 1k for someone in our area to come beat him up. It looked like it was a repost so idk who posted it first. They also posted our address which scared me to oblivion. \n\nWe know for a fact that it\u2019s this woman because that picture he sent her on Monday. Why did he send her a picture of our son? Because he\u2019s an idiot and wanted sympathy I guess. \n\nWe have made a police report and tomorrow will file a no contact order. I am so scared that someone will try to come to our home to do us harm. Me and my kids have nothing to do with this and I have no idea what to do to protect my family. My bf won\u2019t return the money because he says he doesn\u2019t want any contact with her and sending it would \u201cbreach that\u201d. Anything else I can do? \n\nWe are in WA. ",

            "Bringing a child into this mess is a lifetime of legal fighting.\n\nYes, you admitting to using a schedule 1 psychedelic substance during pregnancy is something he can use against you.\n\nNeither of you are currently mature enough to parent a child. He doesn't want to be a father and is trying to coerce you into an abortion. You used mushrooms while pregnant. You've demonstrated that your ability to make sound decisions in the best interest of the child is not adequate. He's demonstrated that he will commit abuse through attempted coercive control.\n\nLegally, your best option is to abort. Psilocybin mushrooms affects on a developing fetus are not well understood but can cause a host of neurological issues. I say this even as a strong proponent of legalization. If the fetus has been negatively affected, you could wind up with an infant in foster care from birth. If not, you're going to have to take him to court for child support and he's unlikely to pay which means court. Over and over and over. And it's hard to pay for court when you lack the support needed to cover daycare.\n\nWake up, and do the adult thing."
