Read here!\n\n**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**\n\nThere is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that\u2019s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what\u2019s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).\n\n**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**\n\n**Common Troubleshooting Steps**\n\n* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11\n* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.\n* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -> Managed 3D Settings -> Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance\n\nIf it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:\n\n* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.\n* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it\u2019s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.\n* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.\n\nIf you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.\n\n**Common Questions**\n\n* **Is it safe to upgrade to <insert driver version here>?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there\u2019s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*\n\n**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**\n\n* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -> Change Resolution -> Scroll all the way down -> Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*\n* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*\n* **What does the new Power Management option \u201cOptimal Power\u201d means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*\n\nRemember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.\n\n*Did you know NVIDIA has a Developer Program with 150+ free SDKs, state-of-the-art Deep Learning courses, certification, and access to expert help. Sound interesting?* [Learn more here](https://nvda.ws/3wCfH6X)*.*",

            "I'm hoping they focus on stability, I've had a hard time with the drivers lately. I've had crashes to desktop, and in some cases my PC has rebooted while playing Elden Ring. Older drivers thankfully seem to fix it, but the experience has been pretty bad with newer ones.",
            "this driver is great. works fantastic on my 3080 and 24h2.",

            "537.58 to this (display driver only) and noticed no difference.. yet. Latency is still low and my biggest issue with Chromium apps checkerboarding is gone with the latest Windows 11 update.\n\nEdit: I noticed that while capped fps is fine, uncapped my GPU gets hotter than I\u2019ve ever seen it in game menus 80 degrees and 98 hot spot. This is in Halo Infinite on the latest Windows 11 Pro ver.",
            "Win 11,3080. Performance is a lot better than the last drivers for me. No issues so far. Btw, msi released a bios Update which could be interesting for rtx 40... Users...",
            "Anyone got any info on as to if the 555.99 stuttering issues are still present or should i keep my drivers at 552.22 for the moment?",
            "Yes, Just in time for The First Descendant!",
            "This driver finally fixed the chromium issue on Windows 10 it seems. Can't remember the last time it worked as intended. It's surreal.\n\nEdit: Not totally fixed, still pops up, just not as much. Dang it."
