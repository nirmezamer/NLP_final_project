Read here!\n\n**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**\n\nThere is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that\u2019s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what\u2019s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).\n\n**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**\n\n**Common Troubleshooting Steps**\n\n* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11\n* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.\n* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -> Managed 3D Settings -> Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance\n\nIf it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:\n\n* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.\n* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it\u2019s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.\n* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.\n\nIf you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.\n\n**Common Questions**\n\n* **Is it safe to upgrade to <insert driver version here>?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there\u2019s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*\n\n**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**\n\n* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -> Change Resolution -> Scroll all the way down -> Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*\n* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*\n* **What does the new Power Management option \u201cOptimal Power\u201d means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*\n\nRemember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.\n\n*Did you know NVIDIA has a Developer Program with 150+ free SDKs, state-of-the-art Deep Learning courses, certification, and access to expert help. Sound interesting?* [Learn more here](https://nvda.ws/3wCfH6X)*.*",

            "Please Help.\n\n# UNSOLVED\n\n**SUMMARY/TROUBLESHOOTING**\n\nI bought a ASUS ROG Zephyrus M16 gaming laptop about a year ago and have managed to make the 3070ti in it practically useless. Out of the box it ran amazing, running modern game titles at 165hz on high/ultra with no issues and great framerates. One day while gaming I was getting \"half\" the performance (half the frames than normal and some lag here and there). I've dealt with driver issues before on my custom desktop AMD build and thought it was that. Re-installed drivers, problem persisted, so I went ahead and downloaded DDU and did a factory reset on the laptop...only to realize while I was doing the reset and whatnot that the power supply was unplugged leading to the downgrade in performance. Since then, I haven't been able to run a game on the computer with anything higher than 20-30 frames. I've run memory diagnostics, no problems found. Multiple driver re-installs, updates, disabling and re-enabling of the display adapter to see if it was running on integrated graphics, nothing helped. Changing in-game settings(graphic quality, G-sync, render resolution, windows \"Hardware accelerated GPU scheduling\" toggled on and off, nothing has made any difference. I even bought a cooling pad to see if it was temperature-related. Below are the benchmark results I've been getting and the settings I am using on the ASUS Hardware software. Any suggestions are appreciated, I have yet to open the laptop  as I've been wanting to avoid that but can if needed, although I doubt it has accumulated enough gunk in a year and a half to cause these type of problems.\n\n**SPECS**\n\nASUS ROG Zephyrus M16 GU603ZW\n\nGPU: 3070 ti 8gb no overclock\n\nCPU: 12th Gen Intel i9-12900H 2500Mhz 14 core no overclock\n\nRAM: 16 Gb DDR5 4800mhz\n\nSMBIOS: 3.5\n\nOS: Windows 11 Home\n\nclean install of drivers\n\n\\*below are pics of ASUS hardware software and benchmark results\\*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n4093jlx8y3d1.png?width=2300&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d44b119ca964c96068092f962ccc3ee98072a17",

On Most games at 1440p max settings I gather around 68-73c depending on the game with a slightly adjusted default fan curve. Case fans are artic p12 max even on the radiator at normal speed. My Cpu is 7600x. Is it causing a bottleneck?? I need a pc wizards advice because I watch YouTubers benchmarks with higher end cards with temps around 58-64 I'm over here stressing like why is mine cooking to 70's? I should also mention most of my games I don't like to use DLSS unless I have to for extra frames.",

            "No to every single question. \n\nIf you want lower temps increase the Fan speed.\nIf you dont want louder noise dont increase fan speed. \n\nNo its not a bottleneck for godsake stop watching weird yt videos benchmark videos. Watch Hardware unboxed. Im not even sure why you are watching videos about your card even though you have it installed. \n\n\nGPU load  is higher without dlss thus higher temp.",
            "OC BIOS or silent? There is a switch near the power connector on top.",
            "No 70s is fine for a 2 fan. You are fine! You are pushing alot of power through this. But the issue is some people don't realize the asus dual has 2 models. One is the evo which has sligjtly smaller fans and a smaller heatsink and the other is the none evo which has better temps due to 100mm fans instead of 90mm and has a bigger hestsink with better fins. Sneaky little move from asus it's why I always get the white one with duals because none of the whites are evos. Bit dude 70c is perfectly fine. My 4070 super dual is around 67 to 70c under full load.\n\nAlap the 7600x is a fine cpu to use. You may see a slightly bottleneck at 1080p but it's not much and in 1440p and 4k you won't really notice anything. I say it's not really a bottleneck. Enjoy man nothing wrong with your card at all. Actually the asus dual is the only dual fan card say performs at 3 fan card level. Its the top of the list for duals and the performnace is so close to 3 fans it doesn't even matter.",
            "Except for strix, Asus hardware does run a little hotter. But those temps are fine. 7600x is more than capable of handling 4070ti super.",
            ">  around 68-73c \n\ncompletely fine  \n\n> My Cpu is 7600x. Is it causing a bottleneck??   \n\njust check the GPU utilization while playing, if its near 100% then no bottleneck.",
            "73c and even a little higher are completely fine temps.Only +80c temps under load are where you should start to get worried. 5 7600x is very good for the 4070 ti super in 1440p. In 1080p the 4070 ti super is slightly bottlenecked by the 7600x.",
            "Temps are normal. Your CPU is not bottlenecking the card. \n\nIf you're concerned run a slightly more aggressive fan curve. Have it ramp up to 70% fan speed at 50'c, and 90% at 70'c. You'll find the more quickly you start cooling it off, the lower the overall temps will be.\n\nEdit. If you're not running  intake fans, or intake fans are going across a rad, your temps will be higher.",
            "Honestly the biggest problem seems to be that the gpu isn't in the top slot, I am not 100% sure",
            "One of the PC I built recently has a Asus dual 4070S paired with a 7600X on a 1440p monitor and runs 65-70C, when compared to a PC I built a while back with a MSI trio 4070 Ti with a 7700X on 3440x1440 ultra wide runs 66-70C, they perform nearly identical and run quiet and relatively cool.  The dual is tiny in comparison to the Ti.  The difference is only 50 watts between the 4070S and the Ti/Ti S, hardly enough to really matter.\n\nThere are two bios on the cards you use a switch to set.  On the dual if you're worried just use the performance one.  My testing was done on silent bios on 4070S dual.\n\nThe 7600 is not a bottleneck, but if you want to improve its performance activate PBO and use core offset in the BIOS, just set -20 all core and you should be fine, it'll basically keep the CPU at max speed forever with any half ass cooler like that.  And of course make sure your RAM speed is set properly."
