            "Him threatening her with abuse accusations over the situation with the cat is insane. You said fucked up shit to her cat like you'll snap its neck. Good luck with that 'she abused me too' defense. Idiot.\n\nThis was such a heavy read.",
            "He did fucking strangling motions when he threatened to *bash her head against the wall with a brick* like he was Lil OJ.\n\nHow unhinged do you have to be to do that on camera, even if you weren\u2019t an ~internet celeb~\n\n**What in the cinnamon toast fuck**",
            "I read through the whole doc - and, oh my gosh. I watched Alex\u2019s videos since before the eBoys but had dropped off in interest over the past year or so since he seemed so obsessed about Elphaba, which wasn\u2019t entertaining to listen to. All I can say is \u201cwhat the hell.\u201d I don\u2019t have any real relationship experience, but how someone could claim they love someone when treating them so poorly is beyond me. I don\u2019t know anything about Alice, but I feel bad that she stayed for so long with someone who obviously treated her so poorly. I hope she finds peace.",
            "I'm just shocked at how genuinely unhinged he comes across.  I've seen messages that are more viscerally shocking, but the frequency and manner that he says this stuff it's hard to even comprehend.  He was always a bit of a freak but this is like two mad level of vile. \n\nIt seems that a lot of people are learning that you can send a 40 minute long voice note today because idk if anyone on earth has ever done that before",
            "Not to make light of the horrible accusations, but I burst out laughing when he started with the \"Your boyfriend is an *internet celebrity* and needs to keep his circle small!!\" stuff. You haven't been relevant in years, sit down.",
            "In a recent video, he said something like \u201cI\u2019m sure some of my viewers are older but most of you are like 14-15, if you\u2019re older I dunno sorry but you\u2019re not my main demographic\u201d and I was like\u2026.? So you talk about these topics purposefully to kids? Rubbed me so weirdly. Very interesting with all this context, in that I think he likes feeling powerful in any situation. He knows kids will take his word as gospel and relishes that. He likes to exercise and wield some sick sense of supremacy over others and it\u2019s clear in this horrible behavior",

Feel absolutely awful for him tbh, kinda reminds me a bit of Gus and Eddy. Finding out someone you've been close friends with, worked with a lot and lived with for years is an abusive piece of shit must be a horrendous feeling :(",
            "once again i am here to say imallexx has always been and will always be a piece of shit.",
            "The clip of him sobbing and saying he\u2019s up and down and shedding the tears (the tears are real but 110% for himself because he knows he\u2019s fucked up.)\n\nIt\u2019s absolute classic emotional blackmail and psychological abuse. It was absolutely haunting to hear that clip because it was just near enough identical to the shit my ex girlfriend put me through and abused me with for years, constant mood swings, arguments, demeaning comments, physical abuse - all made to make you feel lucky that this persons even with you. Goes to far, cry feign forgiveness and reset. Leaves you like an absolute shadow of your former self after a year or so."

It's time to put the discussion in one place. \n\n**CONTEXT + LINKS** \n\nFraser (iNabber) was originally accused of mistreatment by his ex girlfriend, Kirst, on Twitter/X @ursoftblood.

This was also well received, at least here on this subreddit. \n\nAt the time of writing, Fraser just responded once again, with another google document. [Discussion and links here](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubedrama/s/4AlNRhAvkv). At the time of writing, consensus seems to be: readers are sick of the google documents. ",

            "Update: Kirsty has replied again in a series of tweets. No it isn't brief. [https://x.com/ursoftblood/status/1804243734134968520?t=Eh9YFsmBekcd-8XcrRwXOw&s=19](https://x.com/ursoftblood/status/1804243734134968520?t=Eh9YFsmBekcd-8XcrRwXOw&s=19)\n\nThat's the link to the first tweet.

            ">readers are sick of the google documents. \n\nI'll say. There's over 22,000 words in these docs, just in the text, not counting images. That's longer than Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka.",
            "This might be a hot take but I feel like none of these documents contain the truth, but both people are being honest about their experiences. \n \nIt's almost 4 am, so I won't elaborate now, but it seems like they tell a lot of similar stories in different ways, and I don't think they are lying about how they emotionally interpreted the situations or how they were impacted by the relationship.\n \nThe one weird thing that I would like someone to explain to me is how Fraser can hear coughing through the walls, but can't hear his dog barking and his girlfriend screaming, calling, and texting. Fraser says the walls are thin and his mic could pick up her making noise in another room, but then said he didn't hear the commotion (he does not elaborate on what sorts of noises he can hear, so I'm inclined to believe what she said about him getting mad about relatively quiet sounds). I get he was sleeping but if your ears are so sensitive that you get anxiety from your girlfriend walking around while you record, I do not understand how you sleep through that.",
            "I don't think any of this covers iNabber in glory, but it also seems pretty within the realms of a typical failed relationship between relatively immature 20-somethings. The stuff about her not being able to make noise while he works makes him sound prick-ish, but I do think calling it 'confinement' is an example of using the worst possible sounding word to illustrate that point. \n\nAll in all I wouldn't want to be in a relationship with the guy from what I've seen, but I also think it's been inappropriately framed especially coming off the back of the extremely serious nature of the abuse with ImAllexx.",
            "Definitely doesn't seem like he's some big evil abuser, but on a personal level it's giving me bad vibes how much his last document is filed with him saying things like \"as you can see this proves she's blatantly lying\" or \"this claim is absolutely insane\". Like I can understand him wanting to counteract what she's saying if he doesn't believe it's true, but it seems like he's not willing to give room to the idea that she could have experienced things differently to the way he thinks they should be read.  \n\nIdk this definitely just seems like a bad relationship that shouldn't be public, but it's definitely a little off putting how his instinct seems to be to just completely shut her side down without much grace",
            "I think they both should handle this in private... Either of them is not a criminal, they just were in a bad relationship, and getting to know the details of the sex life of a couple I don't even know was not on my bingo card.\n\nI think that this is awkward and unhealthy for everyone\n\nEdit: typos",
            "I hope this is the last doc \ud83d\ude1e",
            "This just seems like a toxic relationship, where both felt like they were wronged. I think they both need to grow the fuck up, and just ignore each other, nothing good is going to come from this.",
            "I've read the over 100 combined pages of Fraser's 2 documents and Kirst's 1. A lot of both sides (near 90%, in fact) is pure hearsay. Things under the following categories cannot be regarded as reliable evidence: \n\n* Messages each of them sent to friends talking about the relationship, which of course can be made up or filtered through their personal bias\n* Public social media posts each of them made in the past expressing gratitude or joy at aspects of the relationship, when this type of content would of course want to paint a positive public picture regardless.\n* Screencaps of exchanges between Fraser and Kirst in which they still disagree on the interpretation of an incident, hence leaving no decisive conclusion as to what is the truth.\n* Long explanatory texts from either party explaining their interpretation and feelings around an incident with no supporting evidence.\n\nThrowing out all the inconclusive types of points listed above, here is what I could gather about the proven infractions of both parties.\n\nKirst:\n\n* On at least two occasions, she used guilt to try to pressure Fraser into sex. The incident where she immediately guilts him saying his rejections of breakup sex made her conscious about her weight, as well as a separate incident where she again guilts him by expressing disappointment that he didn't take things further when she got on top of him naked and (in her own words) begged him to initiate sex.\n* Her own account and the evidence does suggest that her eating disorder came about more so due to her own interpretations and insecurities. Fraser never asked or implied that she needed to diet, lose weight, nor did he insult her weight. The evidence supports the opposite of her claim that Fraser is responsible for her eating disorder. It is unfounded for her to so strongly and publicly blame something caused by her own insecurities on Fraser.\n\nFraser:\n\n* Knew his dog attacked Kirst multiple times, including at least one attack putting her in the hospital and another leaving her trapped on top of the couch for 2 hours. Even after that, He was callous and stubborn, not taking his dog's training seriously and sending Kirst defiant messages tilting her about the dog doing things outside the training restrictions. Fraser's rebuttal doesn't sufficient address this, they largely amount to listing examples of where Kirst spoke positively about the dog even after the attacks, which proves nothing.\n* He did say \"let's have sex at the spa\" ahead of one of their travels. This is extremely inappropriate given that it is a public space. Kirst further claims that Fraser tried to coerce her into sex while at a spa, which Fraser denies. Neither side has evidence for or against it going further than Fraser's inappropriate \"let's have sex at the spa\" comment ahead of the trip.\n\nThe 'financial dependency' point, both of them were at fault for it:\n\n* Fraser was clingy at the start of the relationship and was the one to push for Kirst to move in with him and allow him to cover rent. While he didn't force or threaten, he was pushy and insistent at the start despite Kirst expressing reservations.\n* Kirst did make hints to Fraser that she was dissatisfied with her regular job and was enthusiastic and agreeable when he suggested an arrangement to help with this that made her financially dependent on him.\n* After they broke up, Kirst continued to live in their shared flat for free for months. During this time: Fraser did not understand how unhappy and cut off Kirst felt from her \"real\" support networks and life despite having more than sufficient shelter in a home he was paying for. Kirst similarly overlooked the huge amount of financial support Fraser was giving her and expected him to read her mind and put all the blame on him for an arrangement she has co-developed with him from the start. I do not believe that her efforts to scale back on luxuries and save up enough to move away from Fraser are aligned with how badly she claims she needed to get away from him, including turning down Fraser's offer to put himself on the hook legally to fund the first few months of a separate home for her.",
            "None of this should\u2019ve been made public. This isn\u2019t someone taking down their abuser, this is the dirty laundry of a toxic and immature relationship being aired out in public for no reason."
