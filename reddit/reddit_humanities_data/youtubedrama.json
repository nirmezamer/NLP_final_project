        "content": "Seeing how this has been big news, with heavy allegations with pretty damning evidence, and I'm sure there will be plenty of updates, it's already time for an ImAllexx Megathread. \n\nImAllexx has been accused by his ex-girlfriend Alice of verbal/emotional/psychological abuse as well as physical abuse. [Here is the first post on this sub regarding her statement as well as links to her tweets and the document](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubedrama/s/llzqzf1C1K) \n\n[Here is a follow up post highlighting specific abusive texts](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubedrama/s/nfGAKBySec) \n\n[Here is one of the few videos showcasing Alex threatening and insulting Alice on discord](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubedrama/s/yUdRYLT7Te)\n\n[In case the Google drive is broken here is a tweet containing some clips of the videos](https://x.com/sxpnvptee/status/1802120827418329547?t=q3XfXsauStB-jn4Qty58gg&s=19)\n\n[Here](https://x.com/sxpnvptee/status/1802121993199984738?t=3R551Nogh8haAtiMmO0uUw&s=19) [and here](https://x.com/sxpnvptee/status/1802122153967710686?t=3R551Nogh8haAtiMmO0uUw&s=19) where these final clips include a moment where he calls her the n-word, which is included in some of the texts as well. \n\nThere is also a 25 minute voice message in the Google drive, which you can listen to in [this video summarizing the allegations by YouTuber Exate](https://youtu.be/SYMA887G3N4?si=KSCWH4C4hX6OKJLu) (timestamp: 30:24)\n\n",

            "Him threatening her with abuse accusations over the situation with the cat is insane. You said fucked up shit to her cat like you'll snap its neck. Good luck with that 'she abused me too' defense. Idiot.\n\nThis was such a heavy read.",
            "I read through the whole doc - and, oh my gosh. I watched Alexs videos since before the eBoys but had dropped off in interest over the past year or so since he seemed so obsessed about Elphaba, which wasnt entertaining to listen to. All I can say is what the hell. I dont have any real relationship experience, but how someone could claim they love someone when treating them so poorly is beyond me. I dont know anything about Alice, but I feel bad that she stayed for so long with someone who obviously treated her so poorly. I hope she finds peace.",
            "I'm just shocked at how genuinely unhinged he comes across.  I've seen messages that are more viscerally shocking, but the frequency and manner that he says this stuff it's hard to even comprehend.  He was always a bit of a freak but this is like two mad level of vile. \n\nIt seems that a lot of people are learning that you can send a 40 minute long voice note today because idk if anyone on earth has ever done that before",
            "Not to make light of the horrible accusations, but I burst out laughing when he started with the \"Your boyfriend is an *internet celebrity* and needs to keep his circle small!!\" stuff. You haven't been relevant in years, sit down.",
            "In a recent video, he said something like Im sure some of my viewers are older but most of you are like 14-15, if youre older I dunno sorry but youre not my main demographic and I was like.? So you talk about these topics purposefully to kids? Rubbed me so weirdly. Very interesting with all this context, in that I think he likes feeling powerful in any situation. He knows kids will take his word as gospel and relishes that. He likes to exercise and wield some sick sense of supremacy over others and its clear in this horrible behavior",
            "once again i am here to say imallexx has always been and will always be a piece of shit.",
            "The clip of him sobbing and saying hes up and down and shedding the tears (the tears are real but 110% for himself because he knows hes fucked up.)\n\nIts absolute classic emotional blackmail and psychological abuse. It was absolutely haunting to hear that clip because it was just near enough identical to the shit my ex girlfriend put me through and abused me with for years, constant mood swings, arguments, demeaning comments, physical abuse - all made to make you feel lucky that this persons even with you. Goes to far, cry feign forgiveness and reset. Leaves you like an absolute shadow of your former self after a year or so.",
            "Normally I wait to hear out both sides but the evidence here is so damning and now multiple friends of Alex are coming out condemning him and are just as horrified as us. inabber made a statement on instagram saying he knew nothing about the relationship and wasnt even told they broke up until much later, and hes genuinely repulsed but what hes seen as we all should be. I really dont see a way out of this for Alex and this needed to be leaked, Im very proud of Alice for taking her power back and totally decimating whats left of his career. Im curious what he has to say for himself but I just dont see him being able to talk his way out of any of the clips circulating now.",
            "People saying if these people knew why did they not say anything. Its not on them to speak for a victim if the victim doesnt want to come forward. This is more than silly drama exposing people and if the victim didnt want to come out publicly then other people cant do it for them and if they posted vaguely about it they would get backlash of saying well where is the proof and people will just ignore it",
            "Oh thank god I was waiting for a mega thread of this cause theres was way too many threads. thank you mods! "

            "So many of the replies on the subreddit dedicated to him make me sick. I haven't seen goalposts moved this far in a very long time.",
            "Didn't this guy also get exposed for cheating on his wife years ago? or am I mixing him up with someone. If so, yes, cheating isn't really a cancelable offense, but will say personally, seeing that he probably cheated on his wife and him looking like that in his little costume for sure turned me off completely from his content lol",
            "The real kicker of all of this is him trying to claim he's honest and everything.\n\nBut Doc, we literally only found out because ex staff got angry and people pried. He didn't tell us for 4 years, and he's gonna claim he couldn't have said anything, but it's really that he didn't want to. Every Twitch streamer says something about their ban, except for him.",
            "It's hilarious how the tweet starts with \"I've always been always clear and honest with you guys\" and then he removes the individual minor part but then realizes people still can see it and he adds it back\n\nLike, LMAO THIS HILARIOUS AS MUCH AS THE FUCKING UKULELE APOLOGY",
            "I'm so grateful the climate around this stuff has changed. So many of my friends, and even myself, were preyed on by older men when we were just teenagers trying to play online games. One of my best friends had a \"boyfriend\" in his 30s while we were in highschool. Just crazy shit.",
            "The incident with this minor happened the same year he admitted to cheating on his wife btw.",
            "I posted on one of the circlejerk threads a joke about how \"it was only him playing a character that sexts minors!\" I thought it was so funny because surely they couldn't use that shitty excuse anymore, but it got used. A lot.\n\nThis is the first I'm seeing his response and I have to be honest, that is probably the worst Twitter apology I've ever seen. The language he uses is fine if you're talking to a casual friend but as an actual recognition of \"wrongdoing?\" Good lord. I hope his vacation sucks.",
            "This proves that the 'save the children' BS is all a grift.  If Doc's crew gave AF about children, they would have much harsher words to say.  They speak about the Doc better than they speak about LGBTQ people in general.  How do we fix this brainrot?",
            "Look at the comments some leave and it people are saying this is proof that Twitch was out to get him and never trust people. This is despite doc himself saying he did text a minor inappropriately.\n\nSome people just cannot behave themselves and get out of the para social slump they are in",
