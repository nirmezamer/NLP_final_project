        "content": "Hello everyone.  \n\nAs most of you probably know this sub was banned around six months ago for being unmoderated.  I recently requested it, and was granted permission yesterday.  \n\nThe rules are going to remain the same as they were before.  If you're new to the sub or just need a refresher you can find them here:\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/OlderThanYouThinkIAm/about/rules/\n\n\nI had to clean the sub up a little last night, the former head mod threw a bit of a tantrum when he deleted his account over the API changes, and the title and description had quite a few obscenities directed to the admins.  If I missed anything, let me know.  \n\nOutside of that if you have any questions, concerns, changes you would like to see, please feel free to comment them here.  \n\nI most likely will be looking for mods in the near future, but right now I just want to see how active this sub actually gets after being banned for the past six months.  \n\n\nSo again, welcome back everyone, and we all look forward to any new stories you would like to share.",

Over the years, several people gave me comments in both veins about having children at my age.

Boost to the ego.  All coworkers are either old, young or peer. And this really isn't an age thing, it's a competence thing.
