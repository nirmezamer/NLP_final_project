I recently requested it, and was granted permission yesterday.  \n\nThe rules are going to remain the same as they were before.  If you're new to the sub or just need a refresher you can find them here:\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/OlderThanYouThinkIAm/about/rules/\n\n\nI had to clean the sub up a little last night, the former head mod threw a bit of a tantrum when he deleted his account over the API changes, and the title and description had quite a few obscenities directed to the admins.  If I missed anything, let me know.  \n\nOutside of that if you have any questions, concerns, changes you would like to see, please feel free to comment them here.  \n\nI most likely will be looking for mods in the near future, but right now I just want to see how active this sub actually gets after being banned for the past six months.  \n\n\nSo again, welcome back everyone, and we all look forward to any new stories you would like to share.",

I'd love to ask general questions to the sub, and talk experiences in general. It's tough living in this world with a baby face, it'd be cool to have a place to rant without having a good story.",
            "I was so heartbroken when this sub got banned for un-moderation. I do not know a thing about being a moderator so I was learning how to bring it back. Thank you so much for keeping this sub active! Let me know how I can help, should you need it! ",

This is the first sub I've modded on reddit, so I'm getting use to things.  It's actually helpful that the sub isn't *too* active at the moment.  The last time I moderated a message board was back in I think 2004.  As much as I like to think that was \"just a few years ago\", it's obviously not lol.  \n\nBut I'll try to start monthly discussion threads after the holidays.",

Relevant info is you can buy a lottery ticket at age 18 here, but every place has signs that say you should expect to have your ID checked if you look under 25.\n\nSo we go up to the counter with our snacks and I ask for a ticket. The young man behind the counter asks to see some ID. I laugh, thinking he's joking. Then he asks again to see some ID and I blurt out, \"wait, are you serious?!\", and my daughter and I both start laughing because I was in my mid-40s at the time. Through her laughter my daughter (who definitely looked older than 15) says, \"she's my mom!\". I finally manage to get out my license & show it to him, and he says \"oh, well you look very young\". I thanked him for the complement, got my ticket and our snacks, and my daughter and I went on our way, still laughing.",

They did it because a lot of young people struggled to get out and be social again after the pandemic and were lonely and not thriving.\n\nThe municipality invites young people to a community centre so they can form groups. There is a supervisor there for advice and support. And the young people get access to rooms in the centre for their meet-ups (e.g. playing boardgames). The youth groups decide what to do together and run the groups themselves."
