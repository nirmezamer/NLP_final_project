            "All that shit about Satan being the boss of hell, owning souls, and being the source of evil, is just highly metal fanfic that persists because it sounds badass. Overzealous people in some communities sincerely buy into it, but for most people that stuff is just for fun. The Bible really doesn't say too much about it.",

            "To have a more nuanced topic of conversation, while it's not lofty of an idea to suggest anon doesn't know too much about Christianity if that's their assessment of it I will say I do blame modern religious teaching here.\n\nConsidering my own experience it's not a shocker that we've gotten to this point where movies have done way more to shape our ideas on what the mythology (no ill connotation here) of your religion is than your friend's mom who doesn't have a teaching degree who volunteered for week night Christian teaching. No wonder people don't understand not only the real story, but also have no attachment to its depth or practicality. They did a horrible job selling abstinence to us teenagers so they have no chance even attempting the problem of evil. I would have loved to have learned religious history in my teenage years as it's a sort of hobby of mine to do that now. I'm only just learning what the specific beliefs the sect I grew up with has, how I may disagree, and what other sects or philosophies have better approaches to thing.\n\nAnd I will say this sort of thing pops up in a lot of places, so I'm not just shaking my fist at Sunday school. I genuinely think most people don't know what the hell they believe and attach themselves with these labels, speaking with authority at times, but they really don't know anything about it. Often times I even find people who supposedly fit into that category are the worst at explaining their identity and commonly do things outside of their belief system. Whether that's an anarchist (etymology: without ruler) campaigning for a president or a Roman Catholic who believes in the Nine Circles of Hell, people don't know who they are. It would help a lot if the people involved with indoctrinating others to lay all the cards out and see if it's a match, not just crumble and move on when things don't go to plan.",
            "Aren\u2019t like 93% of poles Catholics?\n\nSeriously, how can someone living in one of the most Christian nations in Europe not even know the basic tenets of Christianity?",

            "Uhm yeah? What the fuck else would you do as an omnipotent god if not create silly things to amuse you? \n\nFucking dumb. What else would you have god do? Just fellate himself all day everyday?",
            "God did defeat Satan, twice actually",
            "Satan doesn't rule hell and he doesn't own anyone's soul.",
            "I don't think that's Christian theology. That is the popular conception of Christianity. \n\nIt's like all of us know the popular conception of hellenistic theology, but very few would know what it actually was in antiquity"
