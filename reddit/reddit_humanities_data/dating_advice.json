            "Was seeing a guy for 2 months, 2x a week, texting all the time, sleeping together, etc. He decided he doesn\u2019t see us working well long-term and that we\u2019d be better as friends and I\u2019m simply shook? \n\nThings felt good and easy and fun but he said there\u2019s no romantic potential and we\u2019re better platonic and I just??? \n\nFiguring out how to not beat myself up for giving it my all and it not working out is probably the most challenging part. I thought there was potential for something but now I\u2019m being so self-critical and am very fearful of putting myself back out there. Don\u2019t even really know if it\u2019s related to him or just the internal battle of rejection.",
            "I (39, m, virgin) was talking to this girl on tinder for a week (my second match in almost five years). I thought I was pretty savvy with this stuff but then she dropped the onlyfans link. Feel pretty stupid now and really crushed. I probably wasn't even talking to that girl to be honest, was probably her boyfriend or someone who manages her stuff.\n\nI should've stayed negative and not let myself feel any hope, at least that's how I feel right now. Inching towards being the 40 year old virgin for real. Getting really tired of getting up everyday to bust my ass at work and be exhausted all the time, feeding myself, having to brush my teeth and piss and shit. And do it all again the next day. I'm just a body keeping himself alive because it's the routine while I get nothing out of being alive. \n\nAnd therapy just doesn't cut it for me anymore. I know my issues and I'm trying my best, but life feels empty and pointless. I just want to experience intimacy of any kind. Life is so lonely. It has to get better at some point, right?",
            "I've had 3 incredible dates with this dude that I'm into. I am being positive, but cautious as I am still trying to get to know him. On our third date, we opened up to each other about our family life and such. We last chatted on Friday about his weekend plans, and mine, and then we didn't talk Saturday or Sunday, which is fine. I texted him today and there's been no indication that he will be reaching out to me at all. I'm 26F and he's 34M. I feel like I'm overthinking things, but I am also negative to the fact he may respond back being that I just don't want to get hurt. If he does ghost me, then how should I go about getting over that fact? I've never been ghosted before, either, so idk. I'm just ranting. I feel like I'm going freaking crazy.",
            "29M here with very minimal dating experience, just had a first date with 30F that's left me really confused. \n\nWe were having a nice conversation on the app for around a week until I asked her out, which she said she was hoping I would do, but come day of it seemed like a switch flipped and she was completely disinterested? When we met up, I tried to make conversation by asking about her hobbies- she gave me mostly short answers and didn't really ask me anything in return. I don't know how I would've said anything uncomfortable since there weren't any heavy topics and it felt hard to talk about myself since she didn't seem to engage much. I also tried to then lighten the mood by asking her if she wanted to play a little game, which she went along with, but it didn't really seem to land either. I'm not the best looking guy in the world for sure, but my pictures are up to date, I dressed nicely and made sure my hygiene was on point, I tried to show I was interested and actively engaged, I tried to be very considerate to not do anything that might make her uncomfortable.... and she unmatched me shortly after? I don't have a problem with not having a connection, but as someone who is new to dating / anxious / getting close to 30, man did that just feel super discouraging. Is dating really that hard? Why would someone agree to a date just to act like they don't want to be there at all?",
            "Over the weekend I (29F) got a nice rejection text from someone (38M) I went on an amazing first date with a few weeks ago. He said he thought we had great chemistry (I agree) but he doesn't know if we'd quite work long term. And I'm just so confused and honestly frustrated that he wouldn't even give it a chance. I did respond and say I actually do think we have long term potential so if you change your mind and we're both still single feel free to reach out. IDK if that was desperate but I figured I have nothing to lose.",
            "I\u2019ve been seeing this guy who seems really cool, but I don\u2019t think we have a romantic connection. We\u2019ve hung out multiple times and haven\u2019t even kissed, the most he\u2019s done is put his arm around me. Plus the conversation still feels super stilted. Which sucks because it\u2019s been really nice having someone to go on dates with and do different activities with, but obviously I don\u2019t want to lead this person on. Anyone else feel like mutual attraction/compatibility feels so rare these days?",
            "25th birthday coming soon and still never had a boyfriend or been kissed. went on a handful of dates (<10) my whole life. I'm just so sad I don't know why I can't find love. Granted I think 50% is me and 50% of the reasons have been life circumstances (moving a lot, work challenges, covid etc) I just feel like I'm getting so old now.",
            "Talking to this girl for about about 2 months. Multiple dinner dates\u2014texts/phone calls/kissing sessions.  \nWe went out last weekend and did an \u201cactive\u201d date because she \u201cwanted to see me in the wild\u201d. Long story short\u2014we spoke last night and I got the old\u2014we aren\u2019t compatible convo and she doesn\u2019t see a long term future with me. I tried to smoothly press for specifics but she wouldn\u2019t elaborate and actually got testy with me. I\u2019m 45 and she is 38. She has 2 kids and asked me if I want more kids (I have son starting HS so I said that wasn\u2019t in the cards for me. She told me that she was back and forth on more kids but not committed either way.\n\nI can\u2019t help but beat myself up for screwing this up.\n\nAny help ?",
            "I went speed dating today, met an awesome girl. She was really pretty and super popular so I'm probably 1 of 10 guys who was into her. I gave her my number and I did my best after the event to talk to her and connect with her but I felt like it wasn't enough. After I left I ended up passing her and her friends nearby and we waved bye to each other. Honestly I wish I pitched myself and my ideas for a date (based off of what she was into) at that time. Pretty frustrated right now because of this.\n\nReally hoping she'll text me during the day but experience has taught me that she won't. \ud83d\ude22"

Saying he hasn't been able to think about relationships at all, and needs to sort his feelings out, and relationships haven't been on his mind whatsoever.  \n  \nNext thing you know, a month and a half later he has a serious girlfriend.\n\nI know that when someone says they're not ready theres a \"with you\" silently tacked on the end, but why is it always the case they have a serious girlfriend seemingly RIGHT after they say this? Is it because they're dating multiple girls at once, and they tell the rest of the roster they're not ready, or is it a thing where they're somehow primed from dumping a situationship to suddenly be on the hunt for a GF? Because this exact pattern has happened to so many people it seems like there has to be something going on with the timing?",

They don't offer any meaningful insight, they don't make you feel better, they are simply self-destructive.\n\n\nHis little speech about not being ready for a serious relationship was just an attempt to break it off without hurting your feelings. There could be no specific reason at all, it's hard to define why you \"click\" with one person but not another. Or you burped once and he's a weird little baby and got turned off by it. Unfortunately the specific reasons are something you can never know.\n\n\nAccepting rejection and moving on is difficult.

He was quite shy but lovely guy, I helped him gain loads of confidence, shaped him into an amazing BF (also great in bed), I helped him decorate his house, would help him pick really nice clothes when out shopping, encouraged him to go to the gym, even wrote out workout programmes for him, things a long term GF would help with. We went on holiday, had a fab time, even spoke about living together. We couldn't have got on any better than we were. \n\nWe had a stupid argument a few days later and I never heard from him again (he worked offshore so was gone for a month). I'm stubborn so refused to reach out to him and that was it.  \n\nWe did speak a couple of months later, he was living with someone else by then. He was married and had a baby on the way six months after we had the stupid argument. \n\nFour years we had been together, once I had helped him with his social anxiety, helped build his confidence and get some experience that was it!\n\nYes I was hurt at the time, my ego was bruised and I wanted to know what she had that I didn't, then I realised that for him to have treated me like that, he wasn't as great a guy as I had thought he was, so fuck him!\n\nKarma is a wonderful thing though, he  began to message me all the time, emailed me always wanting to chat, looking for advice, wanting to meet for lunch, complaining about life with my replacement, again proving that he wasn't a great guy by treating the new partner like this by wanting to keep in touch with me. It did give me great satisfaction tbh and then I cut him off completely.",

Lots of people don't have sex til their 20s or 30s, personally I think in many ways it's better that way. You will be more matured and handling the vast amount of emotions and feelings that comes along with sex can be challenging when you are younger. You're not missing out on anything, sex is only fun when you are with someone you actually want to be with and that is reciprocated. It's not worth chasing it out just to fulfill it, although there is nothing wrong with that if you really want to one day. That said I wouldn't lie about it, it will only further complicate things if you end up progressing into a relationship and have to tell someone the truth at some point. Also a lot of people actually enjoy being with a virgin compared to someone who's slept around a lot.

One thing she did only 3 months into the relationship was she went to a gig in another country with her best friend who's a guy and apparently has a girlfriend. \n\nShe got a hotel with him and they shared a room to save money. Fine, fair enough, that's reasonable. \n\nThis is where things get shady for me. She never told me they'd be doing that or asked if I'd be comfortable with it. I find out because she posted a instagram story with her in bed and he's asleep in what appears to be the same bed.\n\nWhen I confronted her, she firstly started gaslighting me. Saying it's not a big deal, I'm insecure, I don't trust her etc etc. She then said that they pushed the beds apart before but it really didn't look like it from the instagram story. She then lied and said his girlfriend doesn't see it as a problem but then said she's never spoken to her.\n\nAnyway, afterwards, I gave her the benefit of the doubt and understood that we make mistakes and felt like she probably hasn't cheated but poorly communicated and tried to claw herself out of a hole. \n\nAfter though, which is not related to the breakup, I spent quite a few months being paranoid that she was cheating and had a lot of anxiety about it. There were small little things that happened that made me instantly jump to conclusions that she's cheating even if she might have not been.\n\n1 being she worked as a stage hand at a music venue. She brought home some flowers one night and said it was from the venue cos they were going to throw them. 2nd time was she found a random guys shirt in her room and didn't understand where ir came from, but she actually showed it to me. Would a guilty person show it to someone deliberately? She said the next day she brought it into work and asked a colleague who said it was from the lost property section and she must have taken it from there.\n\nIt took me a while to trust her, but I was deeply convinced she was cheating until so many months had passed and nothing weird like that ever happened again.\n\nWe eventually split up 9 months after this for completely different reasons. \n\nUpon reflection, she's showing signs she wants to get back together but I'm not currently taking the bait. \n\nHave I dodged a bullet here?
