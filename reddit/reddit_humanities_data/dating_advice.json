            "I met someone in person a few weeks ago, and the moment I saw him, I had this instinct to talk to him. I was casually invited to trivia by a neighbor I am close with, and that's how we met. I kicked myself for not getting his number the night we met after having a great night of laughing and talking. I told him last night to give me his phone and I put my number in it and told him to use it. \n\nFor the past several years, I have been deathly scared to date after dating all the wrong men and losing a child with one of them. Worthiness and confidence have been hurdles for me. In the past year, I've lost 20 pounds and I feel incredibly happy most days rather than dreadful and fat and sad. I'm hoping there's more good to come!",
            "I went on a date with somebody recently. Last time we talked was 8 years ago. I thought I would give him a chance to see how things go. He really wanted to kiss me. When we get back to my place. Nothing wrong with that. But after we kiss a little. I almost puked. I know we went on a sushi date but still. It was so embarrassing I actually took him home. I felt bad but I don\u2019t know if this had happened before.",
            "Hypothetically if I had no criteria for a woman, like as long as they are breathing and alive I will take them.\u00a0\n\nWhat would be the fastest way to get one?\u00a0",
            "So what\u2019s the science between (Hinge) girls ghosting me when I\u2019m way more attractive than them? I don\u2019t think they\u2019re doing much better than me",
            "I'm a little confused.  What is meant by \"when someone starts to become dry\" and perhaps you can elaborate on the context here?",
            "They aren\u2019t animals you\u2019re trying to trap. Have a (normal) conversation with one and see where things end up. Most women want an emotional connection before a physical one",

        "content": "I was seeing this guy for about 3 months. At first he came on really strong - asked me to go out with him multiple times, I finally agreed and we met. Things were pretty ok when we met. He was intelligent, interesting, good looking. The first week we met he initiated and took me on literally 4 dates. Was overwhelming for me but I was having a nice time and kept seeing him. After being in an abusive relationship the consistency was nice. \n\nHe kept being super intense in a weird way - talking about our future children, offered to buy me a new cell phone, calling himself a \"father figure\" to my dog, asking me to go on trips months ahead. I'm new to the city and he basically furnished my apartment. Of course I recognized this was *a lot* but my friends told me he must just be excited about me and to see where it goes. \n\nI slept with him about a month in. The sex was ok, not bad and not amazing. But the more I started opening up the more distant he became. Eventually I was the only one initiating dates and reaching out. I obviously knew something was off, but I figured he'd just say something if he wasn't feeling. He wound up going on a week long vacation - we didn't speak while he was away - and he sent me some 'you are great but I am withdrawing because its not fair to you\" kind of stupid text. \n\nWhich is fine but like - what? He was SO eager and basically had to twist my arm to get me to go out with him. Then when I finally open up months later he is bored? Like who does that? I don't take him spending money on me too seriously - he's rich and money doesn't mean anything to him. But why not just find a hookup or someone who wants causal sex instead of love bombing for several months??? \n\nIt wasn't long or meaningful enough for me to have feelings for him. But why tf did this man waste my time and energy? There are so many easier ways to get laid. Genuinely it would help me to understand what goes on in someone's head when they do this? ",

Chase is over. There are some very good articles on YouTube about it.",
            "Can you elaborate more on what does it mean by started opening up? Were you sharing your vulnerable side ?",
            "Why do I get the feeling he kind of used you for sex?  And the whole furnishing a space.  Sounds like a quid pro quo to me lol..",
            "Welcome to Avoidant Attachment!  This is CLASSIC behavior on his part. \n\nCheck out attachment theory and this will make sense.",
            "While it is possible that he was lying, manipulating you, only look for sex, etc, it's also possible that he got to know you and get intimate with you and decided that you two don't fit. Just because a few first dates go nicely doesn't mean that a man would marry you and that he was lying about his intentions.",
            "Maybe he was attracted initially but then realized it's not what he wants. You were still in the early getting to know phase.\n\nIt happens. Youll getover it.",
            "Some people find someone they are attracted to and assume they are perfect before getting to know them and as soon as they show real human traits they lose that limerence. They may be addicted to that feeling too and once they realize the other person has needs\u2026. Sounds like it was fun while it lasted.",
            "Could be a narcissist. Not everyone wants quick sex. Some people enjoy the chase, the emotional rollercoaster, winning you over. Sex is not the goal, it\u2019s the cherry on top, the prize is your heart, your emotional investment and attachment, the hormones of that hot romance. And he could genuinely tell himself - this is the one, I\u2019ll go all in and this time it will be different, he might be chasing love and then gets bored maybe because he never really let himself be vulnerable with you but rather smashed his way in with all the attention and gifts and what not. I watched the groundhog day the other day and maybe go watch it too, Bill Murray\u2019s character is totally self absorbed. He quickly figures out strategies to hook a girl in but he can\u2019t force love, not with all the gestures, because it shouldn\u2019t be manufactured it just happens. There should be enough space for the girl to say - yes, I claim him as my own and want it too, if it\u2019s all him chasing you non-stop and you have no time to breathe it won\u2019t work, because very soon he\u2019ll be moving on to the next one. And he knows he hacked his way in.",
            "What an idiot 40 years old and still playing these types of games.  I swear shit like this pisses me off \u2026  honestly I\u2019ve delt with these types of men before and learned my lesson from them \u2026hopefully something like this doesn\u2019t happen to you again\u2026 I would definitely block him or just cut him off completely",

She insulted me and I was too mortified to talk so I just hang up on her. She texts me and all of it was just insults and I was angry so insulted her back. I called the guy the next day and he just said that what the girl said was true .I didn't even cry I just laughed because how much of  a coward was he that he couldn't tell me we were over . He texts me and says she is everything he ever prayed for and I didn't know what to say. I felt bad for a couple of days and talked to some friends and I was over him but now I am scared of ever dating again because I don't want to get hurt.. please advice..\nAnd I still think about this guy sometimes but I don't miss him I just feel a pit in my stomach because I couldn't see the red flags\n",

Because while it's true that the bar is in hell, there are good men out there. Most of us don't want to end up without a relationship and HE isn't worth being your last guy let alone the one that scared you off forever. That girl didn't inherit your man. She inherited your problem. Better it be done now than after 7 years or something insane like that.",

It\u2019s easier to cheat doing long distance.  He will likely cheat on his new girlfriend too, so you dodged a bullet.  You protect yourself by going slow.  That\u2019s really All you can do.",

Rule of thumb, don't ever get into a relationship that starts as long distance, don't consider it exclusive if there is no meeting friends or family or being at their place or sofial media posts of just the 2 of you, if their phone is set to silent whenever ur together and they check it and type  quick messages and but it back down- they are probably in a relationship. Always be on the lookout for off behavior or things that don't make sense. People lie and cheat all the time or say/act however they need to to get sex.   Trust takes time, only s fool trust someone soon. too soon in a relationship.",

This experience taught you stuff to look out for, that's how most people figure out red flags and move accordingly after the fact. It won't always be like that. And a day will come where you think of him less, and then hardly ever at all."
