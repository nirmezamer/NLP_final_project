        "content": "So let me started off that i've only ever finished three games and a prototype so I'm semi-new to blueprints and programming in general. and my only experience with making enemy ai's is really simple survival-horror monsters (like the old-school silent hill/resident evil kind that just walks towards you slowly to attack you)\n\ni wanted to ask the best way to go about creating a \"state machine\" like system in ue5 (since it does seem like ue has one). I sort of have a vague idea of how I would do that but it's kinda messy and not super automated (figured I'd have an integer ID for different states?)\n\nI know behavior trees are \"better\" but i'm working on an indie soulslike and the combat in soulslike games seem like they'd be easier to make in a state machine since they based on enemy phases, from what i've read behavior trees aren't great at replicating a set number of sequences to be called at given times\n\nhad to scrap the enemy AI twice, first because the nodes were spaghetti which cased the ai to act \"confused\" and second because i needed a pattern to play on a loop, and the loop decorator seems to not work? Figured this kind of thing would probably be easier to hardcode...\n\n  \nedit: should probably point out that most youtube tutorials don't actually explain \\*how\\* the behavior tree works, and the best thing I could find was on a unreal dev forum post",

            "You can use a state machine in your AI Controller, and swap whichever Behavior Tree they are running for the current state.",
            "Use a state tree. They are behavior trees + state machines. Organize your AI tasks into state tree tasks and assign transitions. You can keep any AI-related code+data not related to tasks inside the AI controller class, which you can also create child classes for if you need even more specialized behavior. This is basically the most powerful solution unreal has for anything AI related, without digging into cpp and designing a system yourself.",
            "I work in a large studio in the uk.\n\nCurrently we use state trees with a system we built to manage the trees with utility AI.\nBasically every state tree is relatively small and accomplish something easy and scoped.\nEach state tree will have a value assigned that is calculated based on the conditions in the world.\n\nThis is the best approach because otherwise you will use large behaviour tree or state trees that become a pain to debug/update.",
            "FWIW, Unreal has State Trees you can use instead of behavior trees. they're newer and not as fleshed out, but see if they'd suit your needs.",
            "Check out [Logic Driver](https://logicdriver.com/). It's on the Epic Marketplace. The Lite version (_free_) is a full featured state machine which would satisfy most people's needs. The Pro version has some pretty nifty features.\n\nThe editor is similar to the Animation Blueprint state graph. Each node is blueprintable, C++, or can be another state machine.\n\nIMO, it's an easier workflow than Behavior Trees or the new UE StateTree. Specially, if your logic tends to jump around states a lot.",
            "that's a great idea! how do I get a behavior tree to play on a loop tho? it seems to only run once on Begin Play and then stop. Would event tick with a delta second delay be a bad idea...? (again new to this part of unreal, so sorry if this question is incomprehensibly dumb lmao)",
            "Behavior trees should always return to the root node and start again.  It's possible that you have custom Tasks that are not properly marked as ended"

But if the platform is moving, how do I update the player movement to follow along with the platform?\n\nAttach to actor doesn't seem to work, I want to be able to grab onto a moving platform, latch on, and then jump off at a different point. So far my player just latches on where it detects the hit from the line trace, and then the platform moves on without it.",

            "It sounds like you need a way for your platform to dispatch movement information to anything hanging onto it. I would bind and unbind these events when latching onto a platform and jumping off.\n\nWhat information you use might need a little bit of experimentation to find what produces the exact results you want. If you're working on a single-player game and there aren't really any complicated physics going on with the platform then I'd imagine updating a hanger's location every tick would work well enough. The hanger's location just lerps along with the platform. If the platform wobbles, twists, and tumbles then you'll want to account for that as well. If you need to replicate anything then you're beyond the scope of my ability to be of any help.",
            "I think you should be using \"Attach to Component\" and specify which component in the platform actor you want to attach to. Here's an example I have where I attach the player to a Scene Component of a block, disable player movement input and instead use player input to move the block with the player attached until they hit the release button: https://imgur.com/6Q5k9XJ"
