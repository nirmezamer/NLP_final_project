            "Just an FYI. I got tickets from another Redditor for tomorrows show. ShowClix confirmed via email that for KT shows specifically, the vendor WILL NOT allow the name of the purchaser to be updated. Ill still try to get in, but if they do turn me away Id suggest NOT buying secondhand KT tickets. We even told them that it was a gift, and ShowClix said too bad.\n\nEDIT: I got in no problem. They scanned my QR and gave us wristbands before they checked ID to make sure we were over 21. Then a pretty thorough pat down. Sorry for freaking anyone out. Also last nights show was dope, yall are gonna be in for a surprise.",

I love his style but always thought things felt a bit forced some times. I was especially apprehensive bringing people who had no idea who he was.\n\nAll I can say after seeing him last night is that he blew my expectations out of the water. Casey had my entire group in absolute tears as his set progressed. He seemed so comfortable up there and watching him rif live when he has a fully hour to play with is truly watching an artist at work. \n\nThe set was a great mix of absolutely ridiculous stories, punchlines, and just straight up nonsense that flowed so well together. He's so believable and authentically himself on stage. I really don't think fitting him in a 1 minute window or watching him on TV compliments his style. He needs to be riffing live with a crowd.\n\nThe whole place was in a standing ovation after his set. 10/10",
