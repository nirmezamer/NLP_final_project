            "My Zooz switches have been terrible. I'm so sorry. I hope you have a better experience. \n\nA lot of mine just died randomly. On others, when the power flickers, I have to turn my breakers off/on to get switches to work again. They're not compatible with lots of lighting, so you get flickering, bad dimming, etc",
            "First, you need to strategically place your always powered nodes (i.e. switches/dimmers). These devices are responsible for routing traffic back to the controller. Initially install enough switches to cover the front-of-house-to-controller and back-of-house-to-controller. Typically 3-hops in either direction is more than enough to cover a big house. Apply the same technique going vertical (up/down floors). Keep good notes. Create a location diagram. Good luck."

            "The encode plus is a great door lock so that's an easy yes if it matches your other locks in the house. The doorbell camera is kinda subjective. I would avoid nest unless you already have similar devices in that ecosystem. Ring will be a little better, ubiquity will be even better and runs locally.",

American company that makes very high-quality products that just work.  ui.com\n\nThe Nest doorbell is good, but I didn't want have to have a separate app from my home security cameras and my doorbell.\n\nSchlage lock is really good, but i never use the apple wallet integration.  the keypad on the door was faster and more convenient."

        "content": "We're in a home that has several skylights in hard to reach places. It gets pretty hot during the day so we're planning to put in blinds for skylights. My requirements are: motorized, blackout, apple homekit compatible, preferably without need for replacing batteries. After hours of sifting through Reddit and Google, I've come across a few solutions:\n\n1. Lutron. This seems top of the line, highly researched and engineered but I've been quoted $4k minimum per shade. That's kind of insane and would escalate quickly with multiple shades. If there were a similar solution at half the price I'd jump on it. \n\n2. Online shops like blindsgalore or select blinds. Quality seems inconsistent and most seem to be missing homekit compatibility. They are at a fraction of the cost of lutron and kind of get the job done. \n\n3. Other brand names like Hunter Douglas. Still expensive, but not as much. Homekit compatibility seems inconsistent. \n\n4. Get non motorized blinds and then use something like Smarter Home to automate and motorize. There's uncertainty about how these products would integrate and I don't want to get stuck with some products that don't work well together. \n\nWhat's the Reddit rec on this to meet requirements while controlling for cost? Am I missing any other ideas? Is Lutron worth it if we're planning to be here for at least seven years? What's the next best option next to Lutron that's maybe half the price while still meeting reqs?",

            "IKEA hits all of the requirements except they\u2019re battery powered. However even with mine automatically going up and down daily, they\u2019ve only needed to be charged once every 5 months or so. Would that be acceptable? They\u2019re about $150-250/shade depending on the size and style",
            "Have two local blinds dealers come out and give you an estimate. I suspect they\u2019ll be slightly more expensive than what you can do the job yourself for. Plus, if there\u2019s a problem, it\u2019s on them. \n\nSkylight shade installation can be a pain, especially in the heat of summer and openings that are out of square.",
            "I have to second this suggestion. Definitely well worth consideration. You'd have to add a side track for skylights, but that's something you might even want to do on normal vertically oriented windows to stop that bit of light bleeding around the side edges. And there's really no reason you couldn't easily wire the Ikea blinds if you have the wiring in place.",
