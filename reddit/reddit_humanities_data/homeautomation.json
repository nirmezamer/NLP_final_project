            "Didn't see it mentioned here, but I'd start with pairing your first switches nearest your Z-Wave hub and work your way outward. \n\nDepends on the size of your house (assuming fairly big since you have 50 switches) but if you start furthest from the hub, the signal may not reach or it will be weak.\n\nZ-Wave works as a mesh, so if you pair closest to the hub, as you work your way outward, your furthest devices will use the ones closest to help pair.\n\nHope that helps and good luck!\n\nEric\n\nFounder | Inovelli",
            "Plan on doing this over a few weekends, honestly. It'll probably take longer than you expect. You're bound to run into boxes that are really cramped and take longer, or other random things you didn't expect.\n\nUse a level to get them straight/vertical, especially in multi-gang boxes. Switch plates screw into the switches, not the boxes, so they need to be level and evenly spaced. \n\nHave a good naming convention figured out ahead of time, and stuck with it. No duplicate names, but also no overly long names. If you use voice control, your family will appreciate this in the long run. \n\nTest as you go. \n\nI highly suggest using Wago 221 lever nuts instead of twist wire nuts, but both are up to code and it's kind of a personal preference. Code allows you to mix solid and stranded wire with Wago's, but not with twist wire nuts. \n\nI replaced every switch in my house (except for a few, like the garbage disposal) with smart switches. I did a good chunk of them in one day, then did the rest a few at a time over the next month or two.\n\nEdit: I can't seem to find anything that says solid to stranded in a wire nut is against code. It's just a general pain, and they don't stay together very well. Wago's are generally the accepted/suggested way to do it, but wire nuts appear to be \"okay\" from what I can find. Still, use Wago's for this.",

Its all good now.\n\nBe warned, the further away the switch is, the longer it will take and might fail. Luckily, if the update fails, pull the breaker and reset it and it will work again.

My requirements are: motorized, blackout, apple homekit compatible, preferably without need for replacing batteries. After hours of sifting through Reddit and Google, I've come across a few solutions:\n\n1. Lutron. This seems top of the line, highly researched and engineered but I've been quoted $4k minimum per shade. That's kind of insane and would escalate quickly with multiple shades. If there were a similar solution at half the price I'd jump on it. \n\n2. Online shops like blindsgalore or select blinds. Quality seems inconsistent and most seem to be missing homekit compatibility. They are at a fraction of the cost of lutron and kind of get the job done. \n\n3. Other brand names like Hunter Douglas. Still expensive, but not as much. Homekit compatibility seems inconsistent. \n\n4. Get non motorized blinds and then use something like Smarter Home to automate and motorize. There's uncertainty about how these products would integrate and I don't want to get stuck with some products that don't work well together. \n\nWhat's the Reddit rec on this to meet requirements while controlling for cost? Am I missing any other ideas? Is Lutron worth it if we're planning to be here for at least seven years? What's the next best option next to Lutron that's maybe half the price while still meeting reqs?",

        "content": "Hi folks, have a bit of an odd one here, hoping someone might have a suggestion. I have a picket fence around the property, and the main gate consists of two parts (one that's always closed, and one that opens/closes - the left one in the image). Because of problems with delivery people ignoring signs (and a resulting dog bite), I needed to find a way to keep them from coming in. At first I tried a carabiner in the lower latch, basically something that jammed the gate latch from opening but was easy enough to remove if a friend wanted to use the gate. Delivery people just ignored that as well, so I ended up having to do a deadbolt on the top of the gate as seen.\n\nWhat I'm looking for are ideas for something that can lock the gate but be easily opened by authorized people. Smart locks or pads that friends can open with their phone would be good, or perhaps just a different idea? Really appreciate any pointers or suggestions - been hard finding something that can work with this style gate!\n\nThank you in advance!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8clewl77be9d1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4c97d6cc449157e13b1fe39b6734e3c8727c2ee\n\n",

        "content": "I finally got fed up with Homeseer, and made the switch to Hubitat. Holy cow, I'm never looking back, and I wish I started with that in the first place.\n\nDuring my 14 months with Homeseer, I had nothing but problems with all their products, and I say this despite being a very technically-minded, big ol'nerd:\n\n-Devices would drop off the znet and have to be re-added every few weeks. \n\n-Battery powered buttons would drop off within days, and have to be factory reset in order to get them running. \n\n-I had six WX300 switches die in a cascade over the course of six months. Customer service remoted in, and found that the diagnostics would show that the switch worked, but it wouldn't actually control the load, despite having worked for months. I got so frustrated that, as a sanity check, I had an electrician come out and check my power, and make sure I had wired everything correctly (despite doing various electrical work my whole life). When I asked customer service to send the replacements via faster shipping, because I was leaving in two weeks for a deployment, they said \"sure!\", and then sat on the order for ten days, then shipped them despite me telling them to hold the order while I was overseas. My kind neighbor saw and picked up the package for me, otherwise it woud have sat outside in the rain for months. \n\n-Customer service would also just sit on messages and requests in their internal message box for weeks, and it would take an hour on hold to get ahold of someone to address the issue. \n\n-The authorization for the Tuya wifi smart plugs they sell would de-authorize itself every couple months, and need to be reset. \n\n-I would have to power cycle the znet before and after adding every single device. \n\n-I spent hours on the phone with customer service for various other issues, and the online documentation for HS4 is hot garbage.\n\nAnd that's not to mention the final straw, which was the bait-and-switch of requiring a subscription to make voice integration work. I got back from a long trip and found that the voice commands I'd used for a year didn't work. I didn't even try troubleshooting, because I'd had enough. I bought HS4Pro, the znet, and paid ~$40 for the Sonos integration plugin so that I'd never have to have a subscription or be reliant on the cloud, so, no thanks.\n\nThe one good thing I'll say is that the technical service rep, Tyler, was super helpful, patient, and knowledgeable once I was able to get him on the phone. \n\nI was tempted to try Home Assistant, which still sounds amazingly capable, but automation isn't a hobby for me and I didn't want to have to study just to make my lights come on when I walk up the stairs. Instead, I bought the Hubitat C8 and was up and running in no time. The rule engine takes a bit of getting used to, but they have easy-to-find instructional videos that actually show you how to build rules for different use cases. The GUI layout is so much more intuitive, and they don't bury commonly used features within similarly named menus like HS4. All my switches, plugs, and battery-powered buttons stay connected, and voice integration works great, without any subscription BS. \n\nDifferent vein, but I also recently bought some LoRaWAN products from Yolink, and the setup and programming was shockingly easy. I could hardly believe it after dealing with HS.\n\nI finally disconnected my znet this week, and put it on the shelf. It's so unreliable that I'd feel bad selling it and passing issues onto someone else.\n\nAu revoir, Homeseer. ",

            "I used HomeSeer for years.  Loved it.  It worked great, and I had everything dialed in just the way I wanted it.  \n\nBut it was showing its age.  Going from HS3 to HS4 brought some new interface stuff, but you still had to drop down to the old interface for certain plugins (like z-wave) which meant more clicks.  And the 'new' Z-Wave plugin had *even more* clicks to change parameters and whatnot.  The event engine was also limited by severe lack of an 'else' function.  \n\nI'd tried Home Assistant a few years previous but found it unapproachable since all the 'helpful' guides included writing pages of YAML to get basic stuff like lights to turn on.  No thanks.  \nBut last year I gave it another go and *holy crap* what a difference.  All the basic stuff Just Works, z-wave parameters have descriptions already for almost everything (not just HS products), and using blueprints with areas I can do the same functionality in one automation that would take 5-10 HomeSeer events.  \nPlus let's not forget costs-- on HS, plugins are closed source, they cost $10-$40, and are usually developed by one guy.  On HA, plugins are free/open source, and have code contributions from dozens or hundreds of people.  \n\nI still like HS.  I hear they've switched their z-wave engine to Z-Wave JS UI which is a big step forward.  Their hardware has been good also- their floodlight sensor for example is pretty great as is the plug-in motion sensor.",

I have HS200\u2019s and 300\u2019s and they\u2019ve been flawless.\n\nThe only issue I ever had was windows updates rebooting the system and HomeSeer wouldn\u2019t restart. That was fixed when it was able to be set up to run as a service and auto start on reboot. \n\nOther than that, it\u2019s been fantastic.\n\nEdit: And I don\u2019t think the price of their Alexa API integration is outrageous.
