Can you stretch your budget if significant quality/features improve at a slightly higher price point? AutoModerator will remind you automatically if it does not see a budget in your title or post; you can go back and edit the post if you forget. Please include currency.\n\n**Source/Amp** \\- What are you plugging the headphones into?\n\n**How the gear will be used** \\- E.g. Do you need noise isolation? Will this be primarily for home listening? Do you do a lot of flying (on airplanes)? Are you hard on gear?\n\n**Preferred tonal balance** \\- Are you a bass-head, focused on accurate acoustic timbre, looking for sparkly treble, or do you want a tonally balanced pair of headphones?\n\n**Preferred music genre(s)** \\- What do you listen to? Provide examples if it's something obscure.\n\n**Past** **gear experience** \\- What have you used in the past? What did you like about it and what didn't you like about it?\n\n# \"thank you\" system:\n\nWe have employed a \"thank you\" system for submissions.

Not only when putting them on but also when wearing them and I take a drink of water or chew something. I don't play as many multiplayer games anymore, mostly single player, so I don't really need the mic and I'm wondering if there's anything out there that's better for gaming. Overall I thought the PC38X sounded fine but I wasn't blown away by them by any means.\n\nHow do the Philips Fidelio X2HR or Beyerdynamic DT 990 PRO sound in comparison in terms of detail, bass, and soundstage? Are there any other open back alternatives roughly in the same price range that I'm missing?",
