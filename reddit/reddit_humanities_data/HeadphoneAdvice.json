        "content": "Hi guys,\n\nI've tested nearly every high end headphone there is (focal utopia, focal stellia, focal clear mg, etc) at a local store on a $5k usd amp and found all of them to be snake oil and I really didn't enjoy them.\n\nAfter going home and spending hours reading all of your reviews on this sub heavily recommending the Monarch MK3 due to its fantastic bass (i love bass), I ended up biting the bullet and bought the Monarch MK3. I really enjoyed them. However, they hurt my ear canal, cost $1k usd and I'm seriously worried about hearing loss due to how far they go into my ears and hurt. So I'm now looking to get my hands on the Audeze GX and the Sennheiser 650, to protect myself from any chance of hearing loss. I've also heard fantastic stuff about those 2 headphones, and the price is very reasonable compared to the other $3k+ snake oil from focal\n\nAnd I've read that an AMP/Dac is a 'must' for the Audeze GX and the Sennheiser 650, but after testing so much snake oil I'm of course very skeptical. So i'd like to know the cheapest AMP/DAC I could get away to run these 2 headphones to their full potential without any snake oil that costs $4000 for nothing.\n\nPlease let me know!\n\n  \nEDIT: My PC has a high end Dark Hero maximus motherboard, so not sure if a DAC is really necessary or just an AMP, but here's what the description says: \"**Immersive Audio**: ROG SupremeFX ALC4082 codec with\u00a0ESS^(\u00ae) ES9218 Quad DAC for up to 32-Bit/384 kHz playback\". Let me know if I should get both a DAC/AMP or just an AMP.",

            "Something small and portable like the fiio ka5 will probably do just fine. Unless you want something bigger for yout desk setup.",
            "Thanks. Is the AMP a lot more important than the DAC? do you think the DAC is worth to get or not if I go with the Atom or Modi?",
            "amps have a greater impact on the sound over a dac. some people feel dacs make no difference to sound at all unless you get into the high-end range. the apple dongle works fine but its limitation is that it can only output 1vmrs. A dedicated dac typically does at least 2vmrs. this just helps the amp drive the headphones better.  if you have the budget and can swing getting the dac, it cant hurt. the dac also has ports for additional sources, like optical or rca on top of the usb you will use for your pc. also - schiit and jds labs are american companies and their products are made in america. they do charge shipping so you can probably save a few bux buying both up front. really up to you and how you plan to use your headphones.",
            "heads up - I corrected my first post. the Schiit amp is Magni. Modi is the matching dac.",
            "thanks, if i go with the atom2 should i still get a dac? if so which one",
            "These arent the cheapest, but they are amazing price/performance. \n\nLook at the JDS Labs Atom 2.. It goes for $129.\n \nOr\n\nLook at the Schiit Magni. It goes for $119. \n\nEither of these will work great with your choices of headphones. As for DAC  -you can start with your motherboard. Get a 3.5mm to RCA cable. Plug the line out on the back to the AMP's RCA and see how it works. Another cheap option is getting the Apple Dongle ($8) which works as a DAC. Its a usb-c to 3.5mm jack. So you will still use the same 3.5mm cable to RCAs to the amp. \n\nand if you still feel like you need more, then you could buy the matching DAC for each of these amps (Atom DAC 2 or Modi  -both $129) \nAlso something to note - you can get the Drop HD6xx headphones. They are  basically the same exact headphones as the HD650 (still made by Sennheiser). If will save you $150-$200 or so from buying HD650. That covers the cost of the Amp.",
            "I like Fiio stuff I\u2019m using the K9 AKM now. Have used K5 as well which is great. Haven\u2019t tried the K7.  Also have used stacks but too many cords for me. I like all-in-ones. \n\n\nMegadealzone on eBay offers open box Fiio products also aliexpress has deals that can be better than Amazon.",
            "thanks for your comment. In all honesty, I have no idea what's the difference between a dac/amp or just an AMP and what is necessary exactly.\n\n  \nMy PC has a high end Dark Hero maximus motherboard, so not sure if a DAC is really necessary, but here's what the description says: \"**Immersive Audio**: ROG SupremeFX ALC4082 codec with\u00a0ESS^(\u00ae) ES9218 Quad DAC for up to 32-Bit/384 kHz playback\"",
            "Your PCs DAC is perfectly fine as long as you don't hear a fuzz or audible distortion from interference since the DAC is encased in a PC full of electrical parts. Unfortunately, it's hard to know if it's supplying enough or correctly applying power to the headphones. They're usually pretty quiet on specs.\n\nThe only thing to watch out for is Asus's bullshit software adding filters, effects, or simulated surround (unless you like those things but they're almost always not good) so make sure those are turned off. \n\nA solid external DAC/Amp combo is great to have because it's essentially insurance that your cans are being fed clean, properly and at the correct amount or at least moreso than whatever Asus tosses on a motherboard. Of course, chances are you're just fine, especially if you're happy with the sound you're getting and it's pop/distortion free. If you got the extra cash lying around then I think a JDS labs atom2 stack will last the rest of your days. Is it more than you currently need? Yes. But it doesn't go into obscene snake oil price territory either. It'll work great whether you plug $40 headphones into it or  $2500 headphones.",

The \u201cS\u201d sound of female vocals in some songs came off as quite offensive to me. Now I wonder if the Edition XS, which has slightly less detail than the Ananda and thus is probably slightly less sharp, eliminates that problem. Does anyone have any experience with these?\n\nThanks in advance! ",
