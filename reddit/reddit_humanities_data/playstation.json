Do you guys have any suggestions for us? \n\nWe like games like, Baldurs Gate 3, Call of Duty, Witcher 3 or Halo. \n\nWe have 1 console so it must be a game where splitscreen is an option and not only online like Avatar the Frontiers of Pandora. (We wanted to play this one but realized you can only play together online\ud83d\ude2d) \n\nI\u2019m really curious if you guys have any suggestions and also thank you in advance! \ud83e\udd29",

I found the platforming to be extremely clunky and hard to forgive. The narrative is interesting and you can tell that the devs are film nerds (Ken Russell would adore this game), but overall I left it a little sour feeling like it could have done a ton more in gameplay for as ambitious as it is in its story.",

On that, you have your games in a list, and there's tabs **below** it for the eShop, gallery, settings.. etc. They're not all thrown together like they are on PS5."
