I guess you could just do the main story of that game in like 30 hours, but that\u2019s missing a ton of the best content. I spent like 80 hours on that game. \n\nLast game is Persona 5, OP.",

If yes then it's still inaccurate because AC Mirage is less than 10h to beat just the story. 20h is more like completionist.  \nCyberpunk is easily 80-100h completionist.  \nDeath Stranding is also 100h completionist.  \nBoth Elden Ring and Baldur's Gate 3 are around 140h completionist.",

        "content": "I was extremely indecisive about whether to play FFVII Rebirth or FFXVI, but in the end, I chose to go with FFXVI because of its mature rating and linear gameplay structure. I'm a bit bored of open worlds, so this game will feel like a breath of fresh air. I think I'll choose to play in quality mode instead of performance mode because Digital Foundry stated that the performance mode is unstable and blurry. I'd rather have a steady 30 FPS than an unstable \"60\" FPS with frame pacing issues.\n",
