        "content": "Hello everyone,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy nature of the content featured here this subreddit can attract some less savoury types of comments. The mod team thought it a good idea to remind everyone of reddit's sitewide content policy, of which rule one \"[remember the human](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy)\" prohibits hatespeech of any kind. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe moderate just a little bit more stringent than the content policy would strictly demand from us, in order to make sure this subreddit  does not fall into territory where we are in danger of seeing the place banned. We also want to keep our comment sections a healthy place for people to talk to each other and this means that we enforce civility and [reddiquette](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439-Reddiquette). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs you may already know, we have compiled a list of talking points [in our wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/wiki/bigotry) which outline the type of talking points we do not allow here. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a public service announcement we will post this text in its entirety below. Please keep in mind that this list is non-exhaustive and is added to regularly. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease assist the mod team in keeping this place fun and healthy by reporting hate when you see it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you and have a happy Pride Month,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthe r/PublicFreakout mod team\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn this subreddit, we affirm that we stand with BLM, LGBTQ+, and other routinely disparaged groups.  Therefore, after consulting with multiple organisations who are active and knowledgeable on these topics, we are further formalising and clarifying Rule 4.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe purpose of this post is to provide common examples of bigotry upon which we, as moderators, will take action.  Please keep in mind that we will not be debating these topics individually, but you are more than welcome to head to r/socialjustice101 to either ask in good faith about these topics, or, if you are already familiar with them, to educate others.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\#This list is non-exhaustive, may be updated frequently, and is applicable to moderator discretion\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\#Racism: \n\n\\* against African Americans or black people in general:\n\n \\* black crime statistics, \"black on black violence\"\n\n \\* any variation on \"despite being 13% of the population, black people commit 50% of the violent crime\"  <- this is literally a copypasta/meme created by the white supremacist website, Stormfront.

However, much of what is purported to be factual is actually twisted by inherent racism. For example, the assertion that black people commit more violent crime than white people is false: In fact, black people are arrested/convicted for violent crime more often than white people. The statistic does not represent a fact-based commentary on a racial proclivity; it represents a way in which systemic racism has unfairly maligned a historically marginalised portion of the population.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFurthermore, even objective facts can be presented in a manner that promotes (or is promoted by) a racist agenda. It may be factual to state that a given entertainer is Jewish, for instance, but if that point is being raised as a means of insinuating something anti-Semitic, it is nonetheless an example of bigotry. Statements of this sort are referred to as \"dog-whistles;\" as coded phrases that are ostensibly based in fact, but which are being presented with bad-faith intentions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDog-whistles, implied bigotry, and memetic phrases with bigoted subtexts are all forbidden.  Please note that there's a different between attacking a disparaged group who cannot change how they were born, and attacking memberships of groups (e.g. saying \"ACAB\" is not bigotry.  Cops can quit, black people can't stop being black).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCivil criticism of religion, governments, and groups/organisations are fully permitted. Attacks on individuals for belonging to those groups, or veiled attacks that are instead meant to target and attack a nation/race of people that practice these faiths, is forbidden.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny language which ascribes the behaviour of an individual to an entire group, or vice versa, is unacceptable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEvery human deserves to be treated as a human.  No exceptions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you don't understand some of the reasons behind these additions, that's ok.  Many people are at different points on their path to education, and everyone should treat it as a process vice a destination.  We encourage users to head over to r/socialjustice101 to either ask about specific points or to explain them to other users if you do understand. We won't be debating these here or in modmail as that's not a debate forum.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading",
