I have used Linux mint cinnamon for 4 months, I like using but kinda wanted to do reinstall it, but I also want to try Debian with KDE for a while.\n\nMy use of OS is programming,  using browser alot, and gaming.\n\nI have read that gaming on Debian is not good, but games I play are bit older, and don't play much  multiplayer games. It's mostly some indie game or old game (old like 3 or more year old) that doesn't require high end hardware.\n\nAlso I tried on Virtual-box and a live USB, network worked fine, was able to use browser, I think I had bit problem on virtual-box with audio but as much I remember on live USB it worked fine.\n\nMy reason to consider installing Debian is just that I want to try KDE, mint does everything I need but trying new stuff is fun.\n\nMy concern is with games working properly, not much trouble with drivers.\n\nAlso is using KDE with Debian good idea?  if not is there better option of DE for Debian.\n\nEdit : I forgot to add in post that I have NVIDIA GPU and AMD CPU.",

            "I think everyone should try Debian. Its a solid everyday driver that you can customise as much or as little as you need; my install is tweaked for music production for example but its also what I boot to just to check emails and that sort of thing. That said, I have a Garuda install that Im using for gaming, its just easier to get there on a gaming-focused distro. Totally doable on Debian mind you, especially with backports, just more time and trial and error.",
            "I dont game but Ive been on Debian Testing with LXQt and Labwc for months without a problem. I fiddle with programming and its been great.",
            "I'm using KDE on Debian and really happy with it. If you install NVIDIA proprietary driver it will work just same as on other distros.\n\nHowever, if your main purpose is just to do a \"distro hop\" and try KDE, You can also consider KDE neon or rolling release distros as they have latest KDE. You know, Debian is a distro which is focusing on stability.",
            "If you a Nvidia user, search for installing your drivers firstly. I am a Debian 12 user after 2 years experience of Ubuntu, my biggest problem was Nvidia drivers.",
            "I just installed debian after trying ubuntu, mint and kubuntu and i can say this is great! It's an OS straight from heaven. It doesn't have any bugs and problem.\nI suggest you try it",

            "Ok, so I haven't used Linux Mint before and might just be confused, but can't you just...install...kde on Linux Mint?",
            "If you want to try KDE Plasma 6.0 or 6.1, maybe Fedora would be a better choice. Even Debian Testing is still on 5.27. And somehow, I think Debian + KDE hasn't been the best combo when I've tried it, but maybe I just don't like KDE.",
            "Debian is fairly DE agnostic. It's not like Ubuntu or Fedora where the main release has one and others maintain alternatives. Debian will just roll with whatever DE you throw at it. Barring some really lesser known ones. \n\nGaming on Debian is about the same as any other distro of Linux. As always though every game is going to be different. Some work flawlessly on Linux while others need some customization to work well and others are just a no go period. So checking sources like Lutris, ProtonDB, or WineAppDB might be helpful for you get an idea. If the games worked on Linux Mint then you shouldn't have any issues running them on Debian."

Perhaps take a look through your boot logs with `sudo journalctl -b` scroll down using the down or enter key to near the end and look for the timestamps surrounding the time when the beep happened and see if there are any obvious error messages which might help to diagnose the problem. If you find an error but don't know what it is, paste it here and I'll try to help."

Let me explain. \n\nToday I was setting up my new system, and downloading a lot of flatpaks and stuff. Before I started working on that though I upgraded my system and installed nala. I liked what I saw about nala online so I decided to try it out. No updates on my system (not surprising since Debian doesn\u2019t update very often). But I did run nala fetch because I thought it sounded cool to choose the quickest mirrors. \n\nBut after I installed Distrobox, and messed with it a bit, and installed apps in a box and such I was going to shut down my computer and be done but I decided to check for updates one more time. And 74 packages needed to be updated and 1 installed (which looked like a kernel image?). So what the heck happened? Is there really a big update that got released between when I started working and when I stopped? Or did I mess something up? \n\nI am not sure what direction to go in to find out what this is all about and would appreciate any help. I tried looking on Debian\u2019s security wiki and didn\u2019t see anything for June 29th\u2026 did me using nala somehow change the selection of software my computer uses, like it started using non-free or something ? I\u2019m so confused\u2026 I didn\u2019t mess with any of those settings myself at least\u2026",
