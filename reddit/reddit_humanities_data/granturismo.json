            "Go fast. The SF cars are like no other cars in the game, just let it rip and see what it can do. If you can't take a corner at 80, try it at 120.",
            "If you search you will find this has been answered many times\u2026\n\nYou need to get used to the car, it drives in a very different way, downforce and grip make this car glued to the track but you need to learn to control its power otherwise you\u2019ll easily spin\u2026 patience and repetition are key\u2026\nMichael Schumacher Ferrari\u2019s livery helps as well",
            "a/ practice a lot  \nb/ set difficulty to easy",
            "I did it with ease using the Honda. Run mediums, first 9 laps run at 6 to lean out fuel. If you handle the car correctly, you can no pit the race. Just be patient as you pass, you will catch first and when he pits you're golden.",
            "A lot is confidence. Trust the giant Wings. They stick the car on the ground. also you want to be on the throttle as much as possible. you want to be at full power when you cross the apex so slow down for a corner, have a little throttle applied when rotating and then floor it at the apex and you will make the corner. I allways give advise to let the car roll or apply 25% throttle to stabilse the car mid corner. Use TC1 (or 0 if possible) so you dont spin out. A lot is practice and confidence in the car. also make sure to use your push to pass. you might want to map it to anther button because the default one sucks. The fastest laptimes are achived if you use it out of the corners and to extend topspeed.  \n\n\n\nStart by trying to keep up with the pack. thats a good beginning. see how they drive. that will help you understand where you are faster and exploit those corners.",
            "For whatever reason I passed the license test but cannot come close for the menu races.",
            "go with the 2019 rather than 2023 cars. the older ones are faster.\n\nedit: I see that you are using the 2019 one already.\n\nsecond tip, you need to tume the car.",
            "I would recommend using the \"hood\" cam if you don't already, it helps me stay centered and understand the speed, you usually don't have to brake until 50-25 heading into most turns and it's only a brief brakes it can sweep corners hard. I would set TCS to 2 or 1 and don't change the fuel map. Also, look for tunes online to possibly help a bit too as that can always help too.",

            "Use a carbon fiber decal, it may not be perfect. You may have to paint the car in gloss, then set decals to powder or semi gloss to mimic the carbon on the decal. You can find many of those decals in showcase.",

            "Or you can do it the hard way that looks much better. Make the whole car carbon. Fill in the painted spaces with decals. This is the way I achieve carbon hoods, vents, trim pieces that dont look like crap. The only downside to this is the limitation on finishes for decals. You cant get a fancy lambo factory paint and carbon. I try to paint the car the color I want and color match the decal color before changing it back to carbon to avoid this but some of the fancier paints just wont happen with the color selector.",
            "Did you check showcase for a premade carbon decal that is made for this application, it seems like it would be out there. I would make it for you, but I have no idea how to get it under 15kb, I\u2019ve not managed to make a carbon fiber one yet that is anywhere near small enough.",
            "Option 1. Carbon fiber decal. Most look really iffy though; it\u2019s hard to find a good one that looks nice scaled-up. \n\nOption 2. Paint the whole car carbon fiber, and then a (insert body color here) vinyl over the rest of the car. It\u2019s a long process",
            "This has to be one of the dumbest mechanics in the game.\nI get it when you want to create a blank livery.\nBut why does it remove the window labels, badges, carbon accessories and manufacturer logos just when I want to change the colour :(",
