            "# New PHCJ rules\n\nCheck them out in the sidebar or [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheadscirclejerk/about/rules).\n\nMostly the rules have just been simplified; the only major change is unironic discussion **MUST** be limited to the /unjerk threads or megathreads!\n\nTo all the new girls: this is not the place for boring serious drivel or bone-headed gossip. Also, it's now on sight for *fauxmoi* and *popculturechat* users who break the rules.\n\nstream [360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJW-VvmRKsE)\n\n![img](pz18elnamsrc1)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
