I feel like the most important thing to remember though is that if she isn't into women, then it's important to accept that, but that she should also accept that your a women now. I hope the two of you can atleast stay friends if she isn't into girls, but if she is then I wish the two of you the best through this, and if she's just straight up not accepting of you being trans, then I'm sorry to say this but you may have to cut her out of your life. If she's not there for you, then you have to be there for you.",

Even someone thet loves yiu very much may not be able to be with someone who's gender doesn't match their orientation. That hurts, it really fucking sucks but it's how people can be.\n\nIt's also possible she is lashing out because change is hard and she may come around eventually. Though this is less likely. You could even end up with a close friend instead. But remember Amy, what matters is Your happiness here. Keep exploring yourself, be true to yourself, and what comes, comes. \ud83e\udec2\ud83d\udc9c",
