            "He might seem really scary at first with his uhh being being very big, but when you get used to his patterns it\u2019s really not that bad. Flame vent and firecrackers are the best tools to use against him as they both stun him, remember that although it may not look like it, his attacks can actually be parried! Not the grabs though if he tries to grab you run for your life. Unlike most bosses monke only has one healthbar so as long as you play patiently you will eventually get him, good luck!",

Given what i know about Owls treatment of Wolf, this has me curious if he truly loved him as opposed to seeing him as a mere tool. Maybe im crazy, Maybe hes laughing? Or hes just old and grunty? Idunno. Sounds like crying to me. ",

            "He is pretending to cry so that wolf lowers his guard in order to stab him in the back.",
            "It is amazing what a dirty fighter he is with the moveset he uses, he is the opposite of Isshin when it comes to fighting with honour and integrity and respect, can't call himself a Great Shinobi like Wolf.",
            "I truly believe this game is the Michael Jordan of video games",
            "I think you're right. Owl even says something like \"it varms my heart to see that you have grown, even a little\" refering that Wolf didn't get killed twice by the same move.",
            "That seems like a pretty solid explanation to me!",
            "Definitely the case. The funny thing is he even tries that shit again once you've taken out his first health bar. I cant remember exactly but I think he dramatically drops to his knees and bows to you and says \"W-wait... please...\" then if you walk up to him he throws a smoke bomb and jumps away then calls you an idiot lol!\n\nOwl truly is the definition of a dirty fighter.",
            "He did care in a way. When you kill him in the first fight, he says, \"That's my boy.\" And in the second one, he says it's no altogether unpleasant to be killed by his own son. So he's an evil bastard willing to kill his own son, but he's still proud of wolf and cares in his own way.",
            "Yep it's crocodile tears. Same as claiming he can't raise a hand against Emma while preparing shurikens in a single motion, and same as feigning surrender the first time you hit phase 2 of his bossfight.",
            "so glock saint fights with honor and respect by bringing a glock to a sword fight\u2026ok that\u2019s neat.\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffe",
            "You got two of his lines mixed. Old owl says \"it seems you've grown, if only just a little\", and owl father (hirata version) says \"it warms my heart to see how much you've grown...\" after the first deathblow."

            "They are at their most dangerous when they are out of your striking range. Literally get close to them and they can't shoot you, basically unless you let them. Just hit them and mind their swing attack, parry it and they're become piecemeal of the ashina army.",
            "Poopoobuttholes kindly helped me remember that you do indeed see one of them on your way to the Chained Ogre, but I saw it as \u201coh shit oh fuck some shits making shit blow up\u201d, and ran straight through that encounter. But also speaking of, I feel like I might have actually killed one before, but I either don\u2019t remember it just cause I never had trouble with the one time I saw one, or saw one more recently, and was actually disgusted by how much of my health they would sap me of, with just one hit. In all honesty, I had fought Snake Eyes (Poison Pool one, since I\u2019m hearing there\u2019s 2 of those shitters), and grew a deep hatred for ranged weapons, went back to Ashina because I had already gotten to the main hall of Mt. Senpou, and figured out I needed to kill Genichiro to go further, and explored that area. I was, once again, taken back by the high damage, cause I was assuming they were lower level Ashina members, and wouldn\u2019t do shit against me (although I fought both the spear user, and the other samurai on the salt bridge with the giant katana, right beforehand, and should\u2019ve connected the dots by then.)",
            "are you hesitating, perhaps?\nbut no need for a method, just get your 2 cuts in, hop onto a ledge, and do that till they die (I\u2019ve never seen ng+, I have no clue what the fuck I\u2019m talking about)",
            "no clue what Buddha statue you\u2019re referring to, but you DID make me remember that I had seen an enemy that made shit blow up, so I ran straight through those few enemies, and went on from there. But I don\u2019t ever recall having to kill any of those fucks",
            "May or may not have worded it a bit strangely, but this was just a funny little clip from like 2 or 3 days ago. I figured out a solid method of blocking the first two hits, then running the fuck out of there until he shoots, yadda yadda, rinse and repeat until deathblow. I also seriously locked the fuck in after that, and cleared out about 2-4 minibosses. Though, you got any tips on the poison pool Snake Eyes? It\u2019s not like they\u2019re a problem, just that the grab reach is bullshit, and I don\u2019t wanna spend all of my Gachiin sugar stealth-deathblowing all the other enemies, before moving onto them",
            "you\u2019ve gotta be bullshittin, cause that bitch could shoot me from the Dilapidated Temple, to within kissing range of the barrel. But do explain how the fuck they get cut, and immediately dodge a spinning shuriken, faster than Wolf can perceive a Miriki Counter??"
