            "Lets discuss something interesting. Why do the mods dont accept posts about people achieving platinum?? I think that is an interesting topic of discussion.",

            "It's harder than most bosses imo, but thankfully the mf only has one phase. Fromsoft really know when to cut back on healthbars and phases.",
            "He\u2019s going to smash you, humiliate you and make you wanna give up and when you finally beat him you will be smile brighter than the light of a thousand suns.",
            "No, when you're scared you hesitate and hesitation is defeat.",
            "he gonna throw his poop at ya",
            "When I went to him first time i had approx 970 spirit emblem when I beated him finally I had 570 something",
            "My favourite boss in the 1st time experience",
            "You\u2019ve lost. You\u2019re already hesitating",
            "He might seem really scary at first with his uhh being being very big, but when you get used to his patterns it\u2019s really not that bad. Flame vent and firecrackers are the best tools to use against him as they both stun him, remember that although it may not look like it, his attacks can actually be parried! Not the grabs though if he tries to grab you run for your life. Unlike most bosses monke only has one healthbar so as long as you play patiently you will eventually get him, good luck!"

            "Use mortal draw",
            "I wish the game gave a bit more stress on a deflect tutorial. I've seen many new players just not understand the posture system and how to deflect rather than block.",
            "For me it was the mindset of parry parry hit\u2026. Parry parry hit\u2026 perilous attacks give you openings but only hit 1-3 times! You have to be aggressively defensive but not greedy",
            "Don't always try and parry, hold the block button when needed. Another tip would be to hold the block button when you get a breather from your enemy, if your posture meter is almost full, as this will bring it back down fast. Don't try and take on Shinchimen warriors and Headless beasts early on, they are pretty easy further down the game's storyline. \n\nOh, I almost forgot, buy Mikiri counter and shinobi eyes, as fast as you can. Have a good one!"

            "Nah he just dies. That's just Isshin in his prime getting resurrected. Geni basically ran to his granddaddy crying."
