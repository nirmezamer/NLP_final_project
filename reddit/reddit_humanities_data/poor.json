Called the person last night that contacts client to schedule me for sunday night and guess what I cant sleep due to the fact that I will have to do it again tonight so I can have money to start my new job. \n\nI keep on telling myself that I\u2019d do it just this last time for me and my dog. That once I get this job started I should be able to get back on my feet and never look back on the things that I did to survive but does it really get better? \n\nI\u2019ve had a small money but my bank took it because Im overdrawn. My period is also coming soon and Im stressing and I cant even afford tampons. \n\nApplied for a free bus pass but it was denied. Im not supposed to start this job until mid of July but there were changes. It\u2019s not like Im not trying. I am doing everything that Im supposed to do. Offering cleaning services, knocking door to door to see if there are chores I could do but theres no luck. \n\nI feel like a disappointment, I cant even afford to buy my dog some treats and I am so ready to give up if it weren\u2019t for her. \n\nI am beyond exhausted.\n",
