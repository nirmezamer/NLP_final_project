I am super sick today and so ended up having to place an order for some bland foods, things like turkey and basically the shopper didn't even get any of the stuff I needed, to the point they should have just cancelled the order. So I have a loaf of bread, a tomato and a drink... which wouldn't have even cost the delivery fee where I live.  I mean I guess that is bland food, I feel like I wasted that money that I genuinely couldn't even really have afford, I was just so sick that I couldn't walk to the store.

That's unacceptable.\n\n  \nOn another note, I know it's hard, but definitely try to stock up a bit.  When you go out for groceries, stick an extra can of chicken soup in with the groceries (when you can).  Do this a few times over the course of a month or two, and it builds up a supply you can use when you're too sick to go out for groceries.  Cans of soup last 2-4 years, so it's something you can hold on to for awhile and still be ok.",
