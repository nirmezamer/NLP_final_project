My roster is pretty deep but I\u2019m missing some of the most used ml5 (senya, politis, yufine, choux, Celine, belian). Should I build teams around jenua and ddr? What would those teams look like?

            "My guildies have a pretty funny gif that we post in discord every time someone gets humbled by jenua. Basically the gif is a jenua who has already procced his immortality and will die next turn, but he crits an ML landy that has 70% hp and kills her, and his second hit goes into a 70% hp karina and he hits/crits her and kills her too. Always gives me a good chuckle.",
