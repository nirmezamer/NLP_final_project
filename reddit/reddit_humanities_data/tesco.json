            "OK, here's a start of something.\n\nCorrections and alternative views welcome!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Where should I go on my first day?**\n\nIf you've been given a specific person to ring or report to or whatever, speak to them. Otherwise, go in to the store customer service desk and tell them you're new (and your department, if you know it). They'll conjure up somebody to take care of you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**When is pay day? What hours are included in this?**\n\nPayday is every 4th Friday.\n\n6th January was the first payday of 2023 [so each one falls 4 weeks after - see here for dates during 2023.](https://colleague-help.ourtesco.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024899811-2023-Pay-Day-Dates)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn any payday, you get paid :\n\n\\- your contracted hours until the day after payday (in this month's example, your contract shift on 7th January would be in this pay packet)\n\n\\- your overtime up to the Saturday before payday (in this month's example, until 31st December) (usually - some stores may have the cutoff on the Sunday).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote that the overtime deadline above depends on your manager/wage clerk putting it on the system etc before the deadline, so there might be cases when this isn't done in time for the cutoff.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou should see the [pay policy here](https://colleague-help.ourtesco.com/hc/en-us/articles/5540584140444-Pay-Policy#h_01G9MG8TXAZJKFTRV79CDM8VZM) for the full details.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I don't understand my payslip.**\n\n[This article explains it.](https://colleague-help.ourtesco.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033636931-Understanding-my-payslip-by-a-colleague-on-Work-Pay)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Have I been paid for XX shift on YY day?**\n\nThe best thing to do is to log on to the calendar on [this link](https://www.ourtesco.com/experience/my-work/calendar/month). That will show you what hours you have been put on the system as working.\n\nYou should check that the hours, breaks, and department are all right - as it can affect your pay if they're wrong. Sometimes, it takes a day or two to correct any adjustments (called 'exceptions') which might happen if, for example, you stayed and did overtime on the day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**OK, I've checked, and there's still an issue!**\n\nYou should speak to your Wage Clerk. They'll be best placed to check on the system and find out what the issue is. Depending on your store and the hours you work, you might not see them in person - check what the arrangements are for raising pay queries in this case.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What is my hourly rate?**\n\nThe exact amount depends on very many factors - your location, your grade or department, whether you are a first aider etc.\n\nPay for the various grades is seen [here, red column on the right.](https://colleague-help.ourtesco.com/hc/en-us/articles/6167394791580-October-2022-pay-award-and-new-ways-of-working-for-our-store-and-CFC-colleagues)\n\nIf your store is within certain areas, you may get location pay (either 45p or 68p per hour), if you are a first aider you get 17p per hour additionally.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How do I resign and how much notice do I need to give?**\n\nYou should resign in writing stating when your last working day will be. It can be via email/text, as long as there's something in some form of writing. Give this to your section manager - if your manager is away give it to the duty manager (you may want to speak to your manager as a courtesy).\n\nNotice period for most GAs is one week, but there are some exceptions for specialise roles (team support, shift leader, CDD, pharmacy etc) and salaried grades - [see here for full details of notice period.](https://colleague-help.ourtesco.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005268926-Leavers-and-retirement-How-do-I-find-out-my-notice-period-)\n\nAnd there is [more information about leaving on this link.](https://colleague-help.ourtesco.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005268826-Leavers-and-Retirement-Full-Policy-and-Supporting-Documents)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I normally work on Dry Grocery but my manager wants me to work on Produce tomorrow. I don't want to. Do I have a choice?**\n\nShort answer, no probably not. Everybody can be asked to cover other departments as long as they're capable of doing so, and have completed any specialist training needed.\n\nIf there's a reason you *can't work*  on a particular department (e.g. you have a bad back and can't lift heavy cases etc) you need to (CHECK & INSERT PROPER PROCESS HERE).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My manager wants me to work overtime on Tuesday, but I don't want to. Do I have to work it?**\n\nStarting point - no you don't *have* to work any overtime.\n\nHowever, IF the Tuesday was within your availability window, the manager might move your contracted hours from another day into there, if they were really up a creek. But they'd need to give you >NOTICE< amount of notice in order to do this.\n\nIn general, assuming your manager is reasonable, have a chat with them about your overtime wishes (i.e. none, certain times only, school holidays only, etc). Nothing and nobody is perfect but letting them know your preferences will only help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Can I work overtime in another store? How does it work?**\n\nYou can, and various people do. It's really important to make sure that your manager and wage clerk know about it and are on-the-ball to make sure you get paid properly.\n\nAt the moment there's no central system for working in another store (i.e. finding empty shifts etc) so you'll need to make contact with them and introduce yourself, where you work, what hours you can do, what departments are you trained on etc. Then agree dates/times of cover with the manager at the other store. They should also make sure you are shown around and know any specific procedures, have access to things you need at the other store etc...\n\nTo get paid, your wage clerk at your home store needs to put the hours in manually, and then charge them back to the other store you worked at. They should know how to do this, but point them to this (LINK HERE) guide if not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I'd like to be trained on another department, how do I do this?**\n\nYou'll need to speak to the manager of the department you're interested in. They will talk to you about it and arrange training. The company is more and more into the multiskilling / one-team setup and so they're likely to be enthusiastic if people put their name forward.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I often get asked to sit on a till but I'm not confident and worry I'll make a mistake. What should I do?**\n\nSpeak to your manager or to the Front End Team Support. Explain what you struggle with. If it's cash handling, they might put you on a card-only till. Or if you need re-training about particular processes (handling gift cards? putting split payments through? cashback?) ask to be put with an experienced cashier at a quiet time, who can show you how things work. Or ask to be sat next to an experienced person so you can ask for help easily if you get stuck.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I keep hearing about something called The Hub, and that they watch us and issue disciplinaries, what is it?**\n\nThe Hub is a CCTV centre who do watch stores CCTV to reduce shrink. They will monitor and review things which raise suspicion - exactly what triggers them to monitor etc isn't public but I've come across things like large voids (\u00a32k), stored transactions not recalled, colleagues serving themselves etc. They will watch the CCTV and see what has happened, if they think there's something suspicious they will send a summary to the store manager. The store manager will then look into it and either be happy that it's benign or investigate the circumstances.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I've been given a \"Let's Talk\" by my manager, is this the same as a disciplinary?**\n\nNo. A Let's Talk is simply a record that something has been discussed. It is not a disciplinary, however a previous Let's Talk might be brought up in a disciplinary.\n\nFor example if you were regularly late the manager may sit down and do a Let's Talk to discuss your timekeeping, what the issues are, whether they can help etc. If it carried on and you were taken to a disciplinary for lateness, you couldn't turn around and say it's the first you've heard of it, as the Let's Talk is on file as evidence that they've spoken to you about it informally first.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I accidentally gave a customer too much change and that left the till \u00a320 short. The manager says I'll have to have an investigation. Should I worry?**\n\nProvided that's all that's happened - probably not. We all make mistakes and assuming it was a genuine mistake you'll basically be told to be more careful and not do it again. If you were regularly short they'd probably take you to a disciplinary, but people are always given a reminder and advice before that stage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**When do I get my Colleague Clubcard?**\n\nIt automatically gets sent out when you've worked for 3 months, it will be posted to your home address.\n\nReference: [Colleague Clubcard Policy](https://colleague-help.ourtesco.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005149446-Colleague-Clubcard-Full-Policy-and-T-Cs)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Can I lend my Colleague Clubcard to my flatmate, brother, great aunt etc?**\n\nIt's for your own personal use and the hub do monitor who and where are using them (for example, if you pay with your own card in a store in Plymouth, and suddenly another card is being used in Aberdeen on the same day, they'll probably look into it). They take this really seriously so really don't lend it to someone else. If you're doing something like buying a food shop for your whole flat or a hoover etc then you buy it and get the money back from others outside of Tesco. Always err on the side of caution.\n\nThe one exception is that you can apply for a second card for a family member who lives at your own address. See the policy for how to do this.\n\nReference: [Colleague Clubcard Policy](https://colleague-help.ourtesco.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005149446-Colleague-Clubcard-Full-Policy-and-T-Cs)",
