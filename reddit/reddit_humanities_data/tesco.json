I have to pay to park somewhere as I work in an area where there\u2019s limited parking and most areas are expensive, I have to leave an hour before my shifts start so that I can park my car and get the bus into town(the area where I work can be like London on most days so a ton of traffic) and I end up having to sit in the staff room for half an hour before my shift starts. Where I live there are 2 big Tesco\u2019s close to me so I could either walk there or drive and I wouldn\u2019t have to pay for parking as there\u2019s parking on sight. I don\u2019t want the company thinking I\u2019m just \u201cjumping ship\u201d because I\u2019ve worked there for such a short time but that money is starting to add up.

You've gone for an approach and deter method so I don't see what's wrong. Just corporations that don't see it that way cos they're scared of getting being liable if these scrotes get a slap.\n\nJust in future though, be wary of who and how you approach mate. A security guy in sainsbos a few years ago ended up on involuntary manslaughter charges for following a guy who nicked spirits, fell running away and died cos the bottles in his jacket smashed and killed him.   Not the guards fault but he ended up having to wait ages for a trial and shit,pretty sure it got thrown out but you don't need that shit in your life. TSS or whoever your boss is won't back you in that case, and neither would tesco. So fuck them.",
            "why would u risk your life for tesco ? They have insurance, they will get their money back, you wont get your life back. The first thing they teach you in training is just report theft, never try to stop it. \n\nIf he had stabbed you, tesco would have been in great legal trouble and a huge PR shit storm. I am not saying it's the right thing but it's what the policy is which you should have adhered to. In a perfect world we all employees would love to hold down the thief and give a beating or two but we dont live in a perfect world",

As far as I can see security guards are just scarecrows (no offence).\n\nI watched a guy in B&M stuffing a tote bag full with stuff of the shelves and walking out past the cashiers. I told them what I saw but they understandably weren't interested."

Guess nobody wants to work Friday nights. \n\nMy issue is that my store is pretty small for a big tesco, and there isn't actually that much to do on my department after about 6 o'clock. I get in. I get in at 4, I work the backstock (which is already pretty slim, because the people on before me have done most of it.) I will also refill the milk, which takes me to just about 6 o'clock, to do the evening reductions. After that, I don't really have anything else to do. There's not really any point dragging the backstock cages out again, because I'll usually only get one or two items on the shelf, if that. \n\nToday I had everything finished by 6:25, which is pretty standard. I went over all the cages again and then faced up, but there's a woman on after me who's supposed to face up, and she complains when I do her job. \n\nI'm a person who likes to be doing things. I'll happily work a 12 hour shift as long as there's 12 hours of work to do, but when I'm idle it's just so exhausting. \n\nWhat do you guys do when you're basically finished, but you've got 2 hours of your shift to fill?",

            "I'm normally quite busy on BWS, but occasionally I get a shift where the delivery is super light or most stuff has been worked by the time I come in. I usually just wander round and ask my colleagues if they'd like a hand - there's usually someone else who's got a bit more on their plate than they can manage alone, so I just pitch in with them for the rest of the shift.",
            "Ask your SL if there's anyone who might need help. If that fails, cleaning and OSI.\n\nIf your backstock is 99% worked, what's the person after you doing? Do you get evening deliveries for night shifts or something?",

I would have horrible anxiety over having nothing to do, I hate looking for work and standing around like a lost lemon. That was one of the reasons I left the job, I like being busy as the time flies by, when it\u2019s dead it drags so much",
