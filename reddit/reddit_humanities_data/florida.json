        "content": "Moving to Florida? This is your thread.\n\nAsk questions, answer questions, or tell us your best advice on moving to Florida.\n\n# FAQ Section in the works\n\nFeel free to contribute below!\n\n# Hurricanes\n\nHurricanes are part of living in Florida. Some years nothing happens, some years it's a wild ride.\n\nIf you're going to live beach side, then you need to take hurricanes seriously. Wind conditions leading up to them can and will cause the bridges to the mainland to close, meaning you can be cut off for extended periods from everything, including emergency services. Flooding/Storm Surge are real dangers to life and property. Make sure you have a plan way in advance for the high likelihood that you will lose both electricity and running water.\n\nThe further you get away from the coast and intracoastal zone, the lower the risks you have from severe damage from hurricanes, even major ones. But still have a plan, because anything can happen. Look for houses that have hurricane shutters or look into getting your home fit with them. Consider areas with buried power lines, as they're less likely to lose power. You can have a storm like Faye sit off the coast for days and flood almost everything. You can have tornadoes spawn from them. Fences are regular casualties of almost any named storm. Trees should be trimmed well in advance, paying close attention to when final collections occur before the storm hits so you don't have piles of potential wind debris laying in your yard.\n\nThat said: hurricanes are typically overblown by the media and should not be a major deterrent. As long as you have a plan and make sure that you're ready for the worst that could happen, you should almost always come out of the other side of hurricanes fine. Our local government knows how to handle them and a lot of infrastructure is built to withstand them. Most of us who have been through many of them don't consider anything Cat 3 or less to be anything more than a couple hour inconvenience. But always have a plan, no matter what.\n\n# Car & Home Owners Insurance\n\nYes, Florida has one of the highest rates of Car & Home Owners insurance in the US. It is recommended you find an insurance broker who can shop around (at no cost to you) for the best rates for your needs.\n\nCar Insurance is required by law per vehicle per driver.\n\n# Toll Roads and You\n\nWelcome to Florida, home of what seems like every toll road on the planet. You can certainly get around them, but it's significantly more efficient to use tolls.\n\nE-pass Vs Sunpass: one or the other for all the tolls around Florida. Both are accepted across Florida, Georgia and North Carolina. E-PASS has less issues. Plus the advantage of their Uni, which is accepted across 18 states. Both gives you discounts on most tolls Florida.\n\n**Keep Discussion on topic**. Comments such as the below will be removed:\n\n* \"Don't Move here\"/ \"Leave\" or any variation of goes against Rule #1.\n* \"Don't {insert state} my Florida\"\n* Complaining about people moving here - this isn't the thread for that.\n* Unwarranted political discussion/comments. *This is not a politics thread.*\n\nThread will refresh every 2 weeks.",

            "My partner and I will move to Florida in September from Nebraska. I got a Job close to FIU. I am looking for a 2-bedroom apartment close to Westchester, Fontainebleau, Olympia Heights, or any other area around it.  I saw an apartment close to Miami International Airport, but I am worried about the traffic, and airplane sounds. Can someone recommend me a safe, and quiet neighborhood?",
            "I am moving to Florida in a few months around the Wellington and West Palm Beach area; Are any websites that can help me find an apartment that is not apartments.com?",
            "I'm planning to move to the Ft. Lauderdale area later this year/early next year for work. I own a house now but am considering keeping it and renting for the first year while I am getting my feet in Florida. Ideally I'm looking to rent in an area with a lot of charm, with outdoor space, but still adjacent to gay/gay-safe spaces. I am not very familiar with the area. Any suggestions of where to start my search would be much appreciated.",
            "Hi guys, I just got a job offer of $24/hr in Tampa. I'm in CA and planning to make a move to Tampa around mid August after my wedding. I'm an IT and she's a medicurist/pedicurist. How is the living expense in Tampa now? Is $24/hr a livable wage in Tampa in case my wife got pregnant and I'm the only income source in the family? We always cook at home so we're able to save a little bit on that part. Thanks for the insights.",
            "Hi I\u2019ve got a question. I\u2019ve been driving a rental in Florida for 2 days now and I was following the maps to get to my destination and I got flashed by a camera. It was a weird looking flat yellow camera it flashed the car from the front once and then a second time from the back as I went through the cameras/barrier. I wasn\u2019t speeding or anything and I can\u2019t seem to find any info about that camera online. I would appreciate it if anyone can guide me as to what that camera was for. For reference it was around 10pm I thought it might be a toll camera flashing as it was dark but it\u2019s odd for the camera to take the front as Florida has no front plates. Thank you :)",
            "Hi everyone, my bf (23M) and I (23F) graduated college and want to move to FL next year. We want to live close to Orlando for job opportunities but in a quieter and safer area. We live in Maine currently so we are used to being rural/outdoors so we want somewhere with a lot of nature/walking trails and somewhere I (23F) could walk my dog alone if my bf is at work. We also want to be close to Disney as we plan on buying annual passes and plan to spend a lot of time there. I have heard Clermont and Windemere but they don't have many options for apartments so not sure if there are any good ones that are under the radar/not on zillow. ALSO are hurricanes a huge issue in Orlando? Is that something we need to consider? TIA!",
            "My Wife and I are planning on moving to Florida next Summer (2025). We aren't 100% sure where yet, but know we want to be on the gulf side. We are coming down next month to check out some towns and see what feels right to us. Right now, we are leaning towards the areas North and East of Tampa, without getting too close to Orlando. (I do not want to deal with that traffic on a daily basis) I will have 1 child who will be entering 8th grade, so I'm looking to be close to good schools. What towns or areas should we check out while we're down there? We'll be staying in Hudson, so we plan on taking a few day trips to check out other towns.\n\nAny advice you can give, or recommendations are much appreciated.",
            "I am very interested in moving to Florida. One perk is no state income tax! However, I have been told by a few people that Floridians have massive tax bills come tax season, so it\u2019s not like you are saving money. Is that true?\n\nIf it helps, I am single and I have a very simple tax situation. Nothing complicated at all.",
            "My boyfriend and I are planning to move to Pensacola/Destin area next year.  How are things over that way? Is that a good area to move to? Really trying to stay on the panhandle."
