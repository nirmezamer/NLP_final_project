        "content": "Moving to Florida? This is your thread.\n\nAsk questions, answer questions, or tell us your best advice on moving to Florida.\n\n# FAQ Section in the works\n\nFeel free to contribute below!\n\n# Hurricanes\n\nHurricanes are part of living in Florida. Some years nothing happens, some years it's a wild ride.\n\nIf you're going to live beach side, then you need to take hurricanes seriously. Wind conditions leading up to them can and will cause the bridges to the mainland to close, meaning you can be cut off for extended periods from everything, including emergency services. Flooding/Storm Surge are real dangers to life and property. Make sure you have a plan way in advance for the high likelihood that you will lose both electricity and running water.\n\nThe further you get away from the coast and intracoastal zone, the lower the risks you have from severe damage from hurricanes, even major ones. But still have a plan, because anything can happen. Look for houses that have hurricane shutters or look into getting your home fit with them. Consider areas with buried power lines, as they're less likely to lose power. You can have a storm like Faye sit off the coast for days and flood almost everything. You can have tornadoes spawn from them. Fences are regular casualties of almost any named storm. Trees should be trimmed well in advance, paying close attention to when final collections occur before the storm hits so you don't have piles of potential wind debris laying in your yard.\n\nThat said: hurricanes are typically overblown by the media and should not be a major deterrent. As long as you have a plan and make sure that you're ready for the worst that could happen, you should almost always come out of the other side of hurricanes fine. Our local government knows how to handle them and a lot of infrastructure is built to withstand them. Most of us who have been through many of them don't consider anything Cat 3 or less to be anything more than a couple hour inconvenience. But always have a plan, no matter what.\n\n# Car & Home Owners Insurance\n\nYes, Florida has one of the highest rates of Car & Home Owners insurance in the US. It is recommended you find an insurance broker who can shop around (at no cost to you) for the best rates for your needs.\n\nCar Insurance is required by law per vehicle per driver.\n\n# Toll Roads and You\n\nWelcome to Florida, home of what seems like every toll road on the planet. You can certainly get around them, but it's significantly more efficient to use tolls.\n\nE-pass Vs Sunpass: one or the other for all the tolls around Florida. Both are accepted across Florida, Georgia and North Carolina. E-PASS has less issues. Plus the advantage of their Uni, which is accepted across 18 states. Both gives you discounts on most tolls Florida.\n\n**Keep Discussion on topic**. Comments such as the below will be removed:\n\n* \"Don't Move here\"/ \"Leave\" or any variation of goes against Rule #1.\n* \"Don't {insert state} my Florida\"\n* Complaining about people moving here - this isn't the thread for that.\n* Unwarranted political discussion/comments. *This is not a politics thread.*\n\nThread will refresh every 2 weeks.",

            "As someone who relocated to the state some 15 years ago, I will say - go all out. Don't go looking for a little town, hidden gem or what have you. You know the big places, look for a job there. That's where you want to be, generally.\n\nThere a whole lot of nothing happening in the small towns and unless you like spending a whole lotta time at home, I'd advise against it. The beach gets old in about 1-5 years, then you're stuck in middle of nowhere with mediocre salary, seasonal job, increasing prices of everything and it's hot out all the time.\n\nSeriously, it's a big move. You are literally changing your life situation. Make sure you are making the best move possible.",
            "I keep hearing people say that people who move to Florida are blindsided by the costs. I understand home owners insurance is much higher - can someone give me an example of how high?\n\nWhat are these other costs that people are unaware of? Coming from a HCOL suburb of NYC, I don't believe I will be as surprised as someone coming from a LCOL area.\n\nMany thanks.",
            "So looking for Opinions,thoughts,differences.\n\nI lived in the Cincinnati Ohio/Northern Kentucky area my whole life and plan to potentially to move to Florida in the next couple of years. I work from home and can really work anywhere in North America that I want. I have a family with multiple kids ranging from newborn to \\~11 years.\n\nWe travel to Florida every year for Vacation and mainly the general Tampa (St Pete) area, my Grand Parents lived in the Pinellas area when they were alive so I grew up visiting them in that area also. I am mainly gravitating in looking in this area to live as I have the most experience here and enjoy the area.\n\nI live in an area currently where houses are pretty close together and for our next house I am looking for a little bit more spacing, potentially an Acre or more of land.\n\nJust want to hear peoples thoughts on the difference from my current area on Insects/House Pests, Animals and animal pests, every day problems, traffic (Traffic is pretty bad in busy hours here in Cincinnati), Crime differences, yard work differences. What ever you can throw at me.\n\nAlso Summer time weather differences, it does get humid here in the Summer, but would like some real opinion on differences between heat/humidity. Obviously there is no winter weather down there. We get Tornado threats here a couple times of year, but I feel like there is a shield on the main Cincinnati area and a lot of Tornado warnings never really make it to the ground or stuff gets broken up before it it makes it to the city space to be a real threat, most tornado's are north or south from where we are at. I never actually seen a funnel cloud or tornado in our area.\n\nWere not committed 100% yet on moving and still need a lot of thought and planning on how were going to pull this off lol",
            "Anyone having hydration issues the past few weeks it's been really hot down here? Recently moved from the NE and no matter how much water I intake, I just feel chronically dehydrated.",
            "My partner and I will move to Florida in September from Nebraska. I got a Job close to FIU. I am looking for a 2-bedroom apartment close to Westchester, Fontainebleau, Olympia Heights, or any other area around it.  I saw an apartment close to Miami International Airport, but I am worried about the traffic, and airplane sounds. Can someone recommend me a safe, and quiet neighborhood?",
            "I am moving to Florida in a few months around the Wellington and West Palm Beach area; Are any websites that can help me find an apartment that is not apartments.com?",
            "Holiday, FL\n\nMoving back to FL after some time on the west coast & looking at renting in Holiday. I\u2019m aware this isn\u2019t the most ideal spot to live but just how bad is it? \nAre there areas that are better than others or should I disregard the thought entirely?",
            "I'm planning to move to the Ft. Lauderdale area later this year/early next year for work. I own a house now but am considering keeping it and renting for the first year while I am getting my feet in Florida. Ideally I'm looking to rent in an area with a lot of charm, with outdoor space, but still adjacent to gay/gay-safe spaces. I am not very familiar with the area. Any suggestions of where to start my search would be much appreciated.",
            "Hi guys, I just got a job offer of $24/hr in Tampa. I'm in CA and planning to make a move to Tampa around mid August after my wedding. I'm an IT and she's a medicurist/pedicurist. How is the living expense in Tampa now? Is $24/hr a livable wage in Tampa in case my wife got pregnant and I'm the only income source in the family? We always cook at home so we're able to save a little bit on that part. Thanks for the insights.",
            "Hi I\u2019ve got a question. I\u2019ve been driving a rental in Florida for 2 days now and I was following the maps to get to my destination and I got flashed by a camera. It was a weird looking flat yellow camera it flashed the car from the front once and then a second time from the back as I went through the cameras/barrier. I wasn\u2019t speeding or anything and I can\u2019t seem to find any info about that camera online. I would appreciate it if anyone can guide me as to what that camera was for. For reference it was around 10pm I thought it might be a toll camera flashing as it was dark but it\u2019s odd for the camera to take the front as Florida has no front plates. Thank you :)"
