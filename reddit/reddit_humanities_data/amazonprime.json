            "With two-day shipping taking two weeks, I\u2019m seriously wondering why I\u2019m still paying for Amazon Prime.",
            "What the actual fuck is going on?  I thought maybe it was just a fluke, but I'm noticing all kinds showing as 4-5 day shipping.  For example, right now, I was looking at something, and it won't arrive until Thursday.  Wasn't 2-day shipping part of the deal when we signed up for Prime?  Also, Amazon just raked in billions during this \"pandemic\", while other businesses failed, and this is the shit we get??",
            "Prime orders from the middle of last week that say on the order page:  Due to Arrive Today:  4\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOrders that have actually shipped: 0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSupport representatives giving me the runaround, blaming me for not understanding what 'Prime' means, saying that the estimate isn't a guarantee (what did you base 'Today' on when you estimated if you hadn't shipped?)  and otherwise making excuses for being unreliable?  More than I can count.",
            "Can we talk about the round Robin of chat support reps coming in and out of your chat window?",
            "Something clearly has changed in the past month or so. 2 of the 6 items I've ordered in the past few weeks have literally arrived late even after shipping out and every order I place sits in limbo for 4-5 days before it even ships out.\n\nThis is how you lose your number one spot. Someone else will come along and claim the throne if this is how its gonna be from now on.",
            "Something has certainly changed the past 3-4 weeks. I have been using Amazon prime for oh geez, I dunno, like 10 years? It was usually pretty awesome, up until about a month ago. I started noticing that literally NO items were available with 2 day shipping. Most items took 3-7 days to arrive from the day I would order them.\n\nActually looking back even further, they pretty much silently removed 1 day shipping back when covid was getting bad. But this new issue has nothing to do with Covid, there's no way.\n\nI don't need some Amazon shill or CS rep telling me \"Oh, well, the shipping still only takes 2 days! It's just the fulfillment that might not be, which isn't technically part of Prime!\". I don't give a fuck. It was 2 day shipping AND fulfillment (unless it was a sunday) for YEARS up until a month ago.\n\nFucking Amazon. Cancelling my prime right now. They already banned my original Amazon prime account of 9 years because it got hacked and the CS rep wanted screenshots of all my bank info to get my account back. Yeah, no. I don't need to give a CS rep all my banking information because MY ACCOUNT WAS HACKED.",
            "I came here to see if I was the only one who has seen their delivery dates extended in the past few weeks suddenly. Looks like I\u2019m not alone. \n\nI do want to mention that I saw a comment posted on a thread on the Pittsburg subreddit regarding Prime delivery delays about 9-10 days ago. The post is supposedly from an Amazon delivery driver. They mentioned Amazon implemented a nationwide change recently in how they deliver. I guess prior they had two rounds of deliveries daily (one during regular 7-5 hours and one later round). Apparently Amazon wanted just one round of deliveries daily, so they put everybody on something like an 11 am-9 pm work schedule and as a result, tons of drivers have quit. This individual seems to think this is why we are suddenly seeing these delays.",
            "I will be not renewing my prime. It\u2019s taking way too long to get my orders to justify the price. Back when it was true 2 day shipping I loved having it . Plus last time I had an issue with an order I was not treated very well. I will use other sources to order stuff or Amazon free $35 shipping when I have to.",
            "I joined this sub just for this thread. I am nailed to the wall here because I dont have the option for brick and mortar shopping for everything anymore. I am taking care of elderly immunocompromised family members who have not gotten the shot. So all their shopping or things they want/need I need to go out and get. So I dont want to go out and hit many stores, for fear of bringing something to them. The only store I actively go to is a grocery store. Anything else, i order from Amazon, and paying for prime as well. \nWhile I do use the other prime benefits as well, the main reason for me buying prime was the two day shipping.  Prior to this duplicitous act, with Amazon's third party delivery people, the delivery update said to expect things to arrive between say 12-2, then 2-4, then 6-1015, then we are sorry things are running late, then would appear at night or around 2 thr next day. And now, I would be lucky to see my orders in 5 days if not a week. And I live less than 10 miles from both an international airport and an Amazon distribution hub. And even after complaints to amazon I still have no answers.",
            "This is an example of what is happening. Same item .. two different zip codes in same city.\nThis is all items in the site.  One  zip will be delivered tomorrow, the other would be delivered next Thursday. Same post office, ups and fedex distribution center for both zips. \n\n\n[estimates](https://imgur.com/a/HKcEN6i)"

            "I abandoned Amazon for any expensive item, now I pick up at Best Buy or order from B&H.",
            "Please keep us updated on how the return process goes. They seem to have a pattern lately of defrauding customers whenever you have to make  expensive returns like this. I hope it goes well for you. Make sure reps EMAIL everything they promise to you, they tend to say one thing to get you off the chat and never deliver.",
            "I bought a brand new 3D printer from Amazon. What showed up was a taped up box and a 3D printer missing parts with the print bed scratched to hell. Luckily, their customer service hadn\u2019t gone to shit yet and I didn\u2019t have problems getting a refund. I\u2019m willing to bet you return this and they\u2019ll try to blame you for returning something different. You\u2019ll have to let us know how your refund goes. Good luck",
            "Ordered a switch special edition game recently. Looked brand new in package but there was no game! \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Someone must have outsmarted them and opened the package and returned it resealed. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
            "If the LPN Label is present it means it is a return, what's more, that label is traceable, it cannot be appealed and no one from Customer Service can even question it, since if it says LPN it is SECOND HAND, and if you have bought that product NEW, and they have sent you that, it is a crime of fraud, which is what these Amazon criminals and scammers do constantly, now you will obviously want to return something that is a scam and here the real scam actually begins, They will tell you that something else arrived, that it arrived used, that it is different and they will have you waiting for your money, first of all for a month, then that it didn't arrive and that you have to wait 2 months, until the deadlines run out, which I don't know It's like hell, the Prosecutor's Office hasn't arrested these shits once and for all, because these people from Amazon are a bunch of criminals and they have to be locked up, bunch of miserable people.",
            "Ohhh! Thanks for the insight, I was wondering what those stickers were, why would they be shipping this lens when I bought a \"new\"? It's crazy.\n\nI hope the return goes smoothly for me.",
            "\"The returns department\" lol. You mean the guys that take all the returns and put them back into \"new\" inventory without so much as a glance? Amazon is breaking the Truth in Advertising Act on an unimaginable scale right now. Anything returned by an end consumer, even if it looks like it's brand new, must be clearly labeled as such, i.e. \"refurbished\" \"b-stock\" \"open box\" etc. Amazon commits fraud every time it restocks a returned item as new, but I guess they're too big to prosecute.",
            "I ordered from Amazon, because I couldn't get the item faster using BestBuy or B&H, and have a trip that I am leaving on.\n\nI probably won't make a similar mistake again.",
            "If you look closely both the LPN labels are different on the front, and then there is a 3rd LPN sticker on the top of the box. All 3 LPN labels have different code.\n\nI can't tell but it seems like the top sticker has maybe 2 more stickers under it.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/qXWi23p](https://imgur.com/a/qXWi23p)"

            "Some of the products on amazon are not up to the mark, which goes same for temu products. Since I noticed the same product seeling on amazon, paying 3 times more for that product doesn't make sense to me. So wanted to hear out other people experience with temu",
            "I wouldn't touch Temu, just like I wouldn't touch AliExpress. Not everything is chinese garbage on Amazon, but ***everything*** on Temu and Ali is chinese garbage. Besides, even without prime, Amazon still ships pretty fast, and returns are a snap. Not so with the Chinese sites.\n\nHow long *does* it take to get an order from Temu? I know to the states it's 10-21 days for AliExpress. If I want cheap chinese crap that may be OK, but otherwise a trip to Target is in my cards.  I know, plenty of chinese crap there too, but I can see it and feel it before I decide if something is worth buying.\n\nIf you're looking for some sort of vindication for switching to Temu over Amazon, there may be a subreddit for Temu where you'd have better luck.\n\nAs I said, pick your poison... the Chinese sites ain't mine."

        "content": "I've been an Amazon customer since 2011 (and used a family member's account before that). I have had Prime for over a decade, have made thousands upon thousands of purchases, have a Prime Visa card, primarily get my groceries from Whole Foods, use Amazon wish lists for gifting, have had Alexa/Echo devices in my house since Gen 1, use Amazon when I want to rent a movie, and more. It would take a long time to calculate my return percentage, but it is certainly way below 5%\u2014and has almost always been the result of an item arriving damaged/broken, usually as a result of improper packaging. Aside from that majority, I've had some nonfitting clothing returns, a couple items that never arrived, and very few cases where I made a mistake (trying to cancel too late; placing a duplicate order). My returns have always been pleasant and properly executed\u2014and, again, quite infrequent.\n\nBy all measurements, my account is an excellent one for Amazon. So why am I suddenly being slandered and threatened? I don't understand how scared I should be, what I should do, how they could so recklessly and grossly get this so absurdly wrong, etc. \n\nThe best guess I have is that someone on their team irresponsibly attacked me on behalf of a recent third-party seller that sent me a broken item and has been trying to charge me illicitly for the return. I went to customer support for help with that (after many hours of waiting...) and got this wild threat of an email not to long afterward. \n\nAny help, guidance, etc. is appreciated! Screenshot attached. \n\nThanks. ",
