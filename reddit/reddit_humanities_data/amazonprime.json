            "With two-day shipping taking two weeks, Im seriously wondering why Im still paying for Amazon Prime.",
            "What the actual fuck is going on?  I thought maybe it was just a fluke, but I'm noticing all kinds showing as 4-5 day shipping.  For example, right now, I was looking at something, and it won't arrive until Thursday.  Wasn't 2-day shipping part of the deal when we signed up for Prime?  Also, Amazon just raked in billions during this \"pandemic\", while other businesses failed, and this is the shit we get??",
            "Something clearly has changed in the past month or so. 2 of the 6 items I've ordered in the past few weeks have literally arrived late even after shipping out and every order I place sits in limbo for 4-5 days before it even ships out.\n\nThis is how you lose your number one spot. Someone else will come along and claim the throne if this is how its gonna be from now on.",
            "I came here to see if I was the only one who has seen their delivery dates extended in the past few weeks suddenly. Looks like Im not alone. \n\nI do want to mention that I saw a comment posted on a thread on the Pittsburg subreddit regarding Prime delivery delays about 9-10 days ago. The post is supposedly from an Amazon delivery driver. They mentioned Amazon implemented a nationwide change recently in how they deliver. I guess prior they had two rounds of deliveries daily (one during regular 7-5 hours and one later round). Apparently Amazon wanted just one round of deliveries daily, so they put everybody on something like an 11 am-9 pm work schedule and as a result, tons of drivers have quit. This individual seems to think this is why we are suddenly seeing these delays.",
            "I will be not renewing my prime. Its taking way too long to get my orders to justify the price. Back when it was true 2 day shipping I loved having it . Plus last time I had an issue with an order I was not treated very well. I will use other sources to order stuff or Amazon free $35 shipping when I have to.",
            "Every prime item I put in my cart is giving me delivery times of 5-6 days. Seems like that started happening over the last 3 weeks or so. I am in the Denver area by the way.",
            "This is honestly getting ridiculous. Pay for \"2 day shipping\" and it takes 5 days before Amazon even ships the item out, let alone the actual delivery time. Kind of crazy I can order some of my products from a store that is across the country from me and receive them in 2-3 days reliably, yet it my last 3 things ordered from Amazon took 7, 7 and 6 days to arrive when I live just a hair over 1 hour from my regions main distribution hub (and the origin location listed on all the packages shipping).",
            "This is crazy.  A week ago I ordered a couple of Prime items at same-day delivery and got them the same day (as often.)  A few days later, EVERY item across the site is minimum 3, usually 4 days.  Customer \"service\" just plays head games and lectures about \"well it's two days to get it shipped!\"  Then why was I paying for prime to get the same shipping as everyone else?  That's why I, and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE, to CANCEL AMAZON PRIME ASAP to send a message to these greedy megalomaniacs that they can't just get away with ripping us off and playing games when it's like, hello idiots you're already richer than god, so what is your problem to begin with?",
            "I was gonna order some prime stuff today (a Monday) and they say it's not gonna get here till Sunday. \n\nWhat gives??",
            "Some orders have taken up 2 weeks to be delivered even though they are Prime items. What's the point of me paying for prime if it takes so long for my stuff to get to me? I live in Toronto! It's not like I live in the middle of nowhere."

I was looking for a charger for my new IPhone and most of the products pushed down my throat are random fake cheap things pretending to be a brand with names like BIHPJD. \n\nClearly this is because of drop shipping and so many people realising they can make good money selling stuff from China but why is it so difficult to get ACTUAL good brands now. \n\nDo you guys have that issue as well? It seems like you can\u2019t trust anything that comes from Amazon anymore because you\u2019re paying \u20ac40 for a \u20ac5 item from AliExpress\u2026",

            "From what I can see, Anker products are only sold via AnkerDirect on Amazon. I just checked a few chargers and the only seller for new items is AnkerDirect and any that do have multiple sellers are used items, which also seem to be sold by AnkerDirect or Amazon.\n\nThis means there aren't any third parties co-mingling Anker products at Amazon. It all comes from Anker.",
            "Sorry to break this off for you, but everything is made in China. That doesn't mean it's bad",
            "Yep. There are some good third party chargers, but why not get the one that's designed for your device.",

I found what looks like live chat, but it\u2019s only a selection of prompts which take you to various help pages, none of which actually connect you to an associate. \n\nSo it won\u2019t let me refund a lost package, and I have no way to contact customer support. \n\nThe benefit of Amazon has always been quick deliveries and low-risk purchases. Something doesn\u2019t work? Just return it. Problem with order? Customer service was always quick to resolve it. Since this has changed, the low-risk benefit of purchasing through Amazon is gone. \n\nI\u2019ll no longer be purchasing through Amazon, and will be cancelling my Prime subscription. ",
