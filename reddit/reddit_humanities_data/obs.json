        "content": "I wanted to record me and my friends playing Minecraft. They says no because they don\u2019t want people to see there usernames. That makes me think how to block these stuff on obs. If I\u2019m live streaming and I accidentally pop up like a personal thing I worked on or I personal thing I did I can\u2019t just click out because people can rewind slow down then pause the screen to see it. So what can I do",

            "If you're talking about hiding their usernames in discord, then discord will automatically hide that and other sensitive info if it detects that obs is running. If it fails to detect obs, then you can always turn it on in the in the settings before going live. If you're talking about their minecraft username, then you're going to have to find a mod that censor usernames. Since iirc, vanilla minecart doesn't have that option. \n\nIf you're worried about accidently leaking sensitive documents while live, two things. First, close them before going live. Second thing, instead of capturing the entire desktop, tell obs to only capture specific windows that you want it to. But this can be tedious if you constantly switch between a lot of windows, and you do have to pay attention to obs to see if it's capturing the right window. Also, I did recently discover that obs have a studio mode feature where you can preview your changes before broadcasting them. I haven't had the chance to test this feature out, so your mileage may vary.\n\nBut if you're asking if obs can detect and auto censor personal information, then it doesn't have that feature, since that's not what it's designed for.Plus, that probably require an advanced AI model to analyze and censor every sensitive info in every frame of the broadcast.",
            "Depends a lot on the game.\n\nDisable discord overlay, stream selecting the game windows as the source, not the screen, this are 2 tips.\n\nNow, if the game shows their username, you cant do anything aside from not stream.",
            "You could actually use some kind of Minecraft Mod to hide their usernames, or a plugin to change it to a different nickname instead of going through tedious shit with OBS.",
            "if use game capture and not desktop capture then no one will see any thing but the game..  as for in game names that would have to be something in  game to hide those.",
            "OBS allows for Blur & pixilated overlays of sections. Considering most game setups have static positions for common games elements (usernames, stats...), it shouldn't be too hard to use a still image with holes in those sections as a key mask.",
            "One thing I don\u2019t see mentioned that I used when I worked in college esports production. Run your stream with a delay. College esports keeps a 3 minute delay as standard but for personal streams I would run maybe a 20 second delay. You still interact with chat in a timely manner but if you show something you don\u2019t want seen you have 20 seconds to think about it, switch to obs, and stop stream while dropping delay. Dropping delay allows you to just tell obs to stop sending twitch video and to cut anything that hasn\u2019t been shown yet. Definitely something that helps a ton",
            "You could try using mods to hide your friend's name tags: [Toggle Nametags](https://modrinth.com/mod/hidetags) (Fabric) or [No Render Name Tags](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-render-name-tags) (Forge).",
            "Anytime i pull up OBS my discord immediately goes into streamer mode and blocks not only mine but other user except the very first letter of their name. If its in game maybe you could turn off gamertags in the settings or something",
            "Does the game have any streamer mode setting, or a plugin that can do the same thing?",
            "Ask chatgpt, it's been pretty helpful for niche needs like this for me lately.  Chances are though it's not a thing yet, even though you'd think AI would easily be able to receive input like specific text or programs (like password managers) and auto hide them."

Looks like I was sleep deprived maybe forgot but it was recording for 212 hours and it took up 100% of my 1tb storage and the problem is I cannot delete the video file since I can't physically find it. It's not showing up as a \"hidden file\" or anywhere. It's not even showing up as corrupted its almost as if it doesn't exist but despite this I have only 20 MB left on my 1tb hard drive. I tried restarting, searching \"size: gigantic\" and going into event viewer and I didn't really find much other than errors the video size has caused. OBS support has also seemed to completely ghost me so no luck in talking with them there. Is there any way I can recover my hard drive storage?",
