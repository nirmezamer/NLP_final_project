I had a career break for the last 6 months where mostly I was away from coding and development completely. so I feel rusty in everything. this month I started doing leetcode again, revised DSA. And also, I have been revising core concepts of Android lately. But since my main role is in Android Dev, I need help with Android-focused prep help with someone who is on the same boat prep-wise.\n\n**How we'll prepare:**\n\nto begin, we could make sure we have basics covered theoretically at least. then we can look into major stuff topic wise. After that, we can start mock interviews. Apart from that, I'll also be starting some open source for practice with big codebases and also, to add it in resume ofc.\n\nif this sounds good, let me know. i will add you to the server. i can only add up to 5-7 folks due to limited space.",

I am trying to create a developer profile, but every time I submit documents for proof of address, they are rejected. I have submitted a government-issued certificate of residence and utility bills, but all of them have been rejected. Google support keeps telling me that the documents I submitted are not supported, but they don't provide a clear explanation why. I need to understand why my government-issued document is being rejected and what specific criteria it fails to meet. Additionally, I need guidance on what type of document I can submit to successfully complete the verification process. If anyone has faced similar issues or knows how to resolve this, please share your insights. It's causing significant delays and frustration. Thank you in advance for your help!",

        "content": "I've got several years experience working as an engineer, so I'm no stranger to database migrations, but I'm a bit confused about how changing the structure of data works when developing different app versions.\n\nIf I write an app, and I have a data structure that looks like A, that data will then be saved somehow to the local device, e.g. in JSON somewhere. If I want to make a change to that data structure so that it now looks like B, which is slightly different then all of the saved data on the devices that have the app installed are still going to look like A. This means the A data structures are going to be incompatible with v2 of the app which uses the B data structure. Therefore all the apps are going to crash if they update due to the data structures being incompatible.\n\nTo make it worse, if the app is designed to be offline then I have no way to access the data structures remotely to modify the data, meaning the app will remain unusable unless I find a way to modify the data in v2 of the app so that it is compatible with structure B.\n\nSo my question is how exactly is this done? It's quite hard to find information about this online. If the data was saved to a remote DB then it would be a bit easier to be able to deal with the data structure changes as the database could be migrated and allow the data to be compatible with B.\n\nBut also, if you migrate the data structure in the remote database then all of the apps that are still using v1 would become broken again as the data structures would yet again become mismatched. So you'd have to have different versions of the DB also and have the different versions of the app only use their version of the DB.\n\nAnd then a further issue is that if you bring out v3 of the app that uses data structure C then you'd need a way to allow not only B to be transformed into C, but also A to C because you don't update incrementally on the app store you just install the latest version of the app. So anyone with v1 who then installs v3 needs a way for their data to be transformed in a way that makes the A data work with v3. So now v3 of the app needs to support data migration from v1 to v2 and v2 to v3.\n\nIs this usually handled with something like SQLite DBs and migration scripts? If an app uses MongoDB or another NoSQL solution for handling its data it feels like it would need a new transformation function written for each data structure in order to convert it from A to B or B to C.\n\nThese are all questions that are going through my head as I'm building my app and I'm just not sure how these are handled in a professional way that doesn't lead to a whole swath of code to transform data (A->B, A->C, etc) from one data structure to another or loads of versioned DBs. It seems unmaintainable and would end up causing data problems to the point where it'll make the app hard to develop further.\n\nI'd really like to know how this problem is solved. Obviously it happens because there's plenty apps out there that will have complex data structures",

        "content": "I have been working in a company that develops mobile apps for a while. I want to become an indie developer with the experience I have gained from this company.\n\nWe develop apps for both IOS and Android, but the apps we develop for IOS are doing very badly in terms of performance. It is both very expensive in terms of marketing budget and very difficult to get users. The users who use the app don't spend money. On the Android side, we gain organic users every day, the marketing budget is lower and the number of downloads is much higher. Until today, I always heard the opposite, that the spending habits on the IOS side were better than Android. I wonder if this is a problem that everyone has been experiencing lately or is there a problem specific to the company I work for?\n\nAs an Indie Developer, I want to understand this situation well in order to decide on which platform I should develop an app.",

            "Wow that's interesting to hear. Thought the opposite was true, too. But as the first commenter already said it mostly depends on your target audience. \nAlthough I have very little experience I found it quite struggling to learn Android, although Jetpack Compose is cool. But all the State related parts etc was horrible, and at least for, not worth the struggle. So I switched to Flutter, because it should suffice for the Apps I develop. With that I can reach users on both platform and I don't need to worry about question like those which are bothering you. \nSorry not giving you the clear answer you want but maybe I could push your thinking outside of the \"black or white\" box.",
            "I have a free app with both Android and iOS versions. So far I did zero marketing. The audience is growing slowly, but steadily. About 90% of the growth comes from iOS. However, I would recommend to just go with Flutter or React Native and publish to both stores if your app does not do anything special, that would require something that a cross platform framework can not offer.",
