            "Its a matter of who holds on the longest... how long can they afford to lose that many men.",
            "They may have the numbers but the competence (which was never high) will be tanking and these new Russian recruits will probably never come home.",
            "Even if the numbers are true it's still unsustainable for them. If they continue to have this casualty rate, they are on track to have lost 1% for their entire population in another 3-4 years. That's an astronomical high number of casualties.",
            "Even if is true, they cannot replace equipment at the same rate.",
            "Yes but the Russians  are running  out of every type of equipment and will mot have anything  left by the end of the year. Even if somecsre replaced they can't make artillery  barrels or tank or optics or many other key parts inc helicopters,  planes etc",
            "Ukrainian officials keep on complaining about being outnumbered at the front.  Russia is replacing its losses, and building its Army at a higher rate than Ukraine is able to replace and replentish losses.",
            "this is accurate if u take the Ukraine posted daily losses. Russia is averaging 1k people a day.",
            "I have no idea what source the NYT used.",
            "> If it's from russia we can ignore it.\n\nThe west literally claims that the Russia army is bigger now than it was at the start of the war so of course it is true.",
            "What are people in Russia even thinking?  Do they think 99% of them come back alive and hale?"

            "The S-500 is more advanced because it can fail to detect anything at ranges up to 600km whereas the S-400 can fail to detect anything at ranges up to 400km.",
            "This would be embarrassing. S-500 is their version of THAAD, *specifically designed* to counter ballistic missiles much better than their Patriot analogue S-400. \n\nAnd in kinematic terms, ATACMS isn't a particularly impressive ballistic missile. It's fat & slow for the type (albeit more maneuverable than average).",
            "Well there goes Russia's order book for the S500. If it can not work on the missile that the US is in the process of upgrading with a newer and hopefully better missile then why would anyone want them.",
            "Already? I would have laughed at anyone suggesting it could happen this fast. I look forward to further information on the topic, whether it confirms this or not.",
            "If true would be amazing.  Having ATACMS with 300km range successful will eventually force Russia to push back air defences further from the line (well after being stubborn and taking expensive losses).",
            "So, let me get this straight. A 30 year old ATACMS missile just took out Russias one and only top of the line S-500 system, which costs $ 2.5 billion in todays dollars to replace? Damn. 40 year old F-16s will be like gods from above when finally deployed! Lol",
            "Guessing this is why they flattened an apartment block in Dnipro then",
            "Wow. Whats that, three weeks since it was sent to Crimea? \n\nKeep going russia, you're doing great.",
            "Is the S-500 engineer in the gulag yet?",
            "If this is true, it's potentially a huge setback for the whole program. This is/was the *only* S-500 in existance, it's effectively a prototype, the kind of thing you test for five years before taking the lessons learned and building the production units. If that thing got toasted, it's not just the machine: all that testing is lost, along with part or all of what's probably the only trained S-500 crew in existence. They might even be the factory techs, legit rocket scientists, and some portion of them would be dead and all their knowledge and experience lost."

His company went bancrupt in 2019. Some economic trends are so strong that you just can't turn the tides.",
