The subreddit rules also apply here - but we will be much more relaxed about things being slightly off-topic or discussions meandering away from the topic. \n\nWe are also proud, we can provide daily in-depth news and intel briefings again, our user/friend @Hedgehog from our discord server will provide us with those. We will add links each day to this post, as well in the original formatting as an image, or for users not able to read that, as a link to a text-only copy in our wiki.\n\nTo indicate the current version, we will update the flair of this post with the date of the current briefing.\n\n---\n---\n\n#The Daily Hog:\n\n2024-06-08 [Original Format](https://imgur.com/a/FKcuVYG) / [Text

In 2019, the tech blog, Engadget, noted that Russian propaganda was specifically targeting at least 89 leftwing and rightwing subreddits, \u201csuggest[ing] a Russian-led attempt to antagonize and influence Americans online, which is still ongoing.\u201d\"",
            "I would love some know of analysis regarding Russia's combat power that was realistic. \n\nRussia will never run out of men, but that's not what wins wars. Russia keeps getting degraded. Lower quality equipment replacing their front line equipment. Soldiers who have no training. Morale issues. \n\nObviously there is no magic way to evaluate this, but so many reports just count tanks (and poorly).",
            "Simple javascript code that could help soldiers and civilians detect and evade both drone strikes and enemy invaders (prepared for immediate deployment)\n\nTwo javascript projects that make use of object detection. One uses a simple code that could help detect enemy drones. The other uses a simple code that could help detect enemy soldiers. Both apps could be deployed immediately\n\nhttps://www.academia.edu/115181929/Aerial_Object_Detection_updated_for_combat_deployment_\n\nWait for the model to load before clicking the button to enable the webcam - at which point it will become visible to use. The app will beep when an aerial object is located. The longer an aerial object is hovering near you, the longer the beeping noise. For soldiers, this could mean that a drone is targeting them. Ideally, soldiers would use the app on their cell phones and attach the device to the top area of their vehicles or to their body while sleeping in the trenches. Keep mind that sim cards must be removed and cell phone wireless connectivity must remain \"off\" in combat environments. Before deployment, soldiers should connect to wifi and start the app. Once the app is started, a soldier can then disable wifi and leave the app running as he/she is deployed into a combat zone. For detecting aerial objects in combat, android phone should be mounted to the top of the backpack or top of the helmet. In civilian environments, the cell phone, with wireless turned on, could be placed on rooftops. With internet access, a user could view the aerial scene remotely with facebook live\n\nhttps://www.academia.edu/115225324/Intruder_Detection_App_urban_warfare_and_counter_insurgency_with_Javascript\n\nWait for the model to load before clicking the button to enable the webcam-at which point it will become visible to use. The app will beep when an intruder is detected. The app will also emit voice alert, saying \"intruder detected\" upon detection of an intruder. This app allows phones to be mounted in various places, to which it can detect when an intruder is in the area. This can be used in clearing and counter insurgency operations. This is also useful for the civilian population against thugs and other criminal elements in urban environments. The app can prevent ambush attacks. The phone could be placed in the cracks of walls and other discreet locations. With internet access, a user could view the scene remotely with facebook live and see when intruders have gained unauthorized access.",

NK lacks deserts which make ideal for storage ammunition, instead it is hot and humid which sucks for ammunition storage, unless they have kept the ammo in temperature controlled storage (which I doubt, as they don\u2019t have power for it), this would explain the extremely high dud rates."
