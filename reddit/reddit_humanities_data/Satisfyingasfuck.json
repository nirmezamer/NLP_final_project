            "\"The Future\"\n\nIn 1960, the designer Hans Trippel developed an amphibious vehicle, which he had built from 1961 to 1968, mainly in Berlin-Wittenau at the Deutsche Waggon- und Maschinenfabrik (DWM) (formerly Deutsche Waffen- und Munitionsfabriken AG). The bodyshells were initially produced by Industrie-Werke Karlsruhe AG (IWK) in a former DWM armaments plant in L\u00fcbeck-Schlutup. The vehicle was available in Germany from 1962 at a price of 10,500 DM (27,164 euros in today's purchasing power and adjusted for inflation). The Amphicar sales company from Wuppertal-Elberfeld sold the vehicles. \\~wiki",
