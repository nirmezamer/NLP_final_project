A community moderator here in the Notion subreddit.\n\nI have recently been given the privilege & responsibility of stewarding this community for the foreseeable future. In this introductory video, I wanted to share a few words about what you can expect, along with a healthy encouragement for you all to share your feedback here on this post.\n\n***What to Expect:***\n\n* Reasonable consideration on your feedback about how r/Notion can improve\n* Transparency on what changes or decisions we might make moving forward\n* Ideally, a renewed sense of excitement & value being shared here within our community and amongst one another.\n* NO mod interference on talks about any leaks from Notion\n   * I took it upon myself to get clarity on this, and I will take accountability for the previous discussion on Notion Calendar being hushed, but you all no longer have to worry about that from here on out. After speaking to head of Community at Notion, I can resolutely state that the Notion team had never sought to request, encourage removal of or interfere with the community talks about the platform leaks.\n   * EDIT \u2014 I have published a separate, [**Clarifying Statement about Leaks here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1c74jxp) & down below.\n\nTruly, it is my hopes that with an open ear to your feedback & a nudge in the right direction, this subreddit and the individuals within can truly reap the rewards of having such a large community to lean on.\n\n***Some ideas we can try to achieve that:***\n\n* **AMA Sessions** \u2014 to ask your top voted creators\n* **Industry Flairs** \u2014 for finding others in your niche\n   * EDIT \u2014 I started working on the draft for Industry Flairs, and [**have a question**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1ca1gxk) for you all.\n* **Opportunity Flairs** \u2014 for those open to work & those seeking it\n* **Monthly Community Contributions** \u2014 a collaborative service to help organize Notion finds for one another! (One example could be contributing to a database Full of Notion Gems & build tricks, amongst other things!)\n* **Community Polls** \u2014 for gauging feedback & gathering opinions, and thoughts on best practices\n* **Recognition** \u2014 implementing a way to better recognize community contributors & rewarding them in some way (TBD)\n\nWith that, I and my fellow Moderators are looking forward to hearing your thoughts on all of this.\n\nLet us discover together, a way to nurture genuine value & reciprocity here, while creating more avenues for us to learn, share & inspire one another.\n\nAll the Best,  \nMr. Wildenfree \ud83d\udc3a\ud83c\udf75\ud83c\udfb5  \nu/mrwildenfree  \nCommunity Mod",

I\u2019ve also been using Notion since 2018, and one of the things I would love to see happen in the subreddit is differentiating between self promotion/blatant selling vs people simply showing off Notion builds.\n\nI know it\u2019s a thin red line, but there definitely is a difference. The current subreddit filters has it so that only super amateur Notion builds end up staying up, while experienced builds get taken down.\n\nThis is detrimental to the community for a few reasons, but one of the biggest tragedies is all of the cool ideas from experienced Notion users getting taken down because it looks like it could be a paid template.\n\nThis sub used to be great for generating ideas and seeing what other experienced Notion users were building. But the posts that rise to the top these days are people complaining about the app.\n\nThink about that for a second - for a new user of Notion, they come to the Notion subreddit to see maybe what\u2019s possible with a little experience, and the top post is about how useless this app is without offline mode (its not btw). Not a great look for the community.\n\nThat\u2019s my 2c!",
