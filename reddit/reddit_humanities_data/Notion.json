A community moderator here in the Notion subreddit.\n\nI have recently been given the privilege & responsibility of stewarding this community for the foreseeable future. In this introductory video, I wanted to share a few words about what you can expect, along with a healthy encouragement for you all to share your feedback here on this post.\n\n***What to Expect:***\n\n* Reasonable consideration on your feedback about how r/Notion can improve\n* Transparency on what changes or decisions we might make moving forward\n* Ideally, a renewed sense of excitement & value being shared here within our community and amongst one another.\n* NO mod interference on talks about any leaks from Notion\n   * I took it upon myself to get clarity on this, and I will take accountability for the previous discussion on Notion Calendar being hushed, but you all no longer have to worry about that from here on out. After speaking to head of Community at Notion, I can resolutely state that the Notion team had never sought to request, encourage removal of or interfere with the community talks about the platform leaks.\n   * EDIT \u2014 I have published a separate, [**Clarifying Statement about Leaks here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1c74jxp) & down below.\n\nTruly, it is my hopes that with an open ear to your feedback & a nudge in the right direction, this subreddit and the individuals within can truly reap the rewards of having such a large community to lean on.\n\n***Some ideas we can try to achieve that:***\n\n* **AMA Sessions** \u2014 to ask your top voted creators\n* **Industry Flairs** \u2014 for finding others in your niche\n   * EDIT \u2014 I started working on the draft for Industry Flairs, and [**have a question**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1ca1gxk) for you all.\n* **Opportunity Flairs** \u2014 for those open to work & those seeking it\n* **Monthly Community Contributions** \u2014 a collaborative service to help organize Notion finds for one another! (One example could be contributing to a database Full of Notion Gems & build tricks, amongst other things!)\n* **Community Polls** \u2014 for gauging feedback & gathering opinions, and thoughts on best practices\n* **Recognition** \u2014 implementing a way to better recognize community contributors & rewarding them in some way (TBD)\n\nWith that, I and my fellow Moderators are looking forward to hearing your thoughts on all of this.\n\nLet us discover together, a way to nurture genuine value & reciprocity here, while creating more avenues for us to learn, share & inspire one another.\n\nAll the Best,  \nMr. Wildenfree \ud83d\udc3a\ud83c\udf75\ud83c\udfb5  \nu/mrwildenfree  \nCommunity Mod",

However, I find adding tasks a bit tedious on mobile, and not so user friendly. \n\nI have added buttons, but still, adding a task involves a process that I think I would use more efficiently if it was more simple. \n\nWhen I click the task widget I made for Notion, it loads my whole task database which takes a while. Then I have to click a button that sets on some part of the page. Then I have to click all the fields that I want to fill out. The whole page may look pretty good on computer, but it does not look good on mobile. Difficult to gain overview. \n\nI love how the apps Todoist, Things or Omnifocus or others look in terms of organization. But none of them are able to fill these criteria: \n\n- Full sync back and forth (including a few custom fields in Notion like due date, status, priority, and area). \n\n- No subscription needed\n\nCan anyone help here? I just want to be able to conveniently add tasks. What did you do?",

            "You're right. Task inputs on mobile are generally trash. My workaround was build a very simple list view of the dB on a page named \"mobile\" filter for only \"input today\". You still have to do the page click through, but you can at least get to the input page. Just my thoughts. Would love notion to make a simplified app that would be great for task management, but that's probably not in the cards for a while. I'd bet we get add task through Ai chat before that... Shit that might already work. Never tried that."
