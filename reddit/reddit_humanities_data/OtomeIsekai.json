            "**I Quit Being The Male Lead's Rival** (novel)\n\n\nIt\u2019s a very neat story where everything ties into itself and wraps up nicely. I just read the novel because the newly-released manhwa is quite tragic and I could tell a good story was hidden under the disappointment. \n\nI liked that the protagonist recalled her past life rather than a possession plot. She didn\u2019t turn into a different person overnight, instead the realization just put her actions in perspective. It was quite comedic in a deadpan way and the romance between the leads is cute. I really appreciate how straightforward they were about their feelings leaving no room for silly misunderstandings. Also love a proactive, strong, and sensible female lead. The male lead is a boring, strait-laced guy and everyone constantly makes fun of him for it.",
            "I finished reading [My secretly hot husband] (I'd read s1 before, but not s2). I must admit, I was got so invested in the story. With many OIs I've read s1 feels like a masterpiece, but in s2 things start to fall apart or drag on. Not with this one. Honestly I loved s2 more than s1 (s1 was very hilarious, and in s2 the plot just got so much more interesting that I can't help but love it more). The ending was satisfactory, and I was happy that side characters were also important in the plot.",
            "Just started \"Revenge of the real one\", that has finally a scheming, revenge-driven protagonist. It's so hard to find one of these across all the good-natured discriminated ones!",
            "Finally got around to finishing \\[Glass Wall\\]. Never thought a story could shove its own development down the drain more spectacularly than \\[For Better or For Worse\\] but I stand corrected.\n\nIn hindsight it\u2019s kinda impressive how similar these two manwhas are: both had well-written and realistically flawed leads, engaging dialogue and period-accurate fashion that made them stand out compared to their peers but lost these qualities around the 80-chapter mark in favor of nonsensical conflict and manufactured drama.\n\nS1 & 2 were heartwrenching, while S3 had me rolling my eyes at how contrived the \u201cdrama\u201d was\u2014the beauty of the earlier chapters wasn\u2019t the angst itself but how realistic it all was; both the leads made mistakes but they were in-line with how the author had established their characters\u2019 up til that point and so their missteps felt like a natural consequence of two people with their personalities interacting with each other rather than shoe-horned angst. S3 on the other hand had a guy burst in with a gun on the FL\u2019s head in front of a crowd as the author couldn\u2019t come up with another way to make the ML\u2019s sister forgive her (yeah the FL jumps in to save her, sister is impressed by her selflessness and decides to make up), except none of the (at least 50) witnesses to an *attempted murder* mention wtf happened?? And that guy just walks out unscathed?? The season is chock full of similar \u201cwtf author?\u201d moments which was a dang shame because I loved literally everything else.\n\nAnyhow I still like the story and would recommend it to someone else (yes the first two seasons are that good) but those last 20 chapters or so dropped it from my Top 5 historicals to like\u2026top 10 or 15 or smth (which also happened with \\[For Better or For Worse\\]).\n\nTLDR; it would\u2019ve been a 10/10 had it ended 20 chapters ago, but it didn\u2019t.",

            "I need to talk to some or anyone about Charlotte\u2019s Wheel. Is she an unreliable narrator, unhinged, or suffering from a victim complex? What is going on? Some parts are little hard to follow because it seems to jump or maybe have taken place before she went back in time. I don\u2019t know how to fell, but I\u2019m so intrigued.",

            "I\u2019ve read through the first 20 chapters, and I\u2019m getting Mary Sue vibes from the MC.\n\nBesides the prologue, MC gets the Cinderella treatment in chapter one; she starts as a disgraced abandoned/orphaned daughter who has to make her living as a maid, but suddenly gets the support of a handsome Duke (and his handsome sons) and EVERYTHING goes uphill from there.    \nThe girl has faced no hardships since coming into the duke\u2019s home, as everything is handed to her (including befriending a spirit out of nowhere and achieving magical abilities so easily) and everyone adores her. The only obstacle is the eldest son (who\u2019s abusive and forceful to others, but not her), who she can easily stand up to, and is mainly dealing with him for the younger son and OGFL\u2019s sake. \n\nIt is a definite turn off your brain read. But I can\u2019t say I dislike it. Even though FL is getting the Mary-Sue treatment, I like her personality and go-getter attitude.    \nI like that she judges characters by their actions, and was quickly turned off by the eldest son/OGML when she saw how trash he was; she even acknowledged that he was handsome, but it wasn\u2019t an excuse for his trash behavior, and made a steadfast commitment to never be with him (the narrative makes it quite obvious that the younger son will be the future love interest).    \nI love that she communicates her desires, stands her ground, and smartly uses her adult brain without going too far (I\u2019ve read a bunch where the FMC acts like an adult in a child\u2019s body and keeps stating they\u2019re an adult; this MC is more of a child who can think maturely like an adult as she still has wisdom and experiences from her previous life that she can remember).    \nIt has been a fun read so far, and though cliche in some areas, I\u2019m still enjoying it and looking forward to more chapters. Let\u2019s see if these tropes and cliches can be put to good use and make a FMC who becomes a entertaining \u2018Badass Girlboss\u2019.",
