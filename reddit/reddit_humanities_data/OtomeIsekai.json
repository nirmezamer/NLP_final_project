            "I finished reading [My secretly hot husband] (I'd read s1 before, but not s2). I must admit, I was got so invested in the story. With many OIs I've read s1 feels like a masterpiece, but in s2 things start to fall apart or drag on. Not with this one. Honestly I loved s2 more than s1 (s1 was very hilarious, and in s2 the plot just got so much more interesting that I can't help but love it more). The ending was satisfactory, and I was happy that side characters were also important in the plot.",
            "Just started \"Revenge of the real one\", that has finally a scheming, revenge-driven protagonist. It's so hard to find one of these across all the good-natured discriminated ones!",
            "Anyone got a manhwa/novel which a MC runs away? I've read all the famous manhwa and novels and i want to read those hidden gem where MC runs away, either pregnant or not, and never comes back or had be dragged back.",
            "I haven\u2019t really been reading since the start of this year, what are some recommendations of any new stories or updated ones I should read?",
            "**Not Sew Wicked Stepmom** season 3 finale cliffhanger is so evil \ud83d\ude2d I get why they ended there, but also the PAIN!",
            "I need to talk to some or anyone about Charlotte\u2019s Wheel. Is she an unreliable narrator, unhinged, or suffering from a victim complex? What is going on? Some parts are little hard to follow because it seems to jump or maybe have taken place before she went back in time. I don\u2019t know how to fell, but I\u2019m so intrigued.",
            "**Cinderella Disappeared**\n\nIt's still pretty early on, about 30 chapters. I don't see MC returning unless circumstances are contrived greatly. Or put another way, MC probably won't return emotionally ever, but plot wise it's all up in the air.",
            "Thanks, I\u2019ll take a look!",
            "**I Quit Being The Male Lead's Rival** (novel)\n\n\nIt\u2019s a very neat story where everything ties into itself and wraps up nicely. I just read the novel because the newly-released manhwa is quite tragic and I could tell a good story was hidden under the disappointment. \n\nI liked that the protagonist recalled her past life rather than a possession plot. She didn\u2019t turn into a different person overnight, instead the realization just put her actions in perspective. It was quite comedic in a deadpan way and the romance between the leads is cute. I really appreciate how straightforward they were about their feelings leaving no room for silly misunderstandings. Also love a proactive, strong, and sensible female lead. The male lead is a boring, strait-laced guy and everyone constantly makes fun of him for it.",
            "Finally got around to finishing \\[Glass Wall\\]. Never thought a story could shove its own development down the drain more spectacularly than \\[For Better or For Worse\\] but I stand corrected.\n\nIn hindsight it\u2019s kinda impressive how similar these two manwhas are: both had well-written and realistically flawed leads, engaging dialogue and period-accurate fashion that made them stand out compared to their peers but lost these qualities around the 80-chapter mark in favor of nonsensical conflict and manufactured drama.\n\nS1 & 2 were heartwrenching, while S3 had me rolling my eyes at how contrived the \u201cdrama\u201d was\u2014the beauty of the earlier chapters wasn\u2019t the angst itself but how realistic it all was; both the leads made mistakes but they were in-line with how the author had established their characters\u2019 up til that point and so their missteps felt like a natural consequence of two people with their personalities interacting with each other rather than shoe-horned angst. S3 on the other hand had a guy burst in with a gun on the FL\u2019s head in front of a crowd as the author couldn\u2019t come up with another way to make the ML\u2019s sister forgive her (yeah the FL jumps in to save her, sister is impressed by her selflessness and decides to make up), except none of the (at least 50) witnesses to an *attempted murder* mention wtf happened?? And that guy just walks out unscathed?? The season is chock full of similar \u201cwtf author?\u201d moments which was a dang shame because I loved literally everything else.\n\nAnyhow I still like the story and would recommend it to someone else (yes the first two seasons are that good) but those last 20 chapters or so dropped it from my Top 5 historicals to like\u2026top 10 or 15 or smth (which also happened with \\[For Better or For Worse\\]).\n\nTLDR; it would\u2019ve been a 10/10 had it ended 20 chapters ago, but it didn\u2019t."

            "Can I maybe get some recs for other series with scenes like this? I am *such* a sucker for parts where the FL and ML realize she\u2019s actually way more damaged by their past rejection than she thought, to the point where she only just realizes she doesn\u2019t really believe they\u2019ll protect or rescue her.\n\nMy guilty pleasure trope is similar, actually. When the FL hits total apathy-mode, and that makes the ML fall into a very specific despair that usually includes eye-bags, sleepless nights, and a lot of regret upon realizing it. The \u201cWished You Were Dead\u201d variety of misery that leads to grovelling, yk? ML driven mad by grief for a person still technically \u2018living\u2019.",

While we're on it, can someone please recommend me some webtoon or manhwa that is the same as 'Philomel the fake' that can capture the angst really well?",
            "Not very original but tsundari/obsessive ML. Doesn't even make sense because I'm a lesbian who's never had any interest and I'm usually bored of the spicy scenes, but give me that obsessive dynamic and I'm hooked. It has to be earned though, I don't like it when it's immediate because it feels like lazy writing. I Thought My Time Was Up is my favorite version of this, he FL actually has a personality and things build slowly.",
            "Something kinda specific I like is when our mc dies in their one life, and she dies hated/ignored/not fully loved. But someone, be it a child or our ml or even a nameless faceless character still mourns that bad version of our mc. Doesn't have to be extreme, just a feeling of loss or respect is good. Super basic but I like the idea of \"you're never as unlovable as you think you are or the world says you are\"\n\nSolitary lady did this kinda and esp kill the villainess with the maid. Tyrant wants to be good also *kinda* did this but not rly. Stepmother's marchen did this too iirc",
