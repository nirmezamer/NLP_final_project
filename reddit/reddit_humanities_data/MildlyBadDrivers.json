People don't pay attention and apparently the \"Sun\" camouflages cars, even if they are right in front of your face",
            "After so many reposts of this, I think I finally understood why the white car hit the Porsche. Look at the road. The markings doesn't indicate that this is a 2 way road. The white car driver probably assumed that it's a one direction road based on the weird markings and the red car. He couldn't initially see the Porsche due to the fence. So, he just looked at only one direction.\n\nEither way, dumb driver. ALWAYS look at BOTH directions when getting on to the road. Never assume.",
