The white car driver probably assumed that it's a one direction road based on the weird markings and the red car. He couldn't initially see the Porsche due to the fence. So, he just looked at only one direction.\n\nEither way, dumb driver. ALWAYS look at BOTH directions when getting on to the road. Never assume.",
