            "We will likely submit this guide to KQM shortly after Kafka's release, so you will hopefully be able to view the guide there, as well. If any other theory-crafters want to contribute the work they've done and compare it to what we have so far, join the reddit's Discord located in the sidebar! We hope the guide is helpful to everyone interested in playing Kafka.",
            "Mods should Pin this ASAP! Nice work \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffd",
            "Seems like it\u2019s worth mentioning the DoT synergy with Freeze effects and keeping that in mind when interacting with Sampo/Luka dmg debuff.",
            "So from reading this it seems like versus a single boss target Kafka - Luka - SW - Luocha will be the best general purpose setup. Then for any setup with a group of enemies you would want Kafka - Sampo - Pela - luocha. This is assuming Sampo = Luka and SW = Pela gear wise. \n\n\nIt sounds like the Asta team would be the best general team but the restriction on the rotation seems pretty difficult to overcome. Even with an ERR rope and Von Waq set you need a full S5 lightcone for it so for most people you'll be stuck with a 3 star lightcone. I guess Astas stats don't matter for her buffs with neither the speed buff or Attack% buff scaling with her stats just with the level of the ultimate and talent traces. \n\n\nAm I missing something or is that about right?",
            "Cool guide! Thanks for posting. Something I didn't see talked about was the relative effect of building Break Effect on the Dot flex character. This may only be tangentially related to Kafka's build herself, but it is important for her team. As far as I can tell Break Effect is fairly mid on most characters not named Serval, but would a Kafka team benefit from Sampo or Luka focusing on Break effect with her ability to trigger the dot so often with high speeds? I don't know if anyone here did any TC about it (and I certainly haven't done any calculations) so I'm curious if it's worth it on anyone except Serval.",
            "From this guide.\n\n>**134 SPD** \\- this gives you an extra turn in the first cycle and another in the third and sixth cycles; very useful and important to have.\n\nThat's incorrect. 134 speed is an extra turn in the **1st**, **4th**, **7th** and **10th** cycle. Not 3rd and 6th.",
            "If genshin player have KQM then hsr player should have KKM(Kafka main)",
            "Oh, kqm has star rail guides? I had no idea.",
            "I disagree with the label of the Triple DOT team (Kafka, Sampo, Luka) being 'jack of all trades, master of none'.  Testing has shown overwhelmingly that the Bleed mechanic from Luka is insanely OP.  Guoba did a wonderful video on this that I highly recommend.  Bleed and the way it enhances other DOTs will be vital and the numbers from that particular team setup should be head and shoulders above all other compositions for Kafka.",

            "I\u2018m currently looking to optimize my Kafka team and I\u2018m a bit clueless about what to do. \n\nSo, the base team is E1 Kafka and E0 BS, both with their signature LC.\n\nNow for the 3rd slot I could use Pela or Silver Wolf, but would strongly prefer not to, as I want them in my Acheron team. I have neither Robin nor RM (and don\u2019t really plan on pulling for her, as I\u2018d rather keep saving for Jade). \nOther options I have are maybe Asta (E6), Tingyun (E4), Bronya and Sparkle (E0 without their LC). But I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re that good with Kafka.\n\nFrom what I\u2018ve read, adding another DoT unit like Sampo, Gui or Luca would be a waste of dmg potential? Otherwise these would be options available, too. \n\nWho would be the currently BiS support for her? So I can consider pulling that in the future (or look into replacing Pela/SW in Acherons team).",
            "Just double checking my math here. With PAYN (14.4 speed) and Ruan Mei (9.7 speed) , 136 speed on Kafka will end up being 160, right? So is 136 speed a good place to stop?",
            "With the news of Huohuo AND Black Swam rerun next patch, I wanted to ask which is better to roll for my DoT team: a e0 Huohuo (I already have Gallagher, FuXuan and Aventurine built) or e1 BS (I already have her, and would be rolling for her e1) ?",
            "It depends on your available lightcones.\n\nThird dot is the best option, especially when Kafka eidolons come into play. The higher the eidolons, the more noticeable the gap. Guinafen with RAP s5 is very potent, stacking defense shred on top of vulnerability is particularly good. Sampo uses EOTP but makes up the difference with their high personal damage and break. The Prisoner - Glamoth combo turned the tide in their favor.\n\nHowever, if you're aiming for low cycle clears Tingyun with DDD s5 is the better pick, spamming ultimates and advancing forward pair really well. Asta is of a similar power level but requires planning and managing sp.\n\nDon't use Pela/Silver Wolf for dot, almost every other 4 \u2606 support performs better.\n\nYou already mentioned two BiS supports for Kafka and plan on skipping one. I don't understand the question.\n\nRegardless, Black Swan > Ruan Mei > Robin.",
            "Yes, that is correct.",
            "Black Swan e1 is tremendously powerful. If you want to ignore weakness this is the way, get her lightcone too if you can.\n\nPull Huohuo if you want comfort."
