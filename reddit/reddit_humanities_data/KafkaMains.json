            "Mods should Pin this ASAP! Nice work \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffd",
            "Seems like it\u2019s worth mentioning the DoT synergy with Freeze effects and keeping that in mind when interacting with Sampo/Luka dmg debuff.",
            "Cool guide! Thanks for posting. Something I didn't see talked about was the relative effect of building Break Effect on the Dot flex character. This may only be tangentially related to Kafka's build herself, but it is important for her team. As far as I can tell Break Effect is fairly mid on most characters not named Serval, but would a Kafka team benefit from Sampo or Luka focusing on Break effect with her ability to trigger the dot so often with high speeds? I don't know if anyone here did any TC about it (and I certainly haven't done any calculations) so I'm curious if it's worth it on anyone except Serval.",
            "If genshin player have KQM then hsr player should have KKM(Kafka main)",
            "Oh, kqm has star rail guides? I had no idea.",
            "I disagree with the label of the Triple DOT team (Kafka, Sampo, Luka) being 'jack of all trades, master of none'.  Testing has shown overwhelmingly that the Bleed mechanic from Luka is insanely OP.  Guoba did a wonderful video on this that I highly recommend.  Bleed and the way it enhances other DOTs will be vital and the numbers from that particular team setup should be head and shoulders above all other compositions for Kafka.",
            "Thank you for the hardwork!",
            "Why does this guide say that Asta needs Vonwacq?  You just need an ER% rope/cogs for a two turn rotation.  You do not need Vonwacq on top of that.\n\nI also have no idea why you're going with a squishy Asta build with the attack% body and fire dmg orb.  That's asking for Asta to get deleted when she contributes very little damage to begin with.",
            "I wanna raise the possibility of using the Eagle Set and Tutorial Mission on Kafka for a faster Ult rotation, as long as you have a source of DEF down in the team: 5 (Ultimate) + 30 (Skill) + 10 (followup) + 30 + 10 + 5x8 (Tutorial) = 125 Energy, for a 2-turn Ult rotation, which in turn can give her more turns through Eagle Set's 4-pc.\n\nI don't know if this is worth dropping Kafka's personal damage, and obviously the 40% Effect Hit Rate from Tutorial is a bit wasted unless you have E1 Kafka, plus if you're running Pela she might want Tutorial more instead. But I think having a faster Ult for more DoT triggers that also gives her a psuedo-SPD boost is worth exploring.",
            "Won't you lose damage if you go for EHR chest piece instead of attack% at E1, or is the E1 payoff worth it?"

            "Just double checking my math here. With PAYN (14.4 speed) and Ruan Mei (9.7 speed) , 136 speed on Kafka will end up being 160, right? So is 136 speed a good place to stop?",
            "With the news of Huohuo AND Black Swam rerun next patch, I wanted to ask which is better to roll for my DoT team: a e0 Huohuo (I already have Gallagher, FuXuan and Aventurine built) or e1 BS (I already have her, and would be rolling for her e1) ?",

            "Yes, that is correct.",
            "I\u2018m currently looking to optimize my Kafka team and I\u2018m a bit clueless about what to do. \n\nSo, the base team is E1 Kafka and E0 BS, both with their signature LC.\n\nNow for the 3rd slot I could use Pela or Silver Wolf, but would strongly prefer not to, as I want them in my Acheron team. I have neither Robin nor RM (and don\u2019t really plan on pulling for her, as I\u2018d rather keep saving for Jade). \nOther options I have are maybe Asta (E6), Tingyun (E4), Bronya and Sparkle (E0 without their LC). But I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re that good with Kafka.\n\nFrom what I\u2018ve read, adding another DoT unit like Sampo, Gui or Luca would be a waste of dmg potential? Otherwise these would be options available, too. \n\nWho would be the currently BiS support for her? So I can consider pulling that in the future (or look into replacing Pela/SW in Acherons team).",
            "It depends on your available lightcones.\n\nThird dot is the best option, especially when Kafka eidolons come into play. The higher the eidolons, the more noticeable the gap. Guinafen with RAP s5 is very potent, stacking defense shred on top of vulnerability is particularly good. Sampo uses EOTP but makes up the difference with their high personal damage and break. The Prisoner - Glamoth combo turned the tide in their favor.\n\nHowever, if you're aiming for low cycle clears Tingyun with DDD s5 is the better pick, spamming ultimates and advancing forward pair really well. Asta is of a similar power level but requires planning and managing sp.\n\nDon't use Pela/Silver Wolf for dot, almost every other 4 \u2606 support performs better.\n\nYou already mentioned two BiS supports for Kafka and plan on skipping one. I don't understand the question.\n\nRegardless, Black Swan > Ruan Mei > Robin."
