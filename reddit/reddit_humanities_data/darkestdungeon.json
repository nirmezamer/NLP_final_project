            "Taken from the official discord :\n\nWe\u2019ve been hard at work getting the build into testers hands and navigating the initial kinks. The release is nearly there, and we\u2019re looking for more testers to help us out. Read on for an update on our progress and, if you\u2019re interested, sign up to help us test the mod build ahead of its public release: [https://www.darkestdungeon.com/news/progress-report-on-initial-darkest-dungeon-ii-mod-release](https://www.darkestdungeon.com/news/progress-report-on-initial-darkest-dungeon-ii-mod-release)\n\nLots of cool future mods are showcased, so check it out",

            "Modders, we will watch your careers with great interest.",
            "I hope there's some way to get mods working on Epic Games!",
            "It\u2019s time boys",
            "I just want to change the tooltip descriptions of skills and trinkets because there is so much inconsistency \n\nMaybe reduce negative relationship when on random road checks and choosing an option different than what a character wanted (-2 to -1)\n\nAlso maybe making it that so positively and negatively affected skills by relationships only apply to currently selected skills, hates when a negative effect goes to a trash skill to your characters and you can't unequip it.",

This is crazy that the game actually acknowledges this.\n\nSecond, the very first time I won against the Shambler, I also had a Hellion called Villehardain. She was the sole casualty of the expedition, and the sole survivor of the attack on the Hamlet before that. I miss her.",
