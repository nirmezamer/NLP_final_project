            "It's so fucking annoying how this game is supposed to be competitive but rigs it for good players with matchmaking by making it so that they get matched up with bad teammates. Where's the competitive aspect on that when it's rigged?  \"Oh it makes the game more challenging for good players1!1!\" And? It makes the game easier for bad players, there's no incentive on being good if you can just be dog shit and feed while still being handed good teammates. Not only that you face good opponents too and you have to play above your ranks skill level if you really want to rank up.\n\n\nBad players need to stay low rank and learn to carry themselves but no the matchmaking makes it \"fair\" for them. I'm already on the discord server but everyone there plays classic or doesn't want to play with me so I'm forced to go solo que since I'm a shut in and I don't socialize as much.",
