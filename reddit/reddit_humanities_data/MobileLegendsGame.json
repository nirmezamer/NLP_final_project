            "Dear diary, I am at a point where I just want to relax and laugh when playing. Good team, bad team, very good enemy team, easy enemy team, winning, losing... None of it matter anymore. All became too stressful for me in the last couple of seasons\n\nThe last two seasons I got to glory and I don't think I am an immortal tier player yet so I plan on improving in the game. I will be playing classic (I am not talking about trying new heroes there) and I will be enjoying the experience instead of focusing on doing good. I will do good, this is a game, it will all be okay",
            "Kinda bad at the game but that\u2019s expected with having under hundred matches for every hero?\nI just want to be better at my gameplay but I get chicken and I\u2019m not that familiar with everyone\u2019s ulti yet. Slowly but surely doing improving and avoiding silly mistakes, such as killing off an enemy only to be ganked by the rest of their team.. and knowing when to strike and when to flee and when to do a mixture of both",

Fine I guess but that CD is way too high.\nS2 - Personally, I think either it requires too many stacks to activate, or it's range needs increasing. Also, lackluster damage again. This skill also sucks against any dash skill as the movement on it is glacial slow\nThat said Iike the fact that once they are airborne you can fling them around.\nS3 - meh, it's alright, shield is pretty pointless, no damage but makes the CC activation easier... \n\nMost mages I feel can do ok on their own, Zhuxin feels like she's very reliant on her team to peel and protect her while she focuses on her targets to get them airborne.\nI think it's a wasted ban if you ban her, I don't think she's good enough to displace Xavier, Kagura, Nana etc from the Meta.\n",

            "My early impression:       \n\nShe will get buff in next update and revamp pretty soon for sure. Early game her S1 has 11 sec cd and doesn't have much damage. Her s2 eats too much mana so what should I unlock first? S2. But mana problem is there and wave clearing is slow with s2. After level 4 her ult has 55 sec cd. Her combo is S1 ult s2. But even with full build her mana situation never changes. In mid fight you lose all mana again  and again.if you are in mid clearing  minions with s2 and you lose all your mana and get sudden ganked, how to save  yourself?  She is a CC hero but pretty squishy. In what situation she is good and better pick? IDK.  Why would anyone pick Zhuxin over other meta heros like Xavier, Vexana, nana, change' or even Vale. She deals a lot of damage but is this enough? Her presence doesn't change current meta and in my opinion she is not pick or ban worthy.",

            "Ngl I can see her be a monster in good hands, she may need a small buff tho but it's still her first day so someone might explore her and maybe find the best strat for her in the future",
            "she feels meh, no burst, nor enough utility cause her s2 cc isn't guaranteed cc all the time, s1 only for little bit of slow (no dmg) \uff1e her lane clearing is mainly on s2 (then u have to choose clear minions or poke the enemy)\n\ni hope she can get a small buff, she's underperforming as a mage, as roam also not good, cause again not guaranteed cc plus she's squishy",
            "Yesss, I tried her, she's fun, but so easy to die imo, especially when the opponent is able to dash, before you can make the enemy fly you would've been dead\n\nShe clears lane quite slow too",
