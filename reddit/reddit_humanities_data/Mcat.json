Being well rested, in a good head space, nourished, hydrated, recovered, recovered from fatigue.\n\nBut obviously life isn't perfect and sometimes the stars don't align such that you can enter the transcendental study state allowing you to channel the divine scientific knowledge of our lord and savior Doctor Medicine and Professor Science.\n\nSometimes you feel like trash, you mess up your sleep, you miss the gym, you forget to drink water, you miss breakfast, you get in an argument that ruins your mood. But you still have work to do, you still have studying to get done.\n\nSo in your experience what value have you found from studying when you're not firing on all cylinders, or maybe even half your cylinders. Do you see returns on that investment or do you put your efforts elsewhere unless you can put quality time in? Genuinely interested to hear what y'all think and what your individual experiences are with this. Especially if you have evidence that it's still worth it beyond \"I feel like it did\", like maybe you had 2 weeks of trash studying and still saw an improvement somewhere.\n\nEDIT: Sorry for any CARS trauma I caused with how I wrote this, I was dropped on my head as a child and again as an adult.",

But if hydration is as simple as a flick of the wrist then you can at least guarantee that. Additionally, 3 hours a day for 9 months and 6 days a week. A manageable plan for many busy people. Not a drop of anki and only practice questions because the exam never throws Flashcards at you.",

            "Absolutely. Low quality studying is infinitely better than no studying. The stuff needs to get into your head, and it\u2019s not gonna happen by osmosis.\n\nThat being said, there does come a time where it is more sustainable to insert a day of rest into your schedule.",
