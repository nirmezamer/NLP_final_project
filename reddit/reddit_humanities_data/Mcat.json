        "content": "I just wanted to come back to this thread and say that anything is possible. I got rude comments on my post excited about being accepted into medical school 2 years ago where I mentioned I got into medical school w a 490. While some were positive others were disgusting and really negative. Saying I won\u2019t make it past boards, I\u2019ll fail out of school etc etc etc. Honestly I laughed at some then others I was just thought to myself you know what? A SCORE DOES NOT DEFINE YOU! I\u2019m not telling anyone to apply w low MCAT scores whatsoever. I\u2019m just saying that if you do get into medical school with a low score do not let it define you because your medical school didn\u2019t let it define you. \n\nI didn\u2019t have the right balance nor did I have the resources to take the exam MCAT. I come from a low income family who could not support me (even though they tried their best) and I just tried my best to study with what I had. When coming into medical school I had to let go of what I did previously to get in and grinded like I knew I could. With refunds and school resources I was able to afford and get resources to help support me through school like ALL other students. I was able to use them to level up my study habits as well as use different techniques w/o worrying about $! I just say this to say don\u2019t let a score define you and keep grinding to reach your dream. I\u2019m done w didactics and honored in some of my courses (\ud83d\udd95to the naysayers that said I couldn\u2019t). I love winning and proving haters wrong. Now I am a M3 and ready to take on Clinicals! If you\u2019re reading this know you are good enough and will. Reach your dreams!\n\n- The Person with the 490",
