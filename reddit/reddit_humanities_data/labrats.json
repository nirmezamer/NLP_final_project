            "I\u2019m in undergrad working on research and the grad student in my lab was doing the sonification for my newest mutation and the falcon tube broke so now I have to restart five wks of work and boy did I need a cry after that",
            "No work-life balance, at all. I am a TECH, and haven't had a doctors or dentist appointment in two years. No vacations, multiple weekends gavaging and sac'ing mice, and people act like it's expected of me despite them taking weeks off at a time. The one time I need to take a day to see a doctor, everyone reschedules everything to time slots literally within the hour of my appointment. I have, all morning, been arguing with post-docs, grad students whose experiments I'm doing, and lab \"partners\" about why suddenly pushing up something without letting me know in advance shows an evident lack of communication and disrespect of my time, rather than me letting them know about my appointment in case they needed to suddenly dump everything to today so they have a lighter workload. I am sick of being treated like I am inconsiderate, stupid, or crazy for taking time for myself. Fuck you, fuck the lab, fuck academia, I hope all your mice get parasites and die and that none of you graduate on time.",

            "Grad students in my lab are constantly stressed and talking about how overworked, underpayed and stressed / suicidal they are. I am an undergrad doing my best and recently started my own project and they left for a conference. A mistake was made by myself, another undergrad working with me, and my grad student as I sent them photos of every step and they didn\u2019t catch it either. I made them incredibly mad and they stormed in the lab and yelled at me that I wouldn\u2019t be allowed to work on their stuff ever again. Had a mental breakdown, led to stress induced tunnel vision and brain fog, ubered home, cried some more. Never want to go back but have to complete my project I got a scholarship for but I don\u2019t know how I can be in a place so bad for my mental health. I really love the lab too and love working but my grad student is so scary and I put so much weight on her opinion and it\u2019s just not working out. I know how stressed they are and understand the frustration of your project being messed with, I\u2019ve been experiencing that with my own and the added guilt of that and seeing the parallels of me with my undergraduate I\u2019m mentoring and her with me is mind fucking me and I don\u2019t know how this dynamic can be fixed. Trust has been lost by her for me and vice versa and what had become a safe-ish space (as long as I didn\u2019t make any mistakes after which many have caused breakdowns and neither of them were this bad) is ruined and my research feels ruined and I don\u2019t know how to move on. I\u2019m going to meet with the my PI who\u2019s really nice to discuss at some point but I just don\u2019t know what to do.",

People would ignore really expensive clothing due to stains, etc. I'd buy them and used greased lightning to remove the stains completely. I own gallons of the stuff now in my garage.",

She also said it was because they often chatted about random stuff. \n\nI don't chat. I work nonstop. I actually measured how long I was sitting and it was 45 min today. And those minutes were spent working (writing, checking emails). \n\nI am exhausted.",
            "I feel more isolated than ever in my lab. I don't talk to the people in my lab because they are toxic AF and have this horrible high school level clique culture. Most of them are openly sabotaging by nature which just makes it worse. They try to misinform you on purpose or try to make you insecure about yourself all the time, their central points of discussion are their personal lives and how hard their lives are... There is NO scientific discussion . I just decided at one point it was better to be out of the group than in it.\n\nI am the only biologist in my lab and my project is far far away from anything the institute or lab even remotely works in so it's tiring and isolating. Even my PI (who initiated this project) does not know enough about it to discuss it with me even though I report my results to him everytime. I feel like an untethered creature running aimlessly amok.\n\nI wish there was more regulation and more discussion in my life about science. I'm just so tired. I want to finish up soon... I'm in my fourth year already.\n\nI'm just so tired and alone."

So it\u2019s a wash. \n\nOrgs like polycarbin and triumvirate environmental offer great recycling programs, but if you go to my green labs, you can also find items that are more green when sourcing.",

        "content": "Hi I (25)  just graduated from my masters in molecular biology. I was happy with what I\u2019ve achieved in my thesis dissertation and I decided to enter an internship program in another country where my family lives.\n\n\nThe internship is basically the things I\u2019ve already done during my masters so it should be easy for me. Wrong. I\u2019m never sure about anything. Simple math I\u2019m second guessing and when I calculate things for my reagents Im back home and I can\u2019t sleep because I think I messed up the math. I cried thinking I\u2019m going to get fired but the next day it would go fine(this would happen multiple times).the experiment would almost always go well. \n\nIm asking my professors the tiniest details which I already know the answer to but I\u2019m worried about not getting it fully right. Sometimes after my shift I\u2019d walk around the lab 3 or 4 times and make sure I didn\u2019t leave any electricity running or else something would go off and set the lab on fire.\n\nThe only time I made a mistake is when my postdoc asked me to look after a volunteer perform an experiment (protein estimation) and I asked her to get Reagent A and reagent B but the volunteer used chemiluminescent for developing. She insisted that this the correct reagents and I told her it isn\u2019t and she used it anyways. The experiment didn\u2019t work and I asked her to go get the correct reagents . When it worked the volunteer told the postdoc what happened although I told her not to go tell her. Long story short this postdoc yelled at me infront of my colleagues and the entire lab heard . I cried so much I couldn\u2019t hold back my tears for the rest of the day . I understand she trusted me to take leadership on this but i considered this an unfair way to treat me in front of my colleagues .\n\n\n\nI am over this I really am she  but I\u2019m swayed I can\u2019t focus. I\u2019m wondering if this is normal to feel this way?\n",

            "I don't understand, how were you at fault? What, the post-doc wanted you to be more assertive with the volunteer? You did tell her how to do things right, what should you have done? Well in any case, it's perfectly normal to not feel comfortable around the lab when you're starting out, every lab does things a little bit different. And even if you're comfortable, it happens that you repeat the same procedure 99 times and get it wrong the on the 100th. We've all been there, we are not robots, mistakes are human. To me it sounds like you are in a toxic and stressful environment, where the prospect of a mistake is frightening and anxiety inducing. It's good though if it's just an internship, at least now you know this might not be the best lab to pursue a career in, if that was on your mind.",
            "Sounds like super unfair treatment from the postdoc. Yelling at someone, public or not, is never okay and you should let the PI know about this. Maybe even HR.\n\nWhat you are experiencing is imposter syndrome. You are competent, but it is hard to see it yourself. Lots of people struggle with this, take comfort in that you are not alone!",
            "It is NEVER ok for someone at work to yell at you. You need to talk to your PI about what happened and maybe HR. Document everything.",
            "I would say it's always better to double and triple check every step you do because our kind of work requires attention to detail..I wouldn't call it second guessing.. it's just a safety measure so that you know everything is going fine and it has helped you so far hasn't it?\nIt's totally fine to feel this way when you are starting out..I think once you become comfortable with your lab environment and your work, your anxiety about whether you are doing things right will reduce.",
            "I\u2019m at fault for not approaching the postdoc and telling them the volunteer is using the wrong reagents postdoc claims to be one phone call away but TBH  In my defense postdoc is  not approachable",
            "This is what I\u2019ve assumed : It is  also the prospect of Im the youngest there less experienced and everyone else is much older than me (35+ and very experienced) and I\u2019m their only intern. I constantly overhear them saying that They have projects to do and get done while they\u2019re tired of training \u201cstudents\u201d aka me and the volunteers. The postdoc said this infront of me to the RA and even pointed at me :\u201dask them! I\u2019m not very nice  am I?\u201d To which the RA said \u201cNo I can\u2019t be not nice ! I\u2019m too soft\u201d . Post doc laughed and said \u201cthey will tell u they\u2019re lost for words right?\u201d . Made me very uncomfortable.
