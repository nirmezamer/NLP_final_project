            "I am experiencing this too nothing like having like 7 kills then crashing with no ability to at least come back and spectate. Additionally the bomb drone is broken, my character always freezes when launching it. Such a shame, this game is a massive improvement from the original Warzone too bad its bug ridden",

            "I can't even start the game. When I try to launch it, my PC just shuts off. No bluescreen or anything, it just reboots. Already tried a fresh Win11 installation, before I had Win10. New PC-hardware and newest drivers.",

            "Such a bummer that a game with such potential like Warzone is constantly plagued by bugs and experiences that dont allow the users to fully enjoy the game",
            "Is anyone else having their whole PC crash with this, or just me? Never had PC crash issues aside from mid-game in Warzone"

Recently the lobbies have been brutal, I\u2019m getting 2 kills max. Even switched over to my other gamertag that I\u2019ve never used for warzone so I\u2019m a level 1.

Whereas in the clip it looks like you used your right stick to do most of your aiming, resulting in the left to right over correction.",

Aim a bit higher for the chest, he hit all chest.\nAlso, when using meta vs non-meta weapons it feels like the game allows the meta weapons user the opportunity to hit their shots, if they hit them youre dead, if not the meta weapon user is dead. Its really hard to explain but there is a weird window the game has where you should be dead but since you are using the meta weapon you survive.",
