            "The graphics look like a nice upgrade over 2020.",
            "Absolutely stunning. Love they took the career approach. Adds so much depth to the sim.",
            "Are we getting AI traffic with real world liveries???",
            "November 19. OMGGG!!!!!!",
            "Will they be releasing specs required or something along them lines as looking into my first pc build and making the switch, 2024 looked phenomenal."

            "One time ATC had me holding short at LFMN for 15 minutes because an AI flight glitched out and wouldn't leave the runway. I went to do something and when I came back, I was cleared for take off, but then I was made to hold short again because a plane was landing but there was no one coming so I just took off anyway.",
