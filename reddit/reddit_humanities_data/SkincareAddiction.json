It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!\n\n* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)\n\n* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)\n\n* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question\n\n* **Anything new** you\u2019ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin\n\n* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThanks for taking the time to include your information!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#Would you like to give advice?\n\nFirstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!\n\nSome things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree. \n\nIf you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful.

This one looks similar to blister and a bit itchy. I'm thinking the one on my arm is Dyshidrotic eczema. I have always have bumps there like keratosis but just recently it started to look like blisters. \n*",

(Not shure if serum or in a moisturizer). Also I maybe want to swap out my moisturizer for another one thats affordable and does the job without worsening my acne.\n\nI am interested in your advice for me, thanks!",

I apply sunscreen everyday and dont go out in the sun much during the day as I work inside. And if I do go outside, because I wear makeup, I reapply a powder spf, its called brush on block. I havens started to use more products with spf to. My question is or are, do yall recommend chemical or mineral sunscreens? Advice on getting rid of fading spots? And how to prevent them from coming? My dermatologist prescribed me hydroquinone but it didnt really work. Thanks!"

If you really enjoy that one then ignore me, I just personally had better results switching to Australian brands considering their requirements for sunscreens are a lot stricter, since their UV index is thru the roof and they have high skin cancer rates.",

In an email to customers, they assured us despite the visual rebrand, they would not be reformulating products. So I was optimistic that this redesign wouldn\u2019t negatively affect those of us part of the loyal customer base they\u2019d built with their (previously) great products.\n\n2 days ago I ordered a staple product of mine, a toner renamed and reorganized into one of their new lines. I received it in the mail yesterday and tested it out. The first difference I noted was the difference in smell. Whereas the old formulation smelled a bit clean & potent, this one smells\u2026. Fruity. And that\u2019s when I knew I was screwed. I applied the toner and it felt absolutely NOTHING like the old formulation. The old formulation had this sorta cooling, tingly feeling when applied, that I really loved. I\u2019m livid because I used the old formulation toner to calm & soothe the itchy rashes I get sometimes, and shrink blemishes. The old formualtion would shrink my blemishes within a couple days, and you could feel the toner actually working. This toner has none of that cooling, tingly feeling at all. And it\u2019s definitely not going to shrink pimples, it feels like I\u2019m applying fruit juice on my skin.\n\nI compared the ingrgedients of the old formulation to the new one and my worst fears were realized\u2014 different ingredients lists. I called Facetheory today asking for an explanation and the customer service rep admitted that some of the products had underwent \u201cformula updates\u201d despite face theory\u2019s assurance that no formulas had been changed.\n\nMy staple toner is not the only product that has been affected by this rebrand. According to customers on Instagram, they have found that their favorite products have been reformulated with Benzene as an added ingredient, amongst others. Customers are also finding it hard to find the renamings of their beloved products, only to find that some of the renamings have come with reformulations.\n\n\nI don\u2019t know how in a million years Face Theory thought this was a good idea but I\u2019m hoping this is just a bad dream",
