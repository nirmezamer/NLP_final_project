            "What are the career pathways i have if i want a hybrid job being a chemistry/polymer science student?",
            "\n\n I have been selected for the best private engineering college (on par with our best Public technical institutes) of India, where I can secure a Bachelor of Engineering (the branch is allotted based on your first year performance) and an MS in chemistry (Integrated 5-year degree) and also for one of our top public research universities for an Integrated BS-MS in chemical sciences. I am conflicted about what to choose, as the former offers great job security but in India even more so than the rest of the world, chemistry is a non-existent part of Chem E and I am really interested in chem. also worth noting is that the total fees for my engineering college is roughly 40 times the fees of the public uni ( Public uni is quite cheap and my parents can afford the former(no loans) but it will definitely be a big thing for them).any advice is appreciated",
            "Advice for master degree\n\nHello there! I'm finishing my bachelor degree in chemistry and I'm about to start a master degree. I think I'd like to end up in the drug design, but I'm worried that maybe it is a little too \"pharmaceutical matter\". Can a chemist work in drug design as a chemist? Maybe in organic synthesis or predicting how active a functional group could be? In what coul a chemist be helpfull in that sector?  Anyone of you works there? I'd love to hear your stories! I always thought I would have done a normal curriculum in Organic Chemistry but now I'm thinking maybe isn't enough specific for this. Let me now what you think about, thank you.",

            "I would like some help figuring out graduate school. I have terrified that I won't be accepted into a good doctoral program. I am a rising junior at a R1 school in NY and I have listed my stats below:\n\nMajor: Medicinal Chemistry\n\nGPA: 3.3\n\nResearch Experience: 2 months worth of lab experience with a professor focusing in environmental analytical chemistry\n\nLeadership Experience: Co-owner and manager of a small taxi company for 4 years now, Vice president of the glee club\n\nI went to community college before transferring to a bigger school. That is why I do not have the best stats. I have only been at this school for about two semesters now. By the time I graduate, my GPA should be closer to 3.6 and I should have a year worth of research experience. I am considering applying to NYU, CUNY Advanced Science Research Center, Stony Brooke University, University at Buffalo, and University at Delaware. I will have strong recommendation letters from my PI, a postdoc that I work with, and a professor from my CC. I will also be taking the GRE in September. I aim to have scores around 160 and above for the verbal and quantitative, and above 5 for the analytical writing. I am willing to provide more information if needed.\n\nWhere do I stand in line of applicants? Will I have a good chance or not?\n\nThank you!",
            "Should I pursue a phd to work in renewable energies?\n\nHi. I'm from Argentina, and I have finished my studies in chemistry. (here, studies take 5 years TT\\_TT, similar to bch degree + master , but it's not a master.)\n\nI've been working in private sector for three years: Pharma for a year (didn't like it, as I don't like organic chemistry) and now doing my second year in geochemistry. This is much more interesting for me, as I'm using a laser ablation system, an ICP and other cool toys.\n\nBut my personal goal is to work in the renewable energy field, hoping to make a contribution.\n\nI love to learn new stuff, but don't particulary like the academia world. I have the idea that research is more having trouble with egoes and low budgets (at lest that's what it is in Argentina). Please correct me if I'm wrong. I like teaching, though. And I think that I did a pretty good job when I was a teacher.\n\nAnyway, I'm considering pursuing a phd in other country, for 3 things:\n\n1. the \"pleasure\" of doing it. Ok, let's say satisfaction, not pleasure.\n2. the possibility of achieving cooler jobs in private industry. (not better paid... just more interesting)\n3. knowing and visiting other countries.\n\nAlso, I don't know what kind of phd would be beneficial. I know I don't like organic chemistry, I prefer more inorganic and analythical. And I'm 32, 33 in 3 months.\n\nI never cared of making a fortune. Just having nice job oportunities and of course, stability.\n\nAny advise, at all?"
