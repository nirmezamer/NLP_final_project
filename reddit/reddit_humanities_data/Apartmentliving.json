            "Yeah they can\u2019t do that lol\n\nIf they want you out make them prorate your rent and let them know they need to provide you an itemized list of repairs and deductions from the security deposit, otherwise just stay until your lease is up and still request that list",
            "Honestly OP, sounds like they\u2019re planning on keeping your security deposit on some trumped up bullshit if you don\u2019t move out early. \n\nThat\u2019s how I read it anyway.",
            "You've been handed a WONDERFUL gift.  You have, in writing, a statement from them that they plan to do extensive construction work inside your apartment.  So when they try to withhold your deposit for crap like replacing the carpet, painting the walls, etc. you can prove to the court that they had intended to do that anyway and thus their attempt to claim it was damaged by you to keep your deposit is bad faith.  Such obvious bad faith that you may well get 3x damages.\n\nBest response: \"Thank you for the notice that you intend to do renovations to my unit.  Unfortunately I will not be able to move out any earlier than the contractual lease agreement date of July 31.  May I be informed of any scheduled construction in nearby units, so that I may ensure it does not interfere with my quiet enjoyment?\"\n\nThis demonstrates that you understand tenant rights, you aren't going to bend over, and you want your full deposit back when you leave.  Throwing around the term \"quiet enjoyment\" sets the tone that you may well expect THEY pay YOU for unnecessarily loud and messy construction for the month of July if they're ripping up your neighboring units at all hours of the day.",

            "This is the same apartment with the MAGA graffiti in the hall btw",
            "Tell Joan her offer is goofy",
            "I love that they are on record that they plan to keep some of your security deposit if you don\u2019t agree to this.  Unless they already know the state of your apartment, this is great evidence of bad faith.",
            "Tell her either you get a discount on your last month's rent AND your full deposit back or you'll be out at the end of your lease, no other terms are acceptable and if they try to strongarm you you'll see them in court for the rest of your money.",
            "Definitely keep this in case they decide NOT to give you a full security deposit refund in retaliation. \n\nGo through now and also the very last day you are there and make a video of the entire place, including anything they put on your walk through list. I'm talking, from the outside of the unit into under sink areas, show faucets are working, light fixtures, fans, even wall outlets- had one landlord try to tell me the cracked wall outlets were why they kept $150 of my deposit. I got it back, but it was a pain in the ass and ONLY because I had the foresight to make a copy of maintenance repair report where I noted they had cracked the outlet cover. It was behind a sofa so I didn't care, but someone was more than ready to care to the tune of $150!  Make sure you get good up close shots of walls, baseboards, floors, swing doors to show they work properly, if the unit came with any blinds or the like note their condition. Better to have too much video you end up not needing than to be under prepared.\n\nAlso, the landlord/manager only have X amount of days after you vacate to return your security deposit and/or a detailed itemized report of what they kept and why. Look up the law in your state, they're all different, but it's usually just 30 days. After that time is up you can charge them daily. I'd wait until after that time was up to inform them that you know that  though. \n\nI would spend the next few days looking into speaking with a lawyer so if they do decide to keep your deposit you have a plan. I don't know what platform you're using to send and receive these messages, so keep getting screenshots of them in case they can be deleted on their end. Don't give them any information or indications you are collecting this as evidence. If you're able to be sneaky or they are just very ignorant you can even ask them if they won't be giving it back if you don't leave early. If they're dumb enough to admit that you'll have a golden ticket once the thirty days or however long it is is up.\n\nEdit: I looked it up for you. In CA, including LA where you are, it's only 21 days which is even better for you.\n\nhttps://selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/guide-security-deposits-california",

I kept them for awhile, ya\u2019 know, just in case - and later realized it\u2019s all old, won\u2019t be using, and tech will only evolve, not regress. \n\nSecond, for organization there are a ton of plastic container shelving you can get at ContainerStore or Amazon or Temu - the kind with bins that slide into stackable trays.   These can be put in a closet if you have, or can get nice ones you can stack on a table or even floor if you go with a high vertical one. \n\nThird, ya need a rug and some art!

If they did tell your upstairs neighbor they were complained about by you could be retaliation. Keep filing complaints.\n\n\nAll this, of course, is if before escalation you spoke to your neighbor about the smoking reiterating it's against the terms of the lease and also that you have lung issues. If it continues all bets are off. \n\n\nBe sure it's them though. My central unit is on the side of the building. If people are outside over there smoking it comes thru the intake.",

I lived beside a chain smoker and the smoke in my place was horrible. I would definitely tell them you have asthma. The only reason I can think why your complaint hasn\u2019t been responded to is that the smoker might have a health issue that the complex thinks means they have to allow the smoking. Pot, maybe (although vaping is an alternative to smoking) but cigarettes no. There should be no way your health is compromised in your own home. But you might need a lawyer.",

            "If you communicate with your complex manager verbally, from now on, as in the very next time, you outline what was discussed and put it in a text or email or both. You need to start a digital record trail. Even if you've already done so, complain again about the smoke you can smell, and which neighbor you think it is so you have a record you've done this. Make sure to mention something like as per the conversation we had last week or per my text yesterday, to establish this is basically retaliation by either the neighbor or the landlord.\n  \n\nI don't want to scare you, but since the management is the one bringing up eviction, take it *seriously*. Get a head of this, now.  Contact a lawyer tomorrow or Monday, and make sure they represent tenants not landlords. If they do both be *sure* they don't represent YOUR landlord before talking to them about your case. Lawyers aren't cheap but I promise, swear to you it'll be easier and cheaper in the long run than having an eviction on your record. Those stay for **seven years** and even Section 8 will not accept applications from people with evictions. Source: my dumb big hearted self. I let family stay with me in a rough patch and they repaid me by getting me evicted. Plus, your first consult should be brief and fee free to ascertain whether or not you have a case (it sounds to me like you do but I am not a lawyer) \n\nYou could even do some base line research tonight in one of the legal subs on here, there's people with law degrees or in law school that can probably provide you some better answers more tailored to your specific situation than Googling will.\n\nSorry you're dealing with this crap, OP.\n\nEta: you could also install some extra sensitive smoke detectors and a camera inside whatever room you're smelling it in the strongest.
