        "content": "Long story short, I noticed a leak from my bathroom ceiling yesterday and submitted a maintenance request to have it looked at. I came home from work and found my bathroom in this state. Thinking that the ceiling had collapse, I found the maintenance guys and told them about it, but turns out they LEFT my apartment like this and basically told me \u201csorry we left it like that, but we\u2019re busy and we\u2019ll be back on Monday to patch it\u201d. I complained to management and they said they would have them clean it right away, but I waited for an hour and no one and had come to clean it so I was forced to do it myself. While I understand that maintenance is busy and that the hole won\u2019t be patched until Monday, I find it unacceptable for it to be left in this condition and then expect me to clean it. Is this worth further complaining about or would I be wasting my breath on it? I emailed management photos of the bathroom just as documentation ",

            "That's ridiculous! Any time someone comes in here to do any work they clean up after themselves. If I have to do anything, it's just some small wiping down to grab some residue left over from those industrial wipe cloths.",

There are pros and cons to living on the bottom and top, but I think I felt more insane when I lived on the bottom floor. \n\nI am so thankful we found an apartment in a single row of single story apartments. We live on the end and only have one neighbor beside us, and she is so quiet! I NEVER hear her at all!! She takes meds that make her sleep, and she goes to bed around 7 pm. My husband and I like to play 80s music/concerts on the weekends and have some cocktails, and she NEVER even hears us!!",

Good luck this summer especially cus these parents never want to take them outside",
            "this is why ill never raise kids in an apartment. i know an apartment may be the only choice some people have when buying or renting, but i rather have a house first, get settled then have kids so i know they have the space to grow and be a kid. i feel bad that they dont have a yard to play in. their coped up in a small space.",

Selfish and self-centered thinking is essential to a child's survival if you think about it. That's just fucking horrific parenting. I'm pretty sure I would be catching a charge if I found out the father was encouraging this kind of behavior. I don't believe in harming children but I sure shit would want to Deck the father",
            "We were raised in apartments/rentals, but we were always on the bottom floor. Maybe we didnt have a lot of space inside, but we spent a lot of time outside to make up for it."
