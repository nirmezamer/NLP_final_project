        "content": "Hello everyone, \n\nWe mods are here because we love Star Wars, with a few that are here to mainly help with bigger events.  We are passionate about the sub, the discussions, the universe, and enjoy most of the people here.  We want to be welcoming to *almost* everyone and hope you will be too.  However, if you want to be disrespectful towards others here, this may not be the community for you.  \n\nWe wanted to post a reminder on how we expect members to treat each other.  It is listed on the sidebar rules as well, the general \"respect fellow redditors\" rule.  We want to clarify things because it seems sometimes people are shocked/angry when we remove and or ban people who don't follow it.\n\nFirst off, you and the mods may have different opinions on what respect is.  So here is a general guideline.  If you wouldn't say it to your mother, your grandma, your boss, etc; don't say it here.  And yes, I get there are one-offs in those scenarios, but to further hammer this home, here are some recent examples right from the ban log:\n\n* Why, does it hurt your feelings? Well too bad, snowflake.\n* You, sir, are what we call a god damn moron.\n* How's that small pee pee working out?\n* Jfc you lack some serious reading comprehension skills...Click and scroll to see his producer credits: Idiot...Pick up a book some time, you\u2019ll learn a thing or two.\n* Stop being a d|#k\n* Dude get a life, nobody f*%*ing cares\n\nOur general guideline is, **30 day bans for any of this**.  Sometimes if its borderline, and if the poster doesn't have a history of disrespect in their profile, we may ban for less.\n\n- If someone is uncivil towards you and you react the same way towards them you are likely both going to get banned.  (use the report function instead)\n\n- If we have to ban you twice for being uncivil, the 2nd one is likely going to be permanent.\n\n- If you get banned, and then message the mods with the same kind of disrespect, the ban will be changed to permanent as well.  \n\nWe get a lot of flack for enforcing the rules, I get it, we are never going to make everyone happy.  We also encourage you all to help out when you see this kind of content and report it, because no, we don't see everything. At the same time, don't abuse reports. Just because you don't like someone's comments doesn't mean it breaks the rules. Offenders may not get banned the same day they break the rules, and we may not reply to modmail complaints right away either.  If we feel we have made our point and don't want to continue to argue, there is a good chance we will mute the discussion in modmail. We may take a further review sometimes on request, and we do overturn things once in a while as well; some scenarios may warrant that.  We aren't reviewing things 24/7 real time, so please be patient. \n\n**As Star Wars fans, and just as people in general, we will have disagreements, different opinions, arguments; not everyone will like what you like.  And that's fine, it can even be healthy.  But showing a lack of respect towards your fellow redditors here is not.  Keep that in mind going forward before you hit that submit button.**",

            "I like the way Vader has flashbacks after this scene in the comic that shows how he was betrayed by the emperor. The comic does a great job of adding depth to Anakin's character arc. It makes you watch the original trilogy in a whole new light. \n\nWe've all seen it but watch again as Vader tells Luke he's his father. I always took it as a shock from Luke's point of view but now that I watch it from Vader's point of view you can hear it in his voice that he's reclaiming something that was stolen from him. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLheiLGZ1k8\n\nIn an often overlooked scene we see Luke turn himself over to Vader. (For some reason when I was a kid I didn't realize that Luke was on an AT-AT and it was dropping him off at an AT-AT platform.) Take note of how Vader looks at his son when the security detail hands him over. At the end of the scene watch how we see Vader walk over to the side of the hallway. We don't see his face but we can feel the anguish from his body language.   \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-HFv6Ms1lw\n\nYou could almost give a name to the scene where Boba Fett tells Vader about Luke; *A New Hope*",
