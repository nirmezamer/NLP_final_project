            "Today I am having a hard time reminding myself that just because my situation was not as extreme as others, no contact is still necessary. Sometimes I am reminded that all of the sudden I don't have a father. I quietly exited his life and he has not done anything to get me back into it. It is also out of safety. I worry as he ages he will become more and more aggressive and violent towards myself and my sister. Its so complicated. I don't want a relationship (we have not spoken for around 4 years now) but it still sometimes hits me how sad all of this is. Until a month ago I wouldn't have even said we're estranged from one another as that feels like you have to have a relationship first to have it end. He has never been a father figure and rarely ever took care of us despite living in the same home. Man. Today just feels very emotionally heavy. I hope everyone else has a successful and happy Friday.",

Cue him threatening suicide if it will help \u201cmake amends\u201d. This feels like a new low of emotional manipulation and makes me feel so much more confident in my original choice to go NC.",

He told me that mum had given him instructions to \"not pass a widower\" when my sister was wedded in 2016. So, every time I go out to a pub, nDad either wants to follow me - and whinge about how much I drink or he stays home and, on my return, he whinges about how I don't bring anyone home for him. \n\nI'm married to a wonderful oncologist and have a daughter with her. How does he think it will look if I tell a random lady -- around my age (because which woman is 80 and drinks in the football pubs in Brussels -- that, \"My father has given me explicit instructions to bring a girl home for him tonight, so, come with me right now\". \n\nEspecially given that I'm happily married and a father? *sigh*",

I told her that we\u2019d be gone so that\u2019s why we couldn\u2019t drop her at work and she couldn\u2019t come with us. Simple right?\n\nMy dad and I decide to skip the 12-1pm showings so we can come back and take my bitch mother to work & they weren\u2019t really of interest. So I sent her a text at 11 saying we will come back & take you.\u00a0\n\nWe get home to my nmom being in her bathroom getting ready. A whole 20 minutes later she comes out and is mute. She wasn\u2019t speaking to my dad over a separate issue so I thought that\u2019s what is was. She finally\u00a0\n\u00a0asked me how it went I said good there were 3 that I liked.\u00a0\nShe then got in this huge aggressive mode and said how why we didn\u2019t invite her to come and I obviously didn\u2019t want her to join. I explained that was why we came back otherwise I\u2019d still be looking and then she says well you never told me and was SOOOOO aggressive yelling about the same issue of not being invited & so I retaliated back for one of the first times in my life by saying that\u2019s why I texted you.\u00a0\n\nThen she came out like storming at me & continued to try rage in the car by saying you never told me ra ra ra and I was like well yeah obviously because we changed the plans to come pick you up and that\u2019s why I sent you THE FUCKING TEXT \ud83e\udd23.\u00a0\nNow I\u2019m sitting in the back of the car while my stupid submissive dad drives her in silence.\u00a0",
