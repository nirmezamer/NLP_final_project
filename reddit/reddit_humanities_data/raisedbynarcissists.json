            "My mother died last year. My only sibling lives in another country and the whole family is coming to visit soon. They want to go to the cemetery. I don't want to go. I've been to her grave once, that's enough. My mother did her best to disinherit me and I'm still hurt and angry. I was the scapegoat and the one who wasn't allowed any needs or wants, my only purpose was to serve, and making sure I got as little as possible is on par with how she treated me my whole life. I really don't have any interest in \"paying my respects\". I'm going to say that I don't want to go but I'm not sure how. I don't want to make up excuses. It's time for me to stand up for myself and not hide my feelings to spare other people's. But this is not going to go over well. My sibling doesn't want to know that our mother was a narcissistic bitch.",
            "My sibling called me yesterday to rage about our mom\u2019s latest issues with managing money. They\u2019re clearly still struggling with emotionally detaching themselves from her. Meanwhile, I felt absolutely nothing as they told be about how our mom had sold this or that thing so she could buy more junk. I\u2019m feeling good about my own apathy about the situation, though wishing my sibling could move on from it.",

            "Is there anyone else who get absolutely furious when their nMom pitch up their voice when talking to someone on the phone or anyone in customer service to pretend she\u2019s nice? Then right after the interaction they go back to the soulless harsh voice at me for no reason at fucking all",
            "My parents showed up on my birthday after I told them not to come. I didn't see them but they left presents for me. The presents are sitting in a corner of the basement. On one hand I know that there are things in there that I need. But on the other hand, I can't bring myself to open them.",
            "I want my mom. No, I want someone else's mom. I want the mom who can have a 2-way conversation without guilt-trips. The one that wants to know how her grandkids are doing. The one who cares when her daughter aches inside. I'm hurting so bad, and all I want to do is call her and tell her to come over. But if I call her, she's going to yell at me. Why would you yell at someone who's already crying?",
            "It's funny how they can recognize abuse and people being affected by bad parents in movies but then as soon as you say it about them no that kind of stuff never happens.\n\nWas watching forrest gump with my nbrother, and I said I forget whats happening at this part, and its the part where Jenny is breaking down and he goes \"well shes crying because shes realizing her dad is a bad person and is responsible for everything that is wrong with her which is understandable\" and im just sitting there like.....but every time I say its YOUR fault that I am the way I am (seeking approval from people, always feel like I do everything wrong, yelling at me for accidents) because you grew up treating me that way suddenly it doesnt exist or I just \"need to get over it youre not a fucking kid anymore\". like...........oooooooooooookay!",
            "First post here but this subreddit has been eye opening. Decided to go no contact with my father due to some heavy and traumatic behaviour from him. My mother told him. Cue him threatening suicide if it will help \u201cmake amends\u201d. This feels like a new low of emotional manipulation and makes me feel so much more confident in my original choice to go NC.",
            "I'll delete this later but rn I have to vent. As an adult I met an uncle and was sure I've never seen him before but his voice (it's deep) sounded familiar and I didn't know why. It took some more years to kinda remember some stuff, it was so sudden so I wasn't sure it happened. I'm not too close to my brother but I told him and he believes me and I'm thankful for that.",

My dad turns 60 at the start of December, but my parents have decided that they want to have his party when the weather is nicer (like he's the fucking King or something), and out of literally every date they could possibly pick before or after they landed on my 30th birthday, 2 months after. Not the same week, not the same weekend, the day of.\n\nSome important points to note: they specified this will NOT be a shared party, it is my fathers party only. We live a 4.5 hour flight + 1.5 from the airport drive away, and I would be expected to travel down with my the 3.5yo and 10mo + pay for our flights - most likely solo as my husband travels for work. This was pitched to me as \"around my birthday weekend\" even though they OBVIOUSLY would've looked at the dates and seen the party fell exactly on my birthday. \n\nWhat the fuck kind of position does this put me in? Swallow my own feelings and show up, be the family pariah and not show up, make a fuss and make them change the date (which you all know would make them go nuclear).\n\nI don't know what's more hurtful:\n\n1. They didn't even realise\n2. They realised and they don't care\n3. They've done it on purpose\n\nJust a little extra icing on the cake is I've recently found out my cancer has recurred, and we're waiting on treatment decisions before sharing. They were INSUFFERABLE last time, making it all about how hard it was for them so can't wait to go through cancer and that again.\n\nRant over \ud83d\ude14 why can't we just have normal, supportive families who don't do this to us?!",

            "One of my inlaws, who had never visited before, decided to visit us on my milestone birthday.  At the time I was a doormat and thought it would be nice for dh, the ignored and forgotten one, to be visited and get some attention.  So I agreed and was 'fine'. Said relative didn't like me and ignored my existence most of the time. Relative and their partner arrived and we took them out for the day and it was pleasant. Their partner asked me what my plans for my birthday were and I said 'this', they looked horrified that it was the actual day of my birthday (inlaw hadn't wished me a happy birthday nor brought a card or gift) and fell over themselves to apologize stating they hadn't realised. Inlaw shrugged and said, 'oh I knew'. Having my own family also pretty awful, when I mentioned things like this to them and getting shrugs,  and my parents being the reason I was such a doormat to begin with, was crazy making. Thankfully, once we had kids, I developed a great spine and painfully grew out of being a doormat.\n\nOp it is absolutely deliberate. When they realised it was something they could do, they felt a thrill. They believe they've forced you into a corner. Don't go.",

Tell him happy birthday for his 60th on the actual day of his birthday, send a gift on the actual day and ignore the rest.  \n\nTake care of your health now.  If they were insufferable last time they don't need to know about it this time.  Take the time you need to heal.  Celebrate your milestone 30th with your family and friends.  You may even find this is nicer without your parents and their drama.",

I'm so sorry about your diagnosis! this reminds of that \"they have to be the corpse and every wedding and the bride at every funeral\" and then there was some poor soul who's father threatened suicide on Christmas Eve when she was 9 months pregnant....  My go-to is \"I'm not feeling well\" {from their constant shrieking} + \"I don't want to get anyone sick\"  two true statements!",
            "If they specified it wouldn't be a shared party we can rule out possibilities 1 and 2. Looks like a move for power. Don't go there. Send a gift or not, explain things beforehand or not, but Do.Not.Go.There",

Then when she tries to force her way in you have perfect justification for the lock. Change your mind set to doing all you can to move out.",

As a parent now, looking at it it\u2019s so gross and weird. My kid is NEVER pushed about that stuff. We can talk about it if they want, of course, but it isn\u2019t an expectation or goal. I wasted so much energy trying to date (unsuccessfully) and in hindsight wish my focus had been elsewhere.",

Kids need healthy boundaries and our job as parents is to keep them safe and healthy.   I also have to be able to loosen the reigns and let them take some calculated risks as they get older.",

Even my 5 year old can identify and communicate her emotions like a boss.   \u201cI felt x when y happened\u2026 \u201c And she is not afraid to express her feelings and expects to have them validated.  Emotional literacy for the win!  [my parents never validated or listened to my feelings growing up, and it was often unsafe to express feelings]\n\nI don\u2019t hit my kids either.
