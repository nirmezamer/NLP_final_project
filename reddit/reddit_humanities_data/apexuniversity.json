        "content": "[Apex University Discord](https://discord.gg/DZU25Za6qx)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWelcome everyone,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst the mod team would like to thank everyone for being part of this community and providing content and tips to other players, we know that there is a lot more that could be wished from the staffs side and we are currently trying to improve things day by day. Now here we are at 160k members which is amazing, we never expected the sub to grow that big when we started it, so once again thank you all for that!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince the beginning of this community the subreddit has naturally been and will continue to be the focal point of our efforts while our discord server started out as a way for the mod team to efficiently communicate about the subreddit, however over time as it became more active and we started putting more attention into making it a stronger extension of the sub and would therefor like to once again invite everyone to partake and explain a bit about what you can expect of the space both now and going forward:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- 1on1 coaching\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Group finding channel\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Subreddit & Discord suggestions (easier for the mod team to have a discussion about the direction of the sub compared to over at Reddit)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Self-promotion channel & stream your games\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Meta & strat chats\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Off-topic and space to flex your gains\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are furthermore in the process of preparing some challenges in the discord, possibly with some smaller prizes. More to come on that in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you are looking for any of that we ask you all to join our discord xbox/ps4/computer, we welcome everyone! We hope to see you in our ever-growing community on discord.",

Made a harmless comment in the #venting channel about being frustrated that I threw a potential 4k damage game and had some people start making fun of my name for no reason. Not a big deal but just unnecessary and rude. Could've been a fluke but if that's how people act on that discord then I'd stay away",

            "learning wattson well is not easy",
            "Is there any legend that's actually hard to learn? Most of the skills are pretty straightforward.\n\nHardest to master has got to be pathfinder. There's so many things to know about how grapple works, and you need to actually know movement techniques to play pathfinder to its full potential. Zipline jumping for example - idk if anyone can reliably pull it off if they're on roller, and even many on mnk can't do it every single time.",
            "Idk  if this goes for everyone but For me it was easy to learn alter but seems to be a lot of untapped potential with her ult \n\nstill trying figure out how to \"master \" her r",
            "Pathfinder, Pretty simple kit, Set up zipline and use your zip to take height. It gets a bit more complicated when you factor in precise swinging to get into buildings or small tricks like using the zip on the ground for momentum when you have nothing to swing off of and many many more moves that takes a ton of time to master. Not to mention he's built like a fridge so he loses fights up close so positioning is a skill in itself.\n\nId say the hardest to learn but easy to master would probably be Ballistic. It's not that he's a hard legend on paper its just on controller its very awkward to remember to not only swap over to your 3rd weapon during fights, It sometimes just doesn't work if you hold it too long because then it pulls up the emote wheel. Not to mention having to remember to actually equip weapons onto your sling. Even with over 5k+ hours of playtime i still sometimes struggle with him when i do get the itch to pick him up. \n\nBut kit wise, Hes pretty easy to master since all he got is extra gun and overheat nothing too fancy outside of that. He doesn't have any technical moves outside of looking up before shooting your whistler so it can go over cover.",
            "I feel like Lifeline has to be up there for easy to use hard to master. Playing with a top tier Lifeline is the best. Her kit is straight forward and she\u2019s used by a lot of new players, but man oh man there\u2019s so many little nuances to doing it right. If you have a rock star Lifeline on your team you\u2019re almost impossible to kill, and same goes for playing against one. She can single handedly ruin a whole lobby just by knowing exactly how to keep her gunners alive and healthy. Shout out to all the great combat medics out there.",
