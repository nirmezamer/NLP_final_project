Now here we are at 160k members which is amazing, we never expected the sub to grow that big when we started it, so once again thank you all for that!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince the beginning of this community the subreddit has naturally been and will continue to be the focal point of our efforts while our discord server started out as a way for the mod team to efficiently communicate about the subreddit, however over time as it became more active and we started putting more attention into making it a stronger extension of the sub and would therefor like to once again invite everyone to partake and explain a bit about what you can expect of the space both now and going forward:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- 1on1 coaching\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Group finding channel\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Subreddit & Discord suggestions (easier for the mod team to have a discussion about the direction of the sub compared to over at Reddit)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Self-promotion channel & stream your games\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Meta & strat chats\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Off-topic and space to flex your gains\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are furthermore in the process of preparing some challenges in the discord, possibly with some smaller prizes. More to come on that in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you are looking for any of that we ask you all to join our discord xbox/ps4/computer, we welcome everyone! We hope to see you in our ever-growing community on discord.",

Her kit is straight forward and she\u2019s used by a lot of new players, but man oh man there\u2019s so many little nuances to doing it right. If you have a rock star Lifeline on your team you\u2019re almost impossible to kill, and same goes for playing against one. She can single handedly ruin a whole lobby just by knowing exactly how to keep her gunners alive and healthy. Shout out to all the great combat medics out there.",

            "Pathfinder is hard to learn but easy to master. If you learn how to use his grapple properly, you can use it to get good angles on teams you wouldn't get on most other legends. He is also good for engagement and disengagement and map rotation for the whole team via his ult. A good solo legend all around.",
            "Is there any legend that's actually hard to learn? Most of the skills are pretty straightforward.\n\nHardest to master has got to be pathfinder. There's so many things to know about how grapple works, and you need to actually know movement techniques to play pathfinder to its full potential. Zipline jumping for example - idk if anyone can reliably pull it off if they're on roller, and even many on mnk can't do it every single time.",

            "Aim assist is technically a little stronger on lower sensitivities, but it's not a huge difference. As others have said, it's most likely just that you're not yanking away from aim assist with the lower sense.",

            "It's actually stronger( by a little bit). Some Japanese players have been using 4-1 linear and then adjusting the sense up in the alcs to take advantage of it(there's a glitch where you can adjust the sense using alcs but still keep the numerical sensitivity). In addition numerical sense also has slightly better aim assist than alcs. \n\nThough these are very slight differences and probably not applicable to OP.\n\nHere's a link to a video that explains it [link](https://youtu.be/nANFfCC5cI0?si=nhwqChJO7YpAEzUy)",
