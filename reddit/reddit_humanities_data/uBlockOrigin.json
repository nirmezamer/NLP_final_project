There's no way around this if you want to remain logged in. It should only happen in brief periods of time between them updating their script and and our volunteers finding a new solution.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile this post talks mainly about YouTube **detecting the use of \"ad blockers\"** and interrupting or blocking playback, the same instructions apply if you're **seeing ads** or encounter any **unexpected issues** (videos not loading, taking a long time to load, and so on).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis post is on a **support forum** for **uBlock Origin** (**uBO** in short). We'll only be discussing/allowing discussions of **uBO solutions** here.  \n**Comments suggesting other solutions** (extensions, userscripts, frontends, apps, etc.) **will be removed**. We don't want the ensuing spam - find another subreddit for these. Similarly with random filters - **all custom filters** need to be **vetted** in a discussion with **uBO Team**. More info in the FAQ below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Do NOT comment if you haven't read and followed the entire post.** There are **specific instructions regarding reporting issues**. Comments ignoring these will be removed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**There is a TL;DR below.** Scroll to it or use Ctrl+F to locate it if you find all of this too overwhelming to read.\n\nJust be aware that following the post in its entirety (from top to bottom) will likely answer all your questions. Comments asking about things covered in this guide already or reporting issues without including info required in this guide might be met with removal.\n\n# \u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\n\n&#x200B;\n\n#### \ud83d\udfe7 FOR ANSWERS: START FROM THE TOP \ud83d\udfe7\n\n#### \ud83d\udfe7 FOR INSTRUCTIONS: SCROLL DOWN \ud83d\udfe7\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [**Image: How the 4 stages of YouTube Detection look like**](https://preview.redd.it/8bsp6n4k11xb1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f0ad8c5764f07e5c042ff9970825d04cd9fdb7d)\n\n# \n\n## \ud83d\udfe6 **FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS** \ud83d\udfe6\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **What do these 4 stages of detection warning actually do?**\n   * Stage 1 is just a simple popup interruption, you can dismiss it and continue on.\n   * Stage 2 is the same, but the close button is only available after a time delay.\n   * Stage 3 is a type of \"last chance warning\" - it gives you 3 videos to open (not necessarily watch) before it moves you to the next stage.\n   * Stage 4 is the final stage. It's no longer a popup. It replaces your video, making it \"impossible\" to watch.\n* **I don't want my playback blocked! What can I do?**\n   * Simply follow this guide below. It will help you hide from detection and resume your playback.\n* **I heard YouTube is banning accounts if I don't stop - can I prevent that?**\n   * People just misinterpret the \"playback is blocked\" message into thinking they're banned.\n   * There's no reason to think YouTube is going to ban your entire account. This would accomplish nothing - banned users can't buy premium. And would likely just make a new account to continue on.\n* **I've never seen this message. Is this because of my browser being X or Y?**\n   * No, YouTube didn't roll this out to everybody yet. They are still expanding their reach with this impediment to other regions.\n   * The detection is account and cookie based, which means you're less likely to encounter consistent warnings in a private window or just not logged in. Some users report detection occurring without logging in though.\n   * We've had reports of this happening on all browsers. The reason people think a new browser resolved this for them is likely due to it not having old YouTube/Google cache and cookies. The same can be accomplished by creating a new browser profile or by:\n      * Logging out of all Google services,\n      * Closing all YouTube/Google tabs,\n      * Clearing cache and cookies (all or just Google/YouTube),\n      * Restarting the browser,\n      * Logging back in.\n* **Is installing/using uBlock Origin enough to never see this message again?**\n   * Never? Unfortunately, no. As explained the very top of this thread, YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly. This means there can be some windows of time between their new script going live and our filters bypassing it.\n   * uBO can't fix issues caused by:\n      * Other extensions - they don't even need to be YouTube related. Totally random extensions might cause the message. Most common are other content blockers or privacy extensions.\n      * Your browser's own adblocking mechanisms.\n      * DNS blocking, which is often included in a VPN.\n      * Other outside the browser protections such as: HOSTS file blocking, Antivirus/Internet Security programs and other privacy tools.\n   * which is why the instructions below will ask you **to test** without using your personal config. This is to eliminate conflicts. You can try restoring your config later. If you do it gradually, you'll find out what was causing the issue in the first place.\n* **Can I somehow check if uBO's filters are up to date?**\n   * NOT CURRENTLY. YT has changed their approach so the status page no longer works.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **I've seen people suggesting I add specific filters, use a userscript or another extension. Is that safe?**\n   * **No, it's not.** Most of the suggested filters going around are very outdated, some were taken from our first threads.\n   * Even fresh filters go outdated very quickly. If they work today, they might be the exact cause of the problem tomorrow.\n   * Userscripts have a lot of power, they can be abused to cause damage. Even \"safe\" ones may cause conflicts.\n   * Same thing for extensions - better not install random ones. And, again, they may easily cause conflicts.\n   * Even if a niche solution works for you and lasts a little longer, it's only because it's too small for YT to care. Once you popularize it, they'll take it down too.\n* **I was able to hide the popup simply by blocking it with uBO's Picker. Why aren't you doing that?**\n   * This only works temporarily. For stages 1-3. You'll still reach stage 4 by doing this. And this might cause scrolling issues, not let videos autoplay, prevent you from adding videos to playlists, and so on.\n* **I'm a technical user, I've read the latest detection script and I believe I found a way of defeating it. Can I help?**\n   * Absolutely! Please contact us via [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/uBlockOrigin). Or head over to [github](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+YouTube.com%3A+ALL+issues+label%3Aongoing) to contact us there.\n   * Please don't share filters in the comments - even if they were to work now, they'll likely cause issues later. If you contact us, we'll evaluate and perhaps improve them with your help. In which case, they'll be added to our lists for the benefit of everyone. And this will also allow us to update them later when necessary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **How often should I manually update filter lists? Can I somehow automate this?**\n   * Starting **uBO 1.54** default lists get automatic updates **every 5 hours.** There should be no need for manual updates now.\n      * Triggering a manual update will knock you back into a (several days) long cycle (depending on the list).\n      * **Don't do it unless absolutely necessary.**\n      * Before forcing a manual update, make sure **you've excluded config issues + cleared YT/Google cache/cookies + closed old YT tabs and restarted the browser**. If you've done so, but you still get detected - you can try updating the list named `uBlock filters - Quick fixes`.\n      * It's the list containing YouTube solutions. And the only list you might ever need to update.\n      * The above mini-steps might need to be repeated after updating.\n   * ***If you're NOT getting detected. DON'T UPDATE!***\n      * Updating for no reason places burden on the servers hosting uBO's filter lists.\n      * uBO's not a company, it's a volunteer project using free services, which have limits that we cannot cross.\n      * Here's the [estimated bandwidth cost](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBlock-issues/discussions/2958) for just ONE of uBO's CDNs. And that's with lists updating every few days.\n      * uBO 1.54's differential updates get only changes to the files instead of whole lists when updating. This should help lessen the bandwidth usage while making updates much more frequent than before.\n      * **Do NOT undermine this effort by forcing manual updates for no reason.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **The** ***uBlock Origin*** **name is too long - can I shorten it somehow when referring to it?**\n   * Of course! *The correct short name is* **uBO**. Please use this abbreviation freely.\n   * I thought I can just use the first word - is that wrong?\n      * It is. You can read about the extension history including the name change on our github wiki and on Wikipedia.

Until you close that tab (or at least do a manual refresh).**\n* **Chromium-based browsers don't wait for extensions to be ready before loading websites.** This happens at browser launch e.g.:\n  * When starting the browser by clicking an outside link.\n  * When `Settings` > `On startup` > `Continue where you left off` is enabled / when restoring a session.\n  * When opening a link in an incognito window.\n  * When opening a link as a Person/User X (in another profile).\n  * **All such instances will likely encounter ads.

Please **make sure you've really followed EVERYTHING** that's written from the very start of the post.\n   1. **Please repeat the whole process.**\n   2. **Do NOT assume** that an extension which was previously fine **doesn't need to be checked** anymore.\n      1. This logic applies to other things as well.\n2. **If all else fails, try making a new browser profile with only uBO installed and on default settings.**\n3. Fixing anti-adblock *may* cause ads or breakages.\n   1. On Chromium-engine browsers, uBO might not reliably block ads after you just launched the browser or switched profiles, including \"Open link in incognito\" and \"Open link as User X\". This state of unable-to-block will be kept until you do a manual refresh of the page.\n   2.

Clear Google Cookies.\n  6. Close all Google tabs.\n  7. Restart your browser.\n  8. Open YouTube and test.\n  9. Not working? Look for other causes.\n      1. Open your browser's Addons/Extensions page.\n      2. Disable all extensions except uBlock Origin.\n      3. Check if your browser has a built-in adblocker. Disable it.\n      4. Open uBO's Dashboard. In the Settings tab click \"backup\", then \"reset to defaults\".\n      5. In the \"Filters list\" tab. Click \"Update now\" or wait for it to update on its own. (Green clock icons mean lists just updated.)\n      6. Disable ad-blocking/filtering DNS. It might be in your VPN.\n      7. Remove any HOSTS file modifications on your system.\n      8. Disable any ad/tracking protections in your Anti-Virus or Internet/Total Security Suite.\n      9. And any other ad/privacy protections you might have on your device/network.\n      10. Still no luck? Make a new browser profile, install only uBO and don't change any settings (other than disabling built-in adblocker). Test there.\n2. Above not working?

            "Update (12, Jun): See sticky comment.\n\nUpdate (10, Jun): Disabled the previous fixes as some user reported black screen. We might need account or cookie sharing for further investigation. If you are willing to do, contact /u/paintboth1234 as I won't be active today. BTW I might ignore any reports without Troubleshooting information.\n\nUpdate (09, Jun): We have fixed the new SSAP ads both for Chromium and Firefox. Wait a second for CDNs to update and then update Quick fixes. If you added the previous rule I asked testing, remove it as making high-quality unselectable.\n\nUpdate (08, Jun): Maybe account sharing is not needed. If you see SSAP ads on Firefox, check \"Allow custom filters requiring trust\" in My filters, add\n\n    /base.js$replace=/(enabled_engage_types\\}.+?;if\\().+?&&(.+?\\.isLivePlayback&&)/\\$1true)\\$2/,domain=m.youtube.com|music.youtube.com|www.youtube.com\n\n, refresh the page, and report back. \n\nUpdate (06, Jun): Due to a new experiment by YT, we disabled rules for SSAP ads to fix \"An error occured. Please try again later.\" If you see SSAP ads, please report with all the required steps, but probably we need account sharing to investigate deeply. An easy way to check whether ads are SSAP is typing `yt.config_.EXPERIMENT_FLAGS.html5_enable_ssap_entity_id` in Console of developer tools and press return. If you're target of SSAP ads, this should return `true`.\n\nUpdate (30, Apr): YT countered the previous fix and we added the rule in 26, Apr update, so no need to add manually any more - just update Quick fixes. Thank you for all the report about the rule!\n\nUpdate (26, Apr): We now understood the cause of the `282054944` error and this should have been fixed. However, the current fix can trivially be bypassed - I won't be surprised if yt does tomorrow. We need feedback for fundamental fix. If you recently got the error, add `www.youtube.com#@#+js(set, yt.config_.EXPERIMENT_FLAGS.ab_sig_bit_dea, undefined)` to My filters to disable the current fix and see if you get the error. If you do, add the two filters below too after checking `Allow custom filters requiring trust` in My filters, see if they fix the error, and report back:\n\n    www.youtube.com#@#+js(trusted-rpnt, script, /^(\\(function serverContract\\(\\))/s, '/*start*/(function(){const wrapper=(target,thisArg,args)=>{let content=Reflect.apply(target,thisArg,args);if(content.includes(\"ssapPrerollEnabled\")){const modifiedContent=content.replace(/\\n.\\n.playerConfig\\.ssapConfig\\.ssapPrerollEnabled.{2}(?:tru|fals)e/,\"\");return modifiedContent;}return content;};const handler={apply:wrapper};window.atob=new Proxy(window.atob,handler);document.currentScript.textContent=document.currentScript.textContent.replace(/\\/\\*start\\*\\/(.*)\\/\\*end\\*\\//g,\"\");}());/*end*/$1')\n    www.youtube.com##+js(trusted-rpnt, script, /^(\\(function serverContract\\(\\))/s, '/*start*/(function(){const wrapper=(target,argumentsList,newTarget)=>{const result=Reflect.construct(target,argumentsList,newTarget);try{const decoded=(new TextDecoder).decode(result);if(decoded.includes(\"ssapPrerollEnabled\")){const modifiedContent=decoded.replace(/\\n.\\n.playerConfig\\.ssapConfig\\.ssapPrerollEnabled.{2}(?:tru|fals)e/,\"\");const modifiedUint8Array=(new TextEncoder).encode(modifiedContent);return modifiedUint8Array}}catch(e){}return result};const handler={construct:wrapper};window.Uint8Array=new Proxy(Uint8Array,handler);document.currentScript.textContent=document.currentScript.textContent.replace(/\\/\\*start\\*\\/(.*)\\/\\*end\\*\\//g,\"\")})();/*end*/$1')\n\nUpdate (23, Apr): It looks YT again countered with `282054944` error. If you've got the error, please grab a `player?` request by following process: press F12 to open devtools, move to Network tab, filter by `player?` (don't mind if no match), and click on videos. If the error happens, choose the bottom row. This will open a subwindow, navigate to Response tab in the opened subwindow (if Firefox, check Raw). Copy the content of it and share this with something like [pastefy.app](http://pastefy.app) As in the previous cases, it may eventually require account sharing by you guys to solve, but we first need to gather information.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dknni6kp09wc1.png?width=1384&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae3ede99e26ab7c81c3e9e75ce125193e22732bb\n\nUpdate (4, Apr): YT again countered with `282054944` error (what an unfrinedly way for user) so we temp disabled rules causing the error. If you got the error, update filters and relaunch browser.\n\nUpdate (1, Apr): We have fixed SSAP ads and `282054944` error again thanks to your cooperation of account sharing. Update will be available in a few hours. Thank you very much!\n\n(original post) Thanks to your help, we could solve their new server-side ad injection.
