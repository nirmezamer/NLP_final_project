            "Note: I was playing normally, we were doing well, until two players (mid, adc) disconnected, and continued connecting and disconnecting for the rest of the game, until in the last 5 minutes of the game I was disconnected and received this message as if Vanguard had stopped to work, since this shit was on. Now my client decided to randomly close by itself, flagging an error in Vanguard that I have no idea what it is, I really don't know what to do, now I'm afraid of it randomly closing during the game and I'll be punished like the players in my game departure, maybe it's time to abandon this once and for all",
            "I was just playing an Aram with friends and 2 people from the enemy team disconnected not 3 minutes later my friends are gone aswell.\n\nLet say I played the \u201ewe have 3v3 at home\u201c.",
            "Had that also yesterday. I was flamed because they thought i was afking. And was punished with low prio queue. Sorry i was trying my best.",
            "Same happens to me since yesterday. 2 games got disconnected. Today another 2 all in ranked. Fun thing is last game literally everyone got disconnected :D one by one from both teams untill only 2 of us were still hanging then vanguard disconnected me as well... It seems in arena theres no problem at least from my experience.",

            "Happened to me this morning all 10 of us in the match got that",
            "Though I still follow different subs, I stopped playing league. Too much bs for too long now. I'm sure there are still people who care about the game at the company but it honestly feels like things aren't gonna get better."

Not every death is worth it, but sometimes it's fine to die for your carries.\n\nAlso, you have way too many champions played, stick to 1-2 champs and improve on them. Your winrates are generally really good tho, so you shouldn't worry.",

            "better to play with pocket picks, trust me if ever you're tilted to your gameplay just play the champion who you're most comfortable with and who doesn't tilt you because you find their kit very enjoyable\n\nit's important to at least have three pocket picks, better make sure you have for engage as well enchanters. try to watch proplays as well if ever you dont know what to do throught early game laning phase and late game teamfights, lol is all about objs\n\nif ever you're tired to your main role you can swap to any roles you want to practice with and it's a blank canvas. it's all about exploration"

If one guy gets 1000 gold they can buy a much more useful epic Item.\n\nThe idea is that the adc (who scales hard with items) will take as much gold as possible, to reach their items as soon as possible, so they can end the game as soon as possible. Taking their CS slows them down, thus putting your team behind.",
            "No, not unless your adc trolls and goes 0/10\n\nYour champions work on support budget, while adc needs a lot of money to come unline. So, by stealing, you actively try to lose",
            "It\u2019s terrible.\n\nChamps played as support are designed to be impactful with lower gold income. ADCs are the opposite; they are designed to scale directly with their income, peaking at different points in the game depending on the champ, but all wanting to get to whatever that peak is as quickly as possible.\n\nYou obviously don\u2019t let minions die for free if your ADC is walking back to lane and they are under tower, but you should always prefer your lane partner to receive gold over you whenever it\u2019s possible."
