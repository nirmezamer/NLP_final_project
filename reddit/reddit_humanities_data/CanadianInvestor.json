            "You show up to brag about your gains in what\u2019s probably a penny stock or junior miner that you\u2019re not willing to name. What exactly are you expecting?  People to come and congratulate you on your investing prowess?  Ask you where you get your mad skillz from? Of course you\u2019re getting downvoted",
            "Congratulations on your investing prowess. We\u2019re all really really proud of you",
            "Posted this in last weekend's thread, and got downvoted into oblivion. Probably more of the same this week.\n\n*Pretty pumped for the coming months. My portfolio consists of two stocks ,99% in one name which is up 280.59% YTD (6 figure gains) and 1% in another name which is flat since I started to build a position. The Canadian Exchange selloffs (due to the new capital gains inclusion rates) should be coming to an end. Very exciting to see where all that money that is sitting on the sidelines gets redeployed by institutional investors*.\n\nBeauty week overall as I felt it would be. My biggest position is now up 319.05% YTD. My small position agreed just this week to a definitive deal to sell the majority of the business, and payout a special dividend (approximate 100% gain since I started accumulating in March). My only disappointment is not having more time to continue to DCA into the small position.",
            "Not sure how a factual post regarding my investment style (without shilling names) can be seen as a brag. In fact, I posted my disappointment in a deal having happened sooner than I would have liked. If I had \"mad skillz\" I would have seen the deal coming, and fully leveraged into the position, sadly I did not.\n\nI've read posts from here for quite some time now, and the vast majority are about ETF couch potato methods, with a smaller portion on large cap well known names where price discovery can be a bit more difficult. Very few are all that helpful (it's more of a buy xyz, trust me bro).\n\nWhat if I told you before I invest in a stock that I spend between 10 - 100 hours reading SEDAR documents, financial statements, and forums trying to better understand the company, and the merits of the potential investment?\n\nI'm not here to say one way is better than the other, to each their own, but do I deserve downvotes for simply wanting to participate in market discussion, while discussing my contrarian methods?"

Basically the Canadian and Sp500 balance out to be similar to XEQT. My VFV is long term in RRSP and HBNK is Non registered (I use the Dividend as income)",

            "Young professional in early 30s, started investing for retirement about a year ago in TFSA. Investment horizon of 30+ years\n\n  \nCurrent desired allocation is 80/20 with the following equity breakdown:\n\n40% in Canadian stocks XIC  \n37.5% in US stocks XUU  \n15.25% in Int. developed markets XEF  \n7.25% in Int. emerging markets XEC\n\nI recognize that 40% in Canadian markets represents a high home country bias, but I wanted to keep the largest portion of my equity allocation in Canada for psychological reasons. I think it would feel bad if I had more invested in the US than in Canada, and if Canada were to outperform the US, since it would feel like I'd be paying more (in MER and taxes) for a lesser-performing ETF. I hope that makes sense.\n\nAs for the rest, I went with a rough market cap allocation for US (37.5% out of the 60% in ex-Canada equity) and divided between international developed and emerging markets in a 2:1 ratio.\n\nIn addition, I arrived at the same allocation a second way. I began with a roughly equal 35/35/30 split between Canada / US / international, then decided to give a little more to Canada and a little less to international because it's cheaper and there's no currency risk, so I tweaked it to 40/35/25. Finally, I gave a little more to US from the international portion, resulting in the final numbers of 40/37.5/22.5.\n\n  \nMy main question is that from what I've read about home country bias, the difference between 40% and 30% in Canada is not that significant. I would love to hear someone chip in on this. I have also played around with the idea of a 35% allocation to Canada, which would give me about 40% US and 25% international."

I already do reoccurring investments on other things, so switching will be easy.

You're also only quoting the price return of those funds which completely ignores distributions (XGRO is up 53.55% over the past 5 years).\n\nYou're right, didn't account for distributions.",

            "> Now I use wealthsimple so there will be a 1.5% conversion fee while buying and selling.\n\nThere is no scenario where *anyone* should convert currency at such a high rate when it's possible to convert at rates between 0.002% and 0.03% depending on the amount converted at Interactive Brokers.\n\n> Also, any tax advantages if i hold one or the other in an RRSP or TFSA?\n\nIn an RRSP (or other retirement accounts like LIRA, RRIF, etc.) VOO will avoid the US foreign withholding tax whereas VFV will not. The amount this saves you will be 15% of the dividend yield. With VOO's current yield of about 1.3%, this is roughly 20 basis points (0.2%) of guaranteed tax savings.",
            "The cost to convert currency outweighs the MER savings and the foreign witholding tax on dividends. Stick with VFV. \n\nRegarding the tax - 15% tax is withheld on dividends in any account other than an RRSP. This can only be avoided if you purchase the US listed ETF (VOO) in an RRSP. \n\nDon't let this drive your decision on whether to save in an RRSP or TFSA though. That decision should be based on your specific financial situation. How much money you make now vs expected income in retirement, etc.",
            "Don't use wealthsimple for US equities. Wealthsimple won't let you do Norbert's Gambit. Use a better brokerage if that's your use case, like IBKR.\n\n1.5% forex fees are insane and nobody should be paying that much. If you have to pay 10$ per transaction, you're still better off than paying that 1.5%.\n\n>I\u2019ve also heard that they don\u2019t allow using their platforms ONLY for Norbert\u2019s Gambit.\n\nWhere are you getting this information from?
