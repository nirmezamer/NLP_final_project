            "Posted this in last weekend's thread, and got downvoted into oblivion. Probably more of the same this week.\n\n*Pretty pumped for the coming months. My portfolio consists of two stocks ,99% in one name which is up 280.59% YTD (6 figure gains) and 1% in another name which is flat since I started to build a position. The Canadian Exchange selloffs (due to the new capital gains inclusion rates) should be coming to an end. Very exciting to see where all that money that is sitting on the sidelines gets redeployed by institutional investors*.\n\nBeauty week overall as I felt it would be. My biggest position is now up 319.05% YTD. My small position agreed just this week to a definitive deal to sell the majority of the business, and payout a special dividend (approximate 100% gain since I started accumulating in March). My only disappointment is not having more time to continue to DCA into the small position."

            "Young professional in early 30s, started investing for retirement about a year ago in TFSA. Investment horizon of 30+ years\n\n  \nCurrent desired allocation is 80/20 with the following equity breakdown:\n\n40% in Canadian stocks XIC  \n37.5% in US stocks XUU  \n15.25% in Int. developed markets XEF  \n7.25% in Int. emerging markets XEC\n\nI recognize that 40% in Canadian markets represents a high home country bias, but I wanted to keep the largest portion of my equity allocation in Canada for psychological reasons. I think it would feel bad if I had more invested in the US than in Canada, and if Canada were to outperform the US, since it would feel like I'd be paying more (in MER and taxes) for a lesser-performing ETF. I hope that makes sense.\n\nAs for the rest, I went with a rough market cap allocation for US (37.5% out of the 60% in ex-Canada equity) and divided between international developed and emerging markets in a 2:1 ratio.\n\nIn addition, I arrived at the same allocation a second way. I began with a roughly equal 35/35/30 split between Canada / US / international, then decided to give a little more to Canada and a little less to international because it's cheaper and there's no currency risk, so I tweaked it to 40/35/25. Finally, I gave a little more to US from the international portion, resulting in the final numbers of 40/37.5/22.5.\n\n  \nMy main question is that from what I've read about home country bias, the difference between 40% and 30% in Canada is not that significant. I would love to hear someone chip in on this. I have also played around with the idea of a 35% allocation to Canada, which would give me about 40% US and 25% international.",

            "Copying [a comment I posted in a different sub yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/1dpcvlh/comment/lamozv2/):\n\n\nWS argues that their lagging performance through the current bull run will even out in a downturn, with their managed portfolios being insulated from some of the downside. Maybe.\n\n\n**I've been using the robo advisors from Wealthsimple, Modern Advisor, Questrade, and CI Direct (formerly Wealth Bar) for about 5-6 years and can say that they've all performed pretty similarly. Each has pulled ahead and lagged behind the pack at different times, though Questrade seems to lead more often than not.**\n\n\nWS Managed was negatively affected as interest rates increased (due to their bond choice), but they regained some ground by betting on gold ahead of the gold rush of the past ~18 months.\n\n\nIt's important to note that WS charges a management fee (up to 0.5%), as well as a 0.4% FX fee (on top of the \"corporate exchange rate\", which already includes a spread). On the flipside, they have negotiated MER rebates with some ETF providers, and they pass some of that rebate on to customers.\n\n\nI am somewhat disappointed with their use of so many USD funds, which means you are being hit by the FX fees in both directions (buy/sell). They have told me that they use the account's KYC/time horizon/goals to choose between CAD and USD denominated funds; for long time horizons, they use the USD funds because the MER is lower and RRSPs get a slight dividend tax advantage. The downside of that is if you change your risk level, time horizon, or withdraw funds, your money may not have been in the USD fund long enough to realize those benefits (vs the FX fees).\n\n\nFees: https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/legal/fees/invest",

I'd recommend others do that too.",
            "It's underperforming VGRO ?  eesh....  and people pay for this ?",
            "> As the article states there just isn\u2019t enough long term performance data to go off of\n\nAgreed, but would also add that long term performance data isn't very relevant here, as all the funds mentioned have different asset allocations. The [longest term data](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us-news/en/articles/media-releases/credit-suisse-global-investment-returns-yearbook-2023-202302.html#:~:text=Since%201900%2C%20Australia%20has%20been%20the%20best%20performing%20stock%20market%20in%20real%20USD%20terms%20with%20an%20annualized%20real%20return%20of%206.43%25) we have (going all the way back to 1900) shows that *Australia* has been the best performing stock market. Does that mean we should disproportionately invest in Australian stocks (rhetorical question)? Investors shouldn't be making asset allocation decisions based on historical returns. The important thing is to know what you're buying and how it compares to your desired asset allocation, not \"long term\" data.\n\n> WS definitely trades some returns for lower volatility overall.\n\nidk tbh, to me WS seems like a mixed bag in that regard. Having a relatively more equal allocation between North American and International stocks, for example, does sound like it could reduce volatility. On the other hand, as the article states, \"it held large positions in an ETF that invested in long-term bonds\", and long-term bonds are notoriously more volatile than short-term bonds. WS also invests disproportionately in emerging market stocks, which are more volatile than their developed market counterparts.\n\n> I\u2019m generally happy with how my WS growth portfolio performed over the past few years, but as the article states, VGRO returned higher over the same period.\n\nThat's really all that matters: \"the best investment strategy is the one you'll stick with\", as a wise person once said. And it's hardly surprising that VGRO returned higher over the past 5 years, since US stocks outperformed International stocks, and short-term bonds outperformed long-term bonds. It would be more surprising if VGRO *didn't* outperform over that period."

CIBC's Investors Edge platform is convenient in terms of transferring money to and from your CIBC chequing account, but costs more in commissions ($6.95 each transaction vs. $0 for WS).",

            "You\u2019re not a moron. Just read up on it, there\u2019s lots of good and easy to find resources out there (beyond Reddit) \n\nUsing CIBC or Wealthsimple or another broker/platform is a personal choice. Wealthsimple is popular bc there\u2019s no commission fee, trades are free. Whereas most banks will charge you an extra $5-10 per trade in commission fees. \n\nTFSA contribution room starts accumulating the year you turned 18 (unless you were 18+ in 2009 then it starts from 2009). The allowable amount for each year varies. Once you open your first TFSA, you should track your contributions from your bank statements for the account. Also, the broker (CIBC or Wealthsimple) will report your contributions to CRA once a year and you can see that in your \u201cmy CRA account\u201d (but that wont be up-to-date since they only report once a year). \n\nIn a TFSA if you hold foreign stocks you\u2019ll be taxed 15-30% on dividends only. Not on the stock price gains and not when you sell a stock. Dividends from US companies have a 15% withholding tax (e.g. if the dividend is USD$1 per share then you will receive USD$0.85 per share). Dividends from companies other countries may have a different rate. Yes, withholding means they\u2019ve already deducted the tax before the dividends are deposited into your account. \n\nYou could answer all of those questions with any one or two of these sites, if you have more questions I\u2019d suggest starting there (or start with your own bank\u2019s website): \n\nhttps://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/contributions.html#toc1 \n\nhttps://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/learn/what-is-tfsa \n\nhttps://www.questrade.com/learning/investment-concepts/rrsps-101/tfsa-or-rrsp-what's-the-right-way-for-you-to-save\n\nhttps://help.wealthsimple.com/hc/en-ca/articles/360056584994-Non-resident-withholding-taxes-and-how-to-minimize-them\n\nhttps://ca.rbcwealthmanagement.com/documents/1647873/0/Tax+Implications+of+Investing+in+the+United+States.pdf\n\nEdit: typos",
