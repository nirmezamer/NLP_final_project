I usually do long road trips on my bike and recently when I was travelling to Kanyakumari I lost my bag which was tied to my bike on the way and couldn't track it and had to bear a loss almost 1 lakh as the lost bag had expensive items like camera etc., I still am planning to do these trips and I will be extra careful from here on but I do not want to risk anything this time as even on my last trip I had tied everything properly and still lost it. So, I am looking for a domestic travel insurance that will cover my baggage and health to avoid any risks in future. Is there any insurance that you guys can suggest that does this",

            "Is shopping in India different than in the US? I want to make clear that this is a genuine question based on a pattern Ive noticed. I work in a part of the US that has a large Indian immigrant population, at least large enough that I interact with a lot of them on the daily. I work at a shoe store and Ive noticed that a lot of times when an Indian family comes in, they just sort of drop shoes theyre not going to buy in a big pile and walk away. Theyre always very polite, but it leaves a big mess for us to clean up. Is this common in India?"

            "Please tell me if this is really fine\n\nI had worked day and night to get into one of the top 5 engineering colleges in my city. After coming to college, I was still in the same mindset of my jee prep days. I didn't make any female friends in college in my 1st semester. I was just doing the same hustle. Later on I realised I had to enjoy my college life as well. I wanted to get into the main group of my class but which had the popular girls and boys but it was too late. I am currently in a position where I talk to all of them but I am not able to get too close with any girl. I tried hard but was of no use and I was even having the doubt that maybe I may look too desperate as well. I still regret the decision why I didn't do the same thing in my first semester when everything was fresh. I am finding it too hard to make any close female friends in college. I am stuck with a boys group of 5 where none of them are really interested to get female friends and are quite boring in nature. I am feeling is it a waste of my college life if I don't have any female friends in my close group because all other groups are a mix of both. I know I will do fine with the placements and stuff. Its not that I don't really talk to any girl. I do but nobody became too close. Idk how could I even explain this to anyone so posted it here"
