            "Hi everyone. \nI am a 29 year old male and a father to a toddler. I don't know what I should say but i haven't been able to sleep properly since ages. Six months ago I had an accident and had to leave my job. My right leg doesn't work anymore. I need help waking up and lying down. There is no source of income. I am down to neck in debt. I don't even have enough money to buy diapers or food for that matter. I am looking for job everyday, but whatever this fucked up recession is doing to us is effecting everyone's life I guess.\n\nI have experience as an HR. I can work in any thing related to customer relations or human relations.\n\nI know there are probably thousands of people facing the same problem but I can't face it anymore. I am nothing but a burden to my family now, a failure. I have promised God that if by the end of tomorrow I am unable to earn anything then I will end my life.",
            "I am writing this post not knowing who else to discuss this with or find anyone who can relate to this experience. I was raised for the most part in what I thought was a traditional household with modern values. Only much later did I realize that was not entirely the case.\n\nTo elaborate, both my parents are well-educated and working professionals. I was bullied numerous times as a kid and have grown up with likely undetected mental health issues. Major life changes brought me and my family into a close community of upper castes and Brahmins.\n\nI was raised with an aspiration to assimilate into the culture and traditional lifestyle of Brahmins. This was partly because my parents wanted to be part of that community, instilling the belief that following the lifestyle of a different group might make us better. Additionally, I had seen people of my caste behave poorly towards women and undervalue education, whereas we observed many upper castes and especially Brahmins who were well-educated and well-settled in life. Moreover, my parents had close friends, closer than family, who belonged to the Brahmin community and were practicing traditional rituals to varying degrees.\n\nI almost believed I was half Brahmin until I benefited from reservations. During this teenage phase of upbringing, I hardly socialized compared to my peers and friends. Most of what I was exposed to were religious and spiritual speeches by various preachers and babas. The central theme was the normalization of dogma, miracles, and an emphasis on belief rather than rationality. Additionally, given my introverted nature and the cultish upbringing involving no interaction with people my age, I did not make many friends. I do not blame my circumstances entirely, but I cannot ignore their contribution as a key factor.\n\nFast forward two decades later, and after numerous depressive episodes in life, I educated myself on different ideologies and perspectives. I learned from acquaintances and distant friends how their lives were so different and the kind of exposure they had. Over time, I realized my folks' propensity to be hypnotically drawn towards cults and single-minded perspectives with no room for nuance, introspection, or questioning. I also realized that celebrations and happiness are not to be shunned as vulgar and greedy disillusionments. In short, I grew a bit more liberal in how to view life and people.\n\nCurrently, I find myself in a happy relationship, although not fully accepted by my parents. On the other hand, my parents have grown increasingly regressive and accustomed to being part of many cults. Behind the scenes, they express hatred towards me and my choices at every moment, while with me, they express great anxiety for their lives and me being their only caretaker. My relationship with my partner and our work lives are affected daily by the casual lack of empathy or care they express, and I have not been able to make many friends, especially someone who I can talk to about these things. Whether it's near and distant family members or friends, most have grown apart or do not share distantly liberal beliefs.\n\nThis brings me to the present day - I continue to be lonely and depressed but do not wish to share this with anyone. Having tried therapy a couple of times, I am getting weary of explaining my life story with little chance of the therapist truly understanding where I come from. Has anyone gone through a similar transformation in their lifetime or can relate to these emotions and is willing to talk? Does anyone have suggestions on how to progress in life when one foot is tied to guilt-tripping loved ones and the other to a lack of social life? Does anyone have experience on how to overcome regret? I look forward to your perspectives!\n\nTL;DR: Raised in a traditional household that aspired to assimilate Brahmin culture and lifestyle, leading to an isolating and dogmatic upbringing. Over time, grew disillusioned with parents' regressive views and lack of open-mindedness. Now in a happy relationship but not accepted by increasingly cult-involved parents. Struggling with loneliness, depression, lack of understanding social circle. Seeking perspectives from those with similar experiences of ideological transformation and advice on overcoming regret while dealing with guilt-tripping loved ones.",

            "My Indian Parents don\u2019t let me decide for my life. \n\n\n\nI\u2019m an NRI, and live in a west country. This year I\u2019m going to graduate from Year 12. But since last 2 years my parents are talking with their Indian friends and have decided that I should go to India and prepare for JEE for 1.5 years in hope that I\u2019ll go to IIT. \n\n\n\nMind you there are three universities from my cities which come in top 30 QS rank for engineering and I\u2019m happy to go in one of them to purse the discipline with my friends doing similar major. But my parents somehow got this idea that all these rankings are paid and these colleges are nothing in front of IIT. I eavesdropped on my dad talking about how none in his distant family has ever been able to crack it, so he wants me to be the first one.  But his 2 arguments are most CEOs are IIT graduates in the world, and if ever in my life I want to work in India I will have a chance in my hand. I told him I have never thought of doing a job in India when I we have the best laws here for work life balance. But he just tries being aggressive so I just remain silent when my life decisions are being made without asking me. \n\n\n\nHe says once you\u2019ll graduate from IIT then your life will be cakewalk, companies will run behind you to hire you. Everyone will kiss your feet, and you will earn in millions. But honestly I\u2019m happy with my simple life. I\u2019m already burnt out with the rigorous schedule in my school. Jee will be 3 months after my final exams. My curriculum is a lot different than what they ask questions upon. When I told my dad this he just asked me to prepare for it for next 1.5 years. Now for a 4 year degree I have to spend 5.5 years at-least. I have no power for that. \n\n\n\nHere I\u2019m studying for my exams and side by side researching JEE which has taken a big toll on my life. At the age of 17 I am diagnosed with Rheumatoid arthritis my life expectancy can go as low as 10 less years than normal life. I\u2019m still studying pushing myself, with a risk of heart attack. \n\n\n\n\n\nBTW, all these uncles who are asking my dad to send me to IIT have their kids settled in USA, Canada and Australia with a successful life and no they never asked their own kids to join IITs. It is my dad who is so keen to send me to a college where chances of getting in virtually 0. Furthermore he taunts me that I want an easier life and don\u2019t want to do \u201csangharsh\u201d. Moreover, all these uncles who live in India tried their best to force their kids in IIT and they all failed and got depressed and were not able to do anything in life. I wonder how every friend on my dad\u2019s had a son preparing for engineering. \n\n\n\nAnyways, Can someone give me tips on how long I have to study for this exam. And what strategies I should consider for this exam. I guess I have no option but to give it a try.",

        "content": "Recently,\u00a0[u/St\\_Broseph](https://www.reddit.com/user/St_Broseph/), Dushyant had rescued a 23-year-old girl from Tiruvannamalai, a town in Tamil Nadu. He had saved her from a tyrannical family which was trying to control her and get her married off. Before leaving Tamil Nadu, the girl had recorded a video message of her from her own house stating that she is leaving home at her own accord and that she does not intend on coming back to her family. She then shared this video with all her family members, friends and relevant police authorities in Tiruvannamalai. She had also, upon reaching Bangalore, called the police control room and informed them that she is alive and well and had left at her own will. Yesterday, upon receiving information that a missing persons complaint was being lodged for the girl, the girl herself had contacted the Tiruvannamalai police and informed them that she has left out of her own will and even offered to video call them to show them she is okay. Dushyant had called the DSP and other police officers of Tiruvannamalai who didn\u2019t receive his calls. He had then texted him to inform him that no missing person\u2019s complaint should be taken because the girl was alive, well and safe. Broseph had even tweeted out to the Police authorities there telling them that he is not able to reach them. (Link to tweet below)  \n[https://x.com/St\\_Brosephs/status/1804183500645634108?t=KrcQ6QVIVjnA2jO6adco3Q&s=19](https://x.com/St_Brosephs/status/1804183500645634108?t=KrcQ6QVIVjnA2jO6adco3Q&s=19)\n\nAt around 2:30 AM today, 3 Tamil Nadu cops in civilian clothes along with the rescued girl\u2019s parents, in a civilian car showed up at Dushyant\u2019s doorstep. They did not show any identification apart from a picture of one of them in a policeman vardi. They asked him about the whereabouts of the girl and then attempted to drag him outside. He accompanied them to the main road where they proceeded to be abusive and aggressive. Then, still accompanied by these Tamil Nadu cops, he went to the Indiranagar police chowki nearby, where the cops were asleep.\n\nThe cops even after being awakened, were helpless and kept asking Dushyant to comply with the unreasonable Tamil Nadu cops. The Indiranagar cops along with the Tamil Nadu Cops and Dushyant went to the SBA Headquarters and started knocking on the door and ringing the bell. The Tamil Nadu Cops were still being extremely aggressive and by now had begun pushing and manhandling him when the people at Headquarters\u00a0 weren\u2019t opening the door because it was 4:30 AM ish in the morning by now. Frustrated by these things, these monsters tried to drag Dushyant towards the main road and put him into their civilian car. They used force and ganged up on him when he resisted this blatant abuse of power. They tried dragging him into a car and god knows what would\u2019ve happened if he were to go with them.\n\nBy this time Janhavi, got here and tried to support Dushyant. The HQ people had woken up by now and opened the door because of all the commotion. Seeing the HQ open, the girl\u2019s parents lunged inside. Janhavi ran to stop the girl\u2019s parents from trespassing into the HQ and possibly making things worse. She tried to stop the girl\u2019s father. This animal of a person, enraged by being stopped by Janhavi began to hit and punch her. This whole thing was further horrid because Cops from TWO JURISDICTIONS WERE PRESENT THERE AND DID NOTHING TO STOP JANHAVI FROM THIS ANIMAL EVEN AFTER THEY WERE ASKED TO. HE HURT HER SHOULDER, FACE AND KEPT GOING. Dushyant was near the main road and as soon as Janhavi pushed her head out of the door and screamed for help, he ran to her rescue while cops were still trying to restrain him physically. Dushyant had to physically move the assailant away from Janhavi to stop him from hitting her further. The Sub-Inspector of Indiranagar then got to the scene and asked everyone to head to the police station.\n\nEven after so much had transpired and such blatant disregard for law and order had been displayed, the cops at Indiranagar Police Station still tried to TAKE THE TAMIL NADU COPS\u2019 SIDE instead of treating this case on its facts. They were asking Dushyant to not escalate this legally and to comply with them. This whole incident shows how disgustingly entitled cops can get in Tamil Nadu and the height of incompetence shown by Indiranagar Police.\n\nDushyant has decided to pursue this legally. They have gotten medical attention and have medico legal cases. We will hold these abusive cops accountable for their lack of responsibility and blatant violation of procedure. These cops need to be SUSPENDED and the man who hit a FEMALE SOCIAL WORKER MERCILESSLY NEEDS TO BE PUT BEHIND BARS FOR HIS ACTIONS. We will do whatever it takes to bring these cops down because if cops turn a blind eye to crimes, refuse to follow procedure and act in such a brutal and disrespectful manner, are they even cops? Are these shameless scoundrels charged with our safety and protection? Imagine being in this situation instead of a resourceful person such as Broseph, anyone else would have been further assaulted, beaten and persecuted. We cannot rest until the perpetrators are arrested and the cops responsible for this are suspended and for this, we need your help. Follow and amplify St. Broseph posts on this incident across social media, call your journalist friends and inform them about what\u2019s happened, AMPLIFY THIS VOICE so that the law and order situation may improve and the next time a cop even considers doing something like this, they are reminded that\u00a0**PEOPLE OF BANGALORE WILL NOT STAY SILENT.**\n\ntl;dr\n\nDushyant, a social worker, rescued a girl from a controlling family. Tamil Nadu police and the girl's parents showed up at his doorstep at 2:30 AM to take her back. They assaulted Dushyant and another social worker, Janhavi, when they resisted. Bangalore police did nothing to help. Dushyant is calling for legal action against the police and the girl's father.",

For the Average Indians even a Shenghen or USA tourist visa is hard to obtain because they fear we will illegally immigrate.\n\nGlobal Standing means -\n\nHow your people are treated across the world?\n\nHow many countries allow visa free entry etc.\n\nIndia really needs to create 2 crore jobs per year to absorb the youth population boom.",
            "People are writing paragraphs here, so I'll shorten it for everyone else: Don't immigrate illegally. You practically have no protection if you end up in a lousy situation like this.",
            "We have to look into the reasons why people go to foreign countries in order to live as second class citizens at the mercy of their employers. \n\nThere's something horrible wrong here.",
            "It's a common trend in Western nations, this is another example of Indian laborers being treated as slaves / abused / not paid (in ISR, a fake ally): https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/04/25/israel-agriculture-india-palestinians-foreign-workers-rights/",
            "That is why it is very important to think about whom we vote for. The sons and daughters are made to suffer for the poor choices of their parents. \n\nThey kept electing Lalu though he was corrupt to the core and now they are electing Nitesh who cares only about being a slave dog from party to another to keep his position to loot. Unfortunately democracy comes with responsibility and being naive is not an excuse. \n\nI firmly believe no party should be having more than two consecutive terms in our political setup otherwise there is no way a state can develop. Bihar, West Bengal are the classic examples",
            "This is so sad \ud83d\ude1e, the Italian legal\nSystem should punish the person responsible. GoI should escalate!",
            "I'm Italian and this happened not far from my home. \n\nI'm sorry for what happened but i think it's crucial to understand that work conditions in Italy are bad even for italian people with degrees.\n\nComing here illegally, with no degree and not much understating our language is basically coming here as a slave to these people.\n\nThese people, the business owners, they need to stop, but the only way they will stop is by cutting their endless supply of cheap slaves who are willing to work for less than the ones before them."
