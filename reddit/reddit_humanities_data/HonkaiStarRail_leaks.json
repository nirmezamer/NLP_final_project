It's Aventurine's specific power to turn into a sexy jester with a tiny waist, bless him.!<\n\n>!On a more serious note it makes sense that his power involves being very flashy and making himself look like a supervillain considering how often he uses that tactic in his strategies to distract from what's really happening (including in that transformation scene). It's really interesting how their cornerstones are personalised.!<",
