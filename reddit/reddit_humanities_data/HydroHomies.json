I lead a sedentary lifestyle and don't sweat much since it's Winter where I am. Google says that I should be drinking \\~1.3L of water a day, based on my weight \\[I know that isn't a great method of determining how much you need, but it was all I could find\\].\n\nHowever, on an average day I can easily put away anywhere between 3 and 4L, some days up to 5L. In other words, 2-3x the 1.3L recommendation. Most of it is made up of plain water/plain water with mineral drops added, but also some tea \\[English breakfast, peppermint, chamomile, sleep\\] and hot chocolate that is about 2/3 water.\n\nI feel fine, but I figure that I'm almost definitely mildly overhydrated. Weirdly, though, I don't seem to pee an excessive amount and my urine is typically pale yellow \\[sometimes clear\\]. Since I'm not a very active person and I'm not sweating buckets, I'm not sure where all that water's going. I also tend to start feeling very thirsty if I haven't had anything to drink for more than about 10-15 minutes. Does drinking a lot of water make you feel more thirsty?\n\nWhat does drinking this much water do to a person? What are the symptoms associated with mild overhydration? Am I overhydrated, or do I just need to drink this much water?",

            "your body asks you for the amount of water it needs. what it needs depends on many factors such as your diet, your sweat loss, physical activity, health issues, and more i cant think of. Just because Google said something doesn't mean its true nor does it mean it applies to you",
            "3-4L isn't that much, or am I crazy? There is no way that any recommendation is only to drink 1.3 liters a day. Maybe I'm just crazy. I want more water than that.\n\nGoogled the 8 cups thing.. 1.89L. yeah.. I drink way more water than that. I think you're okay, this is like bare minimum stuff.",
            "If you're drinking that much water then make sure you get your daily salt and electrolyte intake",
            "My sister worked with someone that drank too much water - her bladder doubled in size which while great for long car rides was quite alarming to her Doctor. \n\nFrom memory it was not only damaging her bladder but also causing issues with absorbing critical minerals and nutrients.",

            "After drinking 6-7L a day for around 5 days the doctor told me I had given myself Water Poisoning which was taking its toll on my kidneys and why I had no much pain in my lower back. I\u2019m have type 2 diabetes and needed my meds altered due to the extreme thirst. \nOn normal days I drink 2-3L a day.",
            "Your kidneys can only process max of one liter per hour, if you drink more than that regularly that's how you get water intoxication.",
            "Ruin your bladder and wash out your electrolytes (effectively causing dehydration).",
            "I don't think what you are drinking is excessive. I drink 3-5 litres of actual water(spread over the day), 2-3 cups of breakfast tea and obviously get water from food also. I exercise a bit more than you, but nothing wild and I live in the UK where it is cold and wet almost constantly. The thirst thing is something you should stay aware of as there are some medical conditions that show their hand like that, but I also do like you get thirsty easily. I personally think your body gets used to \"the good stuff\" and wants more. Be aware but you are likely just fine."
