I lead a sedentary lifestyle and don't sweat much since it's Winter where I am. Google says that I should be drinking \\~1.3L of water a day, based on my weight \\[I know that isn't a great method of determining how much you need, but it was all I could find\\].\n\nHowever, on an average day I can easily put away anywhere between 3 and 4L, some days up to 5L. In other words, 2-3x the 1.3L recommendation. Most of it is made up of plain water/plain water with mineral drops added, but also some tea \\[English breakfast, peppermint, chamomile, sleep\\] and hot chocolate that is about 2/3 water.\n\nI feel fine, but I figure that I'm almost definitely mildly overhydrated. Weirdly, though, I don't seem to pee an excessive amount and my urine is typically pale yellow \\[sometimes clear\\]. Since I'm not a very active person and I'm not sweating buckets, I'm not sure where all that water's going. I also tend to start feeling very thirsty if I haven't had anything to drink for more than about 10-15 minutes. Does drinking a lot of water make you feel more thirsty?\n\nWhat does drinking this much water do to a person? What are the symptoms associated with mild overhydration? Am I overhydrated, or do I just need to drink this much water?",

The thirst thing is something you should stay aware of as there are some medical conditions that show their hand like that, but I also do like you get thirsty easily.

Being shorter, light and needing a lot of nutriens without expelling much waste kinda reminds me of a hyperactive thyroid.

Also could be some kidney thing? Or diabetes (if, then the genetic kind probably, absolutely possible for shorter/thin people), that makes you super thirsty all the time.
