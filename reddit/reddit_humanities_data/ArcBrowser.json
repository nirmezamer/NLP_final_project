Props to the team for the big updates to Live Calendars this week. Also, a very special thank you to our Early Birds who helped us diagnose a related issue!\n> - Downloads Performance Improvements: By making the downloads history page more responsive, Alex helped drive performance improvements for downloading large files, making the process more efficient and reliable, especially for videos.\n> - Support for macOS 12 is ending soon: After July 11th, Arc will no longer receive fixes or features on macOS 12. If this impacts you, we recommend updating your system to ensure your browser remains stable and secure. Kudos to Max for leading us through this transition.\n\n[**Release Notes**](<https://arc.net/release-notes>) \u2013 [**Download Arc**](<https://releases.arc.net/release/Arc-1.49.0-51346.zip>) (371.5 MiB)",

            "What constraints did Arc have with macOS 12? Seems like a strange decision to drop support for a fairly recent macOS version.",
            "is it just me or does the \"See What's New\" button not work anymore... https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcBrowser/comments/1col6rw/see_whats_new_does_this_work_for_you/ isn't exactly what i'm talking about, here the button just doesnt work at all. seems to have changed in the last few updates.",
            "Very nice! But do we have captions in PiP already?",
            "Someone else experiencing problems with 1password after the update?",
            "The two main reasons:\n\n-\tLimited Userbase: most people are on Ventura or Sonoma by now, so at a certain point you should cut off supporting older versions because it's not viable to keep fixing issues for that OS.\n-\tAPI requirements: some features may require newer APIs only available on Ventura and Sonoma.\n\nKeep in mind that most developers who work on Apple platforms (mostly iOS, but macOS to an extent) provide n-1 support, where n is the latest version. In this case, it means Sonoma and Ventura are supported.",
            "not just you, same here",
            "If you care about PiP use Firefox. It is by far the best PiP of any browser, with captions.",
            "I just updated on my end and no issues so far. Then again, I'm trying again for the first time in a while. How is the memory usage this time around?",
            "Interesting. What is the difference between this and Google Chrome? How can Chrome support macOS 10.15 but Arc can't? Is it because Arc's team is smaller and that's why they should only focus on newer OSs?",
            "This is severely messed up. They're deciding that the minority are disposable. They're locking the app behind a major purchase of hardware. They should never have allowed us to use the app on a pre-2017 Mac if they didn't intend us to use it. Suggesting that we upgrade is utterly out-of-touch. What other developers do is not an excuse."

        "content": "\ud83d\udcc6 27 June, 2024\n\n> Thanks for using Arc! We have a new version for you, including:\n> \n> - Live Calendars for Windows: Now, when Google Calendar is pinned as a favorite in your Sidebar, you'll see a countdown timer in the calendar icon. Also, when it's time for the meeting to start, a \"Join\" button will automatically appear in your Sidebar, allowing you to jump into your next video call with one click. To change your Live Calendar's updates, just right-click the calendar icon and adjust its settings. Huge shoutout to Ben, Connor, and Freddy for bringing your Sidebar to life with this feature!\n> - Window Loading Performance Improvement: Alexandra has enhanced window loading performance by delaying the title bar display until the window is ready, resulting in a faster and more responsive interface.\n> - Translation Button Reliability Fix: Previously, there was an issue where the Translate button was not reliably responsive in certain cases. Thanks to Brian, this issue has been resolved, ensuring translations happen seamlessly each time.\n> - Bug Fix for Window Restoration After Restart: Thanks to Sherry, we have fixed an issue where, upon restarting, Arc would restore a temporary window that made it difficult to access spaces and pinned tabs. Now, we restore a full window with each restart, along with the temporary one if that was the last one closed.\n> - Small Design Polish for Account Settings: Alexandra has added some tiny-but-mighty design polish to account settings, making all widths of setting menus consistent for a more streamlined appearance.\n> - Longstanding Tab Closing Fix: Thanks to Seb, Adam, and Maya, we've fixed a longstanding issue that caused tabs to be archived ahead of your specified \"Archive tabs after...\" setting \u2014 improving tab management reliability.\n\n[**Release Notes**](<https://resources.arc.net/hc/en-us/articles/22513842649623-Arc-for-Windows-2023-2024-Release-Notes>) \u2013 [**Download Arc for Windows**](<https://releases.arc.net/windows/prod/1.8.0.34917/Arc.x64.msix>)",

            "Since I use Arc on Windows and how good people talk about Arc on Mac, I still think that on Mac the devs test for bugs before releasing a stable version, and in Windows the devs let the users test the bugs in the \"stable\" version",
            "The slowest trickle of features and still meh perf & reliability. Nonetheless, I appreciate the change log dedication.\n\n//\n\nWhat's most perplexing to me: I wrongly assumed Swift meant Windows parity would be fast: \"Isn't it the same codebase? Get Swift working on Windows \u2192 voila, Arc on Win has feature parity.\"\n\nI was **completely** wrong. Windows is still massively behind in features & perf \u2192 these are *old* macOS features. TBC is basically rebuilding the browser, brick by brick.\n\nI don't think the Swift-on-Windows experiment has shown its benefits, unfortunately, at a crucial juncture for TBC. \n\n//\n\nMaybe by Arc 3.0 / Arc 1.30 on Windows, it's actually finally parity.",
            "Hello! I am a new Arc user and I did not know that Arc had a setting that auto archived Tabs after 12 hours set by default. I thought it was a bug that Arc was losing my Tabs. I was about to stop using Arc because I thought my content wasn't safe, and I couldn't trust Arc to maintain it's state.\n\nI think it might be helpful to walk users through choosing that option manually during the set up process or within the first moments of using Arc. It certainly wasn't something I expected the browser to do.",
