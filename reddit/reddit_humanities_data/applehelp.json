Questions must be within the bounds of Apple\u2019s EULA.\n\nCertain subjects are not appropriate for /r/AppleHelp, including:\n\n* [Developer Previews and AppleSeed Betas](http://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/2ccsog/apples_nda_yosemite_and_ios_8_rapplehelps/). If you are running a beta or developer preview, head over to /r/AppleHelp_Betas.\n* Jailbroken devices.\n* Hackintoshes.\n* Piracy.\n* [Bypassing an Activation Lock or firmware password.](http://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/wiki/activation_lock)\n\n###3. Include as many details as possible.\n\nCertain information may be crucial for solving issues. Please make sure to include the following:\n\n* Your model of [Mac](https://www.ifixit.com/Info/ID-your-Mac), [iPhone](https://Support.apple.com/HT201296), [iPad](https://support.apple.com/HT201471), [iPod](https://support.apple.com/HT204217), etcetera.\n* Your version of [iOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201685) or [Mac OS X](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201260).\n* Screenshots of the issue [Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201361) or [iOS device](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT200289).\n* If posting a log or crash report, [upload it to Gist](https://gist.github.com).\n* If posting the same question in multiple places, links to the other threads.\n\n###4.

Be polite and kind at all times.\n\nRudeness will not be tolerated! Suggesting someone \"Google it\" is a good example of this. People come here for help, so please don't shove them right back out the door. These posts will be deleted.\n\n###6.
