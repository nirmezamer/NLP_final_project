It is possible that -unknowingly- adware/malware was installed on your mac.\n\nMalwarebytes is a program that can identify all kinds of adware and malware software. If Malwarebytes finds mal or ad-ware it offers the option to remove this unwanted software. Sometimes a restart is required.\n\n\nhttps://www.malwarebytes.com/\n\n\nWhat also can be helpful, a tool called 'etrecheck'.\n\nEtrecheck is a kind of system diagnostics on steroids.

Its a kind of little snitch for system software changes and can flag if (malicious) software is installed. Its called blockblock.

            "You need to erase the iPhone and setup as new.  iCloud information will return but the pesky \"system data\" will not.  It's just like misc cached info that doesn't know where to go.  \n\nMake sure you have a backup before doing this",

You won't lose anything if you do it right.\n\niCloud Backup is only useful if you're trying to maintain the way your phone was setup (as in Home Screen layout, etc.) but otherwise syncing is a much better, reliable and cleaner method of backing up your information.",

            "Back up important stuff (ideally not in a \"backup\" proper, sync it int the individual iCloud whatever or other accounts) and Erase all contents and settings and put it back.\n\nThough that can also be a chunk of something that is trying to sync and reserving storage, but then it doesn't have enough space so it just kind of abandons the half-downloaded files and they become System/Other (on older versions)\n\nIf that is the case then signing back into the app (or restoring it and your keychain off a backup) might just start the sync process again and immediately flood the phone",
            "There is a bit of a misconception with how iPhones, iPads, Macs etc. calculate the specific categories of storage.\n\nSystem Data/Other CAN contain data that are not just allocated to the system, but data that the phone struggles to categorize properly. This is very common especially with files that involve some sort of sync process. Turning on services like Optimized iPhone Storage in iCloud Photos can cause this, but it's expected behavior. As the phone dumps some image data to save space, the photo file itself can be hard for the phone to recognize as a photo, so it puts it into the System Data/Other category.\n\nI'd check how much data is being used in iCloud first. because this tend to be the issue. Your phone will try to push as much data over to the cloud as possible, and keep as little as possible on the phone, if necessary, but there is a limit to how much the phone can do in this way. At one point you will be full up regardless.",
