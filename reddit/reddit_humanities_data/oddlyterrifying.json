Needless to say trauma ensued for a few, thankfully I walked in, took a look, said \"that ain't my Dad\" and promptly left to greet people at the entrance with the news. Everyone thought it was cute, man the 80s was a wild time huh.?\n\nEdit: Should mention, he did donate his eyes to someone in need, thus the cotton ball, still not entirely sure why they didn't use more but hey I was 7 and didn't find out til I was like 20.",

Basically punctire it and all the gel comes out. So these would also help reshape the eye to help it look normal when the eye lid was closed rather than have a big indentation. They are plastic with little barbs on them. See you later.",
