Last we polled the community you all made it clear you would like that rule to stay. I know not every violation is removed as we miss a few here or there but your reports help us weed them out. We love all the content being posted and getting help from the community here is great but until you all let us know you want rule #3 to change we are gonna leave it as it is. Thanks, be cool, and keep the rubber side down.",

            "I'm firmly in favor of keeping rule 3. Just look at the other MTB sub, or really any cycling sub in general, and it's 99% pictures of people's bikes leaning against trees, leaning against a wall, etc. Just really low quality post. If I want to look at pictures of bikes there's a lot of other subs and websites to do that at",

            "Anyone else want rule #3 to change? I don\u2019t mind seeing pics of bikes on their own. Actually I think a photo of someone riding is kinda weird; unlike a vid of someone riding. Do people outside of bike park photographers even take photos of people riding?",
            "The only bummer for me (and I\u2019m guilty, I had one kicked back) is that I was really excited to share my new bike, after this sub gave me really great help and advice through a few posts.  Maybe in general it\u2019s not good for the sub, I\u2019m just saying the one time I tried, I was disappointed because I wanted to share my new bike with all the awesome folks here that helped me out.  Either way, I love this sub, and will be here with or without rule 3.",

            "I had a question for the hivemind about tire sizing:  I recently bought a Salsa Rangefinder Deore 10 29\", with  WTB ST i30 32h 29 rims that have a 30mm inner rim width measurement, and 35mm outer rim. I am hoping to turn it into a bikepacking rig and I'm trying to pop some leaner tires on it (between 2.2 and 2.35in) such as Vittoria Mezcals compared to the chunky 2.6in Maxxis Rekons that came with it which are great for chugging through anything but are a drag on pavement, dirt road, or gravel. Would there be any issue with mounting a tire as narrow as 2.2 inches on these? Is there a general reference for rims that the manufacturer puts out that provides these kinds of data points? I'm pretty new to all this so I'm not sure the best way to find min/max tolerances for tire size vs rim width. Thank you!",
            "I have a 2014 Giant Trance 3 27.5, worth upgrading or get a new bike? I was riding a ton 2014-17 but intermittently since then but getting back into it as my main out of the house hobby. Upgraded a few parts over the years, dropper post, handle bars, tires, brake pads. I really like the geometry and feel of the 27.5 wheels. But there are a lot of out dated parts as I am finding. 200mm eye to eye shock that needs a rebuild, 2x10 drive train, 150mm front brake, deore components, 19mm rims and the most noticeable are the chrome stantions. I'd really like to upgrade it and then once my son can hit the trails in a few years upgrade to a new bike then.\u00a0",
            "Hey I got this 2020 polygon cascade 4 and it has a SUNTOUR XCE, 100MM 27.5\" TRAVEL fork. It was my first bike and I'm letting a friend use it for his first bike and I would like to upgrade the fork. I'm thinking 120 travel and air. What would be a good fork  match up for this bike that's under 150? Not sure if there is anything under that bit I have some wiggle room. TIA",
            "any ideas on how to remove a stuck bushing from the shock eyelet? I already tried with the correct tool, but it is too stuck",
            "Alright y'all I'm having quite the internal debate here. My current bike is a 2020 Spectral AL 5, I plan to keep this bike as my mess around bike for park days or enduro type riding. Looking to get a shorter trail/DoWnCoUnTrY bike. Right now I'm looking at the YT Izzo Core 2 (which isn't shipping until May 27th, that date could be further out who knows.) or the Commencal TEMPO Essential.  The TEMPO is about 300 dollars more and is available now. I'm slightly leaning towards the Commencal in the Metallic Green. I have not seen a ton of reviews on the TEMPO yet. I'm hoping someone in here has ridden both of these bikes and may be able to give me some insight!",
            "I am in need of a new MTB helmet. Any recommendations? Preferably looking for a full face and I dont have a lot to spend after buying some stuff for my bike. I have money but im looking to spend no more than \u00a3150 max, preferably around the \u00a3100 mark and I know options very limited. Currently looking at a fox proframe or an alpinestar missile pro as I can get them for \u00a3100-\u00a3150 however I want something that has good ventilation and good comfort are my main priorities.\n\nThanks",
            "Complete MTB noob here and had some questions about MTB shoes.\n\nI was looking at some Fizik Terra Atlas shoes (I have some Fizik road bike shoes and am a big fan), and it looks like the area for a cleat is pretty recessed, so maybe the shoes could be used as clipless or on flats - is that correct?  It seems like several different types of MTB shoes offer this configuration.  Could those shoes specifically work fine on flats and/or clipless?",
