Last we polled the community you all made it clear you would like that rule to stay. I know not every violation is removed as we miss a few here or there but your reports help us weed them out. We love all the content being posted and getting help from the community here is great but until you all let us know you want rule #3 to change we are gonna leave it as it is. Thanks, be cool, and keep the rubber side down.",

Read the rules, the photo did not meet the criteria (it was just a photo of the tyre where it had cracked) so I removed the photo. I did not want to break the rules.\n\n1 comment on the post about how worthless the post was without a photo and I couldn't agree more and then the thread was locked.(Clarification: comment not from mod).\n\nHere's the thing: I'm on Reddit; it has the functionality to host photos and videos. Why force posters to host images elsewhere? Why force consumers to click links to third-party sites? (Could be malicious/unsafe links).\n\nExplain the reasoning behind the rule and perhaps I could understand. (I'm not asking for an explanation BTW).\n\nEdit: read a few more comments and I'm seeing there was a poll to decide the rule. Democracy at its finest.\n\nEdit2: https://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/s/uBheQs5Ta0\n\nHumans will find loopholes. Tell someone they can't do this or that and they get the same end result by working around the rules.

            "I had a question for the hivemind about tire sizing:  I recently bought a Salsa Rangefinder Deore 10 29\", with  WTB ST i30 32h 29 rims that have a 30mm inner rim width measurement, and 35mm outer rim. I am hoping to turn it into a bikepacking rig and I'm trying to pop some leaner tires on it (between 2.2 and 2.35in) such as Vittoria Mezcals compared to the chunky 2.6in Maxxis Rekons that came with it which are great for chugging through anything but are a drag on pavement, dirt road, or gravel. Would there be any issue with mounting a tire as narrow as 2.2 inches on these? Is there a general reference for rims that the manufacturer puts out that provides these kinds of data points? I'm pretty new to all this so I'm not sure the best way to find min/max tolerances for tire size vs rim width. Thank you!",
            "I have a 2014 Giant Trance 3 27.5, worth upgrading or get a new bike? I was riding a ton 2014-17 but intermittently since then but getting back into it as my main out of the house hobby. Upgraded a few parts over the years, dropper post, handle bars, tires, brake pads. I really like the geometry and feel of the 27.5 wheels. But there are a lot of out dated parts as I am finding. 200mm eye to eye shock that needs a rebuild, 2x10 drive train, 150mm front brake, deore components, 19mm rims and the most noticeable are the chrome stantions. I'd really like to upgrade it and then once my son can hit the trails in a few years upgrade to a new bike then.\u00a0",
            "Hi women's forum,  \nI'm considering switching my 150 Recon Silver RL to a 170 Yari standard. The Recon has an axle to crown length of 569mm while the Yari has 581mm, only 12mm longer but offering 20mm more travel. I have the option to remove a spacer under my handlebars, which would lower them by 10mm, so my standing position would only be 2mm higher. The bike becomes slightly slacker from 66 to ? and the seat angle is 75 and becomes ?. A slacker bike is okay since I want it to be more enduro-like, and I can push the seat a bit further forward to maintain the same effective seat angle.\n\nIs this a good idea then? Will I notice a big difference between 170mm and 150mm even though both are relatively budget choices? I ride a lot of technical trails with roots and rocks like those in the Oslo forest, and since I'm on an eMTB, efficiency is not my top priority.",
            "Hey I got this 2020 polygon cascade 4 and it has a SUNTOUR XCE, 100MM 27.5\" TRAVEL fork. It was my first bike and I'm letting a friend use it for his first bike and I would like to upgrade the fork. I'm thinking 120 travel and air. What would be a good fork  match up for this bike that's under 150? Not sure if there is anything under that bit I have some wiggle room. TIA",

            "I am looking to get a trail bike after riding a hard tail for awhile. I\u2019m not a very experienced trail rider and I don\u2019t know much about suspension bikes but I do understand bikes and component levels otherwise. \n\nThere\u2019s two options standing out to me currently:\n\n1. A 2021 Marin rift zone 2, basically new. Rockshox recon silver 130mm front and deluxe rear 135mm. 12 speed shimano deore. Shimano mt200 brakes.  \n\n2. 2023 Merida one twenty 700. Fox rhythm 34 130mm front and fox something 120mm rear. Shimano 12 speed xt and shimano 4pot brakes (think SLX). \n\nThe Marin is $1700 aud and I can get it right now or the Merida is a few weeks away (which plays into my decision - my stoke is currently high) and is probably $2050. \n\nThe Merida seems better on paper everywhere but I want to ride soon haha. \n\nMy trails are hilly and mostly flow focussed but there is a bike park with rough stuff within driving distance that I\u2019ve never been too because of my current bikes. \n\nAnyone care to help with my dilemma ??",
            "Hey there!\n\ni'm trying to get my dad's old racing/training MTB Stumpy back to life in a little nostalgic hobby project and use it as a kind of everyday city-/commuter bike. I'm pretty sure it's a 2000 model (or earlier?). I've used it myself many years ago as a starting point to get back into the sport. I'm not an experienced bike mechanic but i'd like to learn a bit in the process :).\n\nFor now I'm most concerned about the (i think original) Manitou SX Fork which kinda still does its job (more or less) but has its rubber sealing ring got loose on one side. Because of that there got much dirt into the fork (on the backside of the image).\n\nRegarding possible replacements i'm rather puzzled about the specs i need to consider. I can't find any specialized's manuals for very old stumpjumpers. I found a 2000s Manitou SX Manual (https://www.retrobike.co.uk/gallery2/d/144335-1/2000+sx+om.pdf) and so i think i need a non-tapered fork - but does any 26\" fork with rim-brake mounts do the job?\n\nThanks\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7ndcfjzvk2uc1.jpeg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6abede9e32d45da50abe6b745e6d7fd9255ea801",
