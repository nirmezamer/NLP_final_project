        "content": "Greetings from the r/Danganronpa mod team. \n\nLast Saturday we had a meeting to discuss various matters on the subreddit, this post is the culmination of these changes.\n\n1. Mod Applications: \n\nAfter going through the mod applications as a team we have decided to promote 4 individuals, u/Canadajones68 , u/ElsonCheung, u/Kasc4t, and /u/Parfait_of_Markov . Give a big welcome to the new additions to the mod team!\n\n2. The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy: \n\nAs you all probably know by now, a new game by Kazutaka Kodaka was announced earlier this week. Regarding discussion, we have decided NOT to ban any discussion of it on this subreddit for the time being. This decision will be revisited once the game releases in early 2025 and we are able to come to a better conclusion regarding it and its relevance of Danganronpa. Posts regarding Last Defense Academy still must abide by all other subreddit rules, we also have a subreddit called r/LastDefenseAcademy up and running for anyone that wants to only talk about the game.\n\n3. NSFW rule rewording:\n\nIt has recently come to our attention that the NSFW rule as it stands is incredibly vague and hard to follow, hence why we have decided to make some changes to it, hopefully making it more clear. The new rule is as follows. \n\n1. No Genitals or Female Nipples\n2. No extremely suggestive expressions.\n3. Absolutely no sexualization of the children/loli characters (UDG Children, Hiyoko, Himiko). This does not include swimsuits.\n4. Bunny suits and other similar artwork need to be NSFW tagged.\n5. No decapitations, severed body parts, bodily fluids (minus blood), or organs.\n\nPoints 1-3, 5 will result in an immediate ban if found, while point 4 will result in your post being tagged. These new NSFW rules go into effect immediately, but any posts made before the change will not be affected.\n\n4. Images in Comments:\n\nRecently we have had multiple people asking the mod team about images in comments and if they\u2019ll ever be enabled. The original reasons the mod team chose to not enable them was because they are both hard to enforce and easy to spoiler others with, however, the mod team has changed its stance. We will be running a 2 week trial period for images in comments to see how it goes, and we will make a further decision to either allow them permanently or disallow them afterward. We reserve the right to run back this change if we deem things to be getting out of hand.\n\nThat is all, thank you for your time, the r/Danganronpa mod team.",

            "kyoko better, she was good in dr1 but she was done dirty in dr3 just like everyone else.\n\nMaki is ok but she was annoying and cringy,she looked like a edgy waifu from a bad unpopular anime/isekak with her dialogues but she had development maybe more than kyoko so she is top 4,5 of the characters in drv3 but kyoko solos to me",
            "One issue hampering Makis character development is that its rushed. She begins to fall in with Kaito and Shuichi late into trial 2, compared to Makoto and Kyouko first connecting in the post trial of ch1. An entire chapter of development is thereby lost. Even further, since the other character starring in Makis tsundere arc, Kaito, is set to die in ch5, whereas Kyouko and Makoto both survive. The 2 chapter difference is meaningful; while DR1 can make us wait till ch4 to get Kyoukos first significant moment of vulnerability and clear investment in her friendship with Makoto, Maki has to accomplish the same in a single chapter. Not only that, but even though Makis development has less time, she gets further in the same time period along the scale of emotional development. We already established that Kyouko doesnt seem to be in love with Makoto by the end of DR1; that emotional development between the two continues in DR3. But Makis conversation with Shuichi in ch4 about whether or not he liked Kaede romantically has undertones implying shes beginning to discover her feelings for Kaito.\n\nAnother issue with Makis character development is the degree to which it revolves around Kaito, and how unequal it is. Kaito has plenty of significant relationships outside of Maki; Shuichi and Kokichi are two more major influences on his character, and then even minor influences like Ryoma or Gonta also impact him. However, Maki has two significant relationships, Kokichi and Kaito, with a third minor influence, Shuichi. Ill add though that a lot of the time she spends with Shuichi feels centered around Kaito; their canon interactions generally also involve Kaito or have Kaito as the subject, and they cant even make it through Makis Free Times without mentioning that theyre both Kaitos sidekicks. Its difficult to quantify, but Kyouko doesnt suffer from the same issue. Although she has few significant relationships outside of Makoto, she is clearly and apparently pretty much married to investigating the school, and this is made clear through her early treatment of Makoto where she will disappear without notice and expect to not have to explain herself to Makoto when she gets back. I think her relationship to her father helps with this; it gives her a specific reason to want to get out. Maki doesnt have this; in fact, she has the opposite of a reason to want to get out (the fact she will have to go back to living under the thumb of the Holy Salvation Society). Oh wait, she does find a reason to get out? When? oh in ch5. When everyone finally knows that Kaito is sick.\n\nAnother issue with Makis character is the lack of consequences she deals with. Kyouko faces consequences for her flaws. As I discussed above, talking about how her failure to socialize appropriately is what gets her held responsible for the secrets shes been keeping (the taking of her room key) and then caught in the masterminds trap in ch5.\n\nMeanwhile, Maki doesnt. Im gonna focus this section on her actions in ch5 to minimize bias. Lets be clear: she had no right to go into the hangar that night, and its reasonable in my view to see her as 60% (or more) responsible for the deaths of Kokichi and Kaito. ***She was explicitly told not to go and kill anyone***. She *knew* the rest of the group had a plan to deal with Kokichi! So she attempts murder, and there are more things wrong there that Im not permitting myself to get into for the sake of staying on topic. She then proceeds to go to trial believing shes the blackened who killed Kaito. What does she do? She attempts to sacrifice every last spotless students life (including her own) to double down even harder and attempt to get Kokichi killed. After all of that, and her dragging the trial out by refusing to admit to any of her involvement in the case, the victim portrays her as a victim. Oh, the poor ice queen, who defrosted and learned what it meant to love someone, only for that love to get used to crush her further and throw her into despair. She doesnt offer so much as an apology to the other kids whose lives she saw as collateral damage to assassinating Kokichi. Its even said later that Makis actions were instigated by the mastermind, an attempt by the narrative to fully strip her of responsibility.\n\nI reject that. Maki is her own person that we should expect to take responsibility for her own actions. She shouldve apologised, and her betrayal at this late stage thoroughly sours V3-6s friendship gimmick.\n\nI suppose I should find things to compliment about Maki. I think her use of her talent in ch3 to make an autopsy of sorts, is fantastic. I think the new goal she gains as part of that chapter, making her talent something reliable about her instead of a cause for suspicion, is a really creative take on an assassin. And I think design wise, Maki is really well suited to the tsundere trope. Her threatening color scheme allows you to take her seriously with ease, while her girlish design lends to giving her a softer and more emotional side.\n\nAnd lets address Makis weakness as well for the sake of clarity. As an assassin who sees life as something horribly transient, who has a dehumanized perspective on herself what point is there in emotional attachments? Why have standards if you can never stand by them? And does a thing whose existence only brings suffering to others deserve to have emotional attachments or standards? The answer she finds seems to be such: because following your desires and being true to yourself is worth doing, even knowing you will have to endure the consequences. It *is* better to have and to lose than to never have had at all. And we are deserving, because we exist.\n\nAnd thats a lesson I've had to learn to personally take to heart. I dont like talking bad about Maki. Heres why; I really really liked her at the start of V3. Back then, before I ever saw what followed ch2, I liked Maki enough that she was in my top five of all DR characters. Same goes for Kyouko, I loved her for the first three chapters of her game. But both characters eventually went downhill for me, in heavy part due to their tsundere nature, and I could never really quite come back from that. This was a very difficult debate to write for; I didnt even know who Id vote until I finished writing for Kyouko. This actually helped me a lot to think through and bat around - not a lot of characters in DR I havent analyzed to death!",
            "No use in wasting time with worthless prevarications; these queens would themselves prefer to cut to the point.\n\nI want to first establish a baseline. So lets do a deep dive into Kyoukos character development throughout DR1, then well compare Makis character development based on what weve already established.\n\nKirigiri Kyouko is blessed with attention to every minute detail of her story. Before we knew the Ultimate ??? was a student whod forgotten their talent, we had only Kyouko to look to as an example, who simply brushed past the topic to begin with. This isnt to say her talent isnt extremely significant to her; it absolutely is, this, theres no denying. But she simply refuses to talk about it. Instead, she simply charges ahead, relying on her unfriendly demeanor and natural tendency to withhold information to deflect. This is the source of a not insignificant amount of her refusal or inability to connect with others early on, as even in her FTEs, she deflects away from her vulnerability repeatedly.\n\nMaking Kyouko an amnesiac whose associations remain though does create a really interesting situation. Kyouko is capable of perfectly manipulating her own emotions, and displays as much to Makoto during her Free Time Events. She prefers to don a neutral and blunt mask, but is perfectly willing to discard such if it suits her purposes. However, amnesiac Kyouko has no clue what to expect from herself. Why would she have such a strong reaction to the headmasters name? Why does she know what to do during investigations? Because she doesnt know what to expect from herself, she doesnt know what to suppress when presented with a particularly strong stimulus. Her memory loss therefore enhances the strength of her character by naturally creating a setting instigating her vulnerability.\n\nVulnerability; it is something Kyouko avoids at all costs. Its why she relentlessly pushes away Makoto, why she refuses to display her true emotions, why she so relentlessly hunts down the truth behind the game. At the end of the day, covering up her weaknesses means having control to Kyouko, and thats what she wants. It's rooted in a deep seated paranoia and distrust, rooted in the same backstory that left her with those burns on her hands.\n\nThis leads her to directly focus on and attack the killing game itself. And she does so with abandon, to the point that the survivors may never have left the school without her pushing them forward, pushing them for answers, constantly pushing. Her determination is one of her better traits. She leaves no stone unturned and makes use of every tactic within her arsenal to achieve her goal: to uncover her lost memories and the truth behind the killing game.\n\nAnd this is the source of her interactions with Makoto. Kyouko is self-aware; she knows that she is suspicious, and her disposition does not lend itself to be trusted. She uses Makoto as a bridge to communicate effectively with the group and a shield with which to distract and delay Monokumas attacks on her investigations. Otherwise, its more than likely she wouldve never entertained Makotos overtures of friendship.\n\nShe is flawed, too, and the narrative doesnt shy away from this. Yes, you almost never (maybe actually never) Counter her, even when the game calls for it in DR1-5. You are rewarded for trusting her when she has given less than no reason to do so. This however can be chalked up narratively to who our protagonist is; Naegi Makoto, the boy who trusts without reserve. Doubting Kyouko here is framed as falling into despair and abandoning Makotos principles. I have never thought that this was a strong choice. I hate it actually; I cant help but be mad at Kyouko. But a justification, however flimsy it may be, does exist. And her distancing herself from the group and repeatedly refusing to explain herself is reacted to appropriately by other cast members; she is ostracised for it in ch5 and nearly succumbs to Junkos trap.\n\nBy the end of the game, she is still emotionally distant, yes. It cant really be said that she and Makoto have developed romantically. However, theyve developed a lot platonically, as partners relying on each other, and as close friends. Kyouko is slowly but surely more comfortable releasing some information to Makoto; she backslides on this in ch4, but even that is consistent with her character, however frustrating it may be. She loses control of Makoto as he acts outside her expected patterns and discovers something on her own and is unable to accept this until she realises that this is part of his character. Makoto teaching her what it means to rely on a friend again is a very natural progression of her character, as its made very clear to us that Kyouko is incredibly paranoid and wary of the killing game and Monokuma. And furthermore, she works to make it up to Makoto; she delivers an apology, personally digs him out of the trash, and makes herself extremely vulnerable in discussing her entire backstory at length.\n\nWhile Im not well versed in DR3, I would be remiss without mentioning this key DR3 aspect: >!We can further see that experience really impacted her, as the next time she is choosing between risking herself or Makoto she picks Makoto, which is an insanely selfless choice!<\n\nI wont be discussing any of her further appearances, though, since Im not well versed. I think Trigger Happy Havoc stands well enough on its own.\n\nSo, to Harukawa Maki, then. She initially presents herself as a stoic, taciturn Ultimate Child Caregiver. Its undoubtedly strange, especially with how curt and aggressive she frequently is very early on, as well as her refusal to engage with others. She doesnt seem interested in justifying herself, though, and to be fair she does have a somewhat girlish look to her with the long pigtails and fluffy hair ties she dons. Like Kyouko, if Maki doesnt want to talk about something, she wont. This lasts through her lab discovery, where she immediately holes up there and refuses to let anyone in and explain herself. This only lasts till trial, where Kokichi summarily exposes her, and harshly.\n\nI will take this moment to declare what is probably already known. My vote is for ***Kyouko Kirigiri, Hopes Peak Academys Ultimate Detective***. I think the lens of this debate actually perfectly enhances Kyoukos good traits and emphasises Makis flaws. Theyre tsuns, yes. But where its a strength of Kyoukos character (as her guardedness is well justified within the narrative, which makes it all the more meaningful when its slowly let down) it is the damning weakness of Makis. Though her set up holds just as much compelling potential as Kyoukos, following the same tsundere archetype squanders Makis potential.",
            "Hello all, and welcome to the Stoic Girl^tm edition of Scrum Debate! Scrum Debate is a discussion series where users make write-ups arguing for one side of the week's debate, earning points for that side in turn. This totally officially determines what thing is better than the other thing, and will end all internet flame wars following it.\n\nThese two survivor sidekicks share a lot in common- they both have complicated pasts and aren't above making some morally grey choices to achieve what they believe to be the most logically correct path forward. Despite these similarities and their icy-cold demeanors, buried deep under both is an empathetic, emotional core- the ways in which this manifests being different between the two. Who did you prefer?\n\n---\n\n**To participate in this contest,** please comment below with an analytical write-up arguing in favor of either **Kyoko Kirigiri** or **Maki Harukawa**.  It's not necessary, but it's advised to make your writeup comparative, explaining your choice in the debate *relative* to the other.\n\nThe winner will be determined by a three-point system, with the character earning at least 2 out of 3 points winning the week's scrum debate:\n\n1. Whichever character has the most writeups supporting them will earn a point.\n\n2. Whichever character is supported by the highest-upvoted writeup will earn a point.\n\n3. Whichever character has the most cumulative upvotes between all writeups arguing in their favor will earn a point. **Upvotes on constructive, analytical replies that argue for one side will also earn points towards this metric.**\n\n---\n\n# RULES - READ BEFORE POSTING OR YOUR COMMENT MAY BE REMOVED:\n\nScrum Debate is **not** a popularity contest, it's a writing competition. The comment section below is explicitly for thoughtful character analysis. If you want examples or inspiration, check [past scrums](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WG1WDMRmv45EqFBidxZ2Rwdqp4TfLPEtzhxhGvv3u-Q/edit#gid=0) and the old [character discussion threads.](https://www.reddit.com/r/danganronpa/comments/4ceg1m/character_discussion_masterlist_all_spoilers/) \n\n\n- Low-effort comments which do not make a serious attempt at analysis will not count in the final tally. \n\n- Zero-effort comments, like stating the character you're voting for with no elaboration, will be removed. \n\n- Comments that only argue *against* one side will not earn any points. \n\n- Meta comments, such as \"this is a rough match-up for [character]\", should be done in the replies to this pinned message.\n\n- Replies to other comments don't need to follow these rules, just be civil.\n\n---\n\nThis thread will run for **~8 days** from the time of this post before a winner is decided. Afterwards, a post commemorating the winner's victory will be pinned for ~6 days, before we move to the next debate.\n\nIf you'd like to look at upcoming scrums to prepare in advance, or to see the victors of prior scrums, check out the [**schedule.**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WG1WDMRmv45EqFBidxZ2Rwdqp4TfLPEtzhxhGvv3u-Q/edit#gid=0)"
