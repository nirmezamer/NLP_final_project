        "content": "Greetings from the r/Danganronpa mod team. \n\nLast Saturday we had a meeting to discuss various matters on the subreddit, this post is the culmination of these changes.\n\n1. Mod Applications: \n\nAfter going through the mod applications as a team we have decided to promote 4 individuals, u/Canadajones68 , u/ElsonCheung, u/Kasc4t, and /u/Parfait_of_Markov . Give a big welcome to the new additions to the mod team!\n\n2. The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy: \n\nAs you all probably know by now, a new game by Kazutaka Kodaka was announced earlier this week. Regarding discussion, we have decided NOT to ban any discussion of it on this subreddit for the time being. This decision will be revisited once the game releases in early 2025 and we are able to come to a better conclusion regarding it and its relevance of Danganronpa. Posts regarding Last Defense Academy still must abide by all other subreddit rules, we also have a subreddit called r/LastDefenseAcademy up and running for anyone that wants to only talk about the game.\n\n3. NSFW rule rewording:\n\nIt has recently come to our attention that the NSFW rule as it stands is incredibly vague and hard to follow, hence why we have decided to make some changes to it, hopefully making it more clear. The new rule is as follows. \n\n1. No Genitals or Female Nipples\n2. No extremely suggestive expressions.\n3. Absolutely no sexualization of the children/loli characters (UDG Children, Hiyoko, Himiko). This does not include swimsuits.\n4. Bunny suits and other similar artwork need to be NSFW tagged.\n5. No decapitations, severed body parts, bodily fluids (minus blood), or organs.\n\nPoints 1-3, 5 will result in an immediate ban if found, while point 4 will result in your post being tagged. These new NSFW rules go into effect immediately, but any posts made before the change will not be affected.\n\n4. Images in Comments:\n\nRecently we have had multiple people asking the mod team about images in comments and if they\u2019ll ever be enabled. The original reasons the mod team chose to not enable them was because they are both hard to enforce and easy to spoiler others with, however, the mod team has changed its stance. We will be running a 2 week trial period for images in comments to see how it goes, and we will make a further decision to either allow them permanently or disallow them afterward. We reserve the right to run back this change if we deem things to be getting out of hand.\n\nThat is all, thank you for your time, the r/Danganronpa mod team.",

            "Hello all, and welcome to the Stoic Girl^tm edition of Scrum Debate! Scrum Debate is a discussion series where users make write-ups arguing for one side of the week's debate, earning points for that side in turn. This totally officially determines what thing is better than the other thing, and will end all internet flame wars following it.\n\nThese two survivor sidekicks share a lot in common- they both have complicated pasts and aren't above making some morally grey choices to achieve what they believe to be the most logically correct path forward. Despite these similarities and their icy-cold demeanors, buried deep under both is an empathetic, emotional core- the ways in which this manifests being different between the two. Who did you prefer?\n\n---\n\n**To participate in this contest,** please comment below with an analytical write-up arguing in favor of either **Kyoko Kirigiri** or **Maki Harukawa**.  It's not necessary, but it's advised to make your writeup comparative, explaining your choice in the debate *relative* to the other.\n\nThe winner will be determined by a three-point system, with the character earning at least 2 out of 3 points winning the week's scrum debate:\n\n1. Whichever character has the most writeups supporting them will earn a point.\n\n2. Whichever character is supported by the highest-upvoted writeup will earn a point.\n\n3. Whichever character has the most cumulative upvotes between all writeups arguing in their favor will earn a point. **Upvotes on constructive, analytical replies that argue for one side will also earn points towards this metric.**\n\n---\n\n# RULES - READ BEFORE POSTING OR YOUR COMMENT MAY BE REMOVED:\n\nScrum Debate is **not** a popularity contest, it's a writing competition. The comment section below is explicitly for thoughtful character analysis. If you want examples or inspiration, check [past scrums](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WG1WDMRmv45EqFBidxZ2Rwdqp4TfLPEtzhxhGvv3u-Q/edit#gid=0) and the old [character discussion threads.](https://www.reddit.com/r/danganronpa/comments/4ceg1m/character_discussion_masterlist_all_spoilers/) \n\n\n- Low-effort comments which do not make a serious attempt at analysis will not count in the final tally. \n\n- Zero-effort comments, like stating the character you're voting for with no elaboration, will be removed. \n\n- Comments that only argue *against* one side will not earn any points. \n\n- Meta comments, such as \"this is a rough match-up for [character]\", should be done in the replies to this pinned message.\n\n- Replies to other comments don't need to follow these rules, just be civil.\n\n---\n\nThis thread will run for **~8 days** from the time of this post before a winner is decided. Afterwards, a post commemorating the winner's victory will be pinned for ~6 days, before we move to the next debate.\n\nIf you'd like to look at upcoming scrums to prepare in advance, or to see the victors of prior scrums, check out the [**schedule.**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WG1WDMRmv45EqFBidxZ2Rwdqp4TfLPEtzhxhGvv3u-Q/edit#gid=0)",
            "kyoko better, she was good in dr1 but she was done dirty in dr3 just like everyone else.\n\nMaki is ok but she was annoying and cringy,she looked like a edgy waifu from a bad unpopular anime/isekak with her dialogues but she had development maybe more than kyoko so she is top 4,5 of the characters in drv3 but kyoko solos to me"
