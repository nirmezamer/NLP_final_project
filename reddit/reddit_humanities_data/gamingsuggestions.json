        "content": "[Here](https://www.mythicmap.com) is the website.\n\nObservation: I have asked for permission to make this post.\n\nMythic Map is a website that suggests games based on similarity.\nMy goal is to help people find meaningful game suggestions while increasing the visibility of the great games out there.\n\n~~Currently it only supports Steam games. This will change in the future (probably).~~\n\nEdit (02/08/2023): Things have been sorted out and from now on I will be adding non-Steam games -hopefully- daily. Some switch games are in there now, like Zeldas and Pokemons.\n\nIt also checks daily for what is currently on sale on steam (some sales might be missing \\- if I check at 8AM and a sale spawns at 4PM, the website will only be aware of the new sale the next day). I might try adding other sales sources in the future.\n\nAlso, some suggestions might be a little strange, but keep in mind that different players might be looking for different traits in games, so I have to cast a broad net. An example is Skyrim, where a good portion of the suggestions are not open world RPGs, but instead are games that have a big modding/user created content community. \nStill, if you feel a game is missing or is completely out of place, do not hesitate to tell me about it \\- you can send me an email at [mythicmap.dev@gmail.com](mailto:mythicmap.dev@gmail.com) or maybe post about it in the comments.\n\nEdit (05/07/2023): After a couple of months, I have finally implemented most the fixes/features suggested in the comments! The new version might have some bugs or issues, so if you find any, please tell me about it. Same goes for features.\nMeanwhile, I'll keep working on some ideas I have for the website.\n\nEdit (09/14/2023): I thought it would be cool to find games based on other types of entertainment. My tests were done on anime and they ended up being serviceable, but I'm not very happy with the cross-category suggestions and it might take a while until I figure it out, but when I'm done, Mythic Map will start suggesting things based on movies, series and maybe books.\n\nHope it helps!",

        "content": "Welcome to the Hidden Gem thread - Im a big fan of indie games, and always look for under-reviewed games that deserve a second life. This table is all automated based on the list of games I maintain, so let me know if theres more info that would be good to see in it.\n\nUnfortunately, as I found out, something broke between the summer sale and today, so it didn't properly pull out the New games from the list - Hence the delay. I set up the New Game Table manually, so none of the fancy prices, review percentage, or things go with it right now, but I'll update it once I fix the pipeline that gets the data from my database\n\n It now features a neat Table that can be filtered and sorted in all sorts of ways to help with discoverability (since markdown tables are not good for that). [You can find the table here](https://ncdb.prosperitea.net/dashboard/#/nc/view/e7c1fbae-6048-456a-9a2e-8652ba9ffe03)\n\n---\n\n**Big News though** - In the future, this thread will morph into a website of it's own. Ive been building a 'hidden gem discoverability platform' that will let you slice and dice the entire steam catalog by a ton of attributes, including the number of reviews, release dates, steam deck compatibility, genre tags, and more. Its a tool I started to help me find games for this list, so I figured with some polish, I could throw it up for anyone else to use.\n\nI was hoping to launch it today, but the UX is still a WIP. Just be on the watch for it soon ;)\n\n---\n\n**TL:DR** - Out of the 100 games on the Master List there are:\n\n- 3 new games on the list\n\n- 86 on sale\n\n- 64 games over 50% off\n\n- 51 games with a review score of 90% or Higher\n\n- 11 games with Overwhelmingly Positive Reviews\n\n- 7 early access games \n\n- 30 Steam Deck Verified games \n\n- 13 games have demos\n\n\n---\n\n** New Games**\n\n---\n\n\n\nName | Description | Genre | Link\n----|-----------|-----|----\nIslets | I honestly thought I had this on the list since it launched, but Islets is a short (~8 hours) cozy metroidvania that doesn't overstay its welcome.
