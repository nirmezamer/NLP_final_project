        "content": "[Here](https://www.mythicmap.com) is the website.\n\nObservation: I have asked for permission to make this post.\n\nMythic Map is a website that suggests games based on similarity.\nMy goal is to help people find meaningful game suggestions while increasing the visibility of the great games out there.\n\n~~Currently it only supports Steam games. This will change in the future (probably).~~\n\nEdit (02/08/2023): Things have been sorted out and from now on I will be adding non-Steam games -hopefully- daily. Some switch games are in there now, like Zeldas and Pokemons.\n\nIt also checks daily for what is currently on sale on steam (some sales might be missing \\- if I check at 8AM and a sale spawns at 4PM, the website will only be aware of the new sale the next day). I might try adding other sales sources in the future.\n\nAlso, some suggestions might be a little strange, but keep in mind that different players might be looking for different traits in games, so I have to cast a broad net. An example is Skyrim, where a good portion of the suggestions are not open world RPGs, but instead are games that have a big modding/user created content community. \nStill, if you feel a game is missing or is completely out of place, do not hesitate to tell me about it \\- you can send me an email at [mythicmap.dev@gmail.com](mailto:mythicmap.dev@gmail.com) or maybe post about it in the comments.\n\nEdit (05/07/2023): After a couple of months, I have finally implemented most the fixes/features suggested in the comments! The new version might have some bugs or issues, so if you find any, please tell me about it. Same goes for features.\nMeanwhile, I'll keep working on some ideas I have for the website.\n\nEdit (09/14/2023): I thought it would be cool to find games based on other types of entertainment. My tests were done on anime and they ended up being serviceable, but I'm not very happy with the cross-category suggestions and it might take a while until I figure it out, but when I'm done, Mythic Map will start suggesting things based on movies, series and maybe books.\n\nHope it helps!",

            "Observation: your count of steam review is odd\n\nE.g. for Hegemony III: Clash of the Ancients your site says that it is \"80% POSITIVE REVIEWS OUT OF 366\". 80% is correct but 366 is not. Total number of steam reviews is 441, all reviews incl. third parties is 479 and all positive only is 388. So the 366 you give may be only the positive reviews from buyers on steam instead of all reviews (negative + positive)?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nObservation: some games come up twice\n\nE.g. when I've searched for Hegemony 3 the game Total War Shogun 2 comes up twice with identical entries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nObservation 3: it's not possible to sort by review score\n\nMaybe just add this sort option or even better create a rating like steamdb that factors in both the steam user rating and the number of reviews\n\n&#x200B;\n\nObservation 4 - \"similar\" games not neccessarily very similar at all?\n\nI searched Europa Universalis 4 and the most similar game (ranked by popularity) according to you is Risk of Rain 2, which is... a completely different genre!? I don't know your algorithm but it seems to need a touch here and there."

        "content": "Welcome to the Hidden Gem thread - Im a big fan of indie games, and always look for under-reviewed games that deserve a second life. This table is all automated based on the list of games I maintain, so let me know if theres more info that would be good to see in it.\n\nUnfortunately, as I found out, something broke between the summer sale and today, so it didn't properly pull out the New games from the list - Hence the delay. I set up the New Game Table manually, so none of the fancy prices, review percentage, or things go with it right now, but I'll update it once I fix the pipeline that gets the data from my database\n\n It now features a neat Table that can be filtered and sorted in all sorts of ways to help with discoverability (since markdown tables are not good for that). [You can find the table here](https://ncdb.prosperitea.net/dashboard/#/nc/view/e7c1fbae-6048-456a-9a2e-8652ba9ffe03)\n\n---\n\n**Big News though** - In the future, this thread will morph into a website of it's own. Ive been building a 'hidden gem discoverability platform' that will let you slice and dice the entire steam catalog by a ton of attributes, including the number of reviews, release dates, steam deck compatibility, genre tags, and more. Its a tool I started to help me find games for this list, so I figured with some polish, I could throw it up for anyone else to use.\n\nI was hoping to launch it today, but the UX is still a WIP. Just be on the watch for it soon ;)\n\n---\n\n**TL:DR** - Out of the 100 games on the Master List there are:\n\n- 3 new games on the list\n\n- 86 on sale\n\n- 64 games over 50% off\n\n- 51 games with a review score of 90% or Higher\n\n- 11 games with Overwhelmingly Positive Reviews\n\n- 7 early access games \n\n- 30 Steam Deck Verified games \n\n- 13 games have demos\n\n\n---\n\n** New Games**\n\n---\n\n\n\nName | Description | Genre | Link\n----|-----------|-----|----\nIslets | I honestly thought I had this on the list since it launched, but Islets is a short (~8 hours) cozy metroidvania that doesn't overstay its welcome.

It's a metroidvania-katamari-darksouls mix (with a heavy dose of Getting Over it) where you'll have to reshape yourself constantly to try and make your way up a vertical world. There are checkpoints (unlike GOI), and the metroidvania-like growth actually works super well with the \"fall back down through the world\" element, since it allows you to gather powerups/collectibles that you couldn't the first time through. A sort of \"accidental backtracking\". It's got programmer art and sound, but is very much still worth playing IMO. \n\nIt left the biggest impression on me of any indie game I played this year.",

            "Shadows of Doubt is a great immersive sim that doesn't get talked about enough.\n\nIt's a full blown noir detective game in a procedurally generated city oozing with atmosphere and charm. \n\nThe main gameplay loop is investigating murders and trying to put the killer behind bars before they have a chance to kill again. \n\nBetween murders you can take on all sorts of odd jobs to get some extra cash that you can spend on tools, upgrades, food, even renting/decorating apartments.\n\nIt's a good game.",
            "Il name some of the only games that pulled me in, in order of best. All of the following, do not look up spoilers, unless you're absolutely 100% stuck.\n\n1) project zomboid. (Main thing about this game is have patience in the beginning and learn as much as you can. One of the best zombie simulators ever made.\n\n2)subnautica. Go in blind. Enjoy the shallows and embrace the deep.\n\n3)grounded. The crafting system will keep your adhd busy. This game is a breath if fresh air.\n\n4)satisfactory and/or factorio. Satisfying is satisfactory. The atomization will scratch itches you didn't know needed scratching. I havent played favorio but it's a top down view instead of 3rd person and many say it's superiority addictiveness.\n\n5)valheim. Amazing survival game where immersion is done beautifully. The food system is excellent, each biome is unique and thrilling..\n\nI realized all of these are survival games for the most part. But they are all amazing picks to dive into (I got to the point where a)moved and got shitty internet so all these games I played offline and b)everyy game I was playing I got bored with. These games made me realize how beautiful and amazing games can be. \n\nBest of luck on your search! Summer sale incoming on steam!!!",

            "Id suggest immersive sims like deus ex, prey etc. \nPerosnally the only games i ever got immersed in were the citadel, F.E.A.R, trepang2, S.W.A.T 4, fallen aces (really recent game but i love the atmosphere and story, basically i like to have a reason for doing what im doing), mirrors edge, mgs V, prey, dying light, cyberpunk, deus ex. \n\nMost of these games are pretty personal preference i guess and you might not like them. The citadel has amazing atmosphere and gameplay fitting it along with a pretty scarse story leaving it to your imagination, F.E.A.R is simillar to the citadel but with a more coherent story, trepang2 is basically a spiritual succesor to F.E.A.R, S.W.A.T 4 has amazing atmosphere, fallen aces is a mix of im sim and boomer shooter and it works great tho i think the emotional factor might not be for you, mirrors edge again atmosphere and some parts can get pretty emotional, mgsV is just masterclass. Everything from cinematography, lighting, gameplay, sound design is perfect for immersion. I would recommend to play all games tho personally mgsV can hold up on its own as someone who begun with it. Prey has amazing atmosphere and is overall very immersive, dying light has gameplay, atmosphere, emotional moments so it should be to your liking.\n\nThese explanations might not make sense but im not sure how to explain it. Also as i said its personal. I can see most of these not fitting you. Some games will just click some wont. Personally i hardly find cyberpunk immersive. If you find any of those games interesting let me know so i can try doing a better job at summing them up lol i have some more recommendations but i feel like they are hard to recommend.",
