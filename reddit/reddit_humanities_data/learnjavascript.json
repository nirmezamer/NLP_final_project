            "reactions to that book are very mixed\n\nsome people love the crafty ways it shows them to do things\n\nother people (myself included) find the approaches unnecessarily overcomplex, and counterproductive\n\nif you read it, you can accept it or reject it as you see fit.  if you don't, you'll just be left to wonder.  didn't cost you any money.  might as well\n\nbut i'm less enthusiastic about that book than a lot of people seem to be",
            "If you're knowledgeable enough to build an app in React, you probably don't need that book.",
            "No, you should not read it. Not when it got out and not now.\n\nShould you still go ahead and read it, you will notice it\u2019s not the JavaScript you say you are good with, but is a Java thing written with JavaScript syntax.\n\nWhat I mean with the above is that Eloquent JavaScript does not use idiomatic JavaScript and especially not of the kind you are used in React (presumably you were using functional components)",
            "Thank you, OP. I just searched for it and started reading. I like it so far\u2014currently at the very first chapter on values, types, and operations. If the rest of the book is like this, I think I would recommend it as an interesting read. It reads very well too. Since you\u2019re proficient enough with JS, think you can easily skim through it, I think you\u2019ll enjoy it.\n\nEdit: I intended to comment to OP",
            "i feel like there's could some fundamentals i may have miss, or it's good to review the basics",

            "Try some other book, like You Don\u2019t Know JavaScript or it\u2019s second version You Don\u2019t Know JavaScript (yet) if you really want to learn some fundamentals you have missed.\n\nI mean, even watching a 15 year old video of Douglas Crockford might teach you some fundamentals of JS we most likely have forgotten today",
            "No, it treats JavaScript like it needs the same workarounds you need in Java. \n\nThink about some aspect of Java like functions not being first order or not having language syntax for getters and setters.\n\nIn Java you would always create an object to keep a function you need or invent/use convention of methods with names starting in get/set\u2026\n\nYou don\u2019t need the above in JavaScript.\n\nSo, have you seen the singleton pattern in Java? Do you think you need that one in JavaScript?\n\nIn JS, this is a singleton:\n\n    const SINGLETON = {}; // at the global level\n\nNow, do you think someone using `class` keyword and `getInstance()` function in it for singleton is writing idiomatic JavaScript?"
