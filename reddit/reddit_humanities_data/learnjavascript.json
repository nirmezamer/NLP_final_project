            "Since you have the book already, what would be the cost of flipping a few pages of it and see if you find interest in it?\n\nBesides, you wrote what you can do with JavaScript, but not really what you are looking for. If you want to be more proficient at React / Next, I don't think the book will teach you that. Maybe you could find some explanations on the inner working of Node.js that has been abstracted away by Next.js...",

If the rest of the book is like this, I think I would recommend it as an interesting read. It reads very well too. Since you\u2019re proficient enough with JS, think you can easily skim through it, I think you\u2019ll enjoy it.\n\nEdit: I intended to comment to OP",
