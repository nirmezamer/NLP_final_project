            "ive never been sexually active but plan to this year (long distance lol) im visiting my doctor soon, is it strange of me to ask for a vaginal checkup? ive always been very insecure of my smell and hygiene. how should I bring up to my doctor that I want to get a checkup on my vaginal health because of the intentions to become sexually active? never been a topic for me to discuss with my doctor so im shy and want to know the quickest and bluntest way to mention it that gets the point aacross without me having to explain it multiple ways!",
            "To start, your smell and hygiene are probably fine. As long as you're not itchy or in pain, and nothing foul smelling (like, you can smell it through your clothes) or oddly colored is coming out of you, you're probably okay. \n\nThe easiest way to do this without too much awkwardness would be to ask when you should start seeing a gynecologist. Assuming you're an adult (I'm also assuming you're in the US), the answer will probably be, \"Now's a good time to start,\" and they'll give you a referral. You technically don't need a referral to have a \"well woman visit\" (like a physical, but just for your reproductive parts), but it might be easier for you to get an appointment that way. \n\nOnce you get to the gynecologist, they'll take the lead. You tell them it's your first ever gynecological appointment, and they'll walk you through what normally happens and ask if you have any questions, which is when you would mention your plans.",
            "thanks, you\u2019re correct assuming im an adult and in the US. I forgot that asking about a gyncologist is a good first step since im also at the age where pap smears are starting to become a health concern! it might not be that awkward afterall given I am likely due for that, she might even bring it up first.\nThanks for the advice, I appreciate it! I dont think I have anything to worry about regarding discharge and smell in this case :)"

Hentai isn't bad anatomy, it's just porn some dude likes jerking off to.
