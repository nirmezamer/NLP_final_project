Check out our [list of removed topics here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/wiki/removed_topics)\n\n* **\n\n\n# Game updates\n* **What was in the last update?**  \n  See release notes [for PC](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Version_History), [for consoles](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Console_Version_History), and [for mobile](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Mobile_Version_History).\n\n   See also a table of [which version and features each platform has](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Stardew_Valley#Current_versions).\n\n* **Are future releases planned?**  \nStardew Valley 1.5 was released on PC in late December 2020 and console in February 2021. Android/iOS received the 1.5 update in early January 2023. Stardew Valley 1.6 released on 19 March 2024 on PC. [Console release to follow ASAP](https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1762192764899627457).\n\n* **Does every platform get the same content/updates?**  \n  Mostly yes. Updates are developed for Linux/Mac/Windows first, then ported to other platforms. There are customizations for each platform (like tap to move on mobile), but otherwise content is identical across all platforms. See also a table of [which version and features each platform has](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Stardew_Valley#Current_versions).\n\n  The exceptions are PS Vita (which won't get any further content updates [due to platform limitations](https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1232797409010278400)), and Android/iOS (which will continue getting all updates, but [don't support multiplayer](https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1262068497086967808) or Chinese translations).\n\n* **Is Stardew Valley on XBox GamePass?**\n\n     Stardew Valley is on XBox GamePass as of December 2, 2021. See [here](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/12/01/coming-soon-xbox-game-pass-december-2021/) for details.\n\n# Multiplayer\n* **How does multiplayer work?**  \n  See [Multiplayer](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Multiplayer) on the wiki.\n\n* **Is crossplay supported?**  \n   All PC players can play together, whether they're on Linux/Mac/Windows or GOG/Steam. [Console crossplay isn't supported](https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1036993838613651459), and mobile versions don't have multiplayer.\n\n* **Is split-screen supported?**  \n  Yep, split-screen was added on PC and console in Stardew Valley 1.5.\n\n* **Will Android/iOS get multiplayer?**  \n  There are [no current plans for multiplayer on mobile](https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1262068497086967808) (including split-screen multiplayer).\n\n* **Will the 1.6 update apply to my current game?**  \n  Yes! New updates always apply to existing saves.\n\n# Other\n* **Can I transfer saves between devices?**  \n   You can [transfer saves](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Saves#Transfer_a_save) between Android, iOS, and PC (Linux/Mac/Windows).\n\n   Consoles unfortunately don't let you access the save files. The Switch version also has a different format that's not compatible with other platforms (the format used by other consoles is unknown).\n\n* **How do I take a screenshot of my full farm?**  \n  See [this guide to taking farm screenshots](https://forums.stardewvalley.net/threads/how-to-share-your-farm-and-use-stardew-planner.152/).\n\n* **If I buy the game on one platform, can I get it for free on a different one?**  \n   If you buy it on PC, you get the Linux + macOS + Windows versions; if you buy it on PS4, you get the PS4 + PS Vita versions. Otherwise each platform is a different edition with separate development, so you'll need to buy it again if you want it on a different platform.\n\n* **Where can I report bugs?**  \n  1. If you use mods, see the [troubleshooting guide](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Player_Guide/Troubleshooting) first.\n  2. If you use mods and the bug disappears when playing without them (by running `Stardew Valley.exe` directly in [your game folder](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Game_folder)), report it to r/SMAPI or see [Modding:Help](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Help).\n  2. If it happens without mods, report it in the official [bug report forum](https://forums.stardewvalley.net/forums/help-bug-reports.12/), which the game developers keep an eye on.\n\n* **How do I use or create mods?**  \n   See the pinned thread in r/SMAPI for more info, and feel free to ask questions in r/SMAPI!",

Does anyone else \"new\" feel completely overwhelmed by completing community centre and getting level 140 at the mines and raising animals and knowing what to buy/cook/sell? \n\nI can't help but feel I'm \"doing it wrong,\" even though I know there's no real time limit and I should enjoy the process.

I\u2019ve noticed a similar pattern where it leaps to the top of the bar at the start and then crazily goes up and down & I lose the fish every single time. I\u2019m so determined to catch it but what on earth is it?! It\u2019s not a puffer or octopus because I\u2019ve catched those",

I talk to people and the general vibe is \"hey you're new, fuck off!\". It also seems that by the time I walk to town, my character needs to sleep, so then it's time to walk home. I see screen shots of elaborate farms and stuff and I don't know how that's possible."
