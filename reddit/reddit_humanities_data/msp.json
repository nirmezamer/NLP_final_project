Eligible TTM revenue is based on CSP transactional revenue, which includes perpetual software, and excludes non-transactional revenue from Claiming Partner of Record (CPOR), Digital Partner of Record (DPOR), and Partner Admin Link (PAL) status. Microsoft will send a series of advance notification emails, starting three months prior to enforcement, to the resellers whose tenants are below the USD1,000 TTM revenue threshold. During this three-month period, the reseller can work with their indirect provider(s) to generate new revenue sufficient to exceed USD1,000 in TTM revenue for that tenant.\"\n\nSee [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/new-indirect-reseller-requirement](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/new-indirect-reseller-requirement) for more information.\n\nMake sure that Microsoft sent you the advanced notification emails, or they are in breach of their own statements.\n\nAlso try this: once you're in the partner center, click on the gear icon on the top right, then click on, \"Account settings\" in the dropdown menu.
