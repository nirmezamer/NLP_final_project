            "im using a samsung a13, when i try to take a photo no matter what i try one side (usually the right side) is blurry and unfocussed, this is extremely annoying when trying to photograph large objects with alot of details. any ideas on how to fix this?",
            "Hey, i just bought a used Canon 55-250mm STM for like 110$, I did make sure that everything was okay with the lens. It looks like new, no scratches, the zoom feels smooth, no fungus, focus on point. But it seems like something is wrong with the Manual Focus function. I tested it both before, the AF and the MF and they were fine, but, when I got home and tested it with my camera, an old Canon Rebel T6, the Manual Focus didn't work ok. I tested many times and I thought it wasn't working because my battery was low, and then I changed it and it was working again. Then I thought ok, problem solved, but it didn't work again and it seems like I had to change to the LCD Screen to make it work and go back to the EVF. Is this a common behavior? is it something with my camera? is it fixable? or something with the lens is not ok and that's why it was kind of cheap. Or maybe I'm doing something wrong. I also tried the other ones I have. I bought them new, the Canon 50mm 1.8 STM and 24mm 2.8 STM, but they work fine, also I noticed the focus ring doesn't make any sound in the 55-250mm STM like the other ones I don't know if that is okay, because when I tested it in the store it was focusing and didn't noticed the sound of the focus ring. I don't use the MF too much but I want to know if this is something fixable or I just have to return it.",
            "My camera (Canon powershot elph 330 hs) has started taking and exporting every photo in portrait mode, even if it was taken horizontally . Does anyone know why and if I can fix it?

This means it\u2019s a perfect opportunity for anyone who didn\u2019t join us from the beginning to get caught up. There will be no new lessons until September, so you\u2019ll have the next three months to go through the course at your own pace and be ready for new lessons after the break. \n\nYou can find the whole course in order and trackable on [The Focal Point Hub](https://www.thefocalpointhub.com/class-2024). The individual lessons are also on the sub (r/photoclass), but the site does a good job of keeping it organized for you and marking off what you've completed. The discord server is also a good way to connect with other participants, and see how others approached previous lessons. Don\u2019t be shy to join in there, as well. [Here\u2019s an invite link](https://discord.gg/focal-point-with-c-london-785447750447267860).\n\n[Check here for full information on how the class works](https://www.thefocalpointhub.com/photo-class).

My grandpa (an actual photographer) just gifted me his old camera, a canon eos M50 and the lens is the one that came with the camera (pretty sure). it's really big and i need to make my camera portable for casual shooting. Can you guys give me some suggestions for a compact decent lens that is really cheap, like less than 100 and im pushing it (cause as i said i just got my first camera and i don't care that much about quality, plus i actually enjoy a vintage look) that is compatible with my camera?

I dont even know what that means, does it mean send them my Lightroom  link or something?",
            "I have enjoyed learning photography on my Nikon D50. Some of my photos have even been posted on my national parks official page!:D But my camera has a zoom lens(Nikon DX AF-S NIKKOR 55-300mm).   Ive kind of learned everything so far using this lens and its worked fine for what Ive needed so far.   Recently ive been doing a lot of urban exploration in places where I may need to climb or need to run as light as I can. I also plan to photograph things a lot closer to me or just wider shots of rooms or something in general. This lens is bulky and ill be photographing in sometimes cramped spaces. So im looking for light, not so much zoom, and good at taking photos in no or low light.   I know I sound like a mega noob(i am) but I have researched some lenses and Im honestly more lost than anything, I cant really afford to make the wrong choice especially because I plan to buy second hand.",
            "good question! My advice would be to read through the lessons, and note the assignments. Don't feel like you have to do them all if you don't have the time. There's 12ish weeks until we start up again, and 22 lessons. They're written to be one a week, but that obviously is not feasible. That said, some of the lessons are less time-intensive than others. Focus on what you think will benefit you the most.",

He wouldnt upload one of his 30 minute long, multi cam, staged set videos completely unedited and in a log format. He would say its unfinished and not representing his brand or quality. He hires editors that will do that for them in a style he wants. \n\nIf he hires a photographer to give him raws then thats great for him, but to discredit others when that work goes out and represent them sucks.

You hire a photographer, not just their camera - unless specifically agreed upon. You don't order in a restaurant then ask to cook your steak yourself. I'd consider giving a client the RAWs if they ask but they could also assume you're handing over exclusive copyright and now you can't use them for your own portfolio without potential hassle. This and they'll probably post suboptimal amateur edits online which isn't very good exposure for you as the creator."
