What can I chose ?\n\n[Gear](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/?f=flair_name%3A%22Gear%22)\n\nI'm planning to return to photography after more than a decade of using only my cellphone. I'm particularly frustrated with my travel photos and want to invest in a mirrorless camera. My last camera was an old Nikon D5200.

To start, I'm looking for one or two versatile lenses.\n\nWhy Fuji? I've heard good things about the brand, especially the quality of their images. Most importantly, I appreciate that I can use the JPEG files directly with Fuji's film simulations, as I'd prefer to avoid spending hours editing RAW files. However, choosing a camera from the second-hand market is challenging. I don't have a specific budget, but I'm aiming for a \"good deal\"\u2014let's say around $1500 for the camera and one travel lens.\n\nHere's what I've found so far:\n\n* The XT3 is the least expensive, available for around $500-600 in my area. I'm concerned about it becoming outdated, though.\n* The XS10 and XT4 are available for around $700.\n* The XS20, which seems great with its new film simulations, is around $1000.\n\nI'm unsure if I need weather sealing or in-body stabilization since I won't be recording videos. With these prices being quite close, it's difficult to decide which deal is the best. Should I consider another brand or perhaps a good bridge camera instead?\n\nSorry, this post has been removFuji ?

            "Just a general opinion ask. I\u2019ve been using a Nikon D80 for a bit now. I\u2019ll be looking to upgrade sometime in the next year. Naturally I looked at Nikon but I realized the mount type is different on the mirrorless camera so it would be a whole setup overhaul in theory (body and two lenses). With that, for just nature and bird photography, what brands and cameras have you enjoyed? Assuming Mirrorless is the proper change now.  I\u2019d looked to find it used so any expertise on when to shop would also be great!",

I know that the body is great for a beginner to learn on and get started and I don't want to just tell him to go out and upgrade right away.\n\n He also has the Google pixel 8 takes Amazing photos too. Do you think his Cannon would be worth taking on a trip to Japan in September? Or would you suggest if he's really into it, to upgrade within his budget prior to the trip and take a totally new-to-him camera.",

Can you guys give me some suggestions for a compact decent lens that is really cheap, like less than 100\u20ac and i\u2019m pushing it (cause as i said i just got my first camera and i don't care that much about quality, plus i actually enjoy a vintage look) that is compatible with my camera?

Hate posting reels and posting on a \u201cschedule\u201d. I was really hoping to make decent money off of this - but the economy sucks now and people don\u2019t seem to have extra for photos. \n\nI love photography, and people like my work, but I get imposter syndrome big time, and just get tired of the pressure to keep it all running and perform. The switching my exttrovert side ersonality \u201con\u201d when I\u2019m an introvert is so draining .\n\n Plus my area is so saturated. Someone posted looking for a photographer for tomorrow for a Wedding.. And 75 photographers responded in 1hr. Mind you, the person that posted had already called me and was rude to me on the phone and hung up on me. They had my number for over a week (I was recommended by family friend), and they chose the day before to call me -  So, BAD clients that normally would have no photographers want to work for them, are getting hundreds of people lining up because it\u2019s business. Like, why do I even bother\n\n. I used to at least enjoy taking self portraits when things got slow but I haven\u2019t felt particularly drawn to self portraits lately. Oh, models will message me and want to do collabs and shoots together but then slowly stop responding over time. People show up late for shoots all the time. My people skills aren\u2019t bad either, I\u2019m excitable to work with, positive, typically easygoing and fair. Oh and when people message me and ask my prices and I say \u201c200$ for full session\u201d which is typical for my area, maybe a bit. Lower, I get ghosted. \n\nThinking of just raising my prices to 500$ for an hour and if I get no bookings then at least I don\u2019t have to deal with people lol. \n",

Not specifically about photography, but about perceived obligations.  Because you can do photography without any of these concerns.\n\nI get there sometimes.  I'm in video production as a job, so photography for me is mostly for my enjoyment.  I can usually step away when I need to.  But occupational exposure can be fatiguing. \n\n\nMaybe it's time to take a long break and do other things, rediscover what made you want to pick up a camera in the first place.",

The social media aspect is absolutely tiring. \n\nI tried to run a wildlife video YouTube channel for a good while, nothing super skilled but not bad either. Out for days in the pissing rain sometimes, multiple days spent recording footage and editing only for the YouTube algorithm to give you 200 views and call it a day. Meanwhile, the most vacuous narcisstic bollocks imaginable gets frontpage.\n\nSocial media has destroyed things tbh. 90% of your time needs to be devoted to it and because of that most interactions are disingenuous and fake.\n\nI've since gone back to photography, which is way less stressful than video - but I'm not worrying about any kind outreach or anything. I might just store photos of general life for decades and try and pay for my retirement with photobooks in a few decades.",
            "I'm pretty sure a lot of commercial photographers are feeling the same pressure. The market has changed a lot in the last decade. That's why I never recommend anyone here to pursue a full-time career in photography without years worth of portfolio and a pretty decent client base as a start, or spend time and money studying it in school because it's just not worth it (useless degree). I tell them to treat it like a hobby or side hustle and build up from there. I've seen so many people fail miserably in the last few years, going all-in only to realize it's not as easy or great as they thought.\n\nThat's also why I chose not to pursue photography full-time. I keep it as a secondary income I don't need to rely on. I'm glad I went for a stable primary career in another field instead of diving all-in on photography. Less stress and some nice extra money coming in. Definitely recommended for those under constant stress in this field.\n\nMy DJ/musician friends are in the same boat. You need to be more of an influencer than a good musician/DJ/producer. You can be the best technically, but the ones with a bigger online presence (regardless of skill) are the ones getting booked big-time. So it's not just the art market suffering from this.",

I do some paid stuff and even though it is almost always the same type of images  i take as a hobby, I\u2019m under pressure to deliver and I enjoy it a lot less - it\u2019s much more enjoyable to work under your own steam, at your own pace. \n\nI think you can apply what you are feeling to any line of creative work. \n\nPhotography is also very disposable these days - millions of images coming at you from all different platforms. How much is an individual image worth? How much is somebody willing to pay? That\u2019s the problem. There is definitely money to be made with photography, but paid shoots from other so called influencers seems like a dead end for the most part.\n\nAnd there is no way on earth I\u2019d want to be a photographer influencer. God no. I get the impression within that domain, as you have discovered that people want stuff for free in exchange for \u201cexposure\u201d.  I\u2019m afraid exposure don\u2019t pay my bills.",

            "I am grateful that I don\u2019t have friends and family members that want to take advantage of my photography skills \n\nIn the beginning when I wanted to build a portfolio I reached out and asked my close friend and family if they\u2019d let me photograph them and gave them free photos in exchange for them within a model release \n\nOnce I started charging and doing it as a business I never get asked if I can take photos \n\nStart a business and start charging people. Then your friends and family will likely respect your business and not ask for free work \n\nGood luck",
