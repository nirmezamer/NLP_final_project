            "[FO4] changing sprint sound in power armor while in combat\n\nInspired by the show, I grabbed an mp3 of Titus' \"fk fk fk fk no no no no\" line. If possible I'd like the sound to be activated under the conditions of: being in PA, being in combat, and sprinting. Not sure if this even possible to do such a thing, but it would be the most appropriate for the scenario. I don't want it tied to sprinting in PA out of combat as it wouldn't make sense. \n\nHere's the mp3: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hrmVzh9SdOEofiNQsY1kNFQnJsPI_Feg/view?usp=drive_link",

I've been banging my head against a desk over this for few weeks now, between RL and stuff.\n\nIf the person who chooses to take this up, is also willing to put the 'fusion cores' from [Atom's Judgement | Fallout Wiki | Fandom](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Atom%27s_Judgement) scaled down on the firing end, to act as the attachment that gives Gamma Bursts, I'd be even more grateful. Not holding out on that, but it would be neat.\n\nNot interested in any major damage changes (I like the overpowered base Quad Shotgun as it was released).\n\nThanks to anyone who takes this request up!"
