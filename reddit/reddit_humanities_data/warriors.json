            "When you think about it\u2026\n\nDrafting an all-time whiff in Wiseman and then two years later winning a chip is crazy.\n\nFor Poole to have been as good as he was just when we needed him to be is AMAZING fortune.",
            "It's wild checking out the Clippers Sub, they want all our young players. They're not asking for everyone, they just legitimately like our young guns and feel it would be worth it to surround Kawhi with youth. Feels weird to see after the whole Wiseman nonsense and other picks that didn't pan out, to have been successful with so many as of late, Kuminga/Moody/Podz/TJD. \n\nHopefully we just give them Wiggins/CP3 and picks though.",
            "At this point I'm hoping Clippers fuck themselves and end up with PG leaving for nothing. You're telling me Wiggins, CP3, and probably Moody and a pick ain't enough for ya'll no championship having asses?",
            "If you got your information on Klay from any recent r/nba thread you\u2019d think he\u2019s the biggest diva ever and a locker room cancer. Man this team\u2019s run broke so many people\u2019s brains lmao",
            "idk why people keep dismissing these trade rumors.  you have wiggins being held out, CP3 pushing back his option guarantee date and so much more.  the likes of stein, windy and woj talking about it.\n\nguys, mike is trying right now, whether you like it or not.  \n\nhe's actively going after a second option next to steph",
            "Perhaps this is pent up \u201cBob screwed up and left someone else to clean up the mess\u201d but at one point I recall him essentially saying he didn\u2019t care about the draft because it was all a crapshoot.  With some benefit of hindsight now it really feels like he meant this and perhaps didn\u2019t fund or appropriately outsiuce responsibilities for keeping the good times rolling. His consecutive drafts were:\n\n- 2022: PBJ, Ryan Rollins, Gui Santos \u2014> Gui, the after thought / unable to sell the pick / Leandro Barbosa panic pick is likely the only one who will be in the NBA next year\n\n- 2021: JK and MM \u2014> no complaints from me. Others will wring hands about Franz, Sengun, TM3 being picked later. I just thank god they didn\u2019t take Bouknight over either of these guys. \n\n- 2020: Wiseman, Nico Manion, Justinian Jessup. No need to elaborate here. \n\n- 2019: Jordan Poole, Eric Paschall\n\n- 2018: Jacob Evans (out of league)\n\n- 2017: No pick\n\n- 2016: Damian Jones (career journeyman) \n\n- 2015: Kevin Looney\n\n- 2014: no pick\n\n- 2013: no pick\n\n- 2012: Harrison Barnes, Festus Ezeli, Draymond Green\n\nAfter starting off so strong w 2012 and tremendous value in 2015, it\u2019s shocking how poorly he did from 2016 on. \n\nPoole was a value pick (apparently MDJs guy) that helped win a championship and shortly thereafter became one of the unanimous \u201cworst contracts in the league.\u201d \n\nHe didn\u2019t totally fumble the JK and MM picks but I don\u2019t think anyone is saying they are supreme value for having picks number 7 and 14. \n\nJust feels like pretty blatant incompetence once the dynasty started.",
            "If PG doesn't come here then I'm gonna blame it on the new jerseys",
            "Clippers fans want JK AND 1 or 2 frps for PG, Mdj hangs up immediately.\u00a0",
            "Quinten seems like a Luke Kornet esque big which isn\u2019t bad for a late 2nd rounder",
            "Bruce Brown would be  an interesting target.  Easy to get and is a plus playoff rotation player.  The diff between Wiggins and PG contract fits Brown\u2019a salary."

More if they manage to use Wiggins as the main filler, and either waive CP3 or guarantee him at a smaller amount in some other mid-sized trade.\n\nGotta think there\u2019d be multiple ways to free up space. Can always sacrifice future assets to salary dump (circle back with the Wizards and loosen protections on the 2030 1st?), or you know, don\u2019t pick up Loon\u2019s option in the first place (love Loon, but that\u2019d be some horrendous planning from the FO).\n\nIf the Dubs don\u2019t even offer Klay a MLE type number, then I can\u2019t blame him for being pissed and walking, but I\u2019d be shocked if they weren\u2019t willing to re-sign him for something that low. The non-taxpayer MLE is gonna be something around $12.9M\u2026 if they have the space (very likely do), you gotta think they\u2019d offer a good bit more than that.\n\ne: Looks like a sign and trade may be on the table, that\u2019d make it an easier pill to swallow if not just because it means he\u2019s walking for more than the fucking MLE"
