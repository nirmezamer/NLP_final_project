So when Looney signed this deal originally after we won the title it was classified as likely and has since now been re-classified as unlikely. Just the quirkiness of cap minutiae for ya.",

I'm in my mid 20's now and it hurts to imagine Klay in another jersey. At the end of the day Klay will be remembered the same 20 years from now. A legend. Let him write the end of his story.",
            "Man same. The news that he might go to the Mavs made it feel so real. I cant imagine seeing him in another jersey, or at least I couldnt until now. Now I am imagining it and its a total gut punch. It lowkey feels like getting broken up with, and then seeing your ex with someone else. Hard to handle. I love Klay, he epitomizes what I love about this era of the Warriors. Idk man, this is going to be hard if he leaves.",

            "I still dont believe he's gone.  He's said nothing.  His agent has said nothing.  The owner, GM and coach have said nothing.  The only people who have said anything were journalists.",
            "I don't think anyone does, but he made a mistake and passed on 2/48$  and now is pissed of an angry he's not got the offer he wanted. In the ideal world, he stays, but it's looking unlikely."
