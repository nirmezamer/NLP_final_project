            "I love Castlevania. I'm having trouble deciding between a Belmont inspired character and an Alucard inspired one. The Belmont character would be Oath of Vengeance paladin based. The Alucard would be a Dhampir rogue/fighter/druid. Obviously, a paladin fits and would be very powerful, but the Dhampir dex/charisma adds a lot of interesting utility as well. Any thoughts to help decide between them would be appreciated.",
            "What background would work best for this character. I\u2019m a plasmoid wizard who grew up in a dungeon before eating a wizard and realizing that they wanted to be a wizard too. I was thinking hermit, but the items and feature doesn\u2019t fit well. Any help appreciated!",
            "Outlander might be a good one with a subterranean feel instead of a forest vibe. The wanderer part makes sense as you had to memorize all the dungeon tunnels. You're adept at finding food, but it's only things that grow on the ground - mushrooms/lichens, edible moss or roots, etc.",
            "Shepherd Druid. Reskin as Necromancer but with a Frankenweenie twist. Now you have a minion user with very functional spells and minions. The only downside is minions can slow down combat, so it's up to you to take a moment with your GM to figure out how to streamline things. There's plenty of advice out there on how to not bog down the whole table while retaining the minions master aspect.",
            "Imho the homebrew looks like it was made more with utility in mind rather than combat effectiveness. A Druid's summons' are their bread an butter, here you have a nice complement to an existing kit, but imho you're still relying a lot on your base kit (and extra spells) to carry you.\n\nAt least until level 10 that is, level 10 feature sounds kinda neat. One key thing I'd recommend you negotiate for is magical attacks on all minions summoned through Brood features (starting at Warlock 6), cause that puts you on par with Shep Druid 6 (magical attacks on summons) and Moon Druid 6 (magical attacks in Wild Shape) and imho that's fair given the kind of creatures you'll be facing.",
            "There are quite a few way to make a Belmont, especially since we meet quite a few family members through the serie:\n\n* Paladin always make sense as vampire hunter for their access to radiant damage. Though many Belmont are typically a bit more mundane and often has to rely on brute force and Holy Water to complete the job.\n* Thief Rogue is for me one of the most fitting build for Belmont. The ability to use a variety of items on a bonus action, eventually grab any magic item and use it. Sneak Attack also make whip a much better weapon. They are also fairly mobile which is typically needed in Castlevania game due to being platform games.\n* Ranger can also work nicely, they aren't just beast-hunter after all. Something like a Monster Slayer would make sense on a Belmont.\n* Finally you can't really go wrong with a Battlemaster Fighter for a mundane combattant which want a bag of tricks in its pockets.\n\nFor Alucard, I think the closest thing would be a Swords Bard or Bladesinger Wizard. You get mobility, solid martial capabilities, and quite a few tricks through spellcasting including turning into animal with Polymorph spell or turning into mist with Gaseous Form. I've also seen suggested Creation Bard for the serie Castevania due to his ability to control his sword from afar, you would need some kind of multiclass for the more martial part though.",
            "I recently started out on a westmarches discord. I didn't think I'd like it, since the concept isn't really my cup of tea, but I enjoy text RP so I thought I'd give it a go. One month later - I'm hooked. I want more.\n\n  \nMy problem is - I've always been flavour first, optimization second type of player. And that just doesn't fly in westmarches environment. I need to optimize, otherwise I'm just going to fall behind and be useless and that's not fun. \n\n  \nThen comes my second mistakes - I wanted to make an evil character to join the evil guild, since that's not something you get to do every day in traditional campaigns. So I made a necromancer, because I like the flavour. I soon realised that is beyond sub-optimal for various reasons that are quite specific to the server.\n\n  \nSo now, I want to retrain this essentially 'necromancer' personality character into something else. Considering Divine Soul sorcerer potentially, but really looking for suggestions on something that will actually be... strong. .\\_.",
            "I am definitely considering this! If you wouldn't mind at all, could you have a look at this homebrew that's approved in the server:\n\n[https://www.dndbeyond.com/subclasses/1874247-the-brood](https://www.dndbeyond.com/subclasses/1874247-the-brood)\n\nI am considering this, shepherd's druid and divine soul sorcerer right now, but the problem with the homebrew above is that it hasn't been tested much."

At tier 1 and especially mid tier 2 Id argue that Sorcerers are the most powerful class due to metamagic and this is the most played tiers. \n\nEspecially when you consider they get a lot of their negatives due to low spell selection is negated by newer subclasses. Metamagic destroys action economy by allowing you to cast a cantrip and a leveled spell in one turn with twin spell. \n\nA variant human or custom Lineage could get a Eldritch blast plus agonizing blast combo going at level 5 and quicken spell out a fireball plus use Eldritch blast twice per long rest before running out of metamagic. \n\nThey could also get their dex to 16 or take a hexblade dip to do a quicken booming blade/ gfb combo and get decent damage plus a high leveled spell out in the same turn. Wizard cannot take advantage of the hexblade dip as well due to having int being their primary casting stat.\n\nFor DMs that aren't giving out frequent long rests twin spell on haste (level 5) giving two melee characters in your party a buff equivalent to multiple levels. Or twin spelling polymorph at level 7 which is think might be the most broken thing any character can do at that level rules as intended. Basically giving two PCs a combined 254 temporary hit points and potential dpr buff. \n\nI agree around 5th level spells Wizards are on par with Sorcerers then 6th level spells they are stronger. By then your campaign is probably either over or almost over but a level 17 Wizard is so broken it's not funny.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It sounds obvious, but these are the combos that makes me feel like the most flexible caster.",

You can take silvery barbs that procs voice of authority, you can use bardic inspiration to reposition your allies (glamor), have a good array of control and heal spells, and the hobgoblin gives you a BA help action with some extra benefits.

Then, go in melee and try to separate the damage your team receives equally between everyone, giving them all temp HP back with your inspirations. Cast bless on everyone and make your rogue/sharpshooter/great weapon master friend an extra attaque. Then, help your casters control big enemies with silvery barb, while giving advantage + a free attack to your rogue friend. You can sometimes use warding wind to protect your team when there are a lot of archers, while using your inspirations to speed all your team up, or use hold person to increase the critical chances of your rogue/paladin against a humanoid boss. The rest of the time, just cast toll the dead to point at the target that must die or use the help or dodge action.",
            "Order Cleric 1, Divination Wizard 6, Anything for the rest, mostly spellcaster levels though is best. Take Fey Touched and choose Hunter's Mark as your spell.\n\nEvery round use your reaction, if possible, to both negate an enemy attack and give your ally a reaction attack. Use your bonus action each round to upcast hunter's mark on an ally. This does two things. First it lets them make a reaction attack from Voice of Authority. 2nd it replenishes one of the lower level slots you spent on silvery barbs.\n\nBoth spells don't care about your spellcasting mod. I like to max out con, and put the minimum points into wis and int. With maxed or near maxed con, heavy armor, and a shield you make a decent \"tank\". \n\nFor your action you can't cast leveled spells, and casting hunters mark prevents us from concentrating on anything. Main actions that I find a lot of use from include mold earth, the dodge action, blade ward, and random environmental interaction. Mold earth, when usable, can create both a 5x5x5 trench and a 5x5x5 wall which can be extremely useful to control combat engagements. Just being a hunk of meat in a choke point and dodging or casting blade ward can allow your teammates to dish out the damage from safety. Keep some sort of combat cantrip when there really isn't anything else to do but you'll usually be better off finding something else.\n\nThe rest of your spell book can be full of rituals. 2nd highest stat can be either strength or charisma. Taking warlock 2 is nice for the short rest slots and Eldrich blast, maybe 3 for the improved familiar. Strength will let you add grappling to your repertoire.\n\nBattle master 3 is probably your best non spellcaster dip once you've enough spell slots to not be running out by day's end. When exactly that is depends on your DM. Ambush and Bait and Switch being pretty nice for this sort of build. Archey fighting style + Precision attack and having Dex as your 2nd highest stat to throw nets is an interesting angle also possible."

            "Absolutely, the Bracers are excellent on a Rogue. Essentially gives the Rogue Extra Attack, which is great for ensuring that you'll always get your Sneak Attack off each round. Not to mention, you don't need to find a place to store a dozen knives, or waste time retrieving them.\n\nThe only downside is that you can't use the Bracers to make an opportunity attack, so you'll want to keep one actual dagger on hand.",

If you can be satisfied with some reflavoring, using darts with Sharpshooter will do more damage by a wide margin.\n\nFighter is good because of Battle Master, mostly. The options for your maneuvers are a little more limited for ranged attacks, but they can provide some good, consistent benefits.\n\nRanger is good because it gets plenty of spells that interact with ranged attacks, such as Ensnaring Strike. If you want to play a more complex knife-thrower, this is probably where you want to be.\n\nRogue is good because it only needs to make one attack per round and regularly gets advantage from Hiding, Steady Aim, and the likes. If you want to be extremely consistent with your hits, an Elf Rogue with Elven Accuracy is the play. The knife-throwing assassin is also a time-tested trope, which can be fun.",

You also get magical damage from Kensei.\n\nAs for how?\n\nI'd say start fighter and go Variant Human. Take fighter initiate.

You can also start fighter but then delay extra attack till 6. Then another choice is if you wanna take a 2nd level of fighter for action surge after extra attack or not delaying some monk progression for nice nova rounds and if you take that 2nd level of fighter do you wanna just go 3 for a subclass early?
