            "Druids have a surprising lack of elemental damage spells, so transmuted spell is a good choice! I'd skip twinned b'c you'll only have enough sorcery points for lvl1-2 spells. I normally don't like extended spell, but druids have so many concentration spells it could work out well to extend heals or buffs. Even an aoe might worthwhile if you're powering through a dungeon and clear 2-3 rooms in succession with a two-minute moonbeam. Otherwise subtle spell is always a good option in RP situations or if you might get counterspelled.",

I know I'm gonna take Elemental Adept (Lightning) as well, since between that and transmuting to Thunder, I should be able to max damage against basically any creature in there (unless there's something immune to lightning and resistant/immune to Thunder). War Caster would also be good, although my group is generally inconsistent in how often we remember to call for/make our concentration saves. Aside from those 3 feats, idk what else I'd take",

Now, of course, you must also choose a small race, but that's also part of it. And, in truth, I either like to go for a DEX build, dual wielding scimitars or else doing a STR build and building up to Dual Wield lances.\n\nAnd two of the best beasts to choose are Giant Crab (best AC) or else Giant Badger (burrow speed, and neither the enemy or their spells can target you through dirt), or else any beast with a 50+ movement speed (best for groups with DMs that use varied terrain with things to dart around/behind).\n\nFor giant crab builds, I like to go for halflings, since it's easiest to imagine them going into battle, standing upon their mount while using their oversized toes to grip onto the sides of the shell."

        "content": "I wanted to play a bit of a shady conman in this campaign and my initial idea for this was a Changeling Bard. During session 0 another player was also already set on playing a Bard, so I decided to keep the concept but with a Warlock instead - Archfey patron (mostly for flavour), still going for the typical face skills, while supplementing it with debuffing/control and useful out-of-combat spells, plus all the rituals from Tomelock at level 3 later on. \n \nMy problem: I'm currently at level 2 and don't really get to use half of the stuff I built the character for. Two party faces is one too many, kinda should have seen that one coming. This is totally not the other player's fault, it's just that I'm less assertive and frankly not as good at RP. Plus, at the end of the day a Bard lends itself to this role better than a Warlock. Another player also decided to play a Wizard instead of their initial concept, so my non-combat spell utility is kind of redundant and unnecessary as well. \n\nOh yeah, I did not take EB, which is probably the single biggest mistake in this entire mistake of a build. \ud83d\ude2c So here I am in combat with a single semi-decent spell (Sleep) and not much else. The earliest point at which I could get to at least the EB + Agonizing Blast baseline is level 5 in a couple of months. \n\nSo, my question is: Are there any other ways ways to start \"fixing\" this that don't take 3 more levels? How much more would I screw myself if I decided to just drop the Warlock and multiclass into something else at level 3?\n\nEDIT: Originally forgot to mention this, but I did talk with my DM and he does not want characters to be remade in the middle of the campaign.

Would it be ok if I made those changes?\" Make them understand that you got flustered when \"remaking\" your idea and forgot a couple of things. \n\nYou're level 2 and it doesn't sound like you're in a 'serious' enough campaign that would frown upon a little class restructuring. Shit, ask the whole group next time you guys game. Most people want to make sure that everybody is having as much fun as possible, so if you aren't having any, most people will try to change that.",
            "Assuming that this whole situation isn't a dealbreaker for you, there are options available!\n\n1. Your DM says they're a fan of organic growth, so I'd try and find moments to organically have your character's story fit another class - play their game, so to speak. Now, I don't know your campaign, but there's plenty of options to go from Archfey to something else. Find nature despoiled, or some great tragedy? Swear an oath of the ancients, vowing to preserve nature and goodness. Maybe you could get into a major disagreement with your patron and lose your power, relying more on your rogueish charisma to make do? Or, perhaps, you meet someone else who is interested in the natural world like you, or you start using your fey powers to better your shapeshifting, so you can become a druid. Or, maybe your character starts a religion, with your patron diefied, and you switch to cleric (Nature cleric can actually be pretty good if built smart, as an example, but something like Trickery could easily fit, or even peace if flavored as more of like, a hedonism domain). If you've spoken to your DM, and you take actions in character that would lead you down another path, hopefully they would let you reshuffle once it fits like, the story narrative.\n2. If you still have to play warlock for the foreseeable future, at level 3, pact of the tome would allow you to pick up magic stone. Magic stone is actually a spell I would want anyway in a party with a wizard. Basically, for levels 3 and 4, you would create the stones and throw them. The damage isn't amazing, but it's better than non-warlock cantrip damage because you add your charisma to the damage already. At level 5, you can get agonizing blast and eldritch blast, but magic stone isn't obsolete. If your wizard buddy is willing to do some teamwork, they can pick up the spell \"tiny servant,\" which animates an object for 8 hours, and it animates 3 objects when cast as a 4th level spell later. The tiny servants can actually be told to \"Pick up and throw the stones \\[your warlock pc\\] drops at the last enemy one of us damaged,\" and they'll do so. This gives a nice little boost for damage at the cost of casting a bonus action spell every turn, which an eldritch blasting warlock doesn't mind doing that much.\n3. Alternative warlock option - Sprites! At level 3, take pact of the chain, and gain a sprite familiar. They're already the fey option, so easy thematics there, and there's one part of pact of the chain that doesn't usually see play - the ability to let your familiar attack when you take an attack. This lets you spend your action to have your familiar take a shot with their bow, which deals 1 damage and forces the creature to make a DC 10 con save. On a failed save, the creature is poisoned for 1 minute, with no subsequent saving throws, and if they fail by 5 or more, the target falls unconscious. Now, normally, when a warlock goes for this strategy, they also immediately get investment of the chain master at level 3, and I'd ask if they would allow that, but if not, it's a solid level 5 option - it allows you to have your familiar attack as a bonus action, and it makes it so the poison's DC becomes your spell save DC. Now, is this strategy amazing? Eh? It's really good debuffing and it feels really unique, but the sprite is super fragile, so you need to play smart. Because your sprite uses their reaction to attack, they can spend their action turning invisible every turn, and with a 40ft fly speed, they should always be out of reach of melee attackers, and be near permanently invisible. At level 4, I'd look into getting inspiring leader so they have some temporary hit points, and also ask your bard to learn the Aid spell and buff your familiar instead of you when they cast it. That can give the familiar respectable toughness for, well, a familiar. I'd also take full advantage of the fact that you now have a flying ally with a ranged attack - any combat encounter against foes that don't have ranged attacks, and aren't immune to nonmagical weapons, you can just run away from and have your sprite attack from the air over and over to secure what optimizers call a 'default kill,' a situation where there's no chance the enemies can survive and you win by default. Honestly, I mention it more as an acknowledgement that that is possible, than a serious recommendation - it sounds like your table culture wouldn't smile upon that. At level 5, you will want to learn investment of the chain master, and I'd personally take summon fey - it's a powerful spell that also doesn't take any action to upkeep, and it lasts a full hour so it shouldn't be hard to justify having the fey around for every fight. So, by level 5, that leaves you with your concentration on a powerful damage dealing fairy and a debuffing sprite that's poisoning people left and right. At 7th level, your summon fey will double in power, and you'll finally be able to get eldritch blast and agonizing blast yourself if you'd like. \n4. Next time your PC gets a big cash reward, have them retire. Set up some foreshadowing beforehand, ofc, but something like \"This adventuring stuff, it's lucrative, but too much for me. With this haul, I'll have enough to spend several years drinking the finest wine, and who knows, maybe I can start a family,\" can be enough for a hedonistic character to maybe relax and settle down for a bit. Then, you can bring in someone new. Talk with the DM of course, set up that this would be the natural end-point for this character's story arc if you can.\n\nAlso, until you level up, I assume you have a decent dex, since warlocks only get light armor? I would buy a heavy crossbow and some bolts, and/or some nets. Nets are a niche but powerful option, restraining foes on demand, and a heavy crossbow will be less accurate than a cantrip, but like, better than nothing. If you're not in an environment where you can buy things, see if one of your allies has a spare ranged weapon, or ask your DM if you can spend time during short rests weaving nets. Another option would be throwing oil flasks (or, if you have the spell, having an unseen servant pour oil on enemies) if your wizard is using a fire damage cantrip. 5 bonus damage is about as much damage as a firebolt would do on average, so that's another option to contribute between sleep spells. Hopefully stuff like that can tide you over until level 3.\n\nHope any of this helps!",
            "The DM should be the first person to talk to about this.  Tell them that you\u2019re not sure where you fit in best.     \n     \nAs far as party face goes, you could lean the other way from the bard\u2019s temperment.- Good cop/bad cop.      \n      \nIf you don\u2019t have a pet owner take Pact of the Chain.      \nIf you don\u2019t have a gish in the party, you can fill that role by taking Blade.       \nIf you want a control type vibe ask your dm to let you pick up EB(or wait till you get another cantrip) & Repelling\u2026 Warlocks imo are best at this.      \n       \nSurely you don\u2019t have every single niche filled by everyone else in your party except you.    Be stealthy, be strong, be wise, be book smart, be a friend of nature, the list is near endless\u2026. Find your role. You\u2019ve got this!     \n      \nEdit:   Also, Warlock is possibly the easiest low level multi-class. Switch to a role being unfulfilled with a different class. Fighter, sorcerer, paladin, heck even Barbarian for a hella lot of fun",
            "If your set on fixing it we will need to know a few things, notably the other characters in your party. And your ability scores, as well as what goals you would have for the character and your current spells, if possible for you to write our your whole character background and such it would help",
            "You can definitely fix this character with pact of the tome you can get eldritch blast + agonizing blast + hex which will give you baseline damage the entire campaign\n\nPick up other cantrips like guidance, shillelagh+ booming blade or green flame blade (melee option) because sometimes you just get stuck in melee. If you prefer just ranged options I like mind sliver or chill touch for regenerating enemies. \n\nAs a known caster you are allowed to swap 1 spell on level up rules as written. Same with invocations. Swap out sleep when it gets out-scaled. \n\nYou have access to faerie fire as a fey lock which is always a great support option.\n\nWith book of ancient secrets you can pick up find familiar - always useful but if your wizard has it you can copy it into your spell book for 50 gp. Speak with animals, purify food and drink/detect poison and disease to stand out. Otherwise detect magic and unseen servant if your party doesn\u2019t have them for whatever reason. \n\nIf you have 14 dex moderately armored at 4th level can greatly improve your defenses. Otherwise I\u2019d go for fey touched for flavor and pick up bless, command, or silvery barbs if it\u2019s legal, maybe even charm person for flavor. \n\n2nd level spells options - mirror image for defense, shatter for aoe, misty step if you don\u2019t want fey touched, \n\n3rd level spells you can stand out with summons as the bard can\u2019t summon and the wizard likely will take fireball and counter spell.\nYou can pick up summon fey for flavor or undead or shadow spawn up to you - they always upcast well. Hypnotic pattern the bard will probably pick up but it\u2019s still a fight winning spell you can have every short rest. Fly and counterspell are always great. \n\nJust with those selections I think you will have a pretty solid character levels 3+.",
            "If you GM is that strict, perhaps your warlock should have a little accident and then you could roll up a new character.",
            "Next level you could get Chain Pact for an Imp Familiar who is quite helpful to a party face. Neither you, the Bard, nor Wizard should have much Wis for Insight. It has a +3 and can telepathically tell you when they think someone is sus. Both of you can take a stab at the check for pseudo advantage. \n\nThen grab Mask of Many Faces, and Friends at Warlock 4 to be a much better Changeling than a Changeling. We can play bad cop. We can play bad guy. Make the Bard look like a hero with the shopkeep as we attempt to steal, get caught by the Bard, book it out and Disguise into a sweet old lady round the corner. We can turn NPCs against NPCs by casting Friends while impersonating them. Tons of options. Try to brainstorm with the Bard out of session to get them in the mindset of tag teaming social encounters. If talking about plans out of character in a social encounter is taboo at your table, Message is an excellent cantrip to speak to an ally without others hearing what you've said.\n\nIf you get tired of this playstyle or it doesn't work out between you two that much then we can switch Pacts again at Warlock 8. Talisman is nice to just hand them extra skill check bonuses. Two party faces isn't overkill though. They're going to get unlucky even on their best Cha skills at times and roll something awful. Always nice to have someone step in and take another crack at it if possible. \n\nUsing the Help Action in these situations could also contribute to their social check. There are some rules about being able to improve the situation in order to qualify, and proficiency is definitely a qualifier most the times. Note also that Bardic Inspiration can buff your skills, but not theirs. Maybe they won't use it out of combat too much until Bard 5 for Font of Inspiration, but it'll eventually become a plentiful resource.\n\nGood Cha and proficiencies alone should always be enough to chime in when you feel is right. If you convert your build purely into combat prowess you'll still be able to have a good time in all pillars with a Lock. Combat just might be your favorite time to shine once the ball gets rolling.
