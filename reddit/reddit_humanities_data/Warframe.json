Some of her Abilities apply **Judgments,** increasing enemy damage vulnerability by 50% for 10s. \n\n**Ability 1: Light\u2019s Judgment**\n\nCreate a well of light that heals allies and hurts enemies. Those who enter the well will be highlighted by Judgment.\n\nLight\u2019s Judgment is Jade\u2019s Railjack Kinesis ability. \n\n**Ability 2: Symphony of Mercy**\n\nCycle through three songs that strengthen allies.

Enemies cannot hurt your allies while wounded by Evensong\u2019s arrows. Kills with Evensong empower ally weapons with Multishot. \n\n**Unique Trait - Evensong Devotion**\n\nDamage dealt by Evensong's arrows applies 7 stacks of Puncture Status, which reduces the target's damage output by 100% and increases their Critical Chance of damage taken by 35%. Kills with Evensong activate Evensong Devotion, a buff that increases Multishot by 35% for allies.\n\n  \n\n\n**How to Acquire Evensong:**\n\nAcquire the Evensong Blueprint from the new Ascension game mode, or obtain the Blueprint in exchange for Vestigial Motes from Ordis in the Larunda Relay on Mercury. It can also be purchased fully built via the in-game Market for Platinum.\n\n[9e662544cb85481b5cf1a5faa7cdab28.jpg](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/9e662544cb85481b5cf1a5faa7cdab28.jpg)\n\n**New Thrown Secondary: Cantare**\n\nIn moments of despair, let the battle resonate with song. Cantare\u2019s blades lodge into the battlefield and return upon reload. When returning blades strike enemies, Cantare empowers allies with increased Reload Speed. \n\n**Unique Trait - Cantare Chorale**\n\nCantare's blades have a 300% Critical Chance when they return upon reload. Strike enemies with returning blades to activate Cantare Chorale, a buff that increases Reload Speed by 20% for allies.\n\n**How to Acquire Cantare:**\n\nAcquire the Cantare Blueprint from the new Ascension game mode, or obtain the Blueprint in exchange for Vestigial Motes from Ordis in the Larunda Relay on Mercury. It can also be purchased fully built via the in-game Market for Platinum.\n\n[4dd96a10fc711f7daa6b2c5c6d0027d7.jpg](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/4dd96a10fc711f7daa6b2c5c6d0027d7.jpg)\n\n**New Scythe Melee: Harmony**\n\nHarmony triumphs over hate. Heavy Attacks condense Status Effect damage into a single instance. Heavy Attack kills empower allies with increased Status Duration. \n\n**Unique Trait - Harmonic Resonance**\n\nHeavy Attacks condense all Status Effects that deal damage over time into a single instance. Heavy Attack kills activate Harmonic Resonance, a buff that increases Status Duration by 30% for allies.\n\n**How to Acquire Harmony:**\n\nAcquire the Harmony Blueprint from the new Ascension game mode, or obtain the Blueprint in exchange for Vestigial Motes from Ordis in the Larunda Relay on Mercury. It can also be purchased fully built via the in-game Market for Platinum.\n\n**Jade\u2019s Ensemble Buff**\n\nWhen all three weapons are used together they have a unique buff! Evensong, Cantare, and Harmony sing together. Their buff effects are doubled.\n\nShare your [Feedback](https://forums.warframe.com/forum/1974-ascension-game-mode-feedback/) & [Bug Reports](https://forums.warframe.com/forum/1979-jade-new-weapons-bugs/) on the new Weapons in the dedicated Feedback Subforum. \n\n[b1d7659a31e0763af00b60401b156412.jpg](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/b1d7659a31e0763af00b60401b156412.jpg)\n\n**NEW GAME MODE: ASCENSION**\n\nThe Stalker\u2019s stronghold is under intensive assault from marauding Corpus forces, but what they\u2019re after must remain safe. You\u2019ll need to initiate an emergency evacuation before embarking on a grueling ascent through enemy-infested elevator shafts to the Extraction waiting for you above.\n\nVisit the new **Brutus node on Uranus** after completing the Jade Shadows Quest to assist Ordis in gathering Vestigial Motes! This new non-endless mission unfurls in three stages:\n\n**Stage 1 - Mote Collection**\n\nThe Corpus have set up **Mote Collectors** to extract energy from the air - Ordis has taken them over, so you must defend them while they complete extraction!\n\n**Stage 2 - Ascension**\n\nOnce you have extracted the Motes, they must be transported in their **Extraction Capsule** top-side! To do so, power the elevator using **Ionic Capsules** dotted throughout the map, or dropped from enemies. As you approach them, they\u2019ll be marked with a small green waypoint! Keep your eyes peeled for extra-glowy **Boosted Ionic Capsules** that offer an additional power and speed boost. Once picked up, use the Alternative Fire to throw them at the Extraction Capsule to power your ascent!\n\n  \nPlayers can keep up with the ever-rising gameplay with increased jump height (thanks to a special Air Support deployed by Ordis), and via jump pads littered on various platforms. Should you take an unfortunate fall to the bottom of the map, use the jump pad at the bottom of the elevator to catch up to its height. \n\n**Bonus Objective:**\n\nAlong with the Ionic Capsules, players may come across **Sister Beacons** hidden throughout the map, identified by the soft pinging noise they emanate upon approach. Collect three of these to summon a Sister of Parvos, who will spawn once you reach the top of the Elevator shaft. Defeating the Sister will reward you with 5-7 Vestigial Motes and a chance at a new Arcane, listed below (8-10 Motes and a guaranteed Arcane on Steel Path). Sisters of Parvos will also drop Steel Essence in Steel Path Ascension missions.\n\n**Stage 3 - Extraction**\n\nOnce you\u2019ve made it to the top, escort the Extraction Capsule safely to extraction and defend it from Corpus foes along the way! Should enemies manage to deplete the health of the Extraction Capsule, its progress will stop briefly and the health will regenerate, at which point it will continue on its path once more. \n\n**Rewards**\n\nSuccessfully completing an Ascension mission will award players with 11-13 Vestigial Motes (16-18 on Steel Path), as well as a reward from the mission drop table, including:\n\n  * Jade\u2019s Component Blueprints\n  * Endo\n  * Relics\n  * Harmony Blueprint\n  * Cantare Blueprint\n  * Evensong Blueprint \n\n\n\nFor a full overview of the Ascension Drop Tables, please review our[ Drop Tables site](https://www.warframe.com/droptables). \n\n**Releasing Vestigial Motes**\n\nVisit Ordis in the Larunda Relay on Mercury during Operation: Belly of the Beast to exchange Vestigial Motes for various wares, including: \n\n  * Jade Main and Component Blueprints\n  * Harmony Blueprint\n  * Cantare Blueprint\n  * Evensong Blueprint\n  * New Arcanes (read on below to learn more!) \n\n\n\nOnce Operation: Belly of the Beast ends, Ordis will relocate to the Drifter Camp and offer his wares there. He finally got a job, yipee!\n\n**New Arcanes**\n\nEnhance your Arsenal with these new Arcanes! Acquire these new enhancements from Sisters of Parvos spawned in the new Ascension game mode, or exchange them for Vestigial Motes via Ordis in the Larunda Relay.\n\nStats below are shown at max rank. \n\n**Arcane Ice Storm (Warframe)**\n\nOn Enemy Frozen: Gain +2% Ability Strength and +2% Ability Duration for 15s. Stacks up to 20x.\n\n**Arcane Battery (Warframe)**\n\nGains 0.30 maximum Energy per Armor point, up to 1000 Energy. \n\n**Secondary Surge (Secondary)**\n\nOn Ability Cast: Next shot gains a Damage Multiplier for every 200 current Energy, up to x8. \n\n**Secondary Fortifier (Secondary)**\n\nGain 1 Overguard for every 100 Damage dealt to an enemy\u2019s Overguard. Deals x8 Extra Damage to Overguard.\n\n**Melee Afflictions (Melee)**\n\nEnemies affected by Status Effects gain 6 additional stacks when they're knocked down or flung by melee attacks.\n\n  \n\n\n**New Semi-Auto Fire Mods**\n\nThese new Mods can be equipped on Semi-Auto Fire weapons only, and prevent their firing speed from being modified once equipped. \n\nTarget Juno Sapper Moa enemies in Ascension missions to earn these Mods!\n\nYou can identify which weapons are eligible via the Arsenal if their Trigger type is \u201cSEMI\u201d. \n\n**Semi-Rifle Cannonade**\n\n+240% Damage  \n+1.5 Punch Through\n\n**Semi-Pistol Cannonade**\n\n+300% Damage  \n+1.5 Punch Through\n\n**Shotgun Cannonade**\n\n+240% Damage  \n+1.5 Punch Through\n\n**New Status Damage Mods**\n\nThis mechanic was originally introduced with Dante, and we have dedicated a whole series of Dual-Stat Mods to it! Increasing your Status Damage stat increases the damage per tick for Statuses that do damage over time (specifically Slash, Heat, Electricity, Toxin, Blast, and Gas). \n\nEarn these Mods from new Juno Sapper Moa enemies found in Ascension missions!\n\n**Rifle Elementalist**\n\n+90% Status Damage\n\n+0.6 Punch Through\n\n**Melee Elementalist**\n\n+90% Status Damage\n\n+60% Heavy Attack Wind Up Speed \n\n**Pistol Elementalist**\n\n+90% Status Damage\n\n+60% Reload Speed\n\n**Shotgun Elementalist**\n\n+90% Status Damage  \n+60% Magazine Capacity\n\nShare your [Feedback](https://forums.warframe.com/forum/1974-ascension-game-mode-feedback/) & [Bug Reports](https://forums.warframe.com/forum/1981-ascension-game-mode-bugs/) on the new Ascension game mode in the dedicated linked Feedback \n\nSubforums. \n\n[7d345af2728b287a9a3e05514132c58c.jpg](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/7d345af2728b287a9a3e05514132c58c.jpg)\n\n**NEW EXIMUS UNIT: JADE LIGHT EXIMUS**\n\nIntroducing a new Eximus Type: Jade Light Eximus.\n\n  \nPlayers will find them in all missions where Eximus spawn, where they will face the threat of Jade Light on the battlefield.\n\nThese new foes will target up to 2 players, and will summon a beam of Jade Light that follows them and deals increasing damage the longer you are in contact with it. Players can either avoid the Jade Light until it dissipates (~8 seconds) or attempt to destroy the beam by shooting at the top of it \u2014 or kill the Eximus unit itself, of course. Once a Jade Light is summoned, the Eximus' Ability will go on a short cooldown before another can be cast.\n\n[b4d5e5e6f0e8a4d87fea68e95e7e7844_1600x90](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/thumbnails/b4d5e5e6f0e8a4d87fea68e95e7e7844_1600x900.png)\n\n**OPERATION: BELLY OF THE BEAST**\n\nJUNE 18TH @ 11:30 AM ET - JULY 18TH @ 11:30 AM ET\n\nParvos Granum is attempting to harvest Volatile Motes to make his own Jade Light Eximus army, and only you and Ordis stand in his way. With Ordis\u2019 help, you can commandeer the Mote Collectors and put an end to Parvos\u2019 plans. \n\nVenture to a secretive location (discovered in the Jade Shadows Quest) at **Brutus on Uranus** to preserve Jade\u2019s legacy! Fight against the Corpus to earn new and returning rewards from previous Operations.\n\n**What You Need To Know**\n\nOperation: Belly of the Beast requires you to step into this shrouded location - only those who have completed the **Jade Shadows Quest** are permitted to do so. \n\nAfter finishing the Jade Shadows Quest, players will have access to a new node on Uranus: Brutus. Here they can access the new Ascension game mode and access Operation-specific missions. Successfully foiling Parvos\u2019 efforts will reward you with special Volatile Motes, which can be exchanged for Operation rewards.\n\n**What You Need To Do**\n\nWhile Operation: Belly of the Beast is live, players will have access to special nodes that allow them to take on Parvo\u2019s forces. In these missions, all Eximus units you face will be empowered by Jade Light - meaning the only Eximus units that will spawn are Jade Light Eximus. You can help Ordis in his mission to stop Parvos in one of three ways:\n\n  * Operation Variant of Brutus (Uranus)\n  * Operation Alerts\n  * Stalker Joins the Fray\n\n\n\n**Operation Variant of Brutus (Uranus)**\n\nIn traditional Operation style, the new Brutus node on Uranus has its own Operation variant. Play Ascension as you know it, but with all Eximus units spawning in as Jade Light Eximus. On top of the regular Ascension rewards, each Operation mission will award players with 4-6 **Volatile Motes** (8-10 on Steel Path), which can be traded for rewards via Ordis in the Larunda Relay.\n\nSummoning a Sister of Parvos will also earn players an extra 1-3 Volatile Motes (2-4 on Steel Path), as well as her usual drops.\n\n  \n\n\n**Operation Alerts**\n\nIn addition to the Brutus node on Uranus, timed Operation Alerts will appear across the solar system that will also reward players with 10 Volatile Motes (15 on Steel Path). These non-Ascension missions will have normal gameplay, but will feature increased Eximus Spawns, and will only feature Jade Light type Eximus. Look for these time-limited Alerts appearing every half hour or so as an alternative method to earning Volatile Motes. \n\n**Stalker Joins the Fray**\n\nVisiting Ordis in the Larunda Relay not only allows you to earn Operation Rewards, but also lets you call on an old foe to assist in your efforts. In speaking to Ordis, selecting the \u201cA Shared Purpose?\u201d option will allow you to join another Squad\u2019s mission as Stalker. Doing so will reward you with the usual mission rewards, but at risk of losing them all should you be downed.\n\n**Rewards**\n\nNo Operation is complete without rewards, and Ordis has collected quite a few offerings for you to choose from. Ordis can be found in the Larunda Relay in the Navigation Room, where he will trade Volatile Motes for rewards.\n\n**Community Progress**\n\nBelly of the Beast comes with a Community Progress segment, tracking the total Volatile Motes collected by players.

Our goal is to reduce the friction necessary to engage in optimal play, so we\u2019ve:\n\na) Simplified the number of Health Types\n\nb) Redesigned how Faction Resistances work \n\nc) Increased the visibility of the new vulnerabilities in normal gameplay flow \n\nInstead of having 13 Health Types, we have simplified them into 4:  \n\n\n  * Health\n  * Armor\n  * Shields\n  * Overguard\n\n\n\nNow, these Health Types only serve to differentiate between Status Effects and Abilities that affect them, such as Magnetic hindering Shields, Corrosive stripping Armor, or Viral amplifying Health damage.\n\nWe\u2019ve changed the system so that Resistances and Vulnerabilities are **no longer tied to the previous Health Types**. Resistances and Vulnerabilities are now based upon the Faction a player is engaging with. \n\n**Star Chart \u201cSuggested Damage\u201d**\n\nVulnerabilities are now listed in The Star Chart mission nodes! Here, we aim to recommend the appropriate per-Faction Resistances, which will then universally affect that specific group.\n\n**The Star Chart** now shows Faction Resistances per node. Aligned with the present Faction, **Vulnerabilities and Resistances** will be listed to communicate the \u201cSuggested Damage\u201d options best used against any specific Faction or location.\n\n[66f1be34ab89ea74fe28f2b721efe055.jpg](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/66f1be34ab89ea74fe28f2b721efe055.jpg)\n\nSub-Factions will also have different Vulnerabilities and Resistances from their primary counterpart. The three main Sub-Factions are:\n\n  * Kuva Grineer\n  * Corpus Amalgam\n  * Deimos Infested\n\n\n\nViewing Faction Vulnerabilities and Resistances now also depends on where the player is within Warframe\u2019s Story. The Factions (and Sub-Factions) will be unlocked via:\n\nFactions:\n\n  * Grineer: Unlocked by **default.**\n  * Corpus: Unlocked by **default.**\n  * Infested: Unlocked by **default.**\n  * Orokin: Unlocked after **Phobos Junction.**\n  * Sentient: Unlocked after **The Second Dream Quest** completion.\n  * Narmer: Unlocked after **The New War Quest** completion.\n  * Zariman: Unlocked after **Angels of the Zariman Quest** completion.\n  * Murmur: Unlocked after **Whispers in the Walls** **Quest** completion.\n\n\n\nSub-Factions:\n\n  * Kuva Grineer: Unlocked after **The War Within Ques** t completion.\n  * Corpus Amalgam: Unlocked after **Jupiter Junction.**\n  * Deimos Infested: Unlocked after **Heart of Deimos Quest** completion.\n\n\n\n**Simplified Faction Resistances**\n\nWith the removal of Resistances/Vulnerabilities being tied to Health Type, they will now be Faction-specific.\n\nDefault Faction Vulnerabilities and Resistances:\n\n  * Grineer: Vulnerable to **Impact** and **Corrosive**\n  * Corpus: Vulnerable to **Puncture** and **Magnetic**\n  * Infested: Vulnerable to **Slash** and **Heat**\n\n\n\nFactions by Quest Vulnerabilities and Resistances:\n\n  * Orokin: \n    * Vulnerable to **Puncture** and **Viral**\n    * Resistant**** to**Radiation**\n  * Sentient: \n    * Vulnerable to **Cold** and **Radiation**\n    * Resistant**** to**Corrosive**\n  * Narmer:****\n    * Vulnerable to **Slash** and **Toxin**\n    * Resistant**** to**Magnetic**.\n  * Zariman: Vulnerable to **Void**\n  * The Murmur: \n    * Vulnerable to **Electric** and **Radiation**\n    * Resistant to**Viral**\n      * Rogue Necramechs also fall under these Vulnerabilities and Resistances.\n\n\n\nSub-Faction Vulnerabilities and Resistances:\n\n  * Kuva Grineer: \n    * Vulnerable to **Impact** and **Corrosive**\n    * Resistant**** to**Heat**\n  * Corpus Amalgam:****\n    * Vulnerable to **Electric** and **Magnetic**\n    * Resistant**** to**Blast**\n  * Deimos Infested:****\n    * Vulnerable to **Blast** and**Gas**\n    * Resistant**** to**Viral**\n\n\n\nWith these Resistance and Vulnerability changes, we\u2019ve made a notable decision to make **Impact** deadlier towards the **Grineer** , while making **Puncture** deadlier towards the **Corpus**. This is a departure from the previous system, however, we believe that these two Statuses are more suited for these specific Factions.",
