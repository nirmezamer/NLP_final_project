Some of her Abilities apply **Judgments,** increasing enemy damage vulnerability by 50% for 10s. \n\n**Ability 1: Light\u2019s Judgment**\n\nCreate a well of light that heals allies and hurts enemies. Those who enter the well will be highlighted by Judgment.\n\nLight\u2019s Judgment is Jade\u2019s Railjack Kinesis ability. \n\n**Ability 2: Symphony of Mercy**\n\nCycle through three songs that strengthen allies.

Enemies cannot hurt your allies while wounded by Evensong\u2019s arrows. Kills with Evensong empower ally weapons with Multishot. \n\n**Unique Trait - Evensong Devotion**\n\nDamage dealt by Evensong's arrows applies 7 stacks of Puncture Status, which reduces the target's damage output by 100% and increases their Critical Chance of damage taken by 35%. Kills with Evensong activate Evensong Devotion, a buff that increases Multishot by 35% for allies.\n\n  \n\n\n**How to Acquire Evensong:**\n\nAcquire the Evensong Blueprint from the new Ascension game mode, or obtain the Blueprint in exchange for Vestigial Motes from Ordis in the Larunda Relay on Mercury. It can also be purchased fully built via the in-game Market for Platinum.\n\n[9e662544cb85481b5cf1a5faa7cdab28.jpg](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/9e662544cb85481b5cf1a5faa7cdab28.jpg)\n\n**New Thrown Secondary: Cantare**\n\nIn moments of despair, let the battle resonate with song. Cantare\u2019s blades lodge into the battlefield and return upon reload. When returning blades strike enemies, Cantare empowers allies with increased Reload Speed. \n\n**Unique Trait - Cantare Chorale**\n\nCantare's blades have a 300% Critical Chance when they return upon reload. Strike enemies with returning blades to activate Cantare Chorale, a buff that increases Reload Speed by 20% for allies.\n\n**How to Acquire Cantare:**\n\nAcquire the Cantare Blueprint from the new Ascension game mode, or obtain the Blueprint in exchange for Vestigial Motes from Ordis in the Larunda Relay on Mercury. It can also be purchased fully built via the in-game Market for Platinum.\n\n[4dd96a10fc711f7daa6b2c5c6d0027d7.jpg](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/4dd96a10fc711f7daa6b2c5c6d0027d7.jpg)\n\n**New Scythe Melee: Harmony**\n\nHarmony triumphs over hate. Heavy Attacks condense Status Effect damage into a single instance. Heavy Attack kills empower allies with increased Status Duration. \n\n**Unique Trait - Harmonic Resonance**\n\nHeavy Attacks condense all Status Effects that deal damage over time into a single instance. Heavy Attack kills activate Harmonic Resonance, a buff that increases Status Duration by 30% for allies.\n\n**How to Acquire Harmony:**\n\nAcquire the Harmony Blueprint from the new Ascension game mode, or obtain the Blueprint in exchange for Vestigial Motes from Ordis in the Larunda Relay on Mercury. It can also be purchased fully built via the in-game Market for Platinum.\n\n**Jade\u2019s Ensemble Buff**\n\nWhen all three weapons are used together they have a unique buff! Evensong, Cantare, and Harmony sing together. Their buff effects are doubled.\n\nShare your [Feedback](https://forums.warframe.com/forum/1974-ascension-game-mode-feedback/) & [Bug Reports](https://forums.warframe.com/forum/1979-jade-new-weapons-bugs/) on the new Weapons in the dedicated Feedback Subforum. \n\n[b1d7659a31e0763af00b60401b156412.jpg](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/b1d7659a31e0763af00b60401b156412.jpg)\n\n**NEW GAME MODE: ASCENSION**\n\nThe Stalker\u2019s stronghold is under intensive assault from marauding Corpus forces, but what they\u2019re after must remain safe. You\u2019ll need to initiate an emergency evacuation before embarking on a grueling ascent through enemy-infested elevator shafts to the Extraction waiting for you above.\n\nVisit the new **Brutus node on Uranus** after completing the Jade Shadows Quest to assist Ordis in gathering Vestigial Motes! This new non-endless mission unfurls in three stages:\n\n**Stage 1 - Mote Collection**\n\nThe Corpus have set up **Mote Collectors** to extract energy from the air - Ordis has taken them over, so you must defend them while they complete extraction!\n\n**Stage 2 - Ascension**\n\nOnce you have extracted the Motes, they must be transported in their **Extraction Capsule** top-side! To do so, power the elevator using **Ionic Capsules** dotted throughout the map, or dropped from enemies. As you approach them, they\u2019ll be marked with a small green waypoint! Keep your eyes peeled for extra-glowy **Boosted Ionic Capsules** that offer an additional power and speed boost. Once picked up, use the Alternative Fire to throw them at the Extraction Capsule to power your ascent!\n\n  \nPlayers can keep up with the ever-rising gameplay with increased jump height (thanks to a special Air Support deployed by Ordis), and via jump pads littered on various platforms. Should you take an unfortunate fall to the bottom of the map, use the jump pad at the bottom of the elevator to catch up to its height. \n\n**Bonus Objective:**\n\nAlong with the Ionic Capsules, players may come across **Sister Beacons** hidden throughout the map, identified by the soft pinging noise they emanate upon approach. Collect three of these to summon a Sister of Parvos, who will spawn once you reach the top of the Elevator shaft. Defeating the Sister will reward you with 5-7 Vestigial Motes and a chance at a new Arcane, listed below (8-10 Motes and a guaranteed Arcane on Steel Path). Sisters of Parvos will also drop Steel Essence in Steel Path Ascension missions.\n\n**Stage 3 - Extraction**\n\nOnce you\u2019ve made it to the top, escort the Extraction Capsule safely to extraction and defend it from Corpus foes along the way! Should enemies manage to deplete the health of the Extraction Capsule, its progress will stop briefly and the health will regenerate, at which point it will continue on its path once more. \n\n**Rewards**\n\nSuccessfully completing an Ascension mission will award players with 11-13 Vestigial Motes (16-18 on Steel Path), as well as a reward from the mission drop table, including:\n\n  * Jade\u2019s Component Blueprints\n  * Endo\n  * Relics\n  * Harmony Blueprint\n  * Cantare Blueprint\n  * Evensong Blueprint \n\n\n\nFor a full overview of the Ascension Drop Tables, please review our[ Drop Tables site](https://www.warframe.com/droptables). \n\n**Releasing Vestigial Motes**\n\nVisit Ordis in the Larunda Relay on Mercury during Operation: Belly of the Beast to exchange Vestigial Motes for various wares, including: \n\n  * Jade Main and Component Blueprints\n  * Harmony Blueprint\n  * Cantare Blueprint\n  * Evensong Blueprint\n  * New Arcanes (read on below to learn more!) \n\n\n\nOnce Operation: Belly of the Beast ends, Ordis will relocate to the Drifter Camp and offer his wares there. He finally got a job, yipee!\n\n**New Arcanes**\n\nEnhance your Arsenal with these new Arcanes! Acquire these new enhancements from Sisters of Parvos spawned in the new Ascension game mode, or exchange them for Vestigial Motes via Ordis in the Larunda Relay.\n\nStats below are shown at max rank. \n\n**Arcane Ice Storm (Warframe)**\n\nOn Enemy Frozen: Gain +2% Ability Strength and +2% Ability Duration for 15s. Stacks up to 20x.\n\n**Arcane Battery (Warframe)**\n\nGains 0.30 maximum Energy per Armor point, up to 1000 Energy. \n\n**Secondary Surge (Secondary)**\n\nOn Ability Cast: Next shot gains a Damage Multiplier for every 200 current Energy, up to x8. \n\n**Secondary Fortifier (Secondary)**\n\nGain 1 Overguard for every 100 Damage dealt to an enemy\u2019s Overguard. Deals x8 Extra Damage to Overguard.\n\n**Melee Afflictions (Melee)**\n\nEnemies affected by Status Effects gain 6 additional stacks when they're knocked down or flung by melee attacks.\n\n  \n\n\n**New Semi-Auto Fire Mods**\n\nThese new Mods can be equipped on Semi-Auto Fire weapons only, and prevent their firing speed from being modified once equipped. \n\nTarget Juno Sapper Moa enemies in Ascension missions to earn these Mods!\n\nYou can identify which weapons are eligible via the Arsenal if their Trigger type is \u201cSEMI\u201d. \n\n**Semi-Rifle Cannonade**\n\n+240% Damage  \n+1.5 Punch Through\n\n**Semi-Pistol Cannonade**\n\n+300% Damage  \n+1.5 Punch Through\n\n**Shotgun Cannonade**\n\n+240% Damage  \n+1.5 Punch Through\n\n**New Status Damage Mods**\n\nThis mechanic was originally introduced with Dante, and we have dedicated a whole series of Dual-Stat Mods to it! Increasing your Status Damage stat increases the damage per tick for Statuses that do damage over time (specifically Slash, Heat, Electricity, Toxin, Blast, and Gas). \n\nEarn these Mods from new Juno Sapper Moa enemies found in Ascension missions!\n\n**Rifle Elementalist**\n\n+90% Status Damage\n\n+0.6 Punch Through\n\n**Melee Elementalist**\n\n+90% Status Damage\n\n+60% Heavy Attack Wind Up Speed \n\n**Pistol Elementalist**\n\n+90% Status Damage\n\n+60% Reload Speed\n\n**Shotgun Elementalist**\n\n+90% Status Damage  \n+60% Magazine Capacity\n\nShare your [Feedback](https://forums.warframe.com/forum/1974-ascension-game-mode-feedback/) & [Bug Reports](https://forums.warframe.com/forum/1981-ascension-game-mode-bugs/) on the new Ascension game mode in the dedicated linked Feedback \n\nSubforums. \n\n[7d345af2728b287a9a3e05514132c58c.jpg](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/7d345af2728b287a9a3e05514132c58c.jpg)\n\n**NEW EXIMUS UNIT: JADE LIGHT EXIMUS**\n\nIntroducing a new Eximus Type: Jade Light Eximus.\n\n  \nPlayers will find them in all missions where Eximus spawn, where they will face the threat of Jade Light on the battlefield.\n\nThese new foes will target up to 2 players, and will summon a beam of Jade Light that follows them and deals increasing damage the longer you are in contact with it. Players can either avoid the Jade Light until it dissipates (~8 seconds) or attempt to destroy the beam by shooting at the top of it \u2014 or kill the Eximus unit itself, of course. Once a Jade Light is summoned, the Eximus' Ability will go on a short cooldown before another can be cast.\n\n[b4d5e5e6f0e8a4d87fea68e95e7e7844_1600x90](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/thumbnails/b4d5e5e6f0e8a4d87fea68e95e7e7844_1600x900.png)\n\n**OPERATION: BELLY OF THE BEAST**\n\nJUNE 18TH @ 11:30 AM ET - JULY 18TH @ 11:30 AM ET\n\nParvos Granum is attempting to harvest Volatile Motes to make his own Jade Light Eximus army, and only you and Ordis stand in his way. With Ordis\u2019 help, you can commandeer the Mote Collectors and put an end to Parvos\u2019 plans. \n\nVenture to a secretive location (discovered in the Jade Shadows Quest) at **Brutus on Uranus** to preserve Jade\u2019s legacy! Fight against the Corpus to earn new and returning rewards from previous Operations.\n\n**What You Need To Know**\n\nOperation: Belly of the Beast requires you to step into this shrouded location - only those who have completed the **Jade Shadows Quest** are permitted to do so. \n\nAfter finishing the Jade Shadows Quest, players will have access to a new node on Uranus: Brutus. Here they can access the new Ascension game mode and access Operation-specific missions. Successfully foiling Parvos\u2019 efforts will reward you with special Volatile Motes, which can be exchanged for Operation rewards.\n\n**What You Need To Do**\n\nWhile Operation: Belly of the Beast is live, players will have access to special nodes that allow them to take on Parvo\u2019s forces. In these missions, all Eximus units you face will be empowered by Jade Light - meaning the only Eximus units that will spawn are Jade Light Eximus. You can help Ordis in his mission to stop Parvos in one of three ways:\n\n  * Operation Variant of Brutus (Uranus)\n  * Operation Alerts\n  * Stalker Joins the Fray\n\n\n\n**Operation Variant of Brutus (Uranus)**\n\nIn traditional Operation style, the new Brutus node on Uranus has its own Operation variant. Play Ascension as you know it, but with all Eximus units spawning in as Jade Light Eximus. On top of the regular Ascension rewards, each Operation mission will award players with 4-6 **Volatile Motes** (8-10 on Steel Path), which can be traded for rewards via Ordis in the Larunda Relay.\n\nSummoning a Sister of Parvos will also earn players an extra 1-3 Volatile Motes (2-4 on Steel Path), as well as her usual drops.\n\n  \n\n\n**Operation Alerts**\n\nIn addition to the Brutus node on Uranus, timed Operation Alerts will appear across the solar system that will also reward players with 10 Volatile Motes (15 on Steel Path). These non-Ascension missions will have normal gameplay, but will feature increased Eximus Spawns, and will only feature Jade Light type Eximus. Look for these time-limited Alerts appearing every half hour or so as an alternative method to earning Volatile Motes. \n\n**Stalker Joins the Fray**\n\nVisiting Ordis in the Larunda Relay not only allows you to earn Operation Rewards, but also lets you call on an old foe to assist in your efforts. In speaking to Ordis, selecting the \u201cA Shared Purpose?\u201d option will allow you to join another Squad\u2019s mission as Stalker. Doing so will reward you with the usual mission rewards, but at risk of losing them all should you be downed.\n\n**Rewards**\n\nNo Operation is complete without rewards, and Ordis has collected quite a few offerings for you to choose from. Ordis can be found in the Larunda Relay in the Navigation Room, where he will trade Volatile Motes for rewards.\n\n**Community Progress**\n\nBelly of the Beast comes with a Community Progress segment, tracking the total Volatile Motes collected by players.

Our goal is to reduce the friction necessary to engage in optimal play, so we\u2019ve:\n\na) Simplified the number of Health Types\n\nb) Redesigned how Faction Resistances work \n\nc) Increased the visibility of the new vulnerabilities in normal gameplay flow \n\nInstead of having 13 Health Types, we have simplified them into 4:  \n\n\n  * Health\n  * Armor\n  * Shields\n  * Overguard\n\n\n\nNow, these Health Types only serve to differentiate between Status Effects and Abilities that affect them, such as Magnetic hindering Shields, Corrosive stripping Armor, or Viral amplifying Health damage.\n\nWe\u2019ve changed the system so that Resistances and Vulnerabilities are **no longer tied to the previous Health Types**. Resistances and Vulnerabilities are now based upon the Faction a player is engaging with. \n\n**Star Chart \u201cSuggested Damage\u201d**\n\nVulnerabilities are now listed in The Star Chart mission nodes! Here, we aim to recommend the appropriate per-Faction Resistances, which will then universally affect that specific group.\n\n**The Star Chart** now shows Faction Resistances per node. Aligned with the present Faction, **Vulnerabilities and Resistances** will be listed to communicate the \u201cSuggested Damage\u201d options best used against any specific Faction or location.\n\n[66f1be34ab89ea74fe28f2b721efe055.jpg](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/66f1be34ab89ea74fe28f2b721efe055.jpg)\n\nSub-Factions will also have different Vulnerabilities and Resistances from their primary counterpart. The three main Sub-Factions are:\n\n  * Kuva Grineer\n  * Corpus Amalgam\n  * Deimos Infested\n\n\n\nViewing Faction Vulnerabilities and Resistances now also depends on where the player is within Warframe\u2019s Story. The Factions (and Sub-Factions) will be unlocked via:\n\nFactions:\n\n  * Grineer: Unlocked by **default.**\n  * Corpus: Unlocked by **default.**\n  * Infested: Unlocked by **default.**\n  * Orokin: Unlocked after **Phobos Junction.**\n  * Sentient: Unlocked after **The Second Dream Quest** completion.\n  * Narmer: Unlocked after **The New War Quest** completion.\n  * Zariman: Unlocked after **Angels of the Zariman Quest** completion.\n  * Murmur: Unlocked after **Whispers in the Walls** **Quest** completion.\n\n\n\nSub-Factions:\n\n  * Kuva Grineer: Unlocked after **The War Within Ques** t completion.\n  * Corpus Amalgam: Unlocked after **Jupiter Junction.**\n  * Deimos Infested: Unlocked after **Heart of Deimos Quest** completion.\n\n\n\n**Simplified Faction Resistances**\n\nWith the removal of Resistances/Vulnerabilities being tied to Health Type, they will now be Faction-specific.\n\nDefault Faction Vulnerabilities and Resistances:\n\n  * Grineer: Vulnerable to **Impact** and **Corrosive**\n  * Corpus: Vulnerable to **Puncture** and **Magnetic**\n  * Infested: Vulnerable to **Slash** and **Heat**\n\n\n\nFactions by Quest Vulnerabilities and Resistances:\n\n  * Orokin: \n    * Vulnerable to **Puncture** and **Viral**\n    * Resistant**** to**Radiation**\n  * Sentient: \n    * Vulnerable to **Cold** and **Radiation**\n    * Resistant**** to**Corrosive**\n  * Narmer:****\n    * Vulnerable to **Slash** and **Toxin**\n    * Resistant**** to**Magnetic**.\n  * Zariman: Vulnerable to **Void**\n  * The Murmur: \n    * Vulnerable to **Electric** and **Radiation**\n    * Resistant to**Viral**\n      * Rogue Necramechs also fall under these Vulnerabilities and Resistances.\n\n\n\nSub-Faction Vulnerabilities and Resistances:\n\n  * Kuva Grineer: \n    * Vulnerable to **Impact** and **Corrosive**\n    * Resistant**** to**Heat**\n  * Corpus Amalgam:****\n    * Vulnerable to **Electric** and **Magnetic**\n    * Resistant**** to**Blast**\n  * Deimos Infested:****\n    * Vulnerable to **Blast** and**Gas**\n    * Resistant**** to**Viral**\n\n\n\nWith these Resistance and Vulnerability changes, we\u2019ve made a notable decision to make **Impact** deadlier towards the **Grineer** , while making **Puncture** deadlier towards the **Corpus**. This is a departure from the previous system, however, we believe that these two Statuses are more suited for these specific Factions.",

            ">We\u2019ve improved enemy spawn logic in Excavation missions to decrease the wait time between completing Excavators.\nThis addresses the player reported issue that it often would take far too long for enemies to spawn when moving from one Excavator to another.\n\nAFTER TEN THOUSAND YEARS I'M FREE",
            "Since**Impact Status Effects** enables **Mercy** actions, we found that it wasn\u2019t all too effective against **Corpus** due to their lower Health counts compared to their **Shields** , while **Mercy** killing **Grineer** is more accessible due to their innate tankiness. The **Corpus** can deliver incredibly high amounts of raw damage, allowing for **Puncture** to naturally play effectively into limiting their damage potential.\n\n**Armor Adjustments**\n\nImportant Note: We have not changed player Armor. This only applies to enemy Armor!\n\nEnemy Armor scaling in its previous current iteration meant that Armor Stripping was almost an all-or-nothing game, especially at higher levels. This resulted in players focusing on Armor Stripping as a way to tackle Grineer at higher difficulty content. Our goal is to reduce some of the extreme damage reduction offered by Armor at high levels, and make partial Armor Stripping more feasible. \n\nTo do so, we are making the following changes: \n\n  * Armor has a maximum cap of 2700 Armor (90% Damage Reduction).\n  * Armor has a minimum cap of 200 Armor.\n  * Steel Path no longer increases Armor values.\n  * Grineer enemies have increased Health scaling.\n  * Altered the formula for Armor Reduction to increase the effectiveness of Partial Armor Stripping.\n    * For reference, currently around 50% of Damage Resistance came from just 300 Armor, which is why complete Armor Strip felt so needed at higher levels.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, our goal was to make partial Armor Stripping a more valuable tool. By capping enemy Armor and adjusting how Armor is calculated, a partial Armor Strip will allow players to engage with high-level Grineer more easily - meaning max Corrosion stacks against an Armored enemy (reducing the Armor by 80%) will feel more impactful due to the new distribution of Damage Resistance from Armor values). \n\nFull Armor Strip is still valuable, but we wanted to even the playing field so players didn\u2019t feel forced to build around it.\n\n**Shield Adjustments**\n\nImportant note: We have not changed player Shields. This only applies to enemy Shields!\n\nThe Grineer are tankier by design, but the Corpus try to make the difference through their Shields. However, Corpus Effective Hit Points (EHP) are significantly lower, making them often trivial to deal with by comparison. Our goal is to reduce the discrepancy between Grineer and Corpus time-to-kill (TTK) by making Corpus Shields a bit more challenging and interesting to fight. \n\n**Changes to Enemy Shields** :\n\n  * Shields now scale more quickly starting at level 80. This means stronger Shields than before as players fight higher-leveled Shielded enemies. \n  * Shield Recharge Delay is now unified across all enemy types.\n  * Shield Recharge Delay now has a minimum and maximum length depending on how much damage has been dealt to enemy Shields.\n    * The more damage dealt, the slower enemy Shields will begin recharging, so if you can\u2019t outpace enemy Shields right away, you can chip their Recharge Delay down within a maximum and a minimum.\n      * For example, if enemy Shields break at any point, it automatically acts as if 200% damage (which becomes the maximum delay) has been inflicted on those Shields. However, if an enemy absorbs 99% damage (so 1% of their shields left), their accumulated damage taken now sets their Recharge Delay in the middle of their respective minimum and maximum delays. Should they Recharge and you deal another 99% damage to their Shields, they\u2019ll have absorbed 198% damage, taking them to the maximum Recharge delay of what that scaled enemy can have.\n  * Shield Recharge Rate scales with enemy level, recharging at a faster rate for higher-leveled enemies.\n    * Shield Recharge Rate will also accelerate while Shields are actively Recharging.\n      * Shield Recharge Acceleration Rate\u2019s base multiplier greatly increases after level 80, resulting in faster Recharge rates at higher levels.\n  * Steel Path Shields are now multiplied by 2.5x, in place of the previous 6.25x. Steel Path Shields were doubly-applying the multiplier unintentionally.\n\n\n\n**Effective Hit Points (EHP) Adjustments**\n\nEnemy stat scalings, such as Health and Shields, now grow faster as enemy level increases, in compensation of the loss in Enemy Armor and to make Shields more engaging to deal with. \n\n**Changes:**\n\n  * After Level 75-80, enemies receive increased stats, such as Health, at a slightly increased rate to prevent EHP stagnation.\n    * It\u2019s important to note that the increase in Health scaling is not meant to match the EHP values seen by previous levels of Armor. \n\n\n\n**Status Effect Reworks**\n\n**Blast**\n\nOur goal with Blast is to invoke an immediate and on-death effect to emphasize explosions. \n\nNow, instead of enemy inaccuracy, you **detonate** your enemies! When dealing a Blast Status Effect to an enemy, the following will happen:\n\n**Blast Changes:**\n\n  * Upon inflicting a Blast Status Effect, individual stacks will cause a mini-explosion, and a max stack count of 10 will inflict combined damage in a 5m radius\n    * After 1.5 seconds, an individually incurred Blast Status Effect deals a percentage of base-inflicted damage per stack-explosion and over 100% of base-inflicted damage for a full (10 stack) explosion.\n  * Status Duration will increase the delay before the Status Effect applies and depletes.\n  * Removed the previous Status Effect of inaccuracy.\n\n\n\n**Cold**\n\nWith Cold, we want to fully realize the fantasy of slowing, freezing and shattering your enemies. The existing Cold Status mechanic of slowing enemies is unchanged, but now has a new mechanic upon applying Max Stacks - freezing your foes!\n\n  \n\n\n**Cold Changes:**\n\n  * Cold now has a maximum cap of 10 stacks (was 9).\n  * Applying 10 Cold stacks to a foe will make them **Frozen** for 3 seconds. Frozen enemies cannot move, will not recharge Shields, and receive double Critical Damage. After the Frozen effect wears off, 3 Cold stacks will remain. \n    * Bosses, such as Alad V or Kela De Thaym, will be unable to be Frozen since they cannot accumulate 10 Cold stacks.\n\n\n\n**Gas**\n\nGas often lacked effective readability, making it difficult to distinguish its presence from the enemy or yourself. We\u2019ve introduced enhanced visuals so that when the Gas Status Effect is active, you\u2019ll be able to recognize it more clearly.\n\n**Gas Changes:**\n\n  * Added VFX on top of the target affected by a Gas Cloud to clearly show an effect is active.\n    * In addition to current and new VFX, Gas VFX now also more clearly shows the radius of the Gas Damage-over-Time (DoT) effect around a given target to better understand its impact on surrounding enemies.\n      * If a player is inside the radius of the Gas DoT, the visuals are reduced for them to maintain visibility, similar to Frost\u2019s Snow Globe. \n  * Gas VFX now has billowy volume to better present presence.\n  * Gas VFX now has additional floating particles around the smoke.\n\n\n\n**Magnetic**\n\nMagnetic has received a few buffs to increase its effectiveness against Shields and to hammer home the power fantasy of overloading enemy Shields.\n\n**Magnetic Changes:**\n\n  * Damage to Nullifier Bubbles has been increased\n    * Minimum Damage raised to 300 Damage per shot.\n    * Maximum Damage raised to 1200 Damage per shot.\n    * Additionally, we now show the minimum and maximum damage numbers against Nullifier Bubbles, with Magnetic attacks displaying the buffed damage shown above, while non-Magnetic sources will display the original, unbuffed damage.\n      * Known issue: Clients see the incorrectly unbuffed damage from Magnetic sources, which is strictly a UI/visual bug. Magnetic sources will continue to deal increased damage towards Nullifier Bubbles despite the incorrect numbers displayed. We will look to resolve this in a future Hotfix/Update. \n  * Reduced Shield Regeneration by a percentage per Magnetic stack against affected targets.\n  * Upon Shield/Overguard Breaking a target, the enemy will now be dealt Electric Status damage for a percentage of Max Shields/Overguard per Magnetic stack while also forcing an Electric Status Effect.\n  * Magnetic stacks on an enemy with Overguard now allow for bonus damage to Overguard, similar to how Magnetic affects Shields. \n\n\n\n**Warframe Changes**\n\nWith the above changes to Resistances and Status Effects, we took a look at Warframe abilities and made some adjustments to compliment the changes.  \n\n\n**Frost Rework**\n\nFrost, the definitively-themed Cold Warframe, has received a rework to better situate him for how Cold works with this Update! While Frost dealt icy attacks to his foes, the Freeze from his hit was not tied to Cold Status Effects. With the update to the Cold status, we have also amended his kit to properly use Cold Status Effects to Freeze enemies! \n\n**New passive - Fortifying Freeze:**\n\nCold Status Effects applied by Frost Abilities have their duration increased by 100%. Frost gains 50 Armor per enemy inflicted with Cold Status within 15m.\n\n**Freeze (1st Ability):**\n\n  * Adds required Cold stacks to freeze instead of simply freezing to both initial hit and AoE interactions.\n  * \u201cDuration\u201d is now known as \u201cFreeze Duration,\u201d indicating how long an affected target is Frozen.\n  * Doubled the baseline Area of Effect component of the projectiles.\n  * The Area-of-Effect aspect now scales with the Ability Range stat. The Area-of-Effect Radius is now present in the Ability description. \n\n\n\n**Ice Wave (2nd Ability):**\n\n  * \u201cDuration\u201d is now known as \u201cFreeze Duration,\u201d indicating how long an affected target is Frozen.\n  * **Ice Wave Impedance Augment Changes:**\n    * Leaves a frozen trail for 12s that adds a Cold Status Effect per second on enemies in contact with it.\n\n\n\n**Snow Globe (3rd Ability):**",

        "content": "So I don\u2019t ever post on my Reddit account but I do sort of lurk around reading posts here and there and I\u2019ve been reading different reactions to Jade Eximus. Personally, I found them fun and encouraged more active gameplay out of some of the more afk builds that are becoming more common, and introduced an actual challenge beyond extreme level/ armor scaling. But THIS was so bad I had to post it somewhere hoping that this is some sort of bug. And this happened to me TWICE beforehand. \n\nExplanation (skip this paragraph if you can see lol):\nIn this clip you\u2019ll see that the Hyldryn is staying on the target to provide shields to the defense target while I cast Tentacle Swarm to provide crowd control in the area while I go to kill an Eximus that was in the area. Another Jade Eximus appears and (apparently from BEHIND A DOOR) targets the Hyldryn and in FIVE SECONDS absolutely shreds the defense target, causing the mission to fail. The eximus I tagged was the only one I could see in the area.\n\nIn what universe is this fair? An eximus that can attack from what appears to be more than double my cc range, is not effected by my cc anyways, and can shred a defense target faster than anyone can have the opportunity to react. I\u2019m happy to have challenging content but this is just excessive. I understand that it\u2019s not good for allies to stand on the defense target as it can get hit by stray bullets and draws more enemies to the target but even in those cases you have a good while to clear the enemies from the area or move before it gets out of control. It\u2019s actually kind of ironic because the Jade Eximus seem to be made ignoring all the restrictions most warframes have to follow. They have incredibly strong damage with no obvious LOS check all with ridiculous range. This isn\u2019t a challenge, it\u2019s just straight up impossible to handle. \n\nSide note: Why do eximus abilities effect defense targets anyways? They\u2019re already difficult enough being immune to all cc, I don\u2019t see the point in them nuking the defense target too.",

            "This will probably get buried under all the comments here but allow me to clarify a few things. \n\n1. The damage is perfectly fine on players and as I state IN THE POST I absolutely welcome a unit punishing AFK players \n\n2. My problem is not that it punishes AFK players, it\u2019s that the punishment ends the game for everyone who\u2019s actually playing properly \n\n3. Im not the hyldryn? I know how to play around the eximus? Im genuinely confused at how someone else going AFK is MY \u201cskill issue\u201d. \n\n4. Just to be absolutely clear: if the hyldryn went down as punishment for being afk, maybe even a noticeable amount of damage to the objective to encourage players to rally back to the area, that would\u2019ve been fine. It\u2019s the fact that the game ended faster than I could even notice the health bar depleting that\u2019s bothering me. \n\n5. No \u201cjust subsume\u201d is not a good counterpoint",
            "I see too many people saying \"don't afk on the objective!\" Like the person is just unaware, but what if they do it on purpose?\n\nThis is an extremely effective grieffing tool and will absolutely be used as such, let's see how those opinions change when people start trolling on purpose",
            "I agree completely. My genuine concerns with this isnt that it\u2019s too strong, it\u2019s the ability it gives the toxic players for griefing. Anyone who is targeted by the jade eximus who wants to fail the mission for everyone now can. I hate that there is toxic players in this community but it is a sad fact. I\u2019m assuming they are going to remove its damage on defense targets when they realize this. \n\nSide note, don\u2019t just say play solo. If an enemy is forcing the entire player base to play solo it\u2019s a problem with the enemy.",
            "I thought we collectively had a conversation about why being AFK on top of the objective is bad back in what... 2015?",

You stop to respond a message and you are dead, you want to write something to squad, you are dead, wanna use Mesa's 4 for more than 4 seconds, you are dead. I think its a cool mechanic but the damage is off the charts. I played Belly of the Beast on SP for a day and it looked like a green laser hydra, you shot 1 laser and 2 more would appear, i think i spent more time looking up and destroying lasers than playing the actual mission.",

Try discord!\n\n\nSimple answer is that it does less damage to the objective. \n\nThe same try hards saying this shit are the ones that complained about circle killing netracells. You *liking* that boring ass content that you HAVE to play solo since those bad teammates drove you off?\n\nThis will be patched though. I can\u2019t imagine DE will keep that in once the fails start rolling in. If not, this will be the first post of many\u2026",

It doesn't solve anything, just makes it worse.\n\nMeanwhile the majority is saying: \"skill issue\", \"yep I love the new anti-agk mechanic\".\n\nBro is the problem the afk? Kick them out asap instead of this bs. It's completely unnecessary and we already had 2 different eximus that targeted you with damaging bubbles. Rocket League for example doesn't even wait 1 minute to kick afk players.\n\n-Nothing stops the afks to be dead the entire mission while you complete it for them. Or respawn right at the end.\n-Neither them running some immortal frame like Revenant and doesn't helping for any reason.\n\nI know those things because I've been getting those afks on my squads, especially the first case. I got some prints and clips from a guy just running around on sp circuit, not that would change anything. Still I'm right here having my invisible operator taking dmg while reviving a squad mate, then instantly being dead when going back to frame, resulting on two people down."
