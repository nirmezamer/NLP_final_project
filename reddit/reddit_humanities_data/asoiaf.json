            "Does anyone know why GRRM isn't on WorldCon's website as a guest? I didn't see him listed anywhere. Is he just showing up? I don't usually pay attention to WorldCon, so I was wondering if it was normal for a high-profile guest not to be listed on their website.",
            "Have the Ironborn ever accidentally killed a would-be king during the drowned god crowning ceremony? I was watching Euron get crowned and they don't even give him CPR or anything. In the books or other stories have they ever mentioned doing the ceremony and the drowned person just didn't wake up?",
            "Why is there any confusion about how good Ned was as a fighter, when Bronze John could beat him so easily when he visited him in WF?",
            "Why did Sansa nearly cry when Littlefinger told her about lies and Arbor Gold?",
            "He\u2019s probably not going to give a talk at any panels or anything like that. I think he\u2019s simply going. I hope this doesn\u2019t ruin your Winds hype train.",
            "Not that I know of. I get the impression, anyone making their case at the kingsmoot are already drowned men. Aeron does reflect on the fact that he has never lost someone while drowning them (Aeron is s-tier god at CPR I guess), but that does create the impression that people do hard die during the drowning ceremony but they wouldn't be at the kingsmoot if that is the case.",
            "Multiple reasons: one is that in the show he is a much better fighter compared to the books (almost equal to Jaime Lannister). Another reason is that he defeated Arthur Daynr, the arguably best swordsman there was. This probably wasnt a fight with a fair ending but it still helps his reputation as long as we dont know what exactly happened there",
            "Oooorrrr... he is going there to announce Winds and to not spoil that they cant mention why he is there...",
            "I dont know how older WorldCons went and in which role he visited them back then.\n\nBut it is interesting that he is neither a Guest of Honor or a Special Guest listed on the website.\n\nMaybe the website hasnt been updated since he announced going there, maybe hs simply goes as a normal guest.\n\nWe do know he is going there, we have to wait and see about the rest",
            "When you type the title to your post include (Spoilers Extended) at the end. \n\nSo in this instance you would type out: \"Targaryens should've been Polyamorous (Spoilers Extended)\"\n\nIt belongs in whatever spoilers scope you want uncovered comments in the discussion to be limited to."

            "So Dunk and Egg is actually a Blackfyre rebellion show in disguise ?",
            "Seems unlikely. The Bloodraven one was more believable. An A-list actor seems way too expensive for this show. Budgets for these kind of shows are not what they were. I strongly suspect thats why House of the Dragon got cut to 7 episodes. Although this show wouldnt have to spend a bunch on CGI dragons.\n\nBut if they are casting Bittersteel already they must be having some form of Blackfyre Rebellion flashback in season 1. There is no other way he could appear. Bloodraven at least is mentioned in the 2nd book and features in book 3.",
            "I\u2019m glad we got the actor for Aemond that we have, but he looks exactly the way I thought Bloodraven should look. He would have been perfect for this. Even has one eye :)",
            "I think it's unlikely for 2 reasons: 1) He's too expensive, like they'd blow a third of the budget on his paycheck and 2) Even if they were to beef up Bittersteel's role, that's still too small a part for him. \n\nI would've bought it more if they'd cast him as Baelor, tbh. Not only is that a one-off role more suited for a bigger name but his death would've been more shocking, just like with Sean Bean as Ned.",
            "Normalize context I have no idea who anyone in this thread is talking about",
            "God, I hope Bittersteel is the world's most determined hater.",

            "A lister and early 40s with black hair and imposing figure?\n\nAdam Driver, is it you?",
            "Makes sense to introduce the Great Bastards a bit earlier. We know Dunk and Egg are involved in three Blackfyre rebellions, and the second and third novellas heavily feature two of the rebellions. The Blackfyres have always been an ever present thing in D&E. Even the first novella has Aerion as a possible WIP Blackfyre.",
