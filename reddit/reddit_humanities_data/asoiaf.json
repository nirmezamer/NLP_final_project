            "Does anyone know why GRRM isn't on WorldCon's website as a guest? I didn't see him listed anywhere. Is he just showing up? I don't usually pay attention to WorldCon, so I was wondering if it was normal for a high-profile guest not to be listed on their website.",
            "Have the Ironborn ever accidentally killed a would-be king during the drowned god crowning ceremony? I was watching Euron get crowned and they don't even give him CPR or anything. In the books or other stories have they ever mentioned doing the ceremony and the drowned person just didn't wake up?",
            "Can someone please tell me how to add Spoiler- Extended tag on my post. It seems to get automatically removed when I use only Spoiler tag. Also, is this title \"Targaryens should've been Polyamorous.\" belongs to \"Spoiler - Extended\" category?\u00a0",
            "More of a theory request/reseach question, but has there been any significant posts or theories about The Trident - and specifically it in relation to the Long Night?\n\nWe have Dany's dream about burning people clad in Ice, which is often touted as potential for the Trident to be relevant in TLN and is often thought of as having some relation to the recent Battle of the Trident between Rhaegar and Robert. However reading about Visenya's life (thanks to a thread featuring an amazing portrait of her) made me realise that there are possibilities for Torrhen Kneeling to be what is related - Torrhen marched from the North to the banks of the Trident, where he was met by three dragonriders and knelt instead of having further unnecessary bloodshed.\n\nSorry I believe this may be the wrong sort of weekly thread - I know there's one for 'new' theory ideas.",
            "I dont know how older WorldCons went and in which role he visited them back then.\n\nBut it is interesting that he is neither a Guest of Honor or a Special Guest listed on the website.\n\nMaybe the website hasnt been updated since he announced going there, maybe hs simply goes as a normal guest.\n\nWe do know he is going there, we have to wait and see about the rest",
            "He\u2019s probably not going to give a talk at any panels or anything like that. I think he\u2019s simply going. I hope this doesn\u2019t ruin your Winds hype train.",
            "Not that I know of. I get the impression, anyone making their case at the kingsmoot are already drowned men. Aeron does reflect on the fact that he has never lost someone while drowning them (Aeron is s-tier god at CPR I guess), but that does create the impression that people do hard die during the drowning ceremony but they wouldn't be at the kingsmoot if that is the case.",
            "When you type the title to your post include (Spoilers Extended) at the end. \n\nSo in this instance you would type out: \"Targaryens should've been Polyamorous (Spoilers Extended)\"\n\nIt belongs in whatever spoilers scope you want uncovered comments in the discussion to be limited to.",
            "Oooorrrr... he is going there to announce Winds and to not spoil that they cant mention why he is there..."

            "So Dunk and Egg is actually a Blackfyre rebellion show in disguise ?",
            "Seems unlikely. The Bloodraven one was more believable. An A-list actor seems way too expensive for this show. Budgets for these kind of shows are not what they were. I strongly suspect thats why House of the Dragon got cut to 7 episodes. Although this show wouldnt have to spend a bunch on CGI dragons.\n\nBut if they are casting Bittersteel already they must be having some form of Blackfyre Rebellion flashback in season 1. There is no other way he could appear. Bloodraven at least is mentioned in the 2nd book and features in book 3.",
            "Who is You-Know-Who",
            "I\u2019m glad we got the actor for Aemond that we have, but he looks exactly the way I thought Bloodraven should look. He would have been perfect for this. Even has one eye :)",
            "I think it's unlikely for 2 reasons: 1) He's too expensive, like they'd blow a third of the budget on his paycheck and 2) Even if they were to beef up Bittersteel's role, that's still too small a part for him. \n\nI would've bought it more if they'd cast him as Baelor, tbh. Not only is that a one-off role more suited for a bigger name but his death would've been more shocking, just like with Sean Bean as Ned.",
            "Normalize context I have no idea who anyone in this thread is talking about",
            "God, I hope Bittersteel is the world's most determined hater.",
            "Lord Voldemort?",
            "Nah lol this is all fan-made stuff. Not buying an A-lister. \n\nI posted the Bloodraven and Shiera casting leaks on here but once this came out it was so clearly fake I realized all of this was BS",
            "For what it's worth, I know it sound like I'm crazy, but either this person is messing with us (which I actually think is a very big possibility the more I consider it), or we might actually get Henry Cavill on our screens as Aegor River.\n\n1. The pseudonym name is the big clue. If you google \"if I go crazy\" the first thing that pops up is the BANGER song, Kryptonite by 3 Doors Down, with the full line being: \"If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman?\" Henry Cavill is probably most well-known for playing Superman.\n2. Henry Cavill is 41 (early 40s)\n3. He is an A-list celebrity\n4. He has the perfect build and even hair color for Aegor Rivers\n\nI don't know anything about his availability or upcoming projects, but...umm, yeah all the signs point to him? Almost TOO well maybe. Like I said, out of any of the recent casting blinds, this one seems most sus for how all the clues lead to the joke casting of all ASOIAF fan casts. \n\nI'm posting this here as my guess in case this thing turns out to be legit, but it honestly puts doubt into my mind on the veracity of all the recent casting submissions for Shiera and Bittersteel too. I think someone (or multiple people) are playing with us, and I applaud their originality in using deuxmoi to do it, LOL."
