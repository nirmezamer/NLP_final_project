Buyers could use this to better understand the home, and draw comparisons to their own family usage of the home.

Right now we're trying to learn all we can about people's problems and the best solutions currently out there.\n\n*Feedback requested*\n\nHas anyone here ever tried to monetize their unused domains in some way - and if so, how did it go? Has anyone got a backlog of domains they do nothing with, and what pains / confusion do you feel about this? Have you tried to monetise them, and why / why not?\n\nAnd here is a live example of someone who has registered a domain on Stakeweb - https://getricheventually.com/\n\n*Seeking beta testers* \n\nyes! You can sign up for free now. Just bear in mind not all features are live. \n\n*Additional comments*\n\nIt\u2019s due to launch officially in July with monetisation features.

We're feeling a bit stuck with progress moving forward slowly and our advertising efforts not quite hitting the mark as we hoped. Even after hiring Google Ads professionals. Most customers stay with us even after their trial runs out and are satisfied. But advertising is hard due to specific audience.

Each profile has its own privacy level, different content and different sets of followers. We bring you the concept of Social Portfolios. Powerful personal branding, local talent discovery, naturally relevant content (not dictated by algorithms) are some of the key features. We allow you to follow just what you are interested in another user and not everything that user shares. \n\n**Technologies used:**\u00a0Node, React, AWS Cloud, Server-less Architecture, DynamoDB, OpenSearch, Lambda, API Gateway, S3, CloudFront, CloudWatch, SQS, SNS, SES, IAM, KMS, Amplify Framework, and so on. Built to scale for any number of users, using distributed, highly scalable architecture and design patterns. \n\n**Feedback requested:**\u00a0We have a pretty good MVP that you could sign in to using Google authentication. Could you please sign in and provide feedback to let us know if you will be a user, if so why, what you like and do not like, what more you like to see, if you would consider being a paid user to use the advanced privacy options (invite-only, hidden profiles), more than 5 profiles on your portfolio, get advanced analytics etc. Any feedback is good feedback and you cannot hurt my feelings. I would love you to be brutally honest if that's what it takes for me to get the message.\n\nI would love to see some feedback specifically on the signed out / Guest user experience. Is it confusing as I am showing a fictitious user and her profiles in the guest mode for illustrative purpose? Any ways to improve the UX  for guest mode and beyond? \n\n**Feedback requested:** yes, please sign in using Google auth and get your preferred username. No separate sign up required. We provision a user account for you on your first sign in.",

Our app aims to bring together outdoor enthusiasts who want to share their passion for activities like hiking, cycling, running, and more. By providing a platform for users to connect, plan activities, and build a community, we hope to make it easier for people to find companions for their outdoor adventures.\n\n**Technologies used:**\u00a0Flutter, Firebase\n\n**Feedback requested:**\u00a0We are seeking feedback on the general concept of our platform as we are finding expansion and marketing to be challenging. Despite our efforts, it's been tough to reach a larger audience and effectively market our app to outdoor sports enthusiasts. We would appreciate any advice or insights on how to better market our product and attract more users.\n\nIt would also be good to get advice on marketing at this stage. Should we start investing money into marketing? So far, I've spent under \u00a330 on the project.\n\n**Additional comments:**\u00a0I am fairly confident the idea is validated. We have a small number of users that engage with the platform but when I share the idea with the ideal customer, they are visibly and very obviously excited by it.\n\n**Seeking Beta-Testers:** Yes, if you're interested.\n\nI would love to hear your feedback. Thank you."
