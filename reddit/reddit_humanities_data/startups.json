As the primary contributor to the development of our mobile application, I believe it is necessary to reassess the current split of the company.\n\nInitially, I approached a colleague with a technical background, assuming that their expertise would complement my own and facilitate the app's construction.I also  possess a background in technology and have been managing the project in other areas (marketing, software assessments and coordination)  and my colleague has not actively participated in the coding process. Their involvement has been limited to attending weekly checkpoints and contributing 50% towards operational expenses, such as cloud services, email accounts, and software licenses.\n\nDespite my colleague's lack of direct involvement in the app's development, I have diligently dedicated my time and effort to bring the project to fruition. During my recent period of unemployment, prior to commencing my new corporate role, I devoted 24 hours a day to the app's development. In contrast, my colleague has been preoccupied with their regular job and has not demonstrated a significant level of commitment to the project.\n\nRecently, we encountered a critical issue with our cloud provider that required immediate attention. I spent three days diligently working to resolve the problem, yet my colleague did not participate in any troubleshooting sessions or offer assistance.\n\nIn light of these circumstances, I propose a revision to our equity distribution. I believe that a fair and equitable split would be 75% for myself, reflecting my substantial contributions in both technology and financial investments, and 25% for my colleague, acknowledging their financial contributions.\n\nIt is important to note that we have not yet incorporated the company, and all agreements thus far have been verbal. I kindly request your guidance and wisdom in navigating this delicate situation.\n",

The seed startup\u2019s CEO was so incredibly cool to talk to. He was super humble and honestly i  felt like I could trust him immediately which is pretty hard for me to do bc I\u2019m always skeptical of executives who are a little too nice lol. I\u2019m kind in a bit of a dilemma bc I really like both companies. The comp/equity/benefits are pretty much close enough that I don\u2019t think it matters a whole lot here.\n\nI feel like when the team is smaller, there is obviously more work to do but there\u2019s also a lot less overhead and a lot more trust. And in my experience, when the team is larger, there is still a lot to do but the pressure is spread out over the team so there is more trust in the team as a whole but there is just more overhead which I can find frustrating at times. I was only an intern when the team was small so I don\u2019t know if Im just wearing rose-colored glasses as to how working at a small company felt like.",

            "The payoff from a startup is the equity. Join earlier, higher risk:reward ratio if they make it big. But, will they make it?\n\nYou\u2019re bang on about what diff companies are like to work for. IMO if you aren\u2019t focused on share options you should optimise for learning or getting skills in a direction you want to move in",
            "IMO it depends on career stage. If you're still very early in your career, the seed stage startup offers a potential faster path to seniority assuming the startup grows. If you're later in your career seed startups offer little in terms of growth and you'll likely need to be at a larger company to move up.\n\nThere is a natural tiering effect that when you move up tiers your seniority gets bumped a level down-ish. Like a VP at a series A might be considered a Director at a series B. Of course that's dependent on how you're able to sell yourself. But just something to keep in mind for career progression - I didn't know this and sorta painted myself into a corner of being too senior for A and too junior for B simultaneously and it is not a fun place to be.",
            "I personally prefer 50+ person. By 50 employees you can see what the culture of the company is going to be like and they\u2019ve just proven so much more by that stage.\n\nGoing in as employee number 5 is a complete lottery - and to be totally honest, what are the actual chances of vesting all the equity, the company succeeding in such a huge way, and being able to capitalise on your options? So rarely happens.",
            "It depends how much runway the 5 person startup has. Need at least 2 years .\n\nOtherwise the 50 member as it will provide you stability . Since they just raised series B it means they got some big folks supporting them and their idea.\n\nSame cannot be said about the 5 member one",
            "The perfect number is a balanced 3. Everything above this is complexity. Which is more cost and risk. Decision making changes. Vision alignment becomes more difficult. 3 individuals collaborating efficiently are creating exponential output. If this collaboration is maintained for a long enough period it creates sustainable energy. This is not symbolic. This is literal.",
            "100% This. But it's also worth considering your life situation. If you don't have kids and don't plan for it for the next couple of years. Also if you want to take risks or are fed up with internal politics.\n\nAnd going medium-large-sized company before going to a startup is also fine. As it makes it easier to pick choose the startup to join.\n\nAnother tip, consider when to leave when things don't work out. I stayed too long at a zombie startup. If it isn't growing, it's time to move on."
