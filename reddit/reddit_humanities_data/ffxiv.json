            "FFXIV to me represents a whole universe to explore. Loads of lore, lots of memorable characters, fragments of a world split across parallel dimensions, even the occasional sucker-punch right square in the feels to make sure you're paying attention.\n\nOne of the things I've been having an unexpected amount of fun with has been the glamor system. FFXIV players know that you can easily spend a couple hours in the character creator and any new look that catches your fancy is merely a vial of phantasia away, and being able to make your gear look like something else opens up a whole new level of creative expression when it comes to your character. Thanks to the glam system I can, with one character, be [a country girl](https://glamours.eorzeacollection.com/193504/cover-0-1667343481.png), [a combat medic](https://glamours.eorzeacollection.com/193495/cover-0-1667341815.png), [a biker chick](https://glamours.eorzeacollection.com/193448/cover-0-1667331289.png), [the devil incarnate](https://glamours.eorzeacollection.com/193509/the-devil-on-your-shoulder-1-1667344013.png), or even [a few different](https://glamours.eorzeacollection.com/257590/cover-0-1718416466.png) [flavors](https://glamours.eorzeacollection.com/192748/full-size-faerie-0-1667004919.png) of [faerie](https://glamours.eorzeacollection.com/192748/cover-0-1667004919.png).",
            "FFXIV has saved my life and that's not an exaggeration. My mental state is very bad and discovering FFXIV gave me something to live for. I started playing a little over 6 years ago, when I was in 8th grade. It has been one of the only constants in my life since then and serves as a way to keep me connected to myself as a human being. \n\nBack in December my partner started playing the game and has caught up recently. I've loved seeing their reactions to the game and I'm proud of how much they've improved. I'm so glad I get to share my favorite game with the person I love.",
            "To me it just makes me feel good to be logged in. Especially when my friends are around. It's a nice way to just escape from the real world for a while.",
            ">\"What does Final Fantasy XIV mean to you?\"\n\nBeing happier and at piece with my life.\n\nMy friend introduced me to the game in 2015 after I ran into him after years of no contact. My brother started playing not long after, and we all had good times playing together. My brother has since quit, and I'm currently unable to play the game, but FFXIV is a game I will always hold dear.\n\nLife has had its up and downs over the years, and FFXIV has always been a stable constant that I can go to, and remember that things can be better.",
            "This game basically got me through quarantine and some pretty chaotic moments around then. I'd already had some friends but getting them to play it most definitely strengthened our relationships and I don't know that we would've played anything else together as much as this. It's now become my go-to game for throwing on a podcast and just chilling.",
            "I used to play FFXIV with friends but they dropped off a while back. But even if I don\u2019t have any solid friends in this game, I really enjoy watching people run around, sit and craft, or just seeing them hanging out. The world feels alive. My FC organizes hunts and it\u2019s just amazing how much people love this game. \n\nI\u2019m really glad I started playing about 3 years ago now and am super excited for DT. Hope the game continues to grow.",
            "It's been a great experience where I've been able to meet some excellent people. I started a few weeks ago and on my first day I had a guardian angel following me around a bit, she was really sweet and level 90! I'm only level 20 but I'm having a blast.",
            "Big congrats to 1 million members! The subreddit has been through a lot like the game and here's to many more!",
            "ffxiv is a place to raid and talk with my best buddies !",
            "Anytime I try another MMO, I wonder why the hell are there so many restrictions to what you can do. As someone who likes a solo character, it means a lot to me that I can just keep returning to my WoL and not fee like they are another faceless pawn."
