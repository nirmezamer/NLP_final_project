        "content": "My girlfriend of 4.5 years, who I lived with for a year, recently broke up with me after cheating on me with someone in her program and left me to live with him. To make matters worse, he was her TA. \n\nWe\u2019re both grad students at the same university, however in departments with no overlap. Currently I\u2019m working on my thesis but the grief and stress of this situation has made me fall insanely behind. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if anyone has experience with long term/messy breakups during grad school. How do you regain your motivation? How do you navigate seeing them (as well as the person they cheated with) at the university? ",

            "Breakups during school are the WORST. Some people like to have school as a distraction, but for me trying to work while dealing with heartbreak and grief is just nearly impossible. My undergrad boyfriend broke up with me a few months before graduation and I had to go the last semester of my undergrad career just randomly seeing him around campus and feeling like I was being stabbed every time. Somehow though I managed to get everything done. It will probably be the same for you. Just go on auto-pilot the best you can. Try setting a timer for small chunks of time and say to yourself, \u201cI\u2019m gonna give my thesis my full attention for an hour and then take a break after that.\u201d And if asking for extra time is an option for you, don\u2019t be ashamed of doing that. \n\nIt gets better. You know that, but it always helps to hear. I met my husband in my PhD program soon after he and his previous girlfriend had broken up. Maybe your next person is right around the corner, or maybe you\u2019ll take some time for yourself first, but either way, it will get better.",
            "Go find the TAs mom and date her.",
            "I went through a horrific break up in grad school. It definitely made everything significantly harder and my way of getting over it was basically saying \"fuck this\" about everything else. Ultimately, I graduated and am better for it, but it was in my final semester and one of the roughest periods of my adult life. \n\nThe things that helped me were a therapist and a cat. The therapist basically gave me the space to be angry and sad so I could work on other graduate school things. That cat provided unconditional love that would never actually leave me.",
            "Breakups are the absolute worst. It's one of the harder things in life somebody can go through.",
            "When I was in grad school, those of us who were married got divorced and those of us who were single got married. Not to each other.\n\nGrad school is stressful. People change.",
            "Has a few.  Most schools have on campus counseling and psychological services.  Go talk to them.",
            "I\u2019m sorry. This has happened to me twice, once in undergrad & once in grad school. Both times were right before finals. It\u2019s hard and devastating so let yourself feel your emotions and know they are valid. I can confidently say each day gets \u201cbetter\u201d and one day you will look up and realize how much you\u2019ve healed. Hugs.",
            "Srry abt this man idk how to help. For me doing my thesis and focusing on it alone helped me escape but everyone is diff. Also shame shame on her wow",
            "I stayed at the school I went to undergrad for to go to grad school because my ex was finishing up there and we loved the area. She broke up with me 4 months after I started my first semester. Completely blindsided. I had never experienced something so painful before and I occasionally get kidney stones. \n\nLong story short, I stayed in bed for a month, got Covid, and then got a kidney stone. I still miss her.",
            "Wow she dated you for almost 5 years and left? Thats too long, must be tough. To be close to someone, and then next day your nothing, after you thought she was everything, now you gotta think of her as nothing. Crazy."

            "You need to contact your states licensing board. It\u2019s dependent on your states requirements, your program, the classes you took, etc\u2026 \n\nWe always required therapists to be eligible for licensure before hiring them, none with masters in psych ever came back after contacting the board so I never did find out what the conclusion was but I\u2019m guessing they were not successful.",
            "It\u2019s heavily dependent on the state but in general if your looking to be a clinical mental health counselor (I.E private practice therapist) then you\u2019ll need your masters in addition to supervised hours after you graduate. Also, you\u2019re going to have to pass licensing exams (typically the NCE or a state equivalent).",

            "Yes, I took 8 week classes for my masters. Sometimes it felt overwhelming just due to the pure content that had to be covered in such as short amount of time. For me, I had to curate a checklist each week of tasks and set aside specific study time - just think in only a few short weeks, you'll be one step closer to the finish line!",
            "I took quite of them in my undergrad during summers to get ahead, although only two concurrently at a time. \n\nIt can be hectic, but it\u2019s manageable as long as you don\u2019t leave everything to the last minute. If you do, you might end up doing all your assignments and multiple tests at once \ud83d\ude2c",

            "Depends on your discipline. Greatly.",
            "It would depend on how the program is set up. So mine if you did 2 every term without any breaks it works out to 30 credits in a year. They typically run 3 classes a term, but they won't let you sign up for more than 2 anymore. Briefly when they switched formats some people did 3, but they were full time students. Most of us work full time jobs in addition to grad school.",
