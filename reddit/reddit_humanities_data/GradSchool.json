        "content": "My girlfriend of 4.5 years, who I lived with for a year, recently broke up with me after cheating on me with someone in her program and left me to live with him. To make matters worse, he was her TA. \n\nWe\u2019re both grad students at the same university, however in departments with no overlap. Currently I\u2019m working on my thesis but the grief and stress of this situation has made me fall insanely behind. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if anyone has experience with long term/messy breakups during grad school. How do you regain your motivation? How do you navigate seeing them (as well as the person they cheated with) at the university? ",

            "Breakups during school are the WORST. Some people like to have school as a distraction, but for me trying to work while dealing with heartbreak and grief is just nearly impossible. My undergrad boyfriend broke up with me a few months before graduation and I had to go the last semester of my undergrad career just randomly seeing him around campus and feeling like I was being stabbed every time. Somehow though I managed to get everything done. It will probably be the same for you. Just go on auto-pilot the best you can. Try setting a timer for small chunks of time and say to yourself, \u201cI\u2019m gonna give my thesis my full attention for an hour and then take a break after that.\u201d And if asking for extra time is an option for you, don\u2019t be ashamed of doing that. \n\nIt gets better. You know that, but it always helps to hear. I met my husband in my PhD program soon after he and his previous girlfriend had broken up. Maybe your next person is right around the corner, or maybe you\u2019ll take some time for yourself first, but either way, it will get better.",
            "Yeah, I\u2019m currently going through a divorce at the tail end of my PhD. We were together through the length of my program. All seven years of it. It sucks ass, it really does. She said she didn\u2019t love me anymore.  But I\u2019m channeling the anger and heartbreak into finishing my last manuscript and my dissertation because I owe it to myself. Because I\u2019ve worked hard for this. And more importantly because **I** still love me. There are moments when it hurts too much to act, I won\u2019t lie. But it gets easier every day. You and I both got this, OP. We\u2019ll make it.",
            "i found out my wife was cheating 2 weeks before my dissertation proposal meeting. Passed but it was another year before I could actually start my data collection because i needed to get my head right. I talked through every bit of my proposal with her so her thoughts were present on every page.\n\nMy advice is to talk to your advisor about what you need and how to proceed toward success. Worrying about them on campus, well that's something you're going to have to find a way to put behind you. Don't let their relationship take anything from you, and just live as well as you can. \n\nTherapy can help too. I did some intensive imaygo therapy with a therapist at the on-campus counseling center and that helped me manage the first few months.",
            "I went through a horrific break up in grad school. It definitely made everything significantly harder and my way of getting over it was basically saying \"fuck this\" about everything else. Ultimately, I graduated and am better for it, but it was in my final semester and one of the roughest periods of my adult life. \n\nThe things that helped me were a therapist and a cat. The therapist basically gave me the space to be angry and sad so I could work on other graduate school things. That cat provided unconditional love that would never actually leave me.",
            "Go find the TAs mom and date her.",
            "My ex and I were living together. He was working remotely while I was doing my PhD, and he told me he was going to go stay with his mom for a couple weeks; we lived far enough away that he hadn't seen her in about a year. \n\nHe gets there, and stops answering my texts in a timely manner. No big deal, I'm busy, he's busy, I know he arrived safely, it's all good. \n\nA week after he left, his mom messaged me to ask how I was going to get all of his stuff to him because he's never coming back.\n\nThat was...not awesome, to say the least. I took about a week to sulk, did basically no work, and then rearranged all the furniture in the apartment so it felt like it was 'mine' and not 'ours.' Then I threw myself into attending conferences, seminars, whatever I could do to keep my mind off of it. \n\nI'm sorry you're going through this. Break ups are awful. Break ups in grand school are worse. I hope you start feeling better soon!",
            "I feel like half of our cohort went through a devastating break up (or divorce) in our first year. They had a hard time, but they made it through. I think it helped that everyone relied on each other. They were also transparent with the professors if they noticed they were falling behind. Thinking of you, OP.",
            "Breakups are the absolute worst. It's one of the harder things in life somebody can go through.",
            "Last year I was in a two week situationship that devastated me two months before my MS defence. I am sure it is not comparable to your situation but I was truly going through it and out of the loop for a month, couldn\u2019t do anything. I was crazy and sent myself to therapy. It worked and I got a little better for my defence. What helped me were 1) my friends and their support 2) emotional regulation methods such as radical acceptance. I am back to dating now but it\u2019s been extremely hard for me for a lot of reasons but I still use the emotional regulation methods and they help me a lot",

Also, you\u2019re going to have to pass licensing exams (typically the NCE or a state equivalent).",

        "content": "I apologize if this is a long post but any help is appreciated. \n\nI am currently a rising senior pursuing mechanical engineering student at a t20 university in the US. I also had a computer science minor. I finished a 2 internships last 2 summers. \n\nI took a few CS classes and loved it. I eventually dropped my minor and made it into an additional CS major to hopefully pursue a CS career. I am still able to graduate in 4 years due to the amount of credits I came in with. The problem is I am not sure how to proceed from here.\n\nTo describe my situation more accurately, I have been reading up on computer vision and I find that field very interesting. I made one project using openCV (nothing to complicated to fancy but it is there on my github). I am trying to work on another project to give me more leverage and looking for hackathons to participate in next sem. I am looking into grad schools for computer vision but since I have been working towards getting a manufacturing/CAD job, I am not sure what to do to become competitive for a masters in CS. I am hoping to get a research based masters so I am able to get it funded (do not have money to pay for it). \n\nI am also open to getting a job and returning to grad school a couple of years later. I think this option makes sense since my application for grad school is extremely weak.  But on the other hand, I doubt Ill be able to land a job where I can make a good app for computer vision or ML. \n\nI am wondering how did people with relatively weak applications decide on schools to apply to and/or what steps did you take improve your application and show your research potential. I am not only lost about what to do but also how to figure out what to do. \n\n If anyone has thoughts specifically about applying to schools for computer vision, this is a brief look at my applications: \n\nMajors: Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science\n\nGPA: 3.2\n\nGRE: not given yet\n\nApplication stuff: \n\n1. Research  related to computer vision but in a interdisciplinary field (biostatistics): It has been a month since I started working in this lab. I am kind of slow and trying to pick things up but so far not as well as I'd like. My friend joined his lab and has made so much more impact since they joined the lab, I worry I will fall behind. As for the work I have done, I have done preprocessing and managed to train one model I was asked to evaluate. \n\n2.  Senior Design: Making a positioning system for a device that will be used for research in a National Lab. Used CAD to design said machine and I am using C++ to program its functionalities. Hoping my second letter of recommendation comes form this client. \n\n3. Formula Club: Worked there a year ago. Used CAD to make parts for various purposes and run simulations occasionally. \n\n4. Jobs Held: Fast food worker in freshman year making sandwiches, Resident assistant for a year and a half, 2 summer internships, 1 more summer internship going on (more related to electrical engineering as I am working with AutoCAD, suppose to go on for a year)\n\n5. Course Work: Introduction to Machine Learning (A), Neural Networks (B), Big Data Systems (AB), (taking optimization and software security next sem and plan to take OS and Data structures and algos the sem after that)  ",
