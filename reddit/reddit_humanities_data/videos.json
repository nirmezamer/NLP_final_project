        "content": "Howdy r/videos,\n\nWe all know the robots are coming for our jobs and our lives - but now they're coming for our subreddit too.\n\nMultiple videos that have weird scripts that sound like they've come straight out of a kindergartener's thesaurus now regularly show up in the new queue, and all of them voiced by those same slightly off-putting set of cheap or free AI voice clones that everyone is using.\n\nNot only are they annoying, but 99 times out of 100 they are also just bad videos, and, unfortunately, there is a very large overlap between the sorts of people who want to use AI to make their Youtube video, and the sorts of people who'll pay for a botnet to upvote it on Reddit.\n\nSo, starting today, we're proposing a full ban on low effort AI generated content. As mods we often already remove these, but we don't catch them all. You will soon be able to report both posts and comments as 'AI' and we'll remove them.\n\nThere will, however, be a few small exceptions. **All of which must have the new AI flair applied** (_which we will sort out in the coming couple days - a little flair housekeeping to do first_).\n\nSome examples:\n\n- Use of the tech in collaboration with a strong human element, e.g. creating a cartoon where AI has been used to help generate the video element based on a human-written script. \n- Demonstrations the progress of the technology (e.g. [Introducing Sora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK6y8DAPN_0))\n- Satire that is actually funny (e.g. [satirical adverts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSewd6Iaj6I), deepfakes that are obvious and amusing) - though remember Rule 2, NO POLITICS\n- Artistic pieces that aren't just crummy visualisers \n\nAll of this will be up to the r/videos denizens, if we see an AI piece in the new queue that meets the above exceptions and is getting strongly upvoted, so long as is properly identified, it can stay.\n\nThe vast majority of AI videos we've seen so far though, do not.\n\nThanks, we hope this makes sense.\n\n**Feedback welcome! If you have any suggestions about this policy, or just want to call the mods a bunch of assholes, now is your chance.**",

Seems more reasonable, yeah? If someone goes to great lengths to create an actual, high-quality video, using AI in part or all of it, seems sad it couldn't be posted here.",

It's lucrative because you get invited places and get to vlog, it's also easier for views because everyone loves geeking out about the latest whatever.\n\nIt's also the same for this guy who's niche has become shitting on Apple. We all know what they are, and consumers have accepted the downsides of owning an Apple device which is no repairs.",
