        "content": "We have identified an issue that may cause the reported battery percentage being incorrectly displayed in G HUB for some of the following headsets:\n\nG533  \nG733  \nG933/G933S  \nG935  \nPro X Wireless\n\nPlease note this situation affects the reporting of the battery, but not the battery of the headsets itself.\n\nWe are actively working on a fix for the next update as part of our ongoing effort to resolve any product issues that arise.\n\nA temporary workaround is possible following these steps : \n\nStep 1: If the device is charging, unplug the charging cable  \nStep 2: Unplug the receiver, wait for a couple of seconds and reconnect it  \nStep 3: This will help to display the actual battery percentage.\n\nWe appreciate your patience and understanding as we tackle this issue head-on and we will keep you updated.\n\nDo not hesitate to reach out for support to our Customer Service team (at [https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us](https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us) ) if you experience any further problems.\n\nCheers!\n\n",

            "you can also close the g hub application, run it again and then it shows the correct percentage (G733)",
            "my g935 is being reported as \"inactive\" despite being on and able to play sound",
            "where do you see the exact battery percentage in ghub? all i see is the battery condition.",
            "It would be nice if you actually fixed g hub so it would open. I have tried every \" fix \" and still can't get it to open. Basically bought a mouse I cant even use",
            "the battery percentage is constantly wrong for both my keyboard and mouse. also, the RGB for both is completely broken on the new G HUB software. I have been forced to find a use the 2021 version of G HUB that I found in this sub-reddit actually. y'all really need to simplify this app down and make it easier to use while working correctly. really infuriating spending all this money on keyboards and mice for them to not work right since i got them.\n\nALSO, my F2 key IS CONSTANTLY YELLOW, the dynamic lighting windows setting or something interferes with G HUB and random keys on my keyboard just stay lit as yellow and its just so obnoxious. can yall please update the software this shit has been going on for too long",
            "Its been glitched for ages the battery percentage in ghub its so wrong and doing those steps only last until ya shut down ya pc then restart then its back to glitching out i got a g935 btw",
            "No, it doesn't work anyway. There was a charge of 14%, restarted - 99%. I restarted it again - 2%. We need to wait for the update.",

            "I would say the 535 are at least 103 better than the 432. Plus two G's, you can't really argue with facts.",
            "Well, do you want a wired or a wireless one?",
            "5 is a higher number so go for that",
            "both kinda suck imo. logitech headphones are pretty ass from my experience",
            "I went from the G430 to a G535 and I gotta say I prefer the comfort of the G430 but the sound of the G535 is better.",
            "I got the G432s recently cause my old G230s from 4 years ago finally gave in. Was thinking of getting the G535 too, but all Logitech wireless headsets Ive had in the past started having issues with the wireless connection after some time, so I decided on the G432s. So far so good, they are comfortable and sound good. The only thing is theyre a bit of tight and leaving red marks around my ears after prolonged wear, but this is cause my head is big and they will stretch out after a while like akin models always do.",
            "I'm currently wearing the G432's (bottom one) whilst typing this message. The audio itself is amazing, however from my experience the built in mic breaks long before the headphones do so I'd consider a standing mic alongside it? \n\nTLDR: I own the G432, they're very good headphones, I don't know about the other pair",
            "Ive had 432 for years and years until one day they just broke. Theyre very light and sound is good as far as I remember. The only issue Ive had that the cable from headphones to the volume slider was sooo bloody long it was ridiculous. Its like 2m to the slider and then another 2 m to usb. Long cable is good, but I remember thinking why the hell is not the slider higher. I didnt have the other one so cant judge. Just throwing my 2 cents in.",
            "wireless is better at least to me. i hate wires",
            "Depending on your budget I would look at purchasing an Antlion Audio ModMic Wireless on Amazon. It's $140 bucks USD but you can pair it with any pair of headphones and it sounds like a podcasting microphone. However, I used to have a pair of G432's for work and they were awesome if you're sticking with either of those two."

My issue is that i have profiles loaded and customized for the G402 for a lot of my games, and i want to transfer these profiles so that the 502X will follow them.   \nIs there a native tool/function in GHub that let's me \"copy-paste\" the profiles of old mouse to new mouse ? been clicking around for 30mins and cant find anything. \n\nThanks !",
