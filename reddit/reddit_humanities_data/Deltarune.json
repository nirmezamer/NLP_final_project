Until confirmed otherwise, Kris should be referred to with they/them pronouns.\n\nIf you're wondering why it matters, or anything else, for that matter, [this very well-written post* contains the answer to almost any question you could have; please give it a read!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/uj8m5i/frisk_chara_and_kris_are_nonbinary_and_why_it) It's not long, and is broken down into easily digestible images.\n\nIf you get into arguments about it, nothing is going to become of it. It will be removed. It just makes a lot of extra work for the mods, and makes a bunch of people angry. So please don't do that!\n\nThank you for understanding <3 If you still have any questions, feel free to ask them under this post, assuming I haven't had to lock it. Trans rights are human rights, have a nice day, bye! \u2764\ufe0f\n\n*^(Although the post specifically discusses the topic of Kris being nonbinary, which is not considered an objective fact by the mod team\\*\\* & subreddit rules, it effectively answers many questions about Kris using they/them anyway, so I've linked it.)",

            "I think something some people should think about is why people may accidentally misgender Kris in the first place\n.\nFor example, in my case I thought Kris was a boy because they're appearance in both the light and dark world looks quite boyish to me, and also their behaviors that they are seen or are mentioned doing in-game seemed so to me as well, things such as liking knifes and pulling pranks like flushing bath bombs in the toilet and butting ketchup on their arms and saying it's blood.\n\nI also thought that them being called they/them by other characters in-game was simply because they didn't know what Kris' gender was or that it was a case similar to Frisk and Chara where it's up to interpretation",
