Until confirmed otherwise, Kris should be referred to with they/them pronouns.\n\nIf you're wondering why it matters, or anything else, for that matter, [this very well-written post* contains the answer to almost any question you could have; please give it a read!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/uj8m5i/frisk_chara_and_kris_are_nonbinary_and_why_it) It's not long, and is broken down into easily digestible images.\n\nIf you get into arguments about it, nothing is going to become of it. It will be removed. It just makes a lot of extra work for the mods, and makes a bunch of people angry. So please don't do that!\n\nThank you for understanding <3 If you still have any questions, feel free to ask them under this post, assuming I haven't had to lock it. Trans rights are human rights, have a nice day, bye! \u2764\ufe0f\n\n*^(Although the post specifically discusses the topic of Kris being nonbinary, which is not considered an objective fact by the mod team\\*\\* & subreddit rules, it effectively answers many questions about Kris using they/them anyway, so I've linked it.)",

            "It's interesting to me that players deciding kris' gender against their (kris') will fits with the narrative of the game, too",
            "as someone named kris who uses they/them pronouns, i got VERY freaked out for a second til i saw what sub i was in",
            "i can't believe people unironically make such a fuss over how people refer to some fictional character",
            "What a kind hearted and friendly reminder, I sure hope nobody takes ill to it, for sure.",
            "it's also canon so people just be wack ig",
            "I occasonally screw up with that, which is a bit embarrassing given that I'm a trans girl and should be used to using the proper pronouns lol.",
            "I kind of wish that the sidebar announcement reminded people to use canon pronouns for *all* characters, because Kris isn't the only one who gets misgendered... A *lot* of the game's they/them and she/her characters get misgendered as he/him (funny how that works).\n\nSad that this announcement was needed again, but not surprising.",
            "Kris looks a lot like a dude",
            "Yeah, I know, but one little mistake about gender, pronouns or sexual orientation, and guess what? The whole fucking r/deltarune law enforcement squad is at my door. It's just so fucking dumb that people say \"omg you used he/him to refer to kris once youre disrespectful!!1!\" while they bombard me with just as disrespectful comments. I love this game but the community sometimes makes me sad.",
            "Thanks for the reminder. But this sub is so violently transphobic that they won't listen and will continue to come up with any pathetically desperate reason as to how Kris somehow isn't nonbinary. It's sad that nonbinary people have to prove that they exist and that woman and men are just accepted automatically. Like so many people on this sub pull the \"I'm not transphobic but...\" garbage. Like no, you are and you're not hiding it as well as you think you are. Trying to come up with reasons to misgender someone and deny them their nonbinary identity is transphobic. Accepting Noelle as a girl based on her appearance and being referred to as she/her but not Kris, Napstablook and Seam being nonbinary because never look at the camera and say they are nonbinary is transphobic. Is it that hard to see someone being referred to as they/them and just respecting that's who they are? Stop trying to fit everybody into unnecessary boxes for your own convenience."
