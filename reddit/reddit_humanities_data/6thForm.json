            "The FM grade boundaries should be ok this year. I plotted a graph of the A\\* boundaries for the FP1 and FP2 option each year, y, against the year, x, on Excel and then added a trendline. I found that the trendline that matches the data best (R\u00b2=1) is a quartic, specifically y=-(17/2)x\u2074+(137419/2)x\u00b3-(416558331/2)x\u00b2+(561205938349/2)x-141765277942067.

The only exception I know of is Cambridge. \n\nBut if you\u2019re not taking FM and you had the option, are you sure you want to study maths?

You will have a hard time without it, since many concepts in further maths are reencountered in the first years of uni and it is very helpful to have seen them at least once beforehand.\n\nPlus, if you want to go to a top uni for maths but don't want to study FM, then ask yourself how does that work?",
