            "Hi, ghost mod here. I've been hearing about this and think it's bullshit, but assumed my mod status must've been revoked long ago with how long I went unable to dedicate time to this sub.\n\nRegained access to my account, and discovered I'm still technically a mod, but sure enough, I was absent long enough that the system doesn't register me as active right away- I was thus initially unable to take the sub private in support of the protest, but thought I'd at least give this post whatever extra traction the pinned position may bring.\n\nIt's a bittersweet feeling, since I'm in a much more stable place in life that would enable me to do much more with the sub, expand the team, and provide a smoother, better experience for everyone interested (which is a huge amount of people at this point, holy shit)- but these changes don't fare well for the site in general.Thanks for reading. I'll post updates / plans for the mod team as soon as there are any... If you have any suggestions, I'll be keeping an eye on the modmail inbox again for the foreseeable future.  \n\n\nEDIT: The sub remained private from June 15th until just now- I've unlocked it after receiving the same threat from the site's administration that other moderators have received, about forcefully replacing them due to the protest efforts."

It's not an official rule but this really isn't a sub to hire anyone, people come here asking for ideas and will get bombarded with DMs.\n\nTalk to your tattoo artist about designs, do not hire a nobody with a brand new Reddit account with a name like hungry-aardvark1234 (currently unused name as an example). Most artists worth your time are going to have a waitlist, they will not DM you on Reddit with an immediate offer. And it's part of your artist's job to help come up with what they'll tattoo on you **and** not all of them will tattoo someone else's art anyway.\n\nIf you really want to show them a drawing to help with visuals, check out r/DrawMyTattoo where someone can sketch your idea for free. Ignore anyone trying to charge you, that's money that should go to your artist.\n\nIf you're an artist who attempts to find clients in this sub, don't. You look fake and desperate, you're one of dozens spamming people with \"I can help, DM me\" so OP can't even tell who's legit.\n\nAnd I'm not here to argue this point, so if you have a problem with this announcement, that's too bad. I'm here to try to keep this sub a friendly place, people shouldn't have to worry about getting scammed.",

            "Ok, you asked for honest feedback so i'll tell you what I think: it looks like a rash. A really, really painful rash. Maybe it's where the paler pink is applied that gives it that 3D \"raised skin\" effect, but I would suggest to go over it with a darker color, or to have just a bit of black to define the petals, because right now I don't think it looks good :(",
