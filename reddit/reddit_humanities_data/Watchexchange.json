If you have suggestions, concerns, or improvements, please let us know in this thread!\n\nThe mods are always open to discussing the rules in place here at r/watchexchange, but having the same discussion every month isn't useful. With that in mind, we've created a working rule wiki, which has some discussion, comments, and common questions. Read there, *then* bring your questions here.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Watchexchange/wiki/rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watchexchange/wiki/rules)\n\n# New Mods\n\nWe have an ongoing collection of moderator candidates. You are invited to complete [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfNpjiQfS9dhUuZrS9Epn-EET1NiEw_aSAdom_2yilSiJUULA/viewform). We have no timeline for adding one or more moderators, and no guarantees are made. New moderators are always added in a limited capacity (ie probationary period). We would very much like help with this sub. If you believe you would be a good help, please complete the form.\n\n# Other META Threads\n\nYou can see other \\[META\\] threads [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watchexchange/search?q=title%3A%22META%22+&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all). Before March 2019, META threads were weekly. After March 2019, META threads are monthly.\n\nThe \\[META\\] tag will be used only by moderators of r/watchexchange; anything that needs to be discussed can be posted in the META thread.\n\n# Please Discuss!\n\nDiscussions of watches is permitted - price checks, etc. WTB posts may go in the weekly [WTB](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watchexchange/search?q=title%3A%22WTB%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all) thread.\n\n# Specific topic for This month\n\nNone",

            "Im thinking of listing my YM for sale here, I dont have any transactions here yet. Though, I have a couple dozen successful transactions on pmsforsale sub.  What would be the best method of having a successful sale as a new seller, any tips appreciated!",
            "I'm new here, so sorry if that question has some obvious answer I missed.\nHow can I report a scammer to the mods that have not yet been active in this sub and hence not been banned?",
            "How would you verify a first time seller with no transactions? They have provided extra photos with the same background as the post. Just not sure of a good way to not get scammed.",
            "Are Romain Gauthier watches frequently traded on this subreddit?",
            "Hi,  I messaged the mods, but I also thought I'd ask participants:  I want to create my first posting, but the interface won't let me add a description of my watch. I can only post the title, media and a \"link.\"  In fact, a box in the upper right corner specifically says that I can't post a description of my watch.  I don't understand why it is not desired to post a description of a watch?  My account is now older than 30 days and I have positive karma. Thank you for any insight.",
            "Hello - simple question - how do I build positive Karma within watchexchange - is it just posting comments under watches that are for sale that I believe are good deals, beautiful pieces etc. over time?  Sorry if I'm asking the obvious...    Thanks in advance.",
            "Another dumb question - I understand that I put the description and details as a comment to the watch I want to post with the proper format \\[WTS\\] (brand).... etc.   But what \"link\" am I suppose to insert? - is it a link to say imgur for the timestamp or.....?   I noticed that posts often have the timestamp link in the description comment.  Sorry for my confusion, and thanks in advance!",
            "Buyers of WatchEx: what sort of photos do you want to see when you open a listing for a watch? What sort of photos do sellers **not** include that drives you crazy? What photos would you like to see more of with each listing? \n\nThanks!"

If you receive an automated reply from this subreddit *read it thoroughly*.\n\n**Most scams in r/watchexchange happen because of WTB requests.**  \n\n**Buyers**:  *Require* that someone responding to your WTB comments *in this thread*.  Commenting *here* proves that they are not banned from this sub. On the other hand, if they can't/won't/offer excuses/*any other thing* then just **they are a banned scammer!** You can manually check if they're banned on the Universal Scammer List by searching the [USL](https://www.universalscammerlist.com/). (This is a good habit to be in anyway!)\n\n* **Do Not Reply** to DMs of users that *have not commented* on your WTB post. This is a **safety measure** to ensure they are **Not BANNED** from the subreddit. \n* Make the seller prove possession of the watch. If the seller can't produce a photo of the watch with the date and a spoon or potato or today's newspaper or whatever you choose, then **you are being scammed**.\n* An unknown seller *requiring* Friends & Family (or any other means where you will not have recourse (Zelle, Crypto)) means **you are being scammed**.  \n* Do not communicate via Reddit chat or Discord. Chats can be deleted! Sellers communicating via chat or Discord means **you are being scammed**.\n* If you feel like a deal is so good that you need to act fast before someone else gets that deal, **you are being scammed**.\n* If the seller has zero transactions, or no history in r/watchexchange, or *anything is the least bit abnormal*, **you are being scammed**.\n\nYou *should* be skeptical of people responding to your WTB!!!\n\n# Do not let a scammer be more diligent than you!\n\n---\n\nYou can see other [WTB] threads [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watchexchange/search?q=%22Weekly+Want+To+Buy+Post%22+author%3Azeroair&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all).\n\nThe [WTB] tag will be used only by moderators of r/watchexchange; any WTB needs shall be handled in this thread.",
