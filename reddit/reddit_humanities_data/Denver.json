I was in the second lane from the right driving as usual, getting annoyed that there was a bit of late night traffic. Suddenly, I heard a thud and saw a lady get thrown out of a moving car in the leftmost lane, landing in the second to left lane, right next to me.  She was just lying there in the middle of the highway. If I was one lane over, I'd have run her over. By the grace of God, the driver in her lane was far enough to stop without hitting her. I had to keep driving because I knew if I'd stop, I could get rear ended and slide into her or just cause more chaos and prevent her from getting rescued.\n\nMy friend called 911 and they were being weird about us not knowing the specific exit. They said they had multiple calls so I'm hoping she was saved. I can't find any information and I want to know the resolution. It was heartbreaking and I hope she is able to get help because whatever situation led to her lying in the highway like a stay piece of poorly restrained cargo must have been quite toxic. \n\nDoes anyone have any information or witnessed this?

It literally straddled a border with Arapahoe County. We got frustrated and gave up. It should not be this hard to get help.",

            "I noticed that the author tried to frame it as the northside being rebranded fairly recently but I've lived in Denver since summer of 2000 (and before that grew up in Longmont) and as far as I know,  it was already being called Highlands even back then.  That's almost 25 years ago now.  There is always a lot of talk on housing articles about \"naturally\" affordable homes or neighborhoods and I don't really know what they mean by that beyond just that Denver didn't used to be so popular so house prices were \"naturally\" cheaper.  That was true across every neighborhood though. Do they really think that the cheaper neighborhoods wouldn't go up in price as the rest of the city does? And is it really that good of a thing to have some neighborhoods so disenfranchised that they are wildly cheaper than others? That seems like a recipe for creating places where even the residents don't want to live there anymore.  Like some people will say things like they don't want their neighborhood to get a new rec center or playground because that's \"gentrifying\" it. \n\nI don't know.  It just seems crazy to me to actively want your own neighborhood to not have amenities though I understand that it makes people nervous that they'll be priced out. But it feels like they want it to stay bad or be dangerous and it makes me sad to think you can't have it both ways.  \n\nAs far as the article goes, it didn't seem to have much of a point except to say teachers need help with their housing. My reaction is to get in line. So many people need more housing. We need more units! \n\nI also agree that the dude making that much money complaining about \"barely\" getting by was eye roll inducing.  It's ok to empathize with others on how expensive everything is but maybe just don't talk about your extremely high salary while you do it.",

Single family homes in that area would still be $3k or more a month easily.
