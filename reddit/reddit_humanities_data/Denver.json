When you call about fireworks, it gets sent out as a pending call, but it's so low in priority that you essentially might as well not even waste your time. It's gotten to the point that I've even seen police agencies post on social media to only call about fireworks if someone is injured or property is on fire. So basically they're saying nothing preventative will be done, we just have to wait until Marshall 2.0. Great.",

        "content": "I am still reeling from seeing one of the most crazy, horrific things at around 10 PM. I was in the second lane from the right driving as usual, getting annoyed that there was a bit of late night traffic. Suddenly, I heard a thud and saw a lady get thrown out of a moving car in the leftmost lane, landing in the second to left lane, right next to me.  She was just lying there in the middle of the highway. If I was one lane over, I'd have run her over. By the grace of God, the driver in her lane was far enough to stop without hitting her. I had to keep driving because I knew if I'd stop, I could get rear ended and slide into her or just cause more chaos and prevent her from getting rescued.\n\nMy friend called 911 and they were being weird about us not knowing the specific exit. They said they had multiple calls so I'm hoping she was saved. I can't find any information and I want to know the resolution. It was heartbreaking and I hope she is able to get help because whatever situation led to her lying in the highway like a stay piece of poorly restrained cargo must have been quite toxic. \n\nDoes anyone have any information or witnessed this?

We called 911 to report it and try to get an officer to get the guy off the road and they kept telling us to call different agencies because they couldn't figure out whose jurisdiction the sign was in. It literally straddled a border with Arapahoe County. We got frustrated and gave up. It should not be this hard to get help.",
            "Did you get more news about what happened? I was the car right behind and had to slam on my breaks/swerve not to hit her. I pulled over and gave a statement to the Police but \\~10 min later the cops still were not there and traffic just resumed? I imagine this means someone took her to the hospital? The police never called me back to say if she was okay.",
            "Denver 911 is shit. I called them because of 2 homeless guys fighting with knives on the 16th street mall in front of the Tabor center. They wanted a street address. 16th Street mall in front of the tabor center should have been enough information to dispatch an officer or two. This was 5 or so years back.",
            "wow, very tragic to have witnessed that. Thats something one won't forget for a while if ever :(\n\nedit: I will say anything happens on I25 anymore I call \\*csp for the state patrol.. they seem to respond quicker then 911 folks. I've had to do that countless times for accidents\\\\road rage\\\\etc on I25. Not sure of jurisdiction, but the CSP phone people seem more competent and get things done better\\\\resources routed, etc.",
            "Unfortunately, unless the news covers it, we probably won\u2019t know what happened. Back in 2015 I was the first bystander at a fatal car accident.   I talked to many EMTs , the police department, Ithe coaches after I went to redo my first aid course, they all said they have to live with not knowing half the time, if their patients live or die.",
            "As with many important jobs, 911 dispatch pay is garbage, they are over scheduled and under staffed.  I worked in a city government for years and they were begging me to go into dispatch or go the police academy because they are chronically understaffed with those jobs.  \n\nIt\u2019s a deliberate choice to underfund public safety agencies.  Since the pay and conditions are so bad, the people that stay are usually not the best and brightest.",
            "I had this scenario once. Driving down sixth. The man jumped out of the passenger seat into the highway. I was able to avoid him, and was with him when paramedics arrived. He was aware when he landed, told me he and his wife had been arguing and he couldn\u2019t take it anymore so he leapt out. I can tell you from the way his legs looked, I would doubt he walked again. It still upsets me 20 years later. BTW, the wife didn\u2019t brake,  stop, or come back to the scene. Horrific.",
            "I feel such regret reading things like this. A few months ago at the crossing of Smith and chambers I jumped in front of the A line. I'm still realing. I felt so bad the moment I came consciousness for the driver. I don't remember anything past actually getting hit. Then black for what felt like days. I read a news article a week or two after that someone did the same thing with the same train and succeed and I felt pain for his success. I felt pain his family had to go through it. I felt as mad as I was about it.....why would I ever put someone through that again. It was so....unclearly at the time selfish. I hope this lady is OK and so are her family. I hope everyone here is safe. You're here for a  reason.",
