This includes posting a meme. If you want to post a picture, post the link to it. \n\n2) Don't editorialize titles.  A title should reflect what is in the link/thread.  A title of \"hilarious\" doesn't do so. \n\n3) No more pictures without any context.  Just posting a picture of an old player is low effort and will be removed. Again this includes memes.  \n\n4) No posts solely for the purpose of sexualizing players, fans, etc.....\n\n5) All Playoff Brackets at this link... https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1c84h3o/mod_announcement_all_playoff_brackets_and/\n\n6) It is bigotry and unacceptable to make fun of a religion in our comments. If it was judaism or Islam, you wouldn't do it and would expect to be banned. For some reason, some of the posters here think its okay to make fun of Mormons in the comments.  This is a reminder.... this violates rule 6 and will be an insta-ban. \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/about/rules/\n\n7) Don't blame entire fanbases, troll them, or take shots at them.  Fanbases are diverse things and a few fans never represent all fans of a team.\n\n8) No, who should I cheer for posts.  Strangers on the internet don't pick your team.  Watch games, watch highlights, find the team you fall in love with.  Your team picks you, not strangers on the internet.",
