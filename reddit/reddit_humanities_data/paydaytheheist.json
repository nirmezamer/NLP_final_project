            "did you know that the boys are in blue today \nstay subscribed for more tips and tricks",
            "Any tips for playing smg on overkill? They deal sooooo little damage. [PD3]",
            "Any good builds for PD3 to do Overkill solo? I always find myself going down and running thru resources too early and always fail. Any advice?",
            "(PD2) Framing Frame Day 3. I spent like 30 hours looking for the phone in stealth, even checked some guides, it literally not spawned anywhere. On restart, spent lots of time looking for last hard drive. I know spawn locations more or less. Can devices be bugged and not spawn, or am I just blind?",
            "IS there any known workarounds for stuff not unlocking?\n\nThe adaptive armour and shock grenade are locked for me despite being well above the level needed.",
            "Rlly depends on the SMG you use, but ftmp just hit headshots.  \nWhat SMG are you using?",
            "FIK PC9 , signature to be clear. Problem is I am having a hard time killing even with headshots.",
            "SMGS are probably the worse guns you can use on OVK, you need to hit your mark precisely to do any sort of meaningful damage.\n\nYou could try investing in some edge skills though, such as enforcer and sharpshooter.  \nThey recently removed cutting edge's increased armor penetration stat in trade for being able to pierce +1 enemy, which is almost useless unless you're using an AR or sniper, so that pretty much just lowered the amount of choices you have on OVK.",
            "I haven't tried this on overkill, but I use gunslinger for SMGs on lower difficulties to guarantee a stagger with each shot. It lets me deal with groups by quickly staggering everyone before focusing down kills. It's kind of fun. Not sure how effective though."

            "Still prefer payday 2\u2019s hoxton tbh. Hox and Houston are gonna look pretty damn similar in 3 if Houston isn\u2019t changed\n\nAlso clover looks a bit fucked in 3 for some reason",
            "The only one who actually had a glowup imo was joy",

            "I'll be honest despite them being on an abomination of a terrible engine payday 2s faces look better than 3s imo",
            "The OG gang looks way more old, and in the case of Hoxton he looks like he started to eat more and better, probably gained a few kilos.\n\n\nClover looks like she got more into punk.\n\n\nJoy looks...more Joyless somehow. More grown up, but somehow feels more emotionless than her blank stare in PD2",
            "I don't think you could've chosen a less flattering photo for PD3 Joy lol\n\nImo, all of them barring Hoxton and maybe Wolf look better in 3",
            "looking for whoever's providing the good stuff that the people that say the PD2 faces look better because damn there's no way y'all saying that sober"
