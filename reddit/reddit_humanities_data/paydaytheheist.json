            "Any tips for playing smg on overkill? They deal sooooo little damage. [PD3]",
            "Any good builds for PD3 to do Overkill solo? I always find myself going down and running thru resources too early and always fail. Any advice?",
            "(PD2) Framing Frame Day 3. I spent like 30 hours looking for the phone in stealth, even checked some guides, it literally not spawned anywhere. On restart, spent lots of time looking for last hard drive. I know spawn locations more or less. Can devices be bugged and not spawn, or am I just blind?",
            "IS there any known workarounds for stuff not unlocking?\n\nThe adaptive armour and shock grenade are locked for me despite being well above the level needed.",
            "Rlly depends on the SMG you use, but ftmp just hit headshots.  \nWhat SMG are you using?",
            "FIK PC9 , signature to be clear. Problem is I am having a hard time killing even with headshots.",
            "I haven't tried this on overkill, but I use gunslinger for SMGs on lower difficulties to guarantee a stagger with each shot. It lets me deal with groups by quickly staggering everyone before focusing down kills. It's kind of fun. Not sure how effective though.",
            "did you know that the boys are in blue today \nstay subscribed for more tips and tricks",
            "iirc they removed the challenges that were supposed to unlock them.\n\nI had to contact a SBZ staff (sbz_rafi) on Discord to get the Shock Grenade on my account.",
            "SMGS are probably the worse guns you can use on OVK, you need to hit your mark precisely to do any sort of meaningful damage.\n\nYou could try investing in some edge skills though, such as enforcer and sharpshooter.  \nThey recently removed cutting edge's increased armor penetration stat in trade for being able to pierce +1 enemy, which is almost useless unless you're using an AR or sniper, so that pretty much just lowered the amount of choices you have on OVK."

            "Finally a mode I can play without dealing with jerkoffs who refuse to play the game beyond sneaking. All the effort in the world of making a nice smooth working transition from quiet to loud gone to waste otherwise.",

            "Sit in a corner, wait it out, hide in a bathroom and take afew pot-shots. I'm fine with that.\n\n  \nJust don't vote to restart, execute civis and cuss people out because you blew stealth 80% way through a heist with 4 plate armor, unsilenced primary and secondary weapons, the whole shebang.\n\n  \nIf you want to learn a heist in stealth, you have Solo mode!\n\nIf you want people to carry you through a heist, you don't have to vote to restart! Let them do their thing and help where you can! Going loud IS possible. It can also be fun!",
            "The current glaring issue with solo beside favors is spawn rates in loud. \n\nTTS overkill loud is probably my lost played mission. I know how many cops have spawned on me on this map since launch. What I saw the past 2 days were Jules levels of cops spawning on top of each other and literally flooding the hallways. \n\nThis had nothing to do with the topic, I just wanted to say it's good for solo stealth, even though the lack of favors makes art gallery stealth very tedious, but loud is currently broken.",
            "For some reason a lot of people seem to prefer stealthing a heist, even with transition improvements added to this game (compared to PD2). I hope it can be resolve with servers browser/lobby types"
