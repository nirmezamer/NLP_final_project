        "content": "Dear all,\n\nI read a similar post a while ago and saw the positive responses and decided to do one for myself.\n\nI am going to level another toon to level 60, thinking about going SF to make the process more authentic. I am a YouTuber, who typically does different content, but have lately been enjoying WoW Hardcore quite a bit. For Season 3 of my Hardcore Journeys, I wanted to change things up and level as a duo. \n\nFor that I would be looking for a friendly partner to level together with. Here are a couple of thoughts around the journey:\n\na) We'd be leveling on Stitches (Horde side)  \nb) I would likely roll a Warlock, open to level with any class really  \nc) Your experience in the game doesn't matter as much, I am happy to partner with a complete beginner  \nd) Would appreciate a working microphone on your side, so that we can communicate  \ne) You should be okay with being a Youtube series :)  \nf) I would love to play in the evenings Central EU time, if you have time (late-ish) in the evenings that is a plus  \ng) Would love if the characters would level together for most of the time (i.e. no major side-leveling from either person)\n\nIf you are interested, feel free to PM me - I am really open about ideas, if you have a fun concept in mind.\n\nTake care and stay safe everyone :)  \nBest regards,  \nsyken ([Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFDN6mKHHiOtGPxyaz9Mk0A))\n\n",

I had two accidents on my two first Ally toons, and I decided to go back to horde side which I knew \"better\" thanks to SoD (until lvl 40 zone).\n\nI just hit 50 with my shadow Priest, I healed every dungeon from RFC to ZF and I'm now wondering which are the deadliest trap coming from 50 to 60 ? I've just complete Hinterlands elite, and I will complete one or two quests to hit 51 in Feralas. \n\nDo you have any advice on the new zone I will discover soon ? I'm really excited about Un'Goro which is a zone I want ti discover since the begining. \n\nCheers mate, and hope to see you in NekRosh EU soon. \n\nFazeo, ",
