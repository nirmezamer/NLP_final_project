I had two accidents on my two first Ally toons, and I decided to go back to horde side which I knew \"better\" thanks to SoD (until lvl 40 zone).\n\nI just hit 50 with my shadow Priest, I healed every dungeon from RFC to ZF and I'm now wondering which are the deadliest trap coming from 50 to 60 ? I've just complete Hinterlands elite, and I will complete one or two quests to hit 51 in Feralas. \n\nDo you have any advice on the new zone I will discover soon ? I'm really excited about Un'Goro which is a zone I want ti discover since the begining. \n\nCheers mate, and hope to see you in NekRosh EU soon. \n\nFazeo, ",
