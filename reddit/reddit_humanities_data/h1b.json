        "content": "**Links:**\n\n* CEAC Status: [https://ceac.state.gov/CEACStatTracker/Status.aspx](https://ceac.state.gov/CEACStatTracker/Status.aspx)\n* USVisaScheduling: [https://www.usvisascheduling.com/en-US/](https://www.usvisascheduling.com/en-US/)\n\n**On the day of appointment:**\n\n* Make sure you take only the required documents and not carry other unwanted stuff. Any items especially that have bluetooth capability is not allowed. This includes smart watch.\n* Make sure your appointment confirmation shows the date of appointment. In my case when I printed it out from usvisascheduling website last minute, the date did not appear because of an issue with the server (it showed an error message in the date instead). So it is better to get the appointment confirmation earlier and make sure date and time do show in there.\n* Make sure you have a copy of I797. I was asked for a copy and show the original.\n* Make sure you take the visa photo the same day or at most a few days before. They reject the photo if it is older than a few days.\n\n**Post submission of documents:**\n\n* Each stage in the process from now on can take indeterminate amount of time. Some steps have taken days for some but weeks for some others. \n* The method of getting the status at each stage is slightly different. Refer to the following table on where to check\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Step|Status in CEAC|Status in USVisaScheduling|Meaning|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|No status|Delivered to Post|Immediately after the submission, you may not see the CEAC to reflect that they have taken the documents and passport.  Also, see Note1 below the table.|\n|2|Application Received |Delivered to Post|This is called AR1. Consulate seems to have received the application and this is the ack for that.  The case created and case last updated date will be the same at this point in CEAC status.|\n|3|Application Received|Delivered to Post|This is AR2. The case last updated date gets updated which is a good sign. This seems to mean that they are actively processing your case. See Note 2.|\n|4|Approved|Delivered to Post|This means that some processing has happened. Note that the case could still be refused after this state. |\n|5|Issued|Delivered to Post|This means that consulate has approved your case and visa is being stamped in the passport. See Note 3. |\n|6|Issued|Origination Scan|This means that the passport is leaving the consulate either to VFS (for pickup) or to your door (for delivery)|\n|7|Issued |Ready for Pickup|This means that the passport is in VFS and is ready for pickup.|\n\nNote 1: In Step 1, until your passport data is fed into the system, you need to enter NA in Passport number and first 5 letters of Surname to get the status as \"No Status\"\n\nNote 2: At this point, some people seem to have been asked for more documents (221g). This post does not cover that path.\n\nNote 3: At this point, some poeple have been refused. Some people seem to have received instructions on how to go with the next steps.\n\n**Picking up the passport:**\n\n* Make sure you have a valid ID proof to collect the passport. The commonly accepted ones seem to be Aadhaar, PAN, Drivers License. \n* If you don't have any Indian ID proof other than passport, make sure you take a copy of your passport. \n\n**Disclaimer**: \n\nAll these are based on my observations and notes / comments from other people in reddit, chat groups and other sources and is not official. Some of these may not even be correct. This post is intended to help. If there are corrections, please do comment and I'll try to update.  \n\nHope this helps.",

            "I remember when he was leaving the office, in his last year, his administration came up with proposals to replace the lottery system with wage wage-based system. In that system, h1b would have been given to whoever had the highest salary meaning all the h1b would go to finance people, managers, and tech people who have high salaries. This system almost went into place but Biden won the election and his administration said we don\u2019t have a system in place to make this kind of selection. So they pushed it for a few years. I even heard during Trump's time, they were more stricter with h1b and green card process, issuing RFIs and more rejections compared to the Biden admin.\n\nEdit: Also, he cancelled h4 EAD, so none of the h1b spouses could work. This was later reversed by one of the courts.",
            "As someone who was on h1b before during his time, I would say it would be a PITA. MAGA people will claim h1bs are taking away jobs that most of these whiners aren\u2019t even capable of doing. The arbitrary RFEs, and uncertain i797 approval expirations are just some of the things I hate.\n\nThe only silver lining in those RFEs was a lot of fly-by-night consultants were reduced (doing proxy interviews among others)",
            "It was only during his 4 years that I had to add a whole essay and a table describing how my job connects to the courses I took in college 6 years ago when trying to EXTEND h1b.
