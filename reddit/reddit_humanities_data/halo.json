            "I think the suit does happy endings for him already so no worries there",
            "Microsoft will probably find a way to keep John active for the next 20 years or whatever. Despite of (or perhaps because of) how beloved John is, the people who own him will never stop looking for ways to make him turn a profit.",
            "Best ending is he and Blue Team fake their deaths, leave the UNSC, but continue to make a difference every now and then. Retired, but occasionally active.\n\nThe we get like a 30 year time skip, a new war - I always fancied the san shyyuum coming back for revenge with Forerunner tech, maybe even teaming up with surviving Forerunners idk - and we the player get saved by old man Master Chief or some shit again IDK",
            "I doubt he's going anytime soon. But tbh, I wouldn't want them to cop out and give him some ride out into the sunset ending that feels cliche. Chief's story deserves better. He's my absolute favorite character and I think giving him some cliche cookie-cutter ending would be a travesty. But thats just my thoughts.",
            "Just don't kill him off like James Bond was. Halo 3 was the best ending to the Masterchief. I hope they do it again where he \"sacrifices\" himself, but there is no definitive proof here dead. It has to end with us being able to say, \"Spartans never die... they're just missing in action\"",
            "Just send him back out into space in cryosleep. *Halo 3* already nailed the perfect ending for the character. Honestly, just do that again. No finality required.",
            "I think it\u2019s probably more likely Chief will sacrifice himself and die a broken man but one whose sacrifice is for the betterment and success of not just humanity but all sentient life in the galaxy. I really like to think that it is Chief alone who holds the mantle of responsibility. In fact I think it would be a great end to his arc. \nI don\u2019t think Microsoft would do this and it would certainly piss off a lot of diehard fans but maybe the best future for the universe would require the halo array be triggered. Look at it this way: if the UNSC come out on top and truly dominate the galaxy then it\u2019s very likely it\u2019ll become more totalitarian and carry out acts of genocide as they\u2019ve planned to do before. A galaxy ruled by the Banished would be in a constant state of war with splinter factions and internal power struggles caused by the inherent structure of the Banished actively fosters instability. The Created would more than likely impose galaxy wide tyranny with the halo array and use it to enslave all the organics. The flood, should they return, would quite literally be the end of all existence. The future of the halo universe is incredibly bleak from where Infinite left off and with the introduction of the Endless and the implication of time travel it\u2019s possible those potential futures could be seen and Chief may realize how fucked the galaxy is, unless he decides to make the ultimate sacrifice for future generations to create a galaxy where all species live in harmony, I think it\u2019s most likely he would make this decision if the flood made a comeback too. Making the same choice the forerunners made but with different motivations.\nI could be entirely wrong of course, but I think it would make sense from the more grandiose perspective that puts aside short term interests that results in long term suffering in favor of a more cosmic perspective on the fate of the universe.",
            "It always bothered me that his armor in the Forward Unto Dawn miniseries looked so much like Mk VI. It\u2019s pre-Mark V, it should look more like that.",
            "Hes already survived pimp slapping a nuke to activation. Multiple Halo ring activations. Atriox. What can kill him?",
            " I hope he has a soldiers send off but one where he embraces his humanity. Maybe like a small contained story where he dies protecting a small  insurrections colony or something along those lines"
