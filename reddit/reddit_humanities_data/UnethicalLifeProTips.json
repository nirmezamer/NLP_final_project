Could this be done realistically or would they likely extradite me back to my home country? Also if those crimes do not land a large incarceration time, then what other crime could I commit that would land me in a Finnish prison?\n\nAnd this is totally not a cry for help I swear lol. I'm just goofing around I swear. Like you know is it possible?",

        "content": "I\u2019d like to preface with this: I don\u2019t care if timesheet reporting for salaried employees is regular or common, I do feel personally disrespected.  I also had to sign an agreement that I am not allowed to complain at all or I would face corrective action\n\nI work a specialized technical position in a building which staffs 12 full time management positions, and two technical positions. They tried to shut me up when I brought up an issue, by trying to make me report my hours instead of helping in any way. I had an issue with this, since no other salaried employees were required to prove their hours, and I politely refused. I told them it seemed like they wanted to discourage me from bringing problems up in the future, and felt like they were targeting me. \n\nThis EXPLODED and ended up with me in extremely hot water, in a room with four management staff. I won\u2019t include details, but jealousy/pettiness took it to an ugly and personal place. My effort and attitude is nothing short of A+, and I am very very happy with my work, but they would rather fixate on my hours in the building.\n\n\n\nNow, 10 months later, they hired a supervisor over my head, and my new boss requires me to log my projected schedule at the beginning of the week, AND a log of my hours for the past week. He said this will be indefinite, and I am still the only person expected to do this. I will face corrective action if I refuse.\n\nAs a salaried employee with a robust set of specialized skills, they are taking advantage of me by comparing my hours to theirs and using it against me. I work up to 12 hours a day, sometimes 7+ days a week, and occasionally have very light weeks. My job is rapidly changing every day, with a TON of pressure to do everything right the first time. Also I am not entitled to any overtime in any way (I used to be, but they changed it.)\n\nI\u2019ve been told by the highest authority here that my job is easier than everyone\u2019s, and it\u2019s not fair that sometimes I get shorter weeks, while they have to work Monday-Friday, 8-5. I was told this by 3 other superiors as well in the meeting, and was also called greedy, which I never will get over. It\u2019s clear they will use these hour logs against me. I think they will try to move me to hourly pay, and I want to make it absolutely ridiculous on the timesheet and skew their perception (and to be super passive aggressive. I would rather be terminated than quit)\n\nOn top of my 40 hours, I have added 3 hours to each day to play videogames on my laptop at my desk. What else can I do to comply on my own terms. \n\n(Liquid ass and piss disk didn\u2019t work, so no need to suggest)",

If you get fired you won't be able to put them as experience and taking a step back professionally will not be worth \"getting even\". \n\nAlso if you are as integral as you say quitting will give them a bigger headache than allowing them time to replace you and fire you. \n\nI switched teams at my company due to a shitty manager, every member of my former team was forced to absorb my workload, so they all quit shortly afterwards. The fallout of having the whole team leave made the manager look wayyyy worse than if I had just waited and gotten fired eventually.",
