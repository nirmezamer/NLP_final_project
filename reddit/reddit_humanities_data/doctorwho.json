Now, he said that the note in question (asking for the Doctor to be given a big scene earlier in *The Church on Ruby Road*) was a good note, but that does not mean that their notes are just friendly advice and that they have no sway at all.

They aren't bringing in their own writers and producers into the mix, but they absolutely are signing checks which ultimately dictate certain aspects of the finished product and as a result, need to be happy with those decisions being made.",
            "Whether Disney has a direct say or not is irrelevant. BBC knows that for Doctor Who to continue it has to succeed in America. \n\nThat's why The Doctor has gone from a science nerd who's a bit odd, to an ultra trendy, good looking guy who knows all the pop culture references. \n\nThat's why it's now season 1 again and why he wears a different outfit every episode. \n\nDoctor Who may not technically be a Disney show, but it's absolutely been written to appeal to Disney audiences."

When Moffat couldn't have Paul mcgann or Christopher Eccleston he created the war doctor.\n\nIn interviews at the time though he said he didn't believe the romantic 8th doctor would destroy galifrey.",
            "Moffat said some bullshit about the 8th being too nice but the truth is probably that someone at the BBC wanted a big name to justify the (relative) big budget they were about to spend on production, marketing and distribution.\n\nPeople may not remember, but they bought a week of YouTube front page advertising, declaring it Doctor Who week or something like that, and they sponsored videos for a lot of big channels. That alone must have been a pretty penny. So Moffat had to justify their investment by getting an actor that non-Whovians would recognize. \n\nI'm still pissed about it. John Hurt did an excelent job, obviously, but Mcgann was right there! \n\nAt least they threw us a bone with Night of the Doctor, the shout out to every 8th Companion at the time, and the announcement that they'll finally allow Big Finish to play in the Time War.",
            "BBC didn't want any of the Classic Doctors back in a significant role for the 50th anniversary special (though they made an exception for a cameo for Tom Baker, the most popular Classic Doctor). And this probably went double for Paul McGann who was the least well-known Classic Doctor among general audiences.\n\nHonestly, if Paul McGann is now much better known among the fandom, and there's a clamor for his return today, its because Moffat (re)introduced him perfectly with the 'Night of the Doctor' minisode. In general, the last decade has seen a much greater openness towards acknowledging Classic Who on the show, as seen with the returns of 80's era companions, and many of the Classic Doctors having cameos in 'The Power of the Doctor'. You can argue that it all started with Moffat bringing Paul McGann back (having also previous brought back Peter Davison).",
            "Steven Moffat had promised the BBC that the 50th anniversary would be \u201cthis year\u2019s Olympics,\u201d and when Christopher Eccleston declined to take part, Steven *did* suggest bringing in one of the other Doctors (presumably McGann would have been his first choice, since it just makes sense), but the BBC didn\u2019t think that was a big-enough move for the high-profile event they were expecting.\n\nStarting at 17:40, [here\u2019s](https://youtu.be/ZOfIIqb8Uhg?si=Sas3_YPV8vpg2yw8) Steven talking more in-depth about the chaotic development of the 50th anniversary special, and the decision to ultimately introduce a new Doctor played by John Hurt.",

This is why I think *Night of the Doctor* was the right approach- we see him try and fail to continue in his old ways, and recognise he was going to have to reinvent himself as a Warrior.",
            "I think McGann would have been a terrific choice. (I would have missed War Doctor though, because Hurt was tremendous.) And I an easily see the \"romantic\" making the hard choice to destroy Gallifrey, quite possibly due to the companion's death. They could have easily tweaked the setup of events on Karn. The Sisterhood revives the Doctor -- give him the bad news \"you've only got about a week, our powers have limits\" and a flask with some elixir to restart the regeneration process -- and he decides to end the war. Story goes on as normal. McGann alone in TARDIS, \"Physician heal thyself.\"",
