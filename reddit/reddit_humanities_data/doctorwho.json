This is why they absolutely do have some (perhaps only theoretical) influence. We know for a fact that they give RTD notes that he acts on. Now, he said that the note in question (asking for the Doctor to be given a big scene earlier in *The Church on Ruby Road*) was a good note, but that does not mean that their notes are just friendly advice and that they have no sway at all. That's just not how co-productions work.\n\nSo sure, Disney doesn't now have sole rights to the show and isn't the sole producer but it's a co-producer with the rights that implies.",

I do not believe the level of influence has been revealed.",

            "Disney don't own the show but they do fund it now and absolutely do have creative control over it as a result. They aren't bringing in their own writers and producers into the mix, but they absolutely are signing checks which ultimately dictate certain aspects of the finished product and as a result, need to be happy with those decisions being made.",

Where's your family? Are you an alien? What do you mean two hearts? What do you mean granddaughter?) We didn't see any of the good middle bit that shows us why they're so bonded.",

Ncuti was barely there for the filming of 73 Yards and Dot and Bubble. Ruby was unconscious for half of Boom. Rogue kept them apart all episode. The Legend of Ruby Sunday and Empire of Death were all about the plot, no time for character moments. So what does that leave? Space Babies, where we got a bit of the usual introduction, and the Devil's Chord, where we at least got to see Ruby's musical skills used. So out of 9 episodes, really only 2 had any substantial Doctor/Ruby moments.",
