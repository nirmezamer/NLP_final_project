However, Galleon crews who mismanage the wind will suffer the largest penalty.\n\n### Sailing into a Headwind\n\n* Ships heading into a direct headwind will now be required to angle the sails to reduce the wind resistance and maintain their speed over longer distances. Sailing with sails flat into the wind will no longer be optimal.\n\n### Double Barrel Pistol Balancing\n\n* The damage of standard and charged shots from the Double Barrel Pistol has been increased.\n\n* A charged shot now takes less time to charge, allowing players to prepare this heavy-damage attack more quickly.\n\n* Hip firing the Double Barrel Pistol is now slightly more accurate.\n\n* Reload time has been reduced, allowing players to reload more quickly and get back into the action.\n\n### War Chest Commendation Balancing\n\n* Following the launch of Season 12, the team has adjusted a number of Commendations from the War Chest, reducing the criteria needed to unlock the various Grades. Players with progress already above the newly rebalanced levels will be required to perform one more action to refresh the Commendation progress.\n\n* When using the Double Barrel Pistol to defeat enemy threats, the Blown-Away Bones, Blam of the Damned and Double Deep Trouble Commendations will now progress more quickly.\n\n* Utilising throwing knives to attack Gunpowder Skeletons will now progress the Keg Knife Kaboom Commendation more quickly.\n\n* Players using scattershot against enemy threats will find the Holey Wood Holes, Scatter Bones, Spooky Spread and Peppered Meg Commendations have been made easier to obtain.\n\n* Using the Bone Caller to attack Skeleton Ships will now progress the Skeleton Squared Commendation more quickly.\n\n* Crews cashing in the Horn of Fair Winds will now find the amount needed for the Storm Sale Commendation has been reduced.\n\n* Players using harpoon tightropes to transfer treasure to their ship will now progress the Carry On Lootin\u2019 Commendation much more quickly.\n\n* The Rib Roast and Title Fight Commendations requiring players to best Skeleton Lords in combat have now been switched to provide progress to the whole crew when defeated, rather than only rewarding a single player.\n\n### Hit Registration Improvements\n\n* Recent improvements to hit registration for player encounters have now been brought to threats encountered within the world, providing an improved ranged combat experience against skeletons, Phantoms and Ocean Crawlers.\n\n---\n\n# Pirate Emporium\n\nShow off your personal style with purchases from the Pirate Emporium!

            "* Crews purchasing Captains Supplies from the shipwright should now consistently find their supplies are delivered to their ships barrels.\n\ni can't recall how many times they said they \"fixed it\" only to find out next hourglass fight I have no food",
            "I hope they fixed the ship name not displaying when spyglassing, or when coming out of the water during HG.  \nI also didnt see it mentioned that steam players often are locked out of being able to invite anyone to guild.  Weve had a guild for weeks we cannot invite anyone to unless we sign into the MS version.",
            "Silent Boarding as we know it may be fixed now. There's a new sound that plays when you grab boarding ladders on boats. I tried the silent board methods I know and it no longer works.  It sounds like a chest being dropped on the deck or something. I tried ctrl+f searching and didn't see anything in the patch notes about it and I can't see why they wouldn't make a note about it. At least it's fixed now",
            "Can we fix not getting supplies you paid for from the merchant too? It's been 1000 years ",
            "Anyone know the new total for finishing the wind caller comm?",
            "So if I understand the ship speed adjustments, the brig no longer has optimal sail/wind position to outrun a pursuer? The sloop had against the wind, galleon with the wind, and brig with the cross wind. Now the galleon as the speed advantage with tail AND crosswinds? Where does the brig fit in now? I see that the galleon needs strong sail management for cross winds but it feels like a strange balancing choice.",
            "No more shores of gold checkpoints to dive to outposts :(\n\nLair of Lechuck spits me back out to an outpost when I go through the portal",
            "Does anyone have the new amounts of what the coms have now been lowered too? Ive looked around and cant find anything.\n\nI dont know why they don't just include numbers in the notes tbh",
            "Ok, so going straight into the wind. Could someone clarify as there doesn't seem to be specific info on this? \n\nDo you put you sails flat into the wind like before (dummy sails, I think they called it) or do you rotate them all one direction or the other?"
