Some other useful links to follow:\n\nFor bug reports please comment on [3.0.2 Update | Bug Reports Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seaofthieves/comments/1dk8dqe/20_june_2024_302_update_bug_reports_megathread/)\n\n[Previous 3.0.1 Discussions Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seaofthieves/comments/1cm9hg3/7_may_2024_3001_update_discussions_megathread/)\n\n[Safes Seas FAQ](https://www.seaofthieves.com/community/forums/topic/161991/safer-seas-faq)\n\n[Sea of Thieves 2024 Preview Event](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seaofthieves/comments/1bjfbhq/sea_of_thieves_2024_preview_event/)\n\n[Sea of Thieves Season 12: Official Content Update Video](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seaofthieves/comments/1cdl2g5/sea_of_thieves_season_12_official_content_update/)\n\n[Sea of Thieves Explained - Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL51podOC3ZN0M7mvsI8vdfGSn1RN32JFU)\n\n---\n\n[Official Release Notes](https://www.seaofthieves.com/release-notes/3.0.2)\n\n# Gameplay Improvements\n\n### Ship Speed Rebalancing\n\n* The Sloop, Brigantine and Galleon have all received a set of speed changes, balancing each ship type and placing more emphasis on ship direction and sail management during naval encounters.\n\n* In a straight tailwind scenario, the Galleon with its three sails angled to the wind will now gain the advantage, followed by the Brigantine, then Sloop.\n\n* In a straight headwind, the Sloop will have less wind resistance from its single sail and will be at an advantage over the Brigantine, and then the slower Galleon.\n\n* Sidewind and crosswind scenarios will also now favour the Galleon when all sails are catching the maximum amount of wind. However, Galleon crews who mismanage the wind will suffer the largest penalty.\n\n### Sailing into a Headwind\n\n* Ships heading into a direct headwind will now be required to angle the sails to reduce the wind resistance and maintain their speed over longer distances. Sailing with sails flat into the wind will no longer be optimal.\n\n### Double Barrel Pistol Balancing\n\n* The damage of standard and charged shots from the Double Barrel Pistol has been increased.\n\n* A charged shot now takes less time to charge, allowing players to prepare this heavy-damage attack more quickly.\n\n* Hip firing the Double Barrel Pistol is now slightly more accurate.\n\n* Reload time has been reduced, allowing players to reload more quickly and get back into the action.\n\n### War Chest Commendation Balancing\n\n* Following the launch of Season 12, the team has adjusted a number of Commendations from the War Chest, reducing the criteria needed to unlock the various Grades. Players with progress already above the newly rebalanced levels will be required to perform one more action to refresh the Commendation progress.\n\n* When using the Double Barrel Pistol to defeat enemy threats, the Blown-Away Bones, Blam of the Damned and Double Deep Trouble Commendations will now progress more quickly.\n\n* Utilising throwing knives to attack Gunpowder Skeletons will now progress the Keg Knife Kaboom Commendation more quickly.\n\n* Players using scattershot against enemy threats will find the Holey Wood Holes, Scatter Bones, Spooky Spread and Peppered Meg Commendations have been made easier to obtain.\n\n* Using the Bone Caller to attack Skeleton Ships will now progress the Skeleton Squared Commendation more quickly.\n\n* Crews cashing in the Horn of Fair Winds will now find the amount needed for the Storm Sale Commendation has been reduced.\n\n* Players using harpoon tightropes to transfer treasure to their ship will now progress the Carry On Lootin\u2019 Commendation much more quickly.\n\n* The Rib Roast and Title Fight Commendations requiring players to best Skeleton Lords in combat have now been switched to provide progress to the whole crew when defeated, rather than only rewarding a single player.\n\n### Hit Registration Improvements\n\n* Recent improvements to hit registration for player encounters have now been brought to threats encountered within the world, providing an improved ranged combat experience against skeletons, Phantoms and Ocean Crawlers.\n\n---\n\n# Pirate Emporium\n\nShow off your personal style with purchases from the Pirate Emporium!

            "I hope they fixed the ship name not displaying when spyglassing, or when coming out of the water during HG.  \nI also didn\u2019t see it mentioned that steam players often are locked out of being able to invite anyone to guild.

            "Not seen much discussed about server stability improvements during PvP. Games have been a laggy mess with players' jitter all around your boat when in a fight. Shot reg is still a huge mess. Doubt, this will ever get fixed. In terms of receiving supplies after purchase, this has been an issue for ages. Been \"patched \" more times than I can remember, never fixed the issue before, Doubt it will this time.",
            "So if I understand the ship speed adjustments, the brig no longer has \u201coptimal\u201d sail/wind position to outrun a pursuer? The sloop had against the wind, galleon with the wind, and brig with the cross wind. Now the galleon as the speed advantage with tail AND crosswinds? Where does the brig fit in now? I see that the galleon needs strong sail management for cross winds but it feels like a strange balancing choice.",
            "It\u2019d be nice if we could just dive to an outpost as an \u201cofficially-sanctioned\u201d form of server hopping. All types of players would probably benefit from that option, I imagine."
