I also got selected for Officer- R&D role at CPCL during campus placements. Both pay the same. Basic considerations- HPCL- Vizag, more diverse crowd, risk of boring role, large organisation moving towards sustainability. CPCL- Chennai, less diverse, part of IOC, Research or Sustainability role (my interest), my girlfriend you placed here.\n\nI am confused and need to decide quickly. Request your suggestions and experience. Let me know if I can share more details."
