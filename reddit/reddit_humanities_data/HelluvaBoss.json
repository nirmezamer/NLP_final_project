            "Without realizing it, this is exactly how I wanted the aftermath of Full Moon to be handled. There was no episode-long gap away from Blitz and Stolas to focus on different characters and draw out their fight. There was no escalation due to them being purposefully dense. We got several lovely, frank conversations of growing self-awareness and the realization that it's only step one. Good, they recognize what the issues were. Now they get to grow and actually work on them. I also loved how Verosika was handled. She's pissed, and rightfully so - and she acts like a pissed off person who really loved Blitz and still wants to see him make things right.",
            "I should not have laughed as hard as I did at Stolass previous Halloween party.",
            "Lmao at Mrs. Mayberry getting it with the woman she took a hit out on.",
            "I can only applaud the decision to not have them get back together immediately. \n\nHoly shit. Stollas getting a fun night and feeling desired again? Sign me the fuck up!",
            "Cant believe they brought back Do [a] sex.",
            "Also, Stolas has a cult. I suppose every Goetia and sin has a cult. And does Charlie have a cult?",
            "Martha and Mayberry. That I didn't expect.",
            "I feel bad for everyone who analyzed the stolas singing clip from the trailer, correctly surmized they were on earth on Halloween but then understandably cane to the incorrect conclusion that itd only happen in the Halloween episode lol",
            "Wow! First of all, congratulations to all the Verosika simps on being right! I really thought when we got the full story she'd end up looking at least a little shitty herself, but nope.\n\nAlso, is anyone else kinda conflicted because they still want Blitz and Stolas to get back together, but on the other hand, that succubus guy is HOT?",
            "So I'm going to be the first to ask, who thinks Stolas got laid with 'Better than Blitzo' guy? I like to think he did, but it's going to be a comparatively healthy one night stand kind of arrangement."

        "content": "Okay this might make zero sense but hear me out okay?\n\nSo in Apology Tour during the fight between Verosika and Blitz we see this clip of them sitting down. Blitz is sitting with his legs between the poles creating an impression of him behind bars like in a Jail cell. Verosika however kicks one of the poles out and sits in the open space left behind.\n\n (See second image for visual details)\n\nCould this be symbolism for their feelings? Verosika being open about hers while Blitz keeps all of his locked up behind his happy facade?",

            "Those glorious thighs wouldn't fit between the bars. But I like that you weren't thinking horny, first time in this sub",
            "That makes sense. I kinda think it was because Verosikas legs couldnt fit between the poles.",
            "i highly doubt thats why, Verosika is just much larger than Blitz, and wouldnt be able to fit comfortably the way he is sitting",
            "I wouldn't put it past the team to use symbolism in this way. They've been pretty good at doing small details and symbolism. I think on the surface level it is because she can't fit between the bars. But then again they also could have just made the bars wide enough for each of her legs to fit through.\n\nThe thing that stuck out more to me is Verosika sitting down to be on almost the same level as Blitz. Which shows her trying to see from his POV and understanding him, rather than looking down on him from the top and talking down to him.",
            "Reminds me of those stupid twitter beta male things with the triangles and the arrows on couples pics",
            "Ooh, I like that interpretation. Similarly, I think it could also be that Blitz is still imprisoned by his past, whereas Verosika's way is free for her to move on now. That and the bars probably couldn't contain her glorious thighs",
            "Yeah, I think you're right tbh",
            "Nah, it's probably because verosika's thicc thighs wouldn't fit in between the fences unlike blitz's skinny legs",
            "Blitz still feels trapped. Verosika is free.",
            "Verosika looks better with short hair.  \nYes I know its tied up in a tail & off to the side.  \nJust zoom in a bit on her face to see what I mean."
