            "As much as the ending was basically known, it made me cry, the way Blitz is shouting, the way he talks about it like it's happened before, and Stolas' few words saying goodbye. Emotional.",

            "Hi everyone! I'm the Spindlehorse executive assistant and I hope you enjoyed the episode. On a personal level I think it has the best facial animation out of the show so far, ESPECIALLY in that last scene.\n\nAnd don't worry about another break. Remember that next episode is coming in June and is my personal favorite of the season.",
            "I LOVED BLITZ AND FIZZ BEING BUDDIES TOO HEARTWARMING AFTER EVERYTHING \ud83e\ude75\ud83e\ude75",
            "So, IMP now technically answers to Asmodeous.\n\n\nAnd they just got in shoot out with a group of angels in his Ring, right in front of his club, got a bunch of succubi killed in the crossfire and even deliverately destroyed an apartment building.\n\n\nI get a feeling for why they might have to go on the run.",
            "The way Blitzo was secretly tensed all episode because he thought Stolas was bored of him and for a moment thinking it was true when Stolas asked for his book back \ud83d\udc94\ud83d\ude2d",
            "I'm glad Loona has a speaking role again",
            "* FINALLY we can hear Stolitz's First Time in Forever duet without screaming! Tho it sounds a lot different than from the con audio. Not that I'm complaining\n* Surprised to know the Cherubs make their return here, I was expecting Masterminds. Hm.\n* WHY TF DOES BLITZ HAVE A MOXXIE PLUSHIE IN THE SEX CHEST?!!!\n* They forgot to sing the Imagination Song to open the portal! Booo. 0/10\n* I do wonder why the portal opened specifically in the Lust Ring instead of Pride?\n* There's something weirdly cute about Blitz wanting tonight to be perfect and even knowing all the things he likes in bed... little does he know :(\n* AHHHHH FIZZ CALLED BLITZ BUDDY! They really have come a long way since Oops. So proud of them.\n* COCO AND APPLE ARE BACK\n* Okay the fact Stolas was tempted to get in bed with Blitz but quickly shot it down...\n* Yk I was surprised to see most of the episode centered around the Cherubs instead of Blitz and Stolas then I thought it made a little sense since the episode is called Full Moon and Blitz doesn't see Stolas until night so we're kinda focused on him prepping with the Cherubs being tossed in\n* Can we start a \"Brandon Rogers doing a great job voicing Blitz's emotional moments\" compilation pls?\n* GUYS! GUYS! THE CHANDELIER FROM WHEN THEY WERE KIDS CAME BACK AT THE ENDING\n\nHonestly this episode was a little weird when we got to the Cherubs trying to kill Blitz. I mean I sorta get it because the episode starts at morning and it was established Blitz wants to try something different and the Cherubs just so happened to get involved. But at the same time, I dunno, it just felt a bit jumbled? Not bad tho",

Actually, most of scenes with the cherubs were pretty funny.\n\nThe ending though made me tear up a bit."

            "Ah, man. That ending bit >!when Blitz sees that Stolas is crying and realizes his mistake, and tries to reach out as he's literally about to say \"I'm sorry\", but it's too late. I think most of us originally expected Blitz to storm out after misreading the situation, not for him to be the one who wishes he could go back at the last moment.!<Now I guess I'm really interested in seeing where Blitz goes from here.",
            "WHEN STOLAS STARTED CRYING, you can SEE the moment his heart BROKE! I can\u2019t. The way he said \u201cI think so very highly of you\u2026I didn\u2019t realize you think so low of me.\u201d Please, as someone who has went through the exact SAME thing in a relationship, this is\u2026A MASTERPIECE!!!!",
            "Honestly? Blitzo handled that better than I was expecting him to.",
            "Holy fuck that ending. I think everyone was fully expecting Blitz to misread the situation as Stolas pushing him away but no. This is so much better than a simple misunderstanding. Blitz fully understands the situation. Stolas genuinely loves him and that terrifies Blitz. The relationship is a actually getting to a place where it could work and Blitz might get the proper intimacy he's been craving but also scares him. All before he was able to self sabotage to escape the potential pain a genuine connection could bring like all his other relationships. So we get to see him driving people away properly this time. And Stolas did everything right. He was completely open and honest in what he wanted and how he felt. Its all on Blitz now. It always amazes me how well Viv gets these two.",
            "People are going to disagree with me because fans think Stolas can do no wrong, but I don\u2019t feel like he did everything right. Blitz def fucked up, but ahh it\u2019s genuinely heartbreaking when he\u2019s first >! literally begging he needs this, getting the crystal, and while he does immediately jump to sex, he\u2019s also saying that he can fuck him better in part to not lose the book but ALSO to not lose Stolas. He doesn\u2019t think Stolas is serious. And then he feels dismissed, because he is being dismissed, when Stolas just walks out without really talking to him at all and he doesn\u2019t have any time to process anything, so he gets angry. But they\u2019re both crying, in reality.!<\n\nIt\u2019s never been a one-sided communication issue and I\u2019ve personally always been able to see both sides. Ugh, looking forward to the rest of the season, hopefully the next episode is in early June.",
            "Really great; as always, I just wish it was longer. I think the B plot also might have worked better in another episode, but that's partly because I want more Stolas screentime.\n\nI don't really care about Cherubs or the DHORKS; the B plot wasn't bad, it was good. It's just not my preference of what I want to see.",
            "Is it just me or this episode could've been 2 episodes? That mechsuit cherub fight could've been it's own episode.",

(Also of course after not speaking since episode 2 her first line is her being rude, wouldn\u2019t have it any other way)\n\nSeriously though, what a good episode. I liked the part where the cherubs were talking about what gets someone into heaven, which is interesting after watching hazbin.\n\nThe ending actually made me tear up a bit, watching blitz and stolas end their agreement.",
            "\u201cI think so highly of you, I didn\u2019t realize you thought so low of me\u201d\n\nOkay...I think I will need a moment to recover from that line holy shit",
