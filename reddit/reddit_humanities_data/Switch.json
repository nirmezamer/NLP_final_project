            "Wtf is the point in being portable if I can\u2019t play a single player game without being connected to Wi-Fi? I had to set up a hot spot to play my switch in the car to play fucking Donkey Kong. Absolutely insane.",
            "Debating with myself if I should buy the Mario Choose One Bundle for $299 or the Oled version for $339.\n\nI plan to buy Mario Kart which I can get included with the bundle and BoTW.  I also do like the newer Oled model, and wouldn't mind paying the difference normally but the free game with the bundle makes it an $80 price difference rather than $40.  Most likely this Switch will be used primarily on the TV as my kids already have Switch lites.  This ones more for couch co-op and Botw for me.  WWYD?\n\nAlso I plan on buying an extra controller or 2.",
            "Is there anyway to set a passcode or something on a switch profile? \n\nMy son is just getting to the age where I'm comfortable letting him play games on his own (with parental controls for ratings and screen time limits) but I'd really like to ensure he doesn't accidentally pick my profile (and potentially mess up my saves and such). \n\nI've looked at the parental control options but that seems to apply to the entire console (which is really annoying) rather than specific profiles. \n\nIs there anyway I can put a pin or something on my profile so my son can't accidentally pick it when launching a game?",
            "I\u2019m thinking of buying a switch but I\u2019m currently and for another 4-7 months not in my home country (Europe) but rather in South Korea. If I buy a South Korean switch will this run me into trouble down the road?",
            "Hello! Wondering people\u2019s thoughts of having Skyrim on the Switch LITE. I\u2019ve had it on Xbox for years and obviously adore it and I know it\u2019s on sale right now, but obviously a switch lite is much smaller lol. Thoughts/preferences??",
            "Hades is my favorite game for switch\u2014- I love choosing what to add to my build in each room and having it snowball into something really OP. Does Have a Nice Death scratch that same type of itch or is it lacking?",
            "What switch games would y\u2019all recommend?  Just got one! :)  I already have Switch Sports, Breath of the Wild, Mario Odyssey, and MK8.",
            "2 questions: \n\n1: do we have any news on a new switch, or switch pro coming out?\n\nI see everybody saying the OLED is better in handheld, better speakers, etc, but performance VS a normal switch is the same. I played scarlet & Violet side by side with my GF who has an OLED switch (both docked) and her graphics looked 100000x better. If the OLED Doesn\u2019t have any extra hardware why is this?",
            "My bro has a switch we bought him back in 2017-ish. Its old.\n\nNew Zelda game is coming. My irresponsible inner child is wanting to buy the OLED one now to play the new Zelda game on. I need help.",

If I am to purchase this digital game, is it possible to link it to both my Switch and Switch Lite? (As well a previously purchased games like Animal Crossing)\n2. If so, Do I have to set them up as a family/shared account?\n3. If so (again), can I play **at the same time** on both devices? Or would that require 2x digital game purchases?"

Someone coined the Nintendo Switch as an RPG-machine, so I knew it would be a natural fit for me. The turn-based RPGs were always my favorite, and they are pretty much all I play single player now. I\u2019m really glad players of all ages still enjoy the relaxing atmosphere that turn-based RPGs provide.",
            "Final Fantasy X is a blast, would fit well alongside those Pixel Remaster !\n\nPersona games are also a must if you're a fan of the genre, especially 4 Golden and 5 Royal since 3 Reload isn't on Switch, but physical copies may be tough to find\n\nAlso, why no Pokemon ? Not a fan or didn't consider it ?",
