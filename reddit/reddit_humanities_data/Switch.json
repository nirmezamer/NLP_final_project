            "Wtf is the point in being portable if I can\u2019t play a single player game without being connected to Wi-Fi? I had to set up a hot spot to play my switch in the car to play fucking Donkey Kong. Absolutely insane.",
            "I\u2019m thinking of buying a switch but I\u2019m currently and for another 4-7 months not in my home country (Europe) but rather in South Korea. If I buy a South Korean switch will this run me into trouble down the road?",
            "Hello! Wondering people\u2019s thoughts of having Skyrim on the Switch LITE. I\u2019ve had it on Xbox for years and obviously adore it and I know it\u2019s on sale right now, but obviously a switch lite is much smaller lol. Thoughts/preferences??",
            "Hades is my favorite game for switch\u2014- I love choosing what to add to my build in each room and having it snowball into something really OP. Does Have a Nice Death scratch that same type of itch or is it lacking?",
            "What switch games would y\u2019all recommend?  Just got one! :)  I already have Switch Sports, Breath of the Wild, Mario Odyssey, and MK8.",
            "My bro has a switch we bought him back in 2017-ish. Its old.\n\nNew Zelda game is coming. My irresponsible inner child is wanting to buy the OLED one now to play the new Zelda game on. I need help.",
            "Is the switch game vouchers worth it? and if so which games would I ideally go for? One voucher for sure will go to TOTK. How about the other?",
            "I\u2019ve had the pink and green splatoon joycons for about 3-4 years, and there\u2019s some wear on the analog sticks. Would I be able to take it to GameStop or Nintendo to get them swapped out? Would it be less of a hassle to just get new joycons?",
            "Anyone know how to turn off motion controls in Quake?",
            "Hey Megathread - updating to an OLED for TotK (still have a Day One Switch) and I\u2019ve heard the docks are compatible either way (wired Ethernet excepted). Does anyone know if there\u2019s any other difference in performance? Will the OLED dock and original dock have any different effect on running software? Any video or audio lag etc. or should it be identical? Just if I can avoid digging out and changing wires all the better! (And also have a dock on another TV to swap between the two when needed)."

            "Awesome! Dave the Diver is a good choice.",
            "Yay! I also got my switch lite only when I finished my undergraduate thesis last year. I was eyeing it since the pandemic. Funnily, my thesis was about PS5 scalping during the pandemic. During my thesis presentation, someone from the audience asked if I bought a PS5 and I said I got a Switch lite instead LOL.\n\nHades is a game I played on my laptop for 200+ hours and still in love with it. Let me know how Dave the Diver is."

            "Okay, this post was more about how RPGs influenced which games I collected growing up. I am 37M who grew up with all the classics on NES and SNES. Someone coined the Nintendo Switch as an RPG-machine, so I knew it would be a natural fit for me. The turn-based RPGs were always my favorite, and they are pretty much all I play single player now. I\u2019m really glad players of all ages still enjoy the relaxing atmosphere that turn-based RPGs provide.",
