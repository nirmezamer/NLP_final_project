        "content": "I genuinely don't understand, there are so many games where a single enemy just snowballs so hard it's gg. Unlike SR, we have no choice in team comp often times, why can't we even itemize against snowballers? \n\nHas anyone heard of a valid reason it was removed in ARAM as well? There are ARAM-only items after all.",

            "Riot generally avoids ARAM-only items. The idea is to avoid creating ARAM metas focused around ARAM-only items. Usually if an item is removed on SR, it\u2019s also removed on HA.\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s not necessarily a good reason to remove Anathema\u2019s Chains from ARAM, but it follows Riot\u2019s typical operating procedure.\u00a0",

            "Sometimes, people would use the item to just torture others. For example, if someone is diving your backline, just chains them as a Leona, and all your cc lasts longer. It could effectively make an enemy useless, which is a bit too powerful. At least, that's what I remember understanding when they explained why they removed it.",

            "I don\u2019t like Morde that much either but he was considered really shit before the R buff and at least he\u2019s got something going for him now?",
            "The starter items are balanced around the starting gold you receive in aram and are just mainstays in the mode for that reason. \n\nAnathemas was probably too niche in their eyes and they already nerfed tenacity which was a pretty big part of the item\u2019s active and they probably couldn\u2019t figure out how to balance it from there without making it either really broken or really shit."

And resets easily with his passive.\n\nFor brand as an example other Champs may want this but I find doing 50 extra damage most of the game once or twice a minute are just not good enough.",

            "You get stormsurge for the move speed and mpen.\u00a0 The extra gold and zap is just a small bonus that you don't care\n\n\nThat said, I do agree it is a shit item. Shadowflame is just a better mpen item and if you buy so many flat mpen you can easily get countered by a bit of magic resist. May as well go deathcap for big damage. Honestly for burst luden is just a better item anyway",
