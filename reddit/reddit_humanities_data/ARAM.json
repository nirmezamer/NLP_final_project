It has bad stats and the passive tickles. \n\nI played against an LB that went like 24 kills and was stomping and this item was her first buy, she did a wooping 300 damage with it lmao\n\nPlease let's sign a petition or something to remove it from ARAM so my teammates don't buy it in a losing game",

            "tbh I think most people build it for the magic pen/move speed. I do think the passive needs a rework or some adjustments bc it\u2019s really really bad",
            "The enticing part would be the move speed, but there is Cosmic Drive which rocks and I see pretty much nobody ever build.",
            "I've had a fizz in my game with it and it dealt around 7k damage. Imho it's decent for ap assassins especially if all enemies are squishy.",
            "Also my god people love to build 2 or 3 mana items on mages like malignance, seraphs etc , riot should change this thing",
            "The only place it has is against 5 squishies, combining with Shadowflame on champs like Orianna who can just 1-shot the enemy team with her combo. In 98% of cases it's shit, yeah.",
            "Depending on the champ as a last item i sell boots and choose between Stormsurge, Cosmic drive or Lichbane just for the %movement speed",
            "Honestly either give it the electrocute/thunderlord's decree passive or remove and add another item in its place. I feel like this item can only be used on a few select champions and even then they only rack up like 1k dmg by the end of the game.",
            "The only champ i ever wanted to build it on was kennen vs full squishy comp after protobelt, penshoes, rabadons, shadowflame (garbage item aswell but still better), probably forgot something but yeah even then is stormsurge very low priority",
            "ludens, boots then stormsurge for nunu is still good no?",
            "Shockingly enough an item designed for a certain class of champions is bad on not that class. The stats are perfect for the nuke mages and the passive only ticks up the damage counter if you don't explode the squall, how much gold did the leblanc have on it? Theres a big difference in stealing 24 kills and earning 24 kills, because LB is a notorious KS champion due to her safety. Play neeko / nunu / sylas / lissandra / AP jax / AP blitzcrank stormsurge first item and see its power when the squall explosion hits more than 0 people."

            "I just want an armor item for adcs",
            "So why have the starter items then? And several seasons ago, I feel like there were a few ARAM specific items as well",
            "I don\u2019t like Morde that much either but he was considered really shit before the R buff and at least he\u2019s got something going for him now?",
            "Why not just build Death's Dance?",
            "1 good reliable crit MR and AP items. JUST ONE of each so that I don\u2019t have to chuck my damage just to die in 2s rather than 0.2\u2026",
            "The starter items are balanced around the starting gold you receive in aram and are just mainstays in the mode for that reason. \n\nAnathemas was probably too niche in their eyes and they already nerfed tenacity which was a pretty big part of the item\u2019s active and they probably couldn\u2019t figure out how to balance it from there without making it either really broken or really shit.",
            "The starting items aren't meta defining, you seem to have missed the point.",
            "His SR winrate dropped after the change because people stopped buying QSS. QSS is a terrible item in terms of gold efficiency and most of the time you're better off building things other than QSS to specifically deal with Mord."

            "On brand who is really the only champ I almost always go dark harvest I'll finish a game with 30ish stacks. So 80-100 more damage at end game? Nah this is shit. After rylais comet hits and vastly out damages this. And resets easily with his passive.\n\nFor brand as an example other Champs may want this but I find doing 50 extra damage most of the game once or twice a minute are just not good enough.",

            "It's why I'm taking Fleet on pretty much every mage now. That little speed and heal is worth more than the DH damage. And it let's me still have Ultimate Hunter.",
            "Because hitting the red dot makes you cum.",
            "I often disliked DH over Comet for many champions and it's crazy people still go it or First Strike which just suck. Electrocute is also underrated.",
            "Most probably because people autopilot in aram much more than they do in sr. So it just leads to most \"successful\" build being just the build most people use. Dark harvest is on most occasions worse than a comet or pretty much any other rune, but it was once giga broken so people still take it",
            "On Brand I go Arcane Comet, I really feel like people are sleeping on it, you can proc it like 3-4 times in a single combo due to DoT and the cooldown reduction.\n\nIt always did more dmg than DH, you should give it a go sometimes",
            "30 stacks is really low"
