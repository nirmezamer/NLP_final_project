I'd also probably be honest that for a student I didn't know all that well, my letter my not be very strong.\n\nAnd being honest... Bs in both courses isn't particularly noteworthy, unless this was an incredibly hard class, or you really shone in class and bombed on rote memorization for tests or something. Are you sure this is the best person to ask?",

I remember one letter where the professor only wrote one sentence about the student.  You may want to reach out them to see if they would do it and if they agree to do it.  Send them a personal statement about you and why you are applying to said school/program/scholarship or whatever so they can at least learn something other than you took both of their classes and earned B.",

If I had a student in the same situation, I would recommend they find a professor who knows them better (and where they had better performance). I wouldn\u2019t outright refuse the letter, but as others have said would want to meet with them before agreeing.",
            "No, because I don't know you as a person or as a student beyond the grade in my gradebook, and that's just not enough basis for a letter of recommendation. You have to build a relationship with professors so that they remember you as a human being, not just a number. You haven't done that.",

            "Can you ask? Absolutely. Can they say no? Absolutely. Never hurts to ask, just be prepared to find another person if they say no.\n\nPost-COVID, I added a statement in my syllabus that unless a student interacted with me in some sort of out of class manner (office hours, department events, etc), I will not write a LOR for them just because I suddenly got flooded with LOR requests from students in my OLA classes, students that I had never seen before, barely knew their names, and couldn't write more than \"they did well on the homework\". But it sounds like you contributed during class time which is often more impactful than during office hours.",

            "No. I have never ever written a LoR based on class engagement. Class engagement tells me nothing other than you have the capacity to pay attention. To me, that's the bare minimum I would expect from any student.",
