Send them a personal statement about you and why you are applying to said school/program/scholarship or whatever so they can at least learn something other than you took both of their classes and earned B.",
            "No, because I don't know you as a person or as a student beyond the grade in my gradebook, and that's just not enough basis for a letter of recommendation.

            "This is just my 2 cents to your post:\n\n1. Like people have said, this particular professor should be your 3rd and last letter of recommendation (LOR). You should have 2 LOR writers who can really speak to your skills, qualities, and preparedness for law school. These could be professors whose courses you took and excelled in (A-grade minimum), someone you perhaps worked under (supervisor/boss, part time job you worked on campus), or an advisor who oversaw your thesis or organization you were a part of (school organization). With these latter two, people who can again speak to your personal strengths, qualities, and character.\n\n2.  Just to be clear, you better provide all 3 of your LOR writers with ample time and information so they can write you the best LOR possible. Firstly, when students ask me to write a LOR, I require a minimum 2 weeks to write the letter. Do not drop this request last second and keep in mind, it may take longer based on the professors schedule and potentially other LORs they have to write for other students (Fall semester is prime time for LORs since that is when students are applying to grad-school, medical/law school, etc.). Secondly, just know that you are expected to do a lot of the heavy lifting when it comes to providing your LOR writer with all the information, documents, and resources possible to write an effective LOR. For example, you need to provide each of your 3 LOR writers with: (A) information on when the application deadline is for each program you are applying to, (B) information on who exactly is being addressed in the LOR (a specific person like the program/department secretary, specific admissions committee member, the specific department, or the university in general), (C) does the application have any specific questions that need to be addressed or answered by the LOR writer, and (D) an updated resume and a Word document that highlights the major skills, experiences (job, organizations, community service), and qualities that you want your LOR writer to highlight and address within the LOR itself. This is why I have every student who asks me for a LOR to meet with me in-person before I write the letter so we can go over steps A-D (above) and that way, we are on the same page and I can write the most effective LOR for the student. \n\n3. The Reality. Don't expect a god-tier LOR from this professor based on the info you provided about yourself above in your post. How you view the professor and their class may be very different from how the professor views you and your potential as a student. You got a B in both classes, which is great. However, raising your hand, showing up on time to class, and speaking in class discussions are nothing special. If I am being honest, that is the bare minimum expectation I would have any student in my class just to be able to walk through my class door. You never really went above and beyond to give this professor a reason to remember your name. As a professor myself, I can tell you that I have 100s of students I teach a year and while they were good students, I can not always remember the \"B-grade\" students after a semester or two. It's usually the A (or F students at times because of the hell they put me through) I remember most because of how they excelled in my class (Ex. assignments), they show an interest in the class material, they usually did show up to my office hours or come before/stay after class to talk about things related to the course, and they are usually engaged in class. Even having basic conversations (sports, weather, current events, university events, plans for the weekend, etc.) before class or after class is how you build a relationship with a professor. Just know that the professor will write about how you performed within their course, but they will not lie or stretch the truth in terms of their actual assessment of you as a student and your ability to be successful in law school. For example, even if I meet with a student to go over their LOR and what they want me to emphasize within the letter itself, when it comes to the section on how they did in my course, what I write is very different based on how the student did in my course (A, B, or C-grade student, I've written letters for all 3 types of student).",
            "No. I have never ever written a LoR based on class engagement. Class engagement tells me nothing other than you have the capacity to pay attention. To me, that's the bare minimum I would expect from any student."

        "content": "Syllabus and dropping lowest test score\n\nMy mom was taking an accounting class at her college, and she got 100% on every exam she took. The teacher had a policy where the lowest exam grade would be dropped, and there was no written requirement to take the final exam in order to pass the class. So, since she literally could not get a higher grade by taking the final exam, she told the teacher she would not be there for finals. The final was dropped, and she got an A.\n\nWhat I am wondering is, was that disrespectful to the teacher? Is it important that students take all the exams? How would you feel if you were in this situation with a student?",
