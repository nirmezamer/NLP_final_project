            "Do I need a large amount of storage and other space to develop my own colour photos?",
            "I'm wanting to get into developing and scanning my film on my own.  What do I need to buy?  Are the kits on amazon reliable?  I will primarily be using 35 with the rare 120",
            "I'm interested in film photography but I have some questions before I buy anything. \n\n1-I noticed most of the cameras made are really old, what's the reliability of Nikon's FM/FE or FM2/FE2 series and F3 models? Can I expect these to work for a couple years without problem more often then not?\n\n2-Some of the chemicals, at least for color E-6 and C-41 kits from Cinestill have a limited shelf life of only a couple weeks after initial use. Does this mean I should only develop color film when I have 10+ undeveloped reels to ensure I don't waste the chemicals?",
            "I got this as an introductory film camera to see if I liked the hobby before investing in another film camera. So far it\u2019s been good, however the film counter is stuck on \u201cS\u201d. I can still move the counter forward and take photos. Is it actually taking photos? Could I develop the film roll when it is finished?",
            "I got a Pentax MG at a flea market a while back without a lens. What is a way to get a cheap lens? I'm kind of sick of using disposable cameras everytime because of the cost. I live in the Netherlands for some context",
            "Is there any place in India where I can ship off my roll of film to get developed and scanned?",
            "Has anyone here used Express Photo & Camera in Livonia, Michigan to develop their film? If so, could you share what their timeline and communication is like? (I shipped them a roll but haven\u2019t heard anything from them\u2026)",
            "Hey, I recently picked up a Pentax MX from eBay and just got my first roll of film developed, but I think there's an issue with my shutter - could I fix this myself or do I need to get it CLA'd?\n\nI've attached some images so you can see what I'm talking about:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/mD8rWXK"

What are you looking to get out of it?**\n\n>I take photos to help me stay connected to the world outside of my mind. if I can conjure up portals to & from my favorite memories, life feels a little bit more manageable. \n\n* **What inspired you to take this photo?**\n\n>I live in a place that rarely sees storms, much less rain\u2026 so when I saw lightning, I grabbed my camera & headed for the cliffs. it was dusk, and massive thunder clouds were forming offshore. I didn\u2019t have my tripod and happened to be midway through a roll of ektachrome, so I held my breath, started shootin\u2019 and hoped for the best. \n\n* **Do you self develop or get a lab to process your film?**\n\n>I use my local lab, Color Services, to develop my film. Glenn & the team there have been very supportive of my work over the years and I\u2019m happy to give them my business! \n\n* **What first interested you in analog photography?**\n\n>my interest in film photography stems from my grandpa\u2019s old slide collection. when I was growing up, he would break out his projector and the family would look through our collective memories. eventually I was old enough to actually use his cameras & start capturing memories of my own. I\u2019m incredibly grateful to him for giving me my first cameras & film. \n\n* **What is your favourite piece of equipment (camera, film, or other) and why?**\n\n>I could never part ways with my Nikon f3\u2026 sometimes it feels like an extension of my hand. I\u2019ve taken some of my favorite photos with it over the years. I\u2019m grateful for its versatility & its sturdiness, as I\u2019m rather clumsy! the f3 is a very solid camera, intuitively designed, and I\u2019d recommend it to anyone looking for a daily shooter. \n\n* **Do you have a tip or technique that other film photographers should try?**\n\n>I\u2019d say the best advice I could give my fellow creatives is this: don\u2019t waste your time shooting things that don\u2019t light you up inside. cater to your own interests, focus on making the images you want to see. \n\n* **Do you have a link to more of your work or an online portfolio you would like to share?**\n\n>[https://evertenderstudios.bigcartel.com/](https://evertenderstudios.bigcartel.com/)\n\n* **Do you have a favourite analog photographer or analog photography web site you would like to recommend?**\n\n>Chris Cuffaro is a legendary photographer, known for his work with the most influential artists of the 90s. I grew up listening to and loving Nirvana, so when I came across his work I was stoked. he was kind enough to send me a print of one of my favorite shots and I love looking at it every day. \n\n* **Is there anything else you would like to add about yourself or your photography?**\n\n>I would like to note that my work flow is vastly influenced by my health, and there are times when I am in too much pain to even get out of bed. as someone that loves shooting landscapes, it is crushing to be stuck at home, wishing I could be out there shooting all of the beautiful things. I am sad when a cloud goes by that I want to shoot but just can\u2019t reach. my photos represent all the places I miss very dearly, and I truly appreciate it when others see the beauty in them too.",

I'm getting some pretty serious light bleeds on the edges of the negative since the negative holder is slightly larger than the negatives, so I'm thinking I'll have to like, 3D print a little insert to cut out the light bleeding through the gaps between images. Other than that it's a decent setup.\n\nSelf developing is a pretty big pain in the ass though, I haven't yet fully decided if it's worth the effort. But then, logically speaking, nothing about this medium is. But we do it anyway.",

            "Roll your film back INTO the canister. It's nearly always a clockwise rotation. Light leak means light seals are bad, check them and if need be, replace them. Black line, show negative. The black line could shutter capping, could be something wrong with your camera, etc.",
            "There\u2019s a lot going on here with leaks, but the black line on the right hand of the frame isn\u2019t a leak - it\u2019s a scanning artifact from dirt in the calibration area of the scanner glass.",

            "I left the camera in -20c and the shutter froze open right after the photo with the light leak. Is there a chance that affected the seals? I think I rewound it the wrong way for the stress marks and the first of the roll is always like that ofc. Black line is perplexing though.. never seen it before with this camera"
