            "Do I need a large amount of storage and other space to develop my own colour photos?",
            "I'm wanting to get into developing and scanning my film on my own.  What do I need to buy?  Are the kits on amazon reliable?  I will primarily be using 35 with the rare 120",
            "I got this as an introductory film camera to see if I liked the hobby before investing in another film camera. So far its been good, however the film counter is stuck on S. I can still move the counter forward and take photos. Is it actually taking photos? Could I develop the film roll when it is finished?",
            "I got a Pentax MG at a flea market a while back without a lens. What is a way to get a cheap lens? I'm kind of sick of using disposable cameras everytime because of the cost. I live in the Netherlands for some context",
            "Is there any place in India where I can ship off my roll of film to get developed and scanned?",
            "Has anyone here used Express Photo & Camera in Livonia, Michigan to develop their film? If so, could you share what their timeline and communication is like? (I shipped them a roll but havent heard anything from them)",
            "Hi, I was wondering if you could recommend me some film with similar qualities to the old Agfa/Fuji film stocks - bluish/greenish, muted tones and lowish contrast. I'd prefer something that is still manufactured so I don't have to hunt for expired stock and whatnot, but I'll accept whatever is available to buy without too much hassle. Thanks!",
            "Did I just miss the biggest deal of my life? It sold but heres what it was - $40 for 70 rolls of color 35mm film and 18 rolls of black and white 35mm films. Film includes 18 T 400 CN Kodak Professional Black and White film; ; 4 AGFA vista color 200 rolls; 8 Kodak MAX 400 and MAX 200 color film; Around 55 FUJIFILM 200 DK color film; 1 Kodak PORTRA Professional 400 VC color film. I did a lot of wedding photoraphy 15 to 20 years ago. These rolls have been stuck in the back of closet since then.",
            "Recommended medium format for me who likes to take portraits but also landscape",
            "i was thinking about either getting an olympus trip mini or a trip af30 does anyone have any thoughts on the two or a cheap point and shoot recommendation?"

This accolade has been awarded based upon the number of votes during week 23, with this post having received the most when searching by top submission: [https://www.reddit.com/r/analog/comments/1d6ziio/nikon\\_f3\\_nikkor\\_55mm\\_f28\\_kodak\\_ektachrome\\_100/](https://www.reddit.com/r/analog/comments/1d6ziio/nikon_f3_nikkor_55mm_f28_kodak_ektachrome_100/)\n\n* **How long have you been taking photographs?**\n\n>I\u2019ve been shooting film for seven years\n\n* **Why do you take photographs? What are you looking to get out of it?**\n\n>I take photos to help me stay connected to the world outside of my mind. if I can conjure up portals to & from my favorite memories, life feels a little bit more manageable. \n\n* **What inspired you to take this photo?**\n\n>I live in a place that rarely sees storms, much less rain\u2026 so when I saw lightning, I grabbed my camera & headed for the cliffs. it was dusk, and massive thunder clouds were forming offshore. I didn\u2019t have my tripod and happened to be midway through a roll of ektachrome, so I held my breath, started shootin\u2019 and hoped for the best. \n\n* **Do you self develop or get a lab to process your film?**\n\n>I use my local lab, Color Services, to develop my film. Glenn & the team there have been very supportive of my work over the years and I\u2019m happy to give them my business! \n\n* **What first interested you in analog photography?**\n\n>my interest in film photography stems from my grandpa\u2019s old slide collection. when I was growing up, he would break out his projector and the family would look through our collective memories. eventually I was old enough to actually use his cameras & start capturing memories of my own. I\u2019m incredibly grateful to him for giving me my first cameras & film. \n\n* **What is your favourite piece of equipment (camera, film, or other) and why?**\n\n>I could never part ways with my Nikon f3\u2026 sometimes it feels like an extension of my hand. I\u2019ve taken some of my favorite photos with it over the years. I\u2019m grateful for its versatility & its sturdiness, as I\u2019m rather clumsy! the f3 is a very solid camera, intuitively designed, and I\u2019d recommend it to anyone looking for a daily shooter. \n\n* **Do you have a tip or technique that other film photographers should try?**\n\n>I\u2019d say the best advice I could give my fellow creatives is this: don\u2019t waste your time shooting things that don\u2019t light you up inside. cater to your own interests, focus on making the images you want to see. \n\n* **Do you have a link to more of your work or an online portfolio you would like to share?**\n\n>[https://evertenderstudios.bigcartel.com/](https://evertenderstudios.bigcartel.com/)\n\n* **Do you have a favourite analog photographer or analog photography web site you would like to recommend?**\n\n>Chris Cuffaro is a legendary photographer, known for his work with the most influential artists of the 90s. I grew up listening to and loving Nirvana, so when I came across his work I was stoked. he was kind enough to send me a print of one of my favorite shots and I love looking at it every day. \n\n* **Is there anything else you would like to add about yourself or your photography?**\n\n>I would like to note that my work flow is vastly influenced by my health, and there are times when I am in too much pain to even get out of bed. as someone that loves shooting landscapes, it is crushing to be stuck at home, wishing I could be out there shooting all of the beautiful things. I am sad when a cloud goes by that I want to shoot but just can\u2019t reach. my photos represent all the places I miss very dearly, and I truly appreciate it when others see the beauty in them too.",

            "1, and 9 are the best. I dont really like when someone holds glasses and takes on a pose its kinda tacky. But 9 is a moment that seems more natural and charming.",
            "2 & 9. \n\nKodak gold in medium format looks wonderful.",
            "I really like 1! \n\nA good blend of fore, mid and background elements that helped frame the subject and give it a 3D pop. Definitely makes for a more interesting background than the sky in the other shots.",
