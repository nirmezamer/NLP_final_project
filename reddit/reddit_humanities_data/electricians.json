            "How is one supposed to become an apprentice in California if they need 3-5 years of experience and trade school only offers a year of experience?\n\nMy school pulled me in with claims they would help us find a job, but the last batch that graduated before me ruined that for everyone by not knowing how to use a multimeter so now my school is trying to send me to other schools to get the years of experience needed, but that doesn\u2019t seem right at all.",
            "     Can anyone suggest any other apps or books to help prepare for the aptitude test. Im applying to a super competative local and i want to give myself the best chance. \n      Also im doing a career transition at 26, is there will this matter? Im still young but alot of the literature im reading is geared towards people out of highschool, is there anything i should be aware of being a older than average apprentice?",

            "Hello all. 28 y/o with only freight / logistics experience. Looking to start my journey in the electrical trade. Some programs that I\u2019m finding seem to be really competitive with wait lists lasting anywhere from 6 months to 2 years. Any suggestions on someone wanting to hop into school and be able to start my path Into this industry? Seattle, WA based.",
            "I work for an IT dept where we pull data cable and other LV for remodels and updates to our stores. We also do this occasionally for new construction but have to do the dance with GC\u2019s and subs with who will be doing LV. Almost every time I\u2019m on one of these new sites a journeyman will comment \u201cwhy don\u2019t you get your license\u201d (LEB here in Oregon) and from my understanding I would have to quit my job and go work under a journeyman to accomplish that. Is this correct?",
            "Should I do a trade school, union application, or private job first when getting into this trade? I applied for a union apprenticeship but really doubt that I would get it since I don't have any professional experience.",
            "Pretty nervous about the math portion of the test. Math has ALWAYS been my weak spot academicly. Ironically, I'm pursuing the IBEW to challenge myself rather than rely on what I'm good at. I've been using Khan Academy, but are there any other good free online resources avaliable? \n\nObviously it changes depending on where, but what sort of Algebra should I be focusing on? Is it mostly whole numbers, fractions, or decimals? I would hate to fail simply because I focused on the wrong aspects of Algebra.",
            "Hi everyone, I\u2019ve been working as an electrical apprentice in North Carolina for the past 5 years. I\u2019ve completed three out of 4 levels. This past year the company I\u2019ve been with has not been able to allow me to complete my last year and I was hoping to get it done ASAP. Do you guys have any advice for the best places that would let finish up my final year, outside of my company?",
            "Hello everyone, I have been working as an electrical apprentice in Washington State for 2 years and am moving to Connecticut.  If anyone has any advice on which companies to work for in the New Haven area.  Thanks in advance",
            "Hello. I just finished an electrical techniques program and now am trying to get hired on as an apprentice. I've emailed and applied to multiple places but haven't heard back from much. I want to start calling electrical contractors and asking if they have anything available but honestly Im not exactly sure how to start that conversation in a professional and good way. How to go about it, things to say and not?"
