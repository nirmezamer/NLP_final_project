            "How is one supposed to become an apprentice in California if they need 3-5 years of experience and trade school only offers a year of experience?\n\nMy school pulled me in with claims they would help us find a job, but the last batch that graduated before me ruined that for everyone by not knowing how to use a multimeter so now my school is trying to send me to other schools to get the years of experience needed, but that doesn\u2019t seem right at all.",
            "Hey guys,\n\nI'm 33 with management experience looking to switch careers into a trade, and wondering if there are any avenues to transfer my current experience over to a trade or if I'll have to start at the bottom. If I have to start at the bottom that's ok, but I wouldn't be doing my due diligence if I didn't ask fist. \n\nI have quite a bit of fabrication experience, project management experience, and experience with actual management of teams of installers/fabricators.\n\nAny help or advice would be great, thanks!",

Im still young but alot of the literature im reading is geared towards people out of highschool, is there anything i should be aware of being a older than average apprentice?",

            "My son is very interested in becoming an Electrician.  We have gone to a few trade fairs and he has asked a lot of questions.   The people at the electrician booth all encouraged him to wait until he graduates and just call around to  ask local companies if they will take in an apprentice.  Of the dozen he has called so far all have said no.  They are only taking in an apprentice with 2 or more years experience.  He is very discouraged by this.  He did find one company that is looking for a brand new apprentice of which he applied at yesterday and will call to follow up Monday.\n\nAny tips or advice you all can give him would be great.\n\nHe has not taken a tour of the training center yet, but he probably will in a few weeks as it's only 15 minutes away and they do tours weekly.",

            "I work for an IT dept where we pull data cable and other LV for remodels and updates to our stores. We also do this occasionally for new construction but have to do the dance with GC\u2019s and subs with who will be doing LV. Almost every time I\u2019m on one of these new sites a journeyman will comment \u201cwhy don\u2019t you get your license\u201d (LEB here in Oregon) and from my understanding I would have to quit my job and go work under a journeyman to accomplish that. Is this correct?",
            "\nHi everyone. Need some advice, and outside input, something truthfully maybe I should have saught prior considering how I'm having more and more concerns. I recently went from a career big city paramedic to an electricians apprentice at a smaller non-union company (rather not use names, I will say in Maryland). And for the past few months I've absolutely loved it. I've never been treated with such respect, and find work satisfying. I'm hired through a contract firm these first few months but I'm coming to the end of that phase. Perfect attendance, and every two week performance reviews have been flawless. My main issue is, my journeyman has passed me off to the crew leader for the week, a second year apprentice, I have gotten along great with everyone I met so far, but this kid is an asshole of the highest degree.  I'm not talking about mean words and stuff, I'm talking about ripping tools and materials out of my hands as I attempt to learn to use them, giving me instructions, me repeating them back to his confirmation, then once completed gets in my face infront of the group to tell me I messed up, and changing things he confirmed, and berating for doing really bad and need to pay attention, pulling me away from tasks to repeat instructions without any clear reasoning as if I was messing up but won't give me a actual critique, today I even saw this clown put markings on the wall then try to tell me I totally missed this and need to pay attention. As well as some other childish gaslighting behavior. So ofcourse the journeyman I work under is his best friend, who are both doing my next performance review and I see no reason to expect I'll be given a fair shake in the very slightest. Upon this, I'm paid less than minimum wage as the employer is technically in a different county. If I get hired fully my raise still won't bring me to minimum wage after those numbers go up for the county. I was initially under the impression the raise would be higher. I've tolerated that bit since I have some savings to float me as I got myself down to a shoestring budget, I'll have to look for a second job in the upcoming months it looks like. \n\nIs any of this just normal? Should I start window shopping to switch teams?",
            "Should I do a trade school, union application, or private job first when getting into this trade? I applied for a union apprenticeship but really doubt that I would get it since I don't have any professional experience."
