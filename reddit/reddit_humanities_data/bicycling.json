        "content": "I joined my second ever group ride yesterday, and had the unfortunate experience of cutting off the rider behind me. I received conflicting feedback from some of the riders in the group who witnessed, so am seeking feedback from this community. \n\nI\u2019m the center rider in the diagram. We are approaching a hill and traveling around 15mph, nothing crazy. The group spreads out a bit - there is actually another rider way to my left on the other side of the road. I\u2019m a bit confused by this format already, because the club rules explicitly state to remain in single file, and avoid riding side by side at all times, except when pulling off of the front and returning to the rear. The red hexagon is a massive pothole, which the rider in front of me, leading the group, is able to see and doesn\u2019t signal. He chooses his line and is able to drift gracefully to the right, leaving me exposed the hazard. In a split second decision, I choose to follow the line and avoid the hazard, but swerving rapidly in the process. What I don\u2019t realize is the proximity of the rider behind me, which is to my right and some of the other riders witnessed him overlapping me moments before. When I swerved, I didn\u2019t hit the wheel of the rider behind me, but was told I came close. There was some shouting, I apologized and we amicably resolved the conflict. \nWhat I am stuck on is if I am truly at fault. Yes, I understand that sudden movements are not ideal and should be avoided, but I also think the rider behind me shouldn\u2019t have been overlapping wheels per the club rules. I also am a former competitive skier from a family of ski instructors, and have always followed the philosophy of responsibility lying in the hands of the uphill skier, as the downhill skier cannot fully be aware of those behind them. I would think that somewhat applies to cycling as well.\nAfter the ride, the individual feedback varied - I was told by one person that I should have just eaten the pothole, and another agreed that the rider behind should have maintained a safer distance.\nWhat do you think? should I have eaten the pothole ? Am I fully at fault here?",

            "Never overlap wheels unless you're a paid cyclist and it's worth the risk. The leader was at fault for not calling out the hazard but sometimes you don't have the time to signal. Then you should use your voice. \n\nBut overlapping wheels is the fault of the cyclist behind you.",
            "It\u2019s the leader\u2019s fault in my view. He is supposed to look out for upcoming hazards and signal quite early if there is a hazard on the street and he is going to change the pacing line as a result.\n\nIt\u2019s a split second decision on your part but either way you were being squeezed out of the pace line even if you did go over the pothole, so the guy behind overlapping wheel is still an \u201cunfriendly\u201d move.\n\nWe always assume risks by following someone\u2019s wheel so closely, and sometimes, shit happens that are beyond anyone\u2019s control and even by mistakes caused by others. But those who go in to group rides and start blaming others often don\u2019t have the grasp of risks they are taking.\n\nAnd if the leader is not taking any responsibilities and not having your back, and just letting others to shift the blame on to you, you should definitely reconsider being in that group.",
            "Nah I don't eat potholes and potentially ruin my tire and / or wheel.\n\nThe person behind you followed you too closely, that's his fault.\n\nThe person Infront of you avoided the pot hole and decided to screw everyone behind him and say nothing.\n\nSounds like a bad group.",
            "thank you for all of your feedback! I am feeling vindicated and a lot more confident for the next ride. this specific club ride has a large attendance, and splits into small pods of 6, so I should be able to avoid these riders moving forward.",
            "100% NOT your fault. Rule number one in group riding is not to overlap wheels for cases like this when you need sudden change of direction. The only time this would be your fault is when the person behind you will be right next to you and you will take him down. I used to race and yes, in races overlap is normal but the danger of holes is pretty low. However, crashes do happen pretty often in races and overlapping is one of the reasons.",
            "Of all the people involved, it sounds like you were least at fault.",
            "\"but I also think the rider behind me shouldn\u2019t have been overlapping wheels per the club rules\"  \nDing! Ding! Ding!",
            "Never, ever overlap wheels with the guy in front of you specifically because if they need to make a sudden movement you are going to be the one eating asphalt when their rear wheel pushes your front wheel.",
            "Everyone's fault but yours.\nFirst rider should signal the pothole, rider behind should not half wheel.",
