        "content": "The people have spoken! We had 683 people participate in [our poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrDraws/s/x2WNAqhRkm) concerning whether or not this sub should allow content containing AI generated images. The overwhelming majority (74% of voters, which is 505 votes) chose to ban AI images here altogether.\n\nThe most common sentiment I\u2019ve heard is that this is Tumblr DRAWS, not \u201cTumblr attaches an AI generated image.\u201d Which is a good point. \n\nTo be specific, we **will** allow both physical and digital illustrations accompanying social media posts. This includes drawings made on top of photographs, such as in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrDraws/s/ietBJenKBo). \n\nWe will **not** allow AI images, even if they\u2019re stylized to look like drawings. \n\nThis does not mean I\u2019m giving this community permission to go on witch-hunts and verbally (er\u2026 digitally?) abuse people who accidentally post AI images. Not everyone can recognize AI right away and differentiate it from physical or digital art. That\u2019s okay. \n\nIf someone posts something containing AI, you should report it- the rules have been updated to reflect this. You may also, if you wish, politely inform the OP that the post contains AI and point out what details helped you come to that conclusion. Of course, you don\u2019t *have* to do that. I just think it might help some people to learn how to identify AI and avoid posting it in the future.\n\nIs this a forever rule? Since the sub is growing pretty quickly, I may decide to reach out to the community again in a year or two just to see if the general opinion has changed or not. I don\u2019t anticipate it changing, but who knows what will happen in a couple years. It\u2019s not changing *soon.*\n\nSo, in conclusion: AI images are not permitted. Being an asshole because someone accidentally posted AI is also not permitted. \n\nHandy guide to dealing with AI posts ***after*** reporting them:\n\n\u274c \u201cHey fuckhead, get your computer generated garbage out of my fucking feed. Are you an idiot?? Ugh, so tired of these dumbasses.\u201d\n\n\u2705 \u201cHey OP, it looks like you posted something with AI in it, which is against the rules. You can tell by the inconsistent shading and deformed sausage fingers.\u201d \n\nFeel free to ask questions or share your thoughts about this rule. I\u2019ll try to answer as much as I can. ",

            "this sounds good, no complaints :0",
            "Missed the poll, happy with the results though. Good rule change",
            "Just out of curiosity, if someone posted a thread which contains an ai generated image but the focus/drawing itself is not ai that would still be allowed?",
            "A lot of AI art has gotten passable at hands, so another way to tell if you're not sure is to look at the hair! Hair in AI images tends to fade into itself and other parts of the image, and hairstyles (i.e., braids) won't look right. The hair was actually what tipped me off on another sub where the hands weren't shown in the image!",
            "Generally I don\u2019t have anything against AI images, but in the context of this sub this is a good decision. Glad we could all agree :)",

            "I appreciate the transparency in sharing the results of the poll and the rationale behind the decision to not permit AI images in this sub. It's important to maintain the integrity of the community and the focus on hand-drawn art. The reminder to be respectful and helpful when addressing AI posts is a great way to foster a positive environment. Looking forward to seeing the continued growth and evolution of this sub!",
            "I am totally one of those idiots who wouldn't know AI if it jumped up and bit me .. ok well if it was blatantly obvious but ... sorry I'm old lol I just wasn't trained to think that way. Slow progress happening ..",
            "Agreed. I did not vote but fwiw I would absolutely have voted against AI content. This is a good change by the mods."
