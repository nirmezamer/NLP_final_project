        "content": "Bumble received feedback from women who found that making the first move was \u201ca lot of work\u201d or \u201ca burden,\u201d and Ms. Wolfe Herd began thinking about how to release the pressure. Opening Moves, she said, is a result of that process, a way to let women maintain control while not feeling the stress of initiating all of the conversations.\n\nA new feature, which the company has called \u201cOpening Moves,\u201d allows women to place on their profiles a question, like \u201cWhat is your dream vacation?,\u201d to which men who match can respond. (In nonbinary and same-gender matches, both sides can include these prompts.)\n\nThe shift is a major one for Bumble. Until now, a man who matched with a woman on the app had to wait for her to message him. If she did not initiate a conversation, the match would expire after 24 hours.",

            "Why not just get rid of the timer? How is this the move? Do they think that dudes won't just type the same weird shit they do on other apps instead of answering the question? Do they think women really want to know what every single one of their matches goto karaoke song is? Someone please explain to me how this is a good idea, because I genuinely don't see it.",

            "Will forever be funny to me that bumble, a feminist dating app, created by a feminist woman and who\u2019s main selling point was allowing women to take control of their messages by allowing them to be the one who initiates had to abandon that because they realized women don\u2019t actually want to be in control and don\u2019t actually want to put in the time to initiate messages. They\u2019d much rather sit back and collect messages. Now there\u2019s literally no difference between bumble and the dozen of other apps",
            "So women got a tiny taste of what it\u2019s like to be a man and have to initiate all the time and they said \u201cnope, not happening.\u201d Got it.",

            "I had my height down as 5'7\".\u00a0 Met all really nice women. I made some good friends and ended up with my soulmate. I think it served me well being online as 5'7\". I didn't encounter any fraudsters or catfish or users... just all really nice women. Maybe it was an effective jerk filter. I think being short and ugly has definitely been very detrimental to me professionaly but it has always served me well in my love life. Plain average women do consistently turn up thier noses at me but then a number of tall beautiful women have alway pursued me. In my six weeks on Bumble I got 400 likes, 50 matches on 60 right-swipes, and 28 women asked me out on a date. Not too shabby. I was only looking for one particular woman and I found her.",
            "Damn you lied on your profile for 4 months?\n\nIf I made another profile with photoshopped pictures I\u2019d also get more likes. Just play with the cards you\u2019re dealt with.",
            "Try being 5'7\" and brown.",
            "Dude 23 matches is not a small amount. I'm 6'5, blue eyes, full beard, the whole shebang. I average less than one a month. Sure, 120 is better than 23, but as you can see height alone isn't worth as much as whatever it is you have going for you.",
            "Totally right but I wish height was the main issue. I am 6'1 and I get little matches still. I'm not in the US, but still. The game is getting worse and worse, I am sure the tall profile would get much more 5 years ago.",
            "A lot of those 120 matches probably swiped right based on height alone, which is pretty shallow. I\u2019ve had my heart broken multiple times by guys who are my same height (5\u20197). I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through it. \n\nOn my end of the spectrum right now, I\u2019m having trouble finding anyone who is dating with intention. It\u2019s all a shitshow lol.",
            "Unless you are also bald, overweight and have a micropenis I wouldn't worry about it. Be grateful for your health, looks, family and whatever you have going on in your life and stop worrying about it. Also bear in mind that dating sites are heaving with tall women because most guys wont date a woman who is taller, and most tall guys dont care if their gf is 5 ft nothing lol..\n\nSo shorter guys on dating sites really feel the height issue, when the truth is that tall women are highly over represented on such sites. Its really not such an issue in real life. Fyi I am 5' 9\" and I dont recall a woman ever knocking me back over my height.",
            "I'm shocked that the difference wasn't bigger tbh",
            "You don't have to match with everyone in the world to find happy. There's a long list of people out there who would not care at all."

We can focus on short-term needs and they are opposite of long-term goals! ( I say this for myself, especially!) \nIf a guy is cute, we may make excuses, especially if he ticks the boxes or we've slept with him and ignore the signs or refuse to see/hear what friends or family tell us. It's best to start things off on the right foot and set standards, because later, things can get tricky!!!",
