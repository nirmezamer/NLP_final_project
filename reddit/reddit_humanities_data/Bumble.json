        "content": "Bumble received feedback from women who found that making the first move was \u201ca lot of work\u201d or \u201ca burden,\u201d and Ms. Wolfe Herd began thinking about how to release the pressure. Opening Moves, she said, is a result of that process, a way to let women maintain control while not feeling the stress of initiating all of the conversations.\n\nA new feature, which the company has called \u201cOpening Moves,\u201d allows women to place on their profiles a question, like \u201cWhat is your dream vacation?,\u201d to which men who match can respond. (In nonbinary and same-gender matches, both sides can include these prompts.)\n\nThe shift is a major one for Bumble. Until now, a man who matched with a woman on the app had to wait for her to message him. If she did not initiate a conversation, the match would expire after 24 hours.",

            "So basically, they changed the root of why they created...and women complained.   \nMakes it no different than any other app",
            "Hi",
            "Why not just get rid of the timer? How is this the move? Do they think that dudes won't just type the same weird shit they do on other apps instead of answering the question? Do they think women really want to know what every single one of their matches goto karaoke song is? Someone please explain to me how this is a good idea, because I genuinely don't see it.",
            "Honestly these apps are so awful for men I wonder why they still go on them. I used to understand for bumble to a degree. It was the one app, the one space in the world where they weren't expected to take initiative. It was the one place where the burden was lifted from their shoulders. That burden, which is placed on men in every area of the world, was placed on women on this one app. \n\nThat was \u201ctoo much work\u201d and \u201ca burden\u201d. And yet a majority of the men on the app seem to say that women either will let the match fizzle out, or initiate with \u201cHi\u201d, which women have complained about since the dawn of OLD. But if it\u2019s \u201ctoo much work\u201d and \u201ca burden\u201d for women to take initiative on one fucking dating app, then what does that say about the pressure men have in the dating arena?\n\nHonestly, any man who wants love should realize by now that these apps are catered to women. What women want on these apps, they\u2019ll get, because even if only 30% of the user base is women, that\u2019s enough to bring in droves of men willing to pay good money. I think a statistic from a bumble analyst of some kind said roughly 10% of men get 80% of the right swipes on the app. So in other words, for 90% of men, you\u2019re getting 20% of the right swipes, from 30% of the user base.\n\nI think the only hope of this ever changing is if men just did something like the 4B movement in Korea, but on a larger scale, and successfully. Since that\u2019ll never happen, women will never have the pressure to initiate. Theres too many millennia at this point of societal pressure ingrained into everyone that\u2019s forcing these dumb gendered standards and rules.",
            "This month, 0 matches, next month, twice as many!",
            "What I found comical is for decades, I've been seeing women put on their profiles \"If you message me, say more than just 'hey'\"\n\nThen Bumble comes out and the vast majority of women's openers.... (((hand wave emoji)))\n\nWhich I'm pretty sure just translates to \"hey\" for the TikTok generation. Turns out when you're the one who has to send out dozens of messages to get a single reply, you see why it's only practical to see if there an actual person who will respond on the other end first before putting in much effort.\n\nMatching on dating sites is like being in a room full of a mixture of real people standing perfectly still and very realistic looking mannequins (only on dating sites, the mannequins are bots, scammers, profiles that people barely attend to, matches that changed their mind once you matched, people who got too busy to respond, etc). If you were in that situation, wouldn't you first say something like \"hey\" first just to make sure you are talking to an actual person and not a mannequin before busting into a conversation?",
            "So bumble is now tinder, lol",
            "I'm on bumble because I'm a guy who struggles with the opening move\n\nAlthough usually the opening moves I get are as bad as the ones I send out"
