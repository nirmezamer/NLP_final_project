            "I think this needs to be highlighted\n\nIn most cases, the networking requirement for vSAN Max ranges from 25Gb networking up to 100Gb Ethernet,\u00a0but the requirement\u00a0only applies to the connectivity between hosts within the vSAN Max cluster, not the vSphere hosts that mount the vSAN Max datastore.\u00a0 As shown in Figure 3, the connectivity from the vSphere hosts that mount a vSAN Max datastore can use as little as 10Gb networking.\u00a0\n\nI'm glad to see the hosts mounting vsan max data stores only require 10gb. This should help more organizations adopt the platform. \n\nIs max included in VCF vsan license?  It's not an add on right?\n\nHow about VVF?",
            ">Is max included in VCF vsan license? It's not an add on right?\n\n**There is now 1 vSAN license SKU and that's it. You get 1TiB entitlement with VCF per core, and if you need MORE than that you can buy 1TiB add-on.** \n\n>How about VVF?\n\nVVF has a small amount of production supported that's really intended largely for people to try vSAN but:\n\n  \n1. As of TODAY it's 100GiB per core, and if you go above that you have to \"rebuy\" the full amount needed.  \n2. Functionally above 200-300GiBS per Core VCF I think is just cheaper. \n\n3. You can't pool the entitlement for VVF like you can VCF and go build a max cluster, so functionally Max is always going to be cheaper with VCF licensing + add ons if needed. \n\n  \nIt's been fun talking to customers about MAX, as if they are up for a 40K core VCF licensing renewal they are looking at 40PB of vSAN to play with on Max clusters :)",
            "Good to know it's no longer an add on. When it first was talked about it was going to be an additional license. Glad that changed.",
            "You do need to still buy the Vsphere license to run the max nodes, but, when you build out bodies with 200TB paying for 32 cores of VCF (that gives you 32 of your TIBs) is a rounding error on that BOM vs. the flash drives.",
            "Right minimal for the max nodes. Thanks for clarifying.",
            "I wish we just didn't force the license for the \"OS\" when only used for storage, but:\n\n1. For now we don't actually lock you out from running workloads on a Max cluster, so this cuts both ways (You can throw some Tier 2/DR workload stuff there, just keep in mind we will give vSAN priority to the scheduler I suspect more than those workload). \n\n2. It's mostly to simplify the sales cycle of not having to explain this, than the 2% on the BOM that it represents. Still a small amount of friction will make the sales/parter person explain the value of the solution, and sometimes a small upsell into a customer that \"has everything they need\" helps motivate sales people as bizarre as that sounds."

In investigating we discovered that two of the hosts we put in maintenance mode had NSX related core dumps, so I opened a Sev 2.  The person that got the case told me to remove the core dumps to clear the alerts, so I did that and let them know and then they immediately CLOSED THE CASE! No discussion of what may have caused this, if it explains the VM issues we encountered, and if it is likely to happen again.\n\nThat's when I replied to the closed case and discovered you can't reopen a case once closed.
