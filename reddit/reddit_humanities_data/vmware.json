            "Great job on the TKG stuff, looks promising!",
            "This is going to break so many things im calling it right now lol",
            "this sounds interesting, can you talk about why/what you use it for? what is VBS?",
            "It's opt in, so you can still reboot if you wish. (And nothing stops you from still evacuating a host with vMotion and trying it). The impact of it not working could be reduced to close to zero risk that way.",
            "That's why it's great having a lab. Just upgraded one of the vCenters with the switch over method (whish it could pull the image itself without needing to attach it but maybe in the future?) and then looking forward to trying the live patch when the next esxi version comes out. Also looking forward to the stretched tanzu configuration, hopefully at some point this will also be available with SAN and not only vSAN, fingers crossed.",
            "You said Proxmox/KVM do it, what kind of performance hit would you take with nested pcie passthrough",
            "No idea -- I imagine you are GPU bound and not CPU bound based on the application. So as long as you are minimizing those vmexits then the hit is minimal.",
            "Well yeah, we are a partner, which is why I'm asking, we heard in slack/gchat that it might be an option but nothing confirmed yet. All I know is that many customers would like this option, as for now we just tell them they either have to use the zone setup or two independant clusters with external load balancing. \n\nMost SAN arrays are either HPE Nimble or HPE Alletra MPs.",
            "Just vSAN for now. Should enough customers demand it, we can revisit adding other storage options. (I'm the PM)",
            "Really interested in the tiered memory stuff.\n\nI am somewhat surprised by its requirements (especially in terms of required endurance) because in contrast, swap files don't generally need high endurance at all.\n\nObviously this is not a swap file, even if it somewhat solves the same problem. Would love to learn about its behaviour.\n\n[edit] just released this blog post does not mention that preview-feature, sorry"
