I knew nothing was going to happen but I still got pissed. An hour or so later your hands are on me again so I make a comment about it. I don't remember exactly what I said but it was along the lines of \"if you don't plan on doing anything why do you keep getting my hopes up\" to which you said \"oh I do plan on doing something.\" Yeah. Must not be with me though since I can't even remember what it feels like anymore. I went to bed angry and left for work before you got up.

Nothing sexual just random funny videos.  I\u2019m in most of them. \nI posted a story of me literally brushing my beard.\nI noticed this one particular person was viewing my profile a lot. After two days, she messaged me. We\u2019ve gone back and forth for the last 24hrs. This woman has a profile picture, but nothing else. The talking has been solely based off personality and semi-interesting conversation. The conversation moved from TikTok messaging to Telegram. I realize this alone is cheating. I wouldn\u2019t want my wife to discover these chats regardless if none of it sexual. None of it, but if you wouldn\u2019t want your spouse to know you\u2019re taking to random person of the opposite sex, then it\u2019s obviously not right. I get it.\nHere is the thing, she actually sent me a picture of herself. Nothing sexual. She sent me her instagram and my god she is beautiful. \nLike 9 or 10. You probably would see her and think she\u2019s model or has models at some point.\nYes, she\u2019s real and it\u2019s really her. \nSo I\u2019ve never been unfaithful to my wife, but I may have had a reawakening.\nIn order to not be a hypocrite, I need to divorce my wife. I don\u2019t think aeparating just to have an affair, is right either.\nRemember that scene in Hook when the lost boy grabs Peter (robin william) face and says \u201cthere you are Peter\u201d. I\u2019m the lost boy talking my old confident self.\nI\u2019d rather disrupt my entire fucking life all over again, so that I can get far away from this life with her.\nIt\u2019s just so painful. Every day. The feeling of being unworthy of love or attention, living life with blue balls. Loving someone who just doesn\u2019t feel the same.  I feel like I\u2019m that chubby nerd in high school again. I remember this hopelessness; having a crush on a girl that has no interest in me. \nI\u2019ve been trying for 13 years. I\u2019ve been trying live and love this woman despite her affair and this deadbedroom. I have tried.\nI\u2019m 37 with a fucking $28m retirement plan, six figure job, with an US slightly above average penis. Six figure job. I\u2019m ok. I\u2019m Fucking O. K.\nDead LL woman, shape up. Figure it. \nDon\u2019t say it\u2019s not that easy because you\u2019re in we\u2019re out.\n",

        "content": "I (48HLM) been married for 22 years to my wife (48LLF). When we were dating the sex was good, spontaneous, nothing crazy but there was passion and at 26 I had not the experience to understand or read any red flags. \n\nAfter we got married there was a significant change in her and I quickly reacted from being confused to frustrated to angry very fast. After the first 5 years our sex life was the number 1 subject of our fights. To be honest my communication and emotional skills were never at par with my wife's and obviously being a LLF she used all the tools in the box to make me feel like it was my problem, that my expectations were not based in reality, she felt angry because everything revolves around sex, I am only married to her for sex (this one hits me hard I will explain later), she felt over sexualized she also made my feel inadequate telling me I don't get her, I don't know how to turn her on, etc. Life goes fast, kids are a priority and the 2 times we have sex or to be honest the 2 times a month she donates her empty body to me to fulfill the obligation of meaningless sex (no foreplay, same position, 4 to 6 minutes before she starts complaining) felt like a good trade-off for having a family a great friend and partner, incredible mother, she is a beautiful, funny and smart woman with is terrible jaja because with each passing year the evolution of my self-esteem went from I feel wanted at 26 to why I'm not wanted, to there is something wrong with me, to I better cling to my beautiful wife or I feel anxious, to oh good I am invisible. \n\nI started therapy 5 years ago, why?... you guest it, my wife felt like I was not putting my best effort in our marriage and had a list of issues that I needed to work (all valid, but the stones on this woman), feeling completely panicked by the idea of loosing my wife and family I started therapy (just me, she is a confident, healthy and emotional evolved human that is the pinnacle of human evolution that obviously has nothing to gain from therapy). In therapy I worked on her list of issues and as I started to like how therapy was helping me I started working on myself. 2 years ago I started seeing a sexuality therapist for a year additional to my regular therapy, and she helped me recover my lost self-esteem, she had a mid session with my wife and a final session 1 year ago when we finish our journey, the results of this sessions with my wife were very informative to her. She told me my wife has no interest in sex, she probably has some sexual disfunction that could be worked to improve but it required my wife to work in many fronts to understand which issues are the causes of her disfunction, but my wife is not interested. In the year I worked with the sexuality therapist, I changed radically my views on my marriage but especially in why is not working, why is not my fault alone, why I am not a problem, and each step I saw in a mirror a different man, I started to see trough the veil, I started to recover my self esteem, my personality changed and this brought a tangible change in how I interact with other women. I felt so betrayed by my wife, so angry, but again time brought the calm to understand I will never change her, I am healthy, I am better that I was, I am a good partner, a great dad. She is not bad she is maybe a narcissist but so I am in many issues, she is selfish yes, but she does not fully understand the damage of her actions since she (and now I see it as something that makes me feel bad for her) is not capable of feeling and experience sex and intimacy like I do, at least not with me. Now I see my marriage as a trip and not a destination, I love my family, I love the time I spend with her as a friend and as the mother of my children, I have set a plan and a destination for this trip in which I will explain to her at the end of the line that this for me is not an until death do us apart situation. I have never cheated, in the past year 2 years I have been entertaining the idea and looking for validation that I deserve to cheat, but I am not that kind of guy which is not judging anyone who does, it is a living hell being in a relationship in which you have been erased by your partner. The irony of recovering my self-esteem is that it did not gave me what I wanted which was a better intimacy and sex life with my wife, it gave me the clarity to leave. Sorry for the long rant. \n\n\n\nPS.  about the \"your are with me only for sex part,\"... It took me 22 years to realize the answer is, no I am here with you by your side in love with you even if you are never here for the sex.\n\nEdit: some.typos English is not my first language ",
