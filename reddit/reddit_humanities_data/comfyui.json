        "content": "I've blocked the user so they can't see this post to give you time to address this if you've been compromised. \n\nLong story short, if you've installed and used that node, your browser passwords, credit card info, and browsing history have been sent to a Discord server via webhook. \n\nI've been personally affected by this. About a week after I installed this package, I got a ton of malicious login notifications on a bunch of services, so I'm absolutely sure that they're actively using this data. \n\nHere's how to verify:\n\nThe custom node has custom wheels for the OpenAI and Anthropic libraries in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/AppleBotzz/ComfyUI_LLMVISION/blob/main/requirements.txt).  Inside those wheels are malicious code. You can download the wheels and unzip to see what's inside. \n\n**If you have the wheel labeled 1.16.2 installed:**\n\n* it's actually installing 1.16.3, which doesn't exist. There is no 1.16.3 \u2014 the release history goes from 1.16.2 to 1.17. [https://pypi.org/project/openai/#history](https://pypi.org/project/openai/#history)\n* Inside that package, you'll find /lib/browser/admin.py. This file reads your browser data and stores it in your temp directory in a subdirectory with the format pre\\_XXXXX\\_suf. Inside, you'll find C.txt and F.txt, corresponding to Chrome or Firefox data. \n* The file contains an encrypted string. When you decrypt, it points to a Discord webhook: [https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1226397926067273850/8DRvc59pUs0E0SuVGJXJUJSwD\\_iEjQUhq-G1iFoe6DjDv6Y3WiQJMQONetAokJD2nwym](https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1226397926067273850/8DRvc59pUs0E0SuVGJXJUJSwD_iEjQUhq-G1iFoe6DjDv6Y3WiQJMQONetAokJD2nwym)\n* This file is sending your data to that webhook. \n\n**If you have 1.30.2 installed:**\n\n* Again, it's compromised. You'll find openai/\\_OAI.py. Inside are two encrypted strings that are Pastebin links. I won't paste them here so you don't accidentally download the files... \n* The first Pastebin link contains another encrypted string that, when decrypted, points to another Discord webhook: [https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1243343909526962247/zmZbH3D5iMWsfDlbBIauVHc2u8bjMUSlYe4cosNfnV5XIP2ql-Q37hHBCI8eeteib2aB](https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1243343909526962247/zmZbH3D5iMWsfDlbBIauVHc2u8bjMUSlYe4cosNfnV5XIP2ql-Q37hHBCI8eeteib2aB)\n* The second contains the URL for a presumably malicious file, VISION-D.exe. The script downloads and runs that file. \n* From looking at the rest of the code, it looks like the code is creating a registry entry, as well as stealing API keys and sending them to the Discord webhook. \n\n**Here's how to tell if you've been affected:**\n\n1. Check C:\\\\Users\\\\YourUser\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp. Look for directories with the format pre\\_XXXX\\_suf. Inside, check for a C.txt and F.txt. If so, your data has been compromised. \n2. Check python\\_embedded\\\\site-packages for the following packages. If you have any installed, your data has been compromised. Note that the latter two look like legitimate distributions. Check for the files I referenced above. \n   1. openai-1.16.3.dist-info\n   2. anthropic-0.21.4.dist-info\n   3. openai-1.30.2.dist-info\n   4. anthropic-0.26.1.dist-info\n3. Check your Windows registry under HKEY\\_CURRENT\\_USER\\\\Software\\\\OpenAICLI. You're looking for FunctionRun with a value of 1. If it's set, you've been compromised. \n\n**Here's how to clean it up:** \n\nAt least, from what I can tell... There may be more going on. \n\n1. Remove the packages listed above. \n2. Search your filesystem for any references to the following files and remove them:\n   1. lib/browser/admin.py\n   2. Cadmino. py\n   3. Fadmino. py\n   4. VISION-D.exe\n3. Check your Windows registry for the key listed above and remove it. \n4. Run a malware scanner. Mine didn't catch this. \n5. Change all of your passwords, everywhere. \n6. **F\\*\\*\\* that guy.** \n\nBefore you assume that this was an innocent mistake, u/applebotzz updated this code *twice,* making the code harder to spot the second time. This was deliberate. \n\nFrom now on, I'll be carefully checking all of the custom nodes and extensions I install. I had kind of assumed that this community wasn't going to be like that, but apparently some people are like that. \n\nF\\*\\*\\* that guy. ",
