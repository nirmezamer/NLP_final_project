Global debt levels reaching a record high of $220 Trillion after the covid pandemic loans\n\n**Nationalism and Populism**\n\n* 1930s : Nationalist and facism movements gained huge momentum and people were in need of leadership to restore national pride and address economic issues\n* Today : Nationalist and right-wing populist movements are rising in many countries, often as reaction to europeanization, globalization and cultural pressure. We also witnessed movements such as Brexit emphasizing national sovereignty and better control over immigration.\n\n**Geopolitical Tensions**\n\n* 1930s : Territorial ambitions and unresolved grievances from World War I led to aggressive expansionism by countries like Germany, Italy, and Japan.\n* Today : There are ongoing territorial disputes and power struggles, particularly involving major powers like the US, China, and Russia. There are major escalations going on as of right now (Ukraine, Israel)\n\n**Cultural and Identity conflicts**\n\n* 1930s : Anti-Semitism, racism, and xenophobia were rampant, leading to discriminatory policies and violence.\n* Today : Similar cultural and identity conflicts are evident, with rising xenophobia, anti-immigrant sentiment, and ethnic tensions. There also seems to be a rise of \"anti-culture\"\n\n**Militarism and military spend**\n\n* 1930s : post WW1 conflict, there was an increased focus on militarism and military spend\n* Today : Global military expenditure has been rising to over 2 trillion and is constantly growing\n\nSome key differences that could help prevent further escalation\n\n* Organizations like UN, NATO and other regional instances should help in conflict prevention and resolution.\n* Large scale wars would be economically damaging to many involved parties as we have a highly interconnected world\n* Nuclear deterrence \n* Technology (although this could easily be seen as conflict facilitator)\n\nSo - are we seeing the same signals building up over time again?

            "One major difference is the presence of the US on the global stage. Like it or hate it, there\u2019s almost no denying the fact that the US can win any conventional war it takes a side on, only really facing difficulty in terms of long term occupation in the face of a dedicated insurgency.

            "> Today : Economic uncertainties are rising, we see impact on inequality, recession and unemployment rates growing steadily.\n\nCan you confirm where this is happening?  In the US we're seeing issues with inflation and corporate greed but there's no indication of a recession, we're at very low unemployment, and salaries have risen.\n\n> Today : Nationalist and right-wing populist movements are rising in many countries, often as reaction to europeanization, globalization and cultural pressure. We also witnessed movements such as Brexit emphasizing national sovereignty and better control over immigration.\n\nI don't fully disagree here, but I do think that the majority of people aren't right-wing populists.  It should be enough to prevent major problems, but it's still too close for comfort.\n\n> Today : There are ongoing territorial disputes and power struggles, particularly involving major powers like the US, China, and Russia. There are major escalations going on as of right now (Ukraine, Israel)\n\nIs there any indication that this is unusual?  From what I've seen of history, there are almost always territorial disputes and conflict.  Israel has been in a fight for longer than you or I have been alive.  Ukraine didn't even exist as a nation when I was born.\n\n> Today : Similar cultural and identity conflicts are evident, with rising xenophobia, anti-immigrant sentiment, and ethnic tensions. There also seems to be a rise of \"anti-culture\"\n\nAt least in the US this is still something that is more prevalent in older generations than in younger ones.  I'd even argue that under-50's are less racist and xenophobic than those over 50.\n\n> Today : Global military expenditure has been rising to over 2 trillion and is constantly growing\n\nThis could be argued as preserving peace as well.  There have been no major global wars since nuclear weapons were brought onto the scene, for example.\n\nUltimately I don't want to criticize your view too much but it seems to be lacking in some aspects of the broader scope of world history.  It feels like you said, \"I'm going to state that X is a problem today, and I will look for evidence that Y was a similar problem that existed prior to WWII.\"  If you take more of a data-driven approach I think you might find that despite our problems that we face, we are actually still in a pretty good time of history.

The premise of the books \"The Forth Turning\"  and \"The Forth Turning is Here\" is that we have a pattern of four sequential generational archetypes which form a seculum and that has cycled since Elizabethian England.\n\nThe fourth turning is the end of the seculum punctuated by a crisis.  Their estimate is that this crisis will happen before 2032. \n\nWhat exactly will precipitate it isn't certain but there are plenty of candidates; another pandemic, expanded war with Russia, the Middle East, Taiwan, the AI singularity and more.\n\nIf you think we are on the brink of a crisis what might you do to prepare?  \n\nGet healthy, lose weight, exercise, improve your diet, get better sleep.  Get out of debt.  Diversify.  Learn practical skills.  Solidify your relationships. Pretty much what you should already be doing.  Resilient people will weather the storm better."

We have identified how millions of concepts are represented inside Claude Sonnet, one of our deployed large language models. This is the first ever detailed look inside a modern, production-grade large language model. This interpretability discovery could, in future, help us make AI models safer.\"\n\nEssentially, the Anthropic team has been tracking the 'internal state' of its AI models as they work, having them spit out great lists of numbers representing the 'neuron activations' in their artificial brains as they interact with humans.\n\nWhat's more, the researchers were able to look at the relationships between different concepts stored in the model's 'brain,' developing a measure of 'distance' between them and building a series of mind maps that show how closely concepts are connected. Near the Golden Gate Bridge concept, for example, the team found other features like Alcatraz island, the Golden State Warriors, California Governor Gavin Newsom and the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.\"",

            "At this point I hope the robots take over and delete all religions and ideas of race and historical conflicts.\n\nMake the earth a glorified prison colony for a few thousand years until we get a nice solar flair that kills all the AI and the world resets. \n\nThen we will start worshiping the sun again for saving us all, and we can start the next cycle of human existence on earth. \n\nThe end.",
            "What a bs article. Of course we know how llms 'think'. It's a statistically trained model, that's pretty much it. We know how they work in detail, or else we couldn't build and improve them. It's no mystery at all to the creators.\n\nWe were just surprised how well transformers scaled with computing power, that's all.",
            "AI is intelligent the same way that a submarine swims.",
            "\u201cTotal Mystery \u201c - bunch of non-sense. You can literally step through the algorithms and look exactly at what is going on. It\u2019s software. \n\nThey might be surprised that their learning algorithm is so effective. That\u2019s a fair observation."
