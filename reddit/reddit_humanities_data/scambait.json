            "I didn\u2019t think this is a scam because I myself have been bordered, and it was indeed a set bacak to my carrer. \n\n (As a sidenote - do you think Johnny Depp has ever had a bath?)",
            "Honestly until he said the 'no sex' thing, I'm not even sure he was even reading any of the replies. He just seemed to by copy/pasting in the next part of the convo no matter what you said until then.",
            "Bit of a sad update. Well, not really. He deserved it. Looks like our \"Christopher\" did something to get his page taken down before I could reply. He sent a message asking me if I'm helping just after midnight. When I saw it and went to reply, I got a message saying I couldn't send. I went to go look at his Facebook page, and it's been taken down. Our man did something big to get that to happen as Facebook is super slow to take these scammers down.  Myself, and others, have sent hundreds of messages to Facebook just to have Facebook say the page isn't in violation  of TOS. Oh well it was fun while it lasted.",
            "To paraphrase a movie, this is the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever heard a scammer say and has made everyone else who reads it stupider.",
            "Lol",
            "Ya, I can tell this one is 16-19. MAYBE 20, but that's pushing it.  I don't know if he will come back.  I may have fried his brain. Maybe he will talk to his Oga if he is lucky enough to have one.  Tho, based on how this has gone so far, I don't think he has more than maybe a few classmates to help."
