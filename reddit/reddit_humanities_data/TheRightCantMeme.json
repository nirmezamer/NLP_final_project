        "content": "Hello, we're announcing a new rule today requiring all users to **deface** right-wing memes before you post them. \n\nWhat do we mean by \"deface\". [Example Meme](https://imgur.com/sUkjyvt) - a simple \"x\" or \"cross\" on the image would suffice, anything that keeps the meme readable/legible for critique on this sub but makes it useless for spreading propaganda.\n\nThe rationale is simple, for some time we've been concerned that this subreddit is essentially platforming and spreading reactionary propaganda as much as it is criticizing it. We want to solve that issue.\n\nWe feel that defacing the memes will stop people from being able to use this subreddit as a resource to share propaganda further. Plus, it will make people who see it slow down and think more critically about what they're seeing if it appears in r/all or on a user's homepage. It also takes away the power and visual impact of the propaganda when it's got some scribbles or whatever over it. \n\nAnd on a slightly more \"meta\" note, it means that this sub will be able to catch out bots and karma farmers easier. \n\n[Further examples](https://imgur.com/a/defacing-memes-guide-suggestions-Bj2ihKr) - all just suggestions, you don't have to follow all of these exactly.\n\nYou're free to be as creative as you like with it, you don't have to follow the exact same methods as we used here. My examples used MS Paint but you can use whatever software you like. And every meme you post will require its own approach. The important thing, however, is that they are reasonably defaced in someway. \n\nWe understand that people often get used to doing things a certain way there can be some \"growing pains\" especially with a dramatic shift like this. We're going to give everyone til the end of the month to start doing it and, starting June 1st we will be enforcing this rule heavily. We will not necessarily issue bans but we will be removing posts that do not follow this rule. \n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask them below or [click here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/TheRightCantMeme) to message our mod team. \n\nP.S. Just a reminder to keep censoring reddit usernames and subreddit names. You do not have to do this for Twitter or any other platform however.",

            "Thanks for all of your eagerness but please stop reporting posts under this rule until it goes into full enforcement on June 1st. It's clogging the mod queue ",
            "This is the way. It's a known psychological phenomenon that simply reposting with commentary still spreads the original message.",
            "i've been getting sick of seeing random right wing memes and reading them before realizing what sub it's from, defacing is great but maybe spoiler tag too? Either way it makes it easier to skip if i'm not in the mood",
            "If I ever post any I'm gonna cover them in gay furry shit",
            "I could make a website that you could easily upload/ paste in your image, and then download / paste in the edited version \"defaced\"",
            "Will take a good second or too to get used to but it sounds like a good rule",
            "While we're at it, can we institute some sort of \"minimum engagement\" threshold for memes that are posted here?\n\nIt's not much fun seeing Nazi tweets in my feed, but it's even worse when it's from some nobody that you've never heard of and has two likes. At that point, we're just giving them a bigger platform than they had in the first place when we re-post it here.",
            "In my opinion this will just make it so people won't post as much because they don't feel like going through the effort of defacing memes.",
            "This is smart. There are SOOOO many obvious bad faith posters on this sub that just want leftists to see their content.",
            "I recommend pinning this post before the end of the month to drive the point home for those who just skim the rules"
