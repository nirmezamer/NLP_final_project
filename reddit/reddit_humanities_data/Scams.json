        "content": "I wanted to take a quick IQ test online. So I found this sponsored site called cerebrum IQ on google and decided to go for it.\n\nAfter taking, it asked for my card to sign me up for a subscription that I could cancel any time. So like a dumba#s I put my card info in and tried to cancel.\n\nThing is I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll actually go through with the cancellation since it just seems like an automated bot just sending me emails without any form of receipt.\n\nDoing some research now, Ive heard stories from people being charged 50 bucks weekly with no way for them to cancel on the site.\n\nAfter trying to contact them through their email, they reached out and said my cancelation supposedly went through and that they are now processing a \"GDPR\" withdrawal which will take a month to finalize. Whatever that means lol.\n\nThing is I really don\u2019t know if the site saved my card info. And if somebody now has my bank account details\u2026\n\nSo what's the safest option for me to do? Should I go through the hassle of making a new card due to the apparent risks ? I received a notification that a check of 0.99 dollars is being processed. Since its a weekend rn I can't contact my bank abt it.\n\nIf you have any suggestions, please reach out.\n\nGuess in a way the website really did test my IQ..\n\n**EDIT: To all future \"scam victims\":**\n\nThe site uses deceptive tactics to try to trick you into signing up for an expensive subscription that you were unaware of. Cancelling the subscription is made to be overly difficult and even then they may not follow through with your **cancellation** request.\n\nAs such,\n\nYour best bet is to freeze your bank account immediately.\n\nContact your bank and ask for a new card, your bank will usually get you a new one within a week for dirt cheap (if not for free).\n\nIf you paid with an online service (APPLE PAY, PAYPAL), just google for ways to cancel the transaction from going through. However, you may still want to consider replacing your card nonetheless.\n\nAfter you make sure your financials are no longer tied to the website. I'd advise you to send them an email asking them to cancel your subscription and delete your account.",

I gave them an alt email.

Seeing as they have a subscription to improve one's IQ score, I *suspect* the test results are purposely designed to give back low score results to promote users to buy their product to improve the user's IQ score = more money for them. If that's true, you're paying to improve taking their test rather than actually increase your intelligence. Seems pointless. For those wondering, I got a 98 IQ score from Cerebrum IQ."

        "content": "I got a call a couple of weeks ago.  The number was blocked, but I had just had several minor home emergencies come up and wasn't really thinking and answered it.\n\nIt was my bank (they identified the correct bank, and asked for me by name), saying they had noticed some fraudulent activity on my card.  They wanted confirmation that several charges were fraudulent, so they could lock the card, reverse the charges, and send me a new card.\n\nWell, that's happened at least three times before, though not recently, so nothing unusual.  Just another chore.  They went through about four charges, giving the time, place, and amount.  None were me, of course.  It was hypnotic; going through a bank routine I'd done several times before.  They said they removed the charges.\n\nThen, with all that cleared up, they wanted me to verify I could log in to the mobile app as well.  Which... was odd.  How would stealing my card information have impacted that?  But logging in to the mobile app is safe, so I did.\n\nThey mentioned, without being prompted, that the charges they discussed were already removed and would not show up in the app that I was now looking at.  Except... no bank moves *that* fast.  Least of all mine.  But again, *not* seeing fraudulent charges was no cause for concern, so I dismissed it.  But the two things were starting to wake me up from the \"just following along with the bank to get this cleared up\" hypnotic state.\n\nThen they (after asking if they could send a text) texted me a link so that I could verify the web portal worked too.\n\nI didn't want to go find my super long and random password that is normally managed by an app on my computer that stores things like that securely, and anyway those little red flags were still niggling at my mind and *holy fuck they just asked me to click a link* ***they*** *sent me and enter my bank password.*\n\nWell *that* woke me up once I realized it.  That's when it sunk in what they were doing and what they were after.  Suddenly I realized a bunch of other security things my bank does when I talk to them over the phone (like voice passwords) hadn't happened, and I'd failed to note their absence.\n\nI hung up, and started poking around on my computer.  The bank account website they sent me was convincing - except that only the name and password parts actually worked.  And the source code was full of hidden text to disrupt search engine attempts to locate it.  And it was registered to an empty lot in a nearby city.  And after a failure or two to make sure you're typing your password correctly, it re-directs you to the real thing with a pleasant confirmation message that everything works now.  \n\nThe best I could do is get it taken down, and I'm sure they've put it back up somewhere else.  It was clearly code they'd been using a while despite the site only having been registered for two weeks.  How many people's life savings do you think they stole in two weeks?  I loose sleep over it.\n\nBe careful out there folks.  They could have taken everything I've worked for and everything my family depends on just because I answered the phone while tired and distracted.",

The fraudster will tell you to answer YES because it's a test. But it's actually them making a purchase with your card and you're telling the bank that you're accepting the purchase as valid.\n\nAlso, a bank agent when calling you will never ever ask you for any personal information. They are the ones calling you, they've already verified you by calling the verified number on your file.\n\nLastly, when you confront them saying that you have a doubt and prefer calling the bank yourself, they'll try to keep you on the phone by telling you there are long wait times and more fraud can be put on your card while you wait. \nWhile a real bank agent will very politely tell you that they'll leave a note on the account that you were uncomfortable with the outcall and will call back. And they'll tell you to call the number in back of your card. \n\nRemember, if the bank calls you, the card is already locked and no other transactions can be put on it.

        "content": "Does anyone know what scam this could possibly be and what precautions I should take?\n\nOver the past 2 weeks, someone has been ordering large deliveries of food to my house that I did not order. I thought it was new neighbors getting their address confused. However, it's happened 8 times and has already been paid for when we've asked (and no, the drivers would not just give me free food - I asked on the 7th and 8th times because I was starting to get pissed lol). One driver said that the caller said his house was in my backyard. There is no house there. I live in a single family home. This is also creepy because the delivery driver was walking around my backyard looking for the house, which lured me outside to talk to him. I will no longer be answering the door and will be speaking through my doorbell camera.\n\nI also learned from other neighbors that those new neighbors who I thought were getting confused are out of town, so it can't be them. Those are also the only 2 neighbors who could possibly be construed as living behind my house the way the street is laid out. When I explain the situation to the drivers, they call the number that ordered it, but they never answer. It actually happened twice from the same restaurant within 20 minutes.\n\nHere's where I messed up. Thinking it was new neighbors, I texted the number from the receipt and told them to please update their address in their ordering app. They didn't respond, and now I'm realizing that they have my address and now my phone number. Maybe that's what they were trying to get the whole time to steal my identity. That was dumb. Another concern is maybe they're casing my house to find out when I'm home. At first I thought that was unlikely since the orders have already been paid for, but they could be using stolen credit cards.\n\nI did some internet sleuthing that I learned from Catfish and found two people tied to that number (one is a man tied to that number. An email for a woman was also tied to that number). The address listed is on the other side of the metro 30 miles away, so there's no way they are ordering food in my neighborhood to be delivered to their house. I found both people on Facebook, and they are Facebook friends with each other, so I'm pretty sure it's them.\n\nAny ideas on how to get this to stop and what precautions I should take? I will work on freezing my credit this weekend and changed my Google password already. I also blocked those two people on Facebook so I won't show up on people they may know and give them more info about my identity. Should I go to the police? Any advice is appreciated. TIA.\n\n",

I thought maybe due to a construction detour, so I followed it, and it actually advised me to park one street behind his place, and *get out and walk across his backyard neighbor\u2018s property, jump the fence, and arrive at my friend\u2019s house.* It was so bizarre.
