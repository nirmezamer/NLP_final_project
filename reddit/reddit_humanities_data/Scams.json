        "content": "We have noticed a substantial uptick of brigading in the sub in recent weeks. It happens every now and then, but we have had ***four*** different threads targeted in the past few weeks. Specifically, these threads are being targeted by either bots or dedicated individuals who are mass reporting threads [like this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/15gloux/chesterzodacom_digital_doctor_scam/), [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/17nnv6c/beware_cody_kerns_sergio_troconis_justin/), and [this pair](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/17exqbt/stocks_scam_using_whatsapp_groups/) of [threads.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/17exf81/stocks_scam_on_whatsapp/) (ETA 11/27: [This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/151nyat/beware_of_chester_zoda_course/) is now being brigaded, bringing the total up to 5 threads being targeted). Spammers are reporting these for ridiculous reasons that are unrelated to the content of the posts, including:\n\n* Scambaiting\n* Personal information\n* Spam\n* Off topic\n* Sexual content containing minors\n\nSpammers aren't just targeting the OPs, but also the commenters as well. The brigading will target commenters making general observations, or sharing their personal experience with these businesses.\n\nALL of the individuals named above present themselves as public figures, and have their identities intertwined with their businesses.\n\nI want to outline the following important information to all 600,000 of you in this sub.\n\n1. Brigading **WILL** be addressed with Reddit. We have worked to get these threads reinstated by contacting Mod Support and reporting the abuse of the reporting/voting system. I have checked all of the above threads in incognito mode and they are now visible again to users who are logged out.\n2. If a thread manages to get removed due to this mass reporting, please send the team a Modmail. We will contact Reddit to get your post reinstated, as we can see all of the reports contained in your thread.\n3. If you are shadowbanned by Reddit's automated bots due to mass-reporting of your thread, contact us via Modmail if you suspect this has happened. You can still communicate with us, and we can try to help you. You should also contact Reddit yourself through [this reporting form on ZenDesk.](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new#:~:text=You%20will%20escalate%20these%20requests,to%20contact%40reddit.com)\n4. If you are harassed by individuals named in your thread, use the reporting form to report the abuse, and contact us directly. If you have screenshots of PMs you have received, please upload them to Imgur and send them to us via Modmail.\n\nI'd also like to outline this brigading has drawn attention to these threads which are several weeks old, and has allowed us to approve comments that were caught by Automod or were automatically removed due to mass reporting.\n\nStay safe, all. Keep sharing your experiences, keep asking your questions about potential scams (whether they have been posted here one time or a million), and always stay vigilant.",

Even very expensive video and other ads or even the cheapest contact with as many as they can. Scam epidemic. Greed epidemic. Poisons of all types created and spread epidemic.

They stated that they were trying to send the money to another person with a phone number that is one digit different from his. \n\nSo my husband called that number, spoke to the person that was supposed to receive the money, and she verified her name and the amount. I was able to verify their identity matched their phone number (very close to his) online. \n\nWe know this is a common scam. How are we supposed to verify that this is a legit accident though and safely get the money back to them? He explained to both parties on the phone our concerns, they sounded understanding, and their voices do seem to match the photos that I found of them online. \n\n*EDIT: ok thank you all for the responses! We are letting our bank take care of it and will no longer be engaging with whoever sent it. I appreciate all the insight and I am much more confident that this is most likely a scam. ",
