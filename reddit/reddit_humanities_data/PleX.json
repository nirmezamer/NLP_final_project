Most of my library is 480p from DVDs and 1080p from Blu Ray. I've seen posts here with people saying they have hundreds (or more) of 4K movies. \n\nFor reference, I've got a relatively \"beginner\" library with about 400 movies. I doubt I'll ever be a thousands kind of guy, but I do appreciate high definition for what I've got.\n\nDo you buy them all on disc? I just flashed my drive to handle them, so that's not an issue anymore. The 4K discs seem somewhat rare though, and the cost adds up quickly...\n\nIs there some kind of legitimate web store without DRM? Or are people using \"alternate\" downloading sources?\n",

Just because companies like Synology or Qnap lets you install applications doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a good idea, it\u2019s a storage server not an application server. If you want to run applications, get a separate box. N100 is a great and cheap choice for most use cases including Plex.",

To do that, I have been using the Plex guides to add a \"-trailer.mp4\" file to specific folders.  Anyway, I have discovered some of the tv shows seem to have automatic trailers. Trailers I do not have locally. I also experimented with playing trailers before movies and it keeps playing automatic ones I don't have locally! But all the options and resources I find about this says those automatic trailer-sourcing features are for Plex Pass only? (which I don't have.) It's annoying as I only want to do my local stuff but it keeps automatically sourcing stuff which is supposed to be a Plex Pass only feature? But it's happening lol. Am I doing something wrong?",
