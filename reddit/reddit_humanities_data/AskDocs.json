            "I just needed to vent.  On facebook I'm part of a group where people talk (among other things) about health concerns, things going on with our bodies.  Someone posted a suggestion for how to lie or fudge the truth to get a certain kind of treatment from your physician.  This really upset me and it's been on my mind all day.  What has become of mutual trust with our medical care?  Has it really come to not only second guessing our physicians' expertise but also lying/exaggerating in order to get a certain answer?  Ugh, don't know how you all do it...I did respond to the post (suggesting that the poster might consider another opinion from someone different if she didn't trust her physician) but I don't expect it will lead anywhere productive.  I don't know, it alarms me somehow, this undervaluing of medical expertise and undermining of our mutual trust.  I know there are bad physicians and physicians who aren't as informed about certain topics.  But it's always been my position that you switch docs (or at least get another opinion) rather than lie or manipulate if the trust isn't there.  Vent over.",

        "content": "I\u2019ve seen this doctor one time. Instead of addressing my concerns, this doctor largely focused on my weight, and suggested I not sit around and eat carbs all day. (I am a VERY active person). When I asked what my goal should be, the doctor said I should lose 5 lbs.\n\nThis did not sit well with me, so I left a review. The same day, I received a call from this doctor. I truly thought that if this doctor was calling me outside of an appointment, I must have misunderstood something, because the only other times a doctor has called me was to deliver results. Instead, they asked me to take my review down and claimed I hurt their feelings, and my critique was inconsiderate because of their experience as a teenager. After I agreed to take the review down, this doctor continued to raise their voice at me and threatened to sue me. I had no idea how to respond.\n\nI took the review down. Then I saw one other review on a different site that claimed this doctor threatened them the same way for leaving a bad review.\n\nI opted to re-write my review in an objective lens, no false claims, no emotionally charged statements. I posted this morning. \n\nThis doctor then called me today saying they were concerned about my mental health because of my bad review, using my medical history as leverage. I asked the doctor to no longer contact me. They asked if I wanted to call my psychiatrist before they did to let them know they\u2019d be receiving a call from this doctor about their concerns. I did not say yes or no. \n\nThis doctor DID call my psychiatrist, and the psychiatrist called my emergency contact to check on me. (I am fine, but obviously upset by all of this)\n\nI feel so violated that a doctor would leverage my medical history against me like this, and that they have access to very personal medical records. \n\nCan this doctor do this?? What can I do? \n\n",

            "This is why I am afraid of defending myself when doctors do something bad to me. However, I wont let them over power me.Those psychiatrists I dealt April 23rd - May 1st were completely ignorant. They didnt believe I was suicidal at all. However, I fought back. I left and filed a complaint with the hospital, left a review on the hospital and even that one psychiatrist who shamed me for coming there for help. She said to watch what I say or else I will be locked up in a facility for weeks. Humana is currently investigating this issue, but the patient advocate did not believe the insurance claim was denied because I was not suicidal. She said she would have to view the claim herself, um she could access it herself? Thats just lazy.",

            "Generally others providers word does count higher. But unless the patient is showing signs that of danger to themselves or others, none of my attending will uphold an involuntary commitment petition. We have had people come in by police, with county petition already filled out, and we have denied it before and released the patient. While its def a scary threat, and def can end badly, its not as simple as she said he said",

Then there is a full psych evaluation. Depending on the state, thats where the decision for inpatient admission takes place.\n\nI have never seen patients brought in by police for mandatory evaluation because some doctor called them. Its usually because they were out in public demonstrating severe illness (being violent, walking around naked in traffic, held a gun in their mouth, etc)"

Hes been in the NICU since (2 weeks). \nMom (40F) had gestational diabetes and high blood pressure during pregnancy. \n\nHe was born with Down syndrome, AVSD (no current surgery needed), born with jaundice (clearing up well), low sp02 (he\u2019s on and off oxygen) and has shallow irregular breathing at times, has a feeding tube (try to push bottle but usually need NG), he has an infection in his blood (not sure what exactly, is this called sepsis?), IV in his belly button for more than 10 days now. \n\nThey tried to insert a PICC line 4-5 times now unsuccessfully. They tired both arms legs and forehead. he has been moved between 2 hospitals to get this done. Now they are trying to get an IV in through somewhere other than his belly button but have already been unsuccessful once. \n\nI\u2019m just seeking help and advice as my family is suffering and don\u2019t know what to think or do. My mom is an immigrant and knows little to nothing about Down syndrome or the other things he has, let alone any of the technical terms the nurses and doctors tell her. She hasn\u2019t been eating or sleeping and just cries all day, so I\u2019ve had to step in and play a major role, yet I\u2019m not sure how to make sense of all this, what to tell her, what questions to ask the medical teams, etc.\n\nHow serious is the blood infection? Will we see long term problems due to this? Why has the PICC line and IV been so unsuccessful? \n\nThe staff at the hospital are clearly overworked and all the beds are filled with a constant movement of babies in and out to make room. I feel we haven\u2019t had a proper sit down for all his health problems to be thoroughly explained as there\u2019s just no time from them. ",

The mother deserves to hear as much information as any native speaker in this situation. Having a family member interpreting for her or summarizing the doctors words and choosing what to tell her is not a solution.",

Theres been some missed information and items when he is handed off between hospitals and staff and they turn to us to fill in the blank so I will definitely keep notes of everything moving forward. Thank you.",

They can help navigate a lot of this, help set up meetings, ensure interpreters if needed are available, etc. They can also get the ball rolling on disability benefits for your brother which will help offset ongoing and long term costs associated with his care.",

            "All the staff have phones that are to be used for medical interpretation and there are also in house phones, family members are not to be used for interpretation because they often confuse words.",
            "I hope this helps! Not everyone will know all these answers, but they should be able to direct you to the right person and everyone will have SOME information. You should also write down what medications he is getting and how often. They will probably change!",

            "Most hospitals have medical social workers who can be a great help just finding resources or explaining how certain processes and things work. A nurse should be able to tell you how to reach them."
