            "I just needed to vent.  On facebook I'm part of a group where people talk (among other things) about health concerns, things going on with our bodies.  Someone posted a suggestion for how to lie or fudge the truth to get a certain kind of treatment from your physician.  This really upset me and it's been on my mind all day.  What has become of mutual trust with our medical care?  Has it really come to not only second guessing our physicians' expertise but also lying/exaggerating in order to get a certain answer?  Ugh, don't know how you all do it...I did respond to the post (suggesting that the poster might consider another opinion from someone different if she didn't trust her physician) but I don't expect it will lead anywhere productive.  I don't know, it alarms me somehow, this undervaluing of medical expertise and undermining of our mutual trust.  I know there are bad physicians and physicians who aren't as informed about certain topics.  But it's always been my position that you switch docs (or at least get another opinion) rather than lie or manipulate if the trust isn't there.  Vent over.",

The same day, I received a call from this doctor. I truly thought that if this doctor was calling me outside of an appointment, I must have misunderstood something, because the only other times a doctor has called me was to deliver results. Instead, they asked me to take my review down and claimed I hurt their feelings, and my critique was inconsiderate because of their experience as a teenager. After I agreed to take the review down, this doctor continued to raise their voice at me and threatened to sue me. I had no idea how to respond.\n\nI took the review down. Then I saw one other review on a different site that claimed this doctor threatened them the same way for leaving a bad review.\n\nI opted to re-write my review in an objective lens, no false claims, no emotionally charged statements. I posted this morning. \n\nThis doctor then called me today saying they were concerned about my mental health because of my bad review, using my medical history as leverage. I asked the doctor to no longer contact me. They asked if I wanted to call my psychiatrist before they did to let them know they\u2019d be receiving a call from this doctor about their concerns. I did not say yes or no. \n\nThis doctor DID call my psychiatrist, and the psychiatrist called my emergency contact to check on me.

            "Hey OP. I\u2019m so sorry you are in this situation. This is difficult and complicated. I recommend you do the following:\n\n1. Get a paper journal. Take notes or have whoever is in the room take notes whenever someone comes in with updates. Write down:\n\n- Who the person is (feel free to ask for a name, they won\u2019t be offended even if you\u2019ve seen them a lot) and what team they are from (surgery? NICU? Etc.)\n- The current situation (ask questions!) including whether they think your brother is better or worse today.\n- The next steps (ie what tests/labs/images/surgery/clinical situation you are waiting on now)\n- When they expect the next step to be done or the next labs to be back.\n- whether they think your brother will be able to go home, whether they are worried he won\u2019t make it, or if he will need more care elsewhere, and about how long they think it will take to find out.\n\nSOMEONE should be able to review all of these questions with you at least once a day.\n\n2. For right now, ask the nurse to set up a family meeting with the doctor team to get an idea of what is happening right now and get you and mom on the same page. Ask the questions listed above and ask for a summary of everything that is causing your brother problems right now and what he will need for the future.\n\n3. What social media does your mom use? If Facebook or Reddit check out Down Syndrome support groups. They can help support your family emotionally and logistically with their next steps.\u00a0\n\nSepsis is often caused by blood infections, but it\u2019s a description of signs and symptoms that tell us someone is critically ill. I don\u2019t know what bacteria \u00a0is causing the sepsis.",
            "Hi friend, I agree with the other recommendation to get a notepad and write everything down as well as a medical interpreter. To answer a couple of your questions: \n\n1. Sepsis is an infection that gets into the blood. It can be pretty serious so the doctors are giving your brother antibiotics directly into his blood. If he gets better from the infection, it should generally not have any effect on him long-term \n\n2. Newborn babies are hard to get an IV in because their veins are so small. Babies that have been just born we can put IVs in their belly button because that was open and how they were getting stuff in the blood when they were inside their mothers. However, the umbilical cord dries up and falls off and for that reason the IV in the umbilical cord/IV doesn\u2019t last much longer than the first week. A PICC is an IV that lasts longer because it has a longer tube in it than a regular IV. It is probably difficult for the team  to get a PICC or IV in your little brother because he is a little newborn baby and they have tiny little veins. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your family is going through this right now and I send you my best wishes",
            "It might be a good idea to get the doctors to gp through this all with your mum and a translator (hospitals usually can provide this) if her English isn't so good especially with the medical terms \n\n\nAnd is she getting looked after at all? Obviously it's a rubbish situation, which is understandably upsetting, but she could have some post partum anxiety/depression/PTSD through all of this",
            "Piggybacking to say that OP needs to request a medical interpreter for their mom, especially for the family meeting with the medical team. The mother deserves to hear as much information as any native speaker in this situation. Having a family member interpreting for her or summarizing the doctor\u2019s words and choosing what to tell her is not a solution.",
            "Thank you for your response, we have no knowledge of how we should interact with healthcare professionals and what is within our rights, or what is to be expected as we\u2019ve never been in this position. This is truly very helpful and I will do all of the things you\u2019ve listed. There\u2019s been some missed information and items when he is handed off between hospitals and staff and they turn to us to fill in the blank so I will definitely keep notes of everything moving forward. Thank you.",
            "NAD but adding on to say that we did 89 days in the NICU and the hospital social worker was invaluable to us! If they have not offered to connect you please ask them to. They can help navigate a lot of this, help set up meetings, ensure interpreters if needed are available, etc. They can also get the ball rolling on disability benefits for your brother which will help offset ongoing and long term costs associated with his care.",
            "NAD but these are stressful times for you and it's more than you should do normally as a sibling. Please make sure you can vent to someone as well. Whether it's a friend, a family member or a therapist. Also make sure you get your sleep. It's very important you look after yourself.",
            "Yes PLEASE ask for a formal interpreter for the family meeting if your mom\u2019s native language is anything other than English!",
            "This is so important. I\u2019ve worked with immigrant families for over 3 decades in an educational setting. I\u2019ve also acted as interpreter in that setting, but I\u2019m very fluent in the language of education in both Spanish and English. \n\nI once considered freelancing on the side as a medical interpreter and was given a bilingual list of medical terms I needed to know to pass a fluency exam. Not only did I struggle immensely with the medical terms in Spanish, the English terms and vocabulary were a bit difficult, also. \n\nThis is why professionals, not family members, are so important in each different field. I would have struggled in a medical setting, but, so too, would a medical interpreter in a school setting. Each has their own specific \u201c \u201clanguage\u201d and vocabulary. An interpreter needs to be fluent in both languages, including their native language."
