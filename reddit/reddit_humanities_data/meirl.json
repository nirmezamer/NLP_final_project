I needed a new heel for my shoe, so, I decided to go to Morganville, which is what they called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion to my belt, which was the style at the time.

Oh yeah, the important thing was I had an onion on my belt, which was the style at the time. They didn't have white onions because of the war.
