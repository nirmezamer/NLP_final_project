        "content": "# Part 1: Basics, Game Mechanics, & DLC questions\n\n**0. What is Cyberpunk 2077?**\n\nAnswer: Cyberpunk 2077 is a 2020 action role-playing video game developed by CD Projekt Red and published by CD Projekt, and based on Mike Pondsmith's Cyberpunk tabletop game series. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_2077). Similar games [can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LowSodiumCyberpunk/comments/187u2z4/games_like_cyberpunk_to_get_into/).\n\n**1. Should I buy the game?**\n\nShort answer: Yes.\n\nLong answer: Yes, the game is really great. [Here is the sales tracker for Steam](https://steamdb.info/app/1091500/).\n\n**2. Should I buy the DLC?**\n\nShort answer: Yes, the DLC is also great. [Here is the sales tracker for Steam](https://steamdb.info/app/2138330/)\n\n**3. Is the game playable now?**\n\nShort answer: Yes.\n\nLong answer: There are still some bugs, like any game. But the game is in its most playable state. However, playing on last-gen consoles like the PS4 will still have issues.\n\n**4. I have an old save, should I use it to start the DLC or make a new save?**\n\nShort answer: make a new save\n\nLong answer: Saves created before the 2.0 update will have to re-spec their build from scratch, as that update came with a complete overhaul of the perk system. Therefore, your pre-existing build may no longer be viable.\n\nIf your save was created after 2.0 then it would be fine to use it after buying the DLC.\n\n**5. When should I start the DLC?**\n\nShort answer: after the start of Act 3, before starting the endgame (Nocturn Op55N1).\n\nLong answer: >!There are 3 separate main questlines during Act 2. The DLC is accessible after completing 1 of them, specifically the questline with Evalyn Parker and the VDB's. You can start the DLC after completing Transmission/Never Fade Away, however conventional wisdom advises you complete all 3 main job questlines first and start the DLC before starting the endgame (Nocturn Op55N1).!< It\u2019s up to you.\n\n**6. When do I have to start the DLC?**\n\nShort answer: whenever you want, no rush, just don\u2019t trigger it by getting to the Dogtown gate.\n\nLong answer: >!after recieving the call to start the DLC, as long as you don\u2019t approach the general area at the Dogtown gate that triggers the relic malfunction, you can start the DLC at any point after unlocking it. **However,** once you DO approach the gate, get the relic malfunction, and start talking to Songbird, you will be locked into the next several missions of the DLC. Attempting to leave mid-mission may result in failing the entire Phantom Liberty mission line.!<\n\n# Part 2: Game Mechanics\n\n**7. How do life paths affect the game?**\n\nShort answer: Different prologues, occasional changes to dialogue and how some Jobs play out.\n\nLong answer: >!When you start the game, you must choose V\u2019s life path among the 3 options: Nomad, Corpo, and Streetkid. Afterward, you will then begin 1 of 3 different possible Prologues, taking about 15 minutes, before they merge together in to the beginning of the \u201cThe Rescue\u201d where you save Sandra Dorset. Throughout the game, your life path will provide different dialogue options to choose from, which impacts how different NPC\u2019s interact with you. There is also a different Side Job available for each life path. Life path has no substantive impact on endgame outcomes. !<\n\n**8.  What Character Build should I go with?**\n\nThat\u2019s up to you. Watch some YouTube videos and check out the official [Build Planner](https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/build-planner). [Here](https://nukesdragons.com/cyberpunk-2077/) is an alternative third-party build planner.\n\n>![Here](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Cyberpunk_2077_Cyberware)!< is a list of all available cyberware.\n\n**9. What happened to clothing mods? Do clothes affect anything?**\n\nPrior to Version 2.0, clothing could receive modifications, including armor mods. This was the primary way of increasing your armor. After 2.0, there are no longer clothing mods; clothing is mostly aesthetic, though a few rare articles do provide some minor stat buffs. In order to increase your armor, and other similar things previously provided through clothing mods, go through cyberware. The Armadillo mod has been removed from the game.\n\n**10. Love Interests?**\n\nThere are 4 possible love interests in the game. [see the full guide here](https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-romance-options-male-female-panam-kerry-river-stout-5077), likely contains spoilers.\n\n**11. What do those percentages mean in the pause menu?**\n\nShort answer: Ultimately, nothing\n\nLong answer: While there is no official explanation beyond what is stated when you hover over them, it is colloquially accepted that they mean, from left to right: >!Your notoriety as a merc, your relationship with Johnny, and how far the relic has degraded you.!< Ultimately, they have no substantive impact on the game in any way. They are either a vestige of mechanic(s) that were not implemented, or just set dressing. They can ultimately be ignored without consequence.\n\n**12. New Game Plus (NG+)???**\n\nNG+ Is not happening. The Developers have said they're not working on it and have shifted focus to the sequel game. There is a [pseudo NG+](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/5144) mod available for PC.\n\n# Part 3: Endgame and Secret Ending\n\n**13. When is the endgame, when is the \"point of no return, when should I start it, and can I finish other missions after beating the game?**\n\n>!When you approach the elevator to Embers for the Main Job mission Nocturn Op55N1, you will be prompted with a pop-up stating \"Point of No Return\". As it states, you should complete other side jobs and gigs before beginning the end Game as you will not be able to stop until you complete the game.!<\n\nAfter completing the game, >!(unless you chose the Phantom Liberty ending)!< you will be given the option to return back to before the Point of No Return and be given various rewards. You will then be able to complete other Side Jobs and gigs as before.\n\nYou will be able to complete the game again as many times as you wish choosing any of the endings you unlock.\n\n**14. How do I unlock the secret ending?**\n\nThe only way to unlock the secret ending is by choosing the correct dialogue options while talking to Johnny in the oil field. These options are:\n\n>\\[Inscribe Johnny's Initials\\] \"Let's do something about that.\"\n\n>*\"The Guy who Saved My Life.\"* (Not a required choice)\n\n>**\"Nah, fucked that up too.\"**\n\n>**\"What do you want from me?\"**\n\n>**\"OK. But as second chances go, this is your last.\"**\n\n>*\"You were a real dick in the beginning.\"* (Not a required choice)\n\n>*\"When you said you let down your friends...\"* (Not a required choice)\n\n>*\"Smasher biz really got to her.\"* (Not a required choice)\n\n>*\"Yeah, I'll call Rogue.\"* (Not a required choice)\n\nYou must then complete the Side Job \u201cBlisterin\u2019 Love\u201d. Nothing else matters. Your \u201cJohnny %\u201d makes no difference.\n\n**15. How do I start the secret ending?**\n\nWhile on the rooftop with Johnny during Nocturn Op55N1, when you\u2019re looking at your list of options for who to call, **wait approximately 5 IRL minutes** on this menu. Then Johnny will speak up and offer you another solution. Choose: \"Let's hear this plan\u201d and agree to >!attack Arasaka alone.!<\n\n**16. What are all the available endings?**\n\n[See the full spoiler-filled guide to all available endings](https://www.ign.com/wikis/cyberpunk-2077/How_to_Unlock_All_Endings_in_Cyberpunk_2077), including the DLC\n\n# Part 4: Technical issues\n\n**17. My game refuses to boot; what do I do?**\n\n* Remove mods\n\n**18. \\[X\\] isn\u2019t calling to start a mission; what do I do?**\n\nHere are a few strategies to trigger missions to start:\n\n* Save and reboot your game.\n* Complete side-jobs.\n* Sleep in apartment bed for 24 hours & walk out of room to the main elevator.\n* Drive to the badlands and back.\n* If you still don\u2019t get the call, repeat the suggested list.\n\n**19. A glitch is preventing me from progressing in a mission. What do I do?**\n\nRoll back go a previous save and try again.\n\n# Part 5: Unlock weapons and decorations\n\n**20.

            "I am level 40, and I have reached the max (50) in street cred. I can beat pretty much any enemy I come up against. And yet I still feel like I'm missing something. Like I'm playing the game all wrong.\n\nFor one thing, I have something like 500,000 eddies. I feel like if I was playing the game right, there's no way I would have that much money. Now granted I loot everything (and I mean everything) but I break everything down - I think I've only ever sold stuff like twice. Also, when I go to gun shops they neve have anything better than what I already have in pickups; when I go to ripperdocs, they never seem to have anything that's much of an improvement over what I already have (and I don't feel like what I have is anything special); in short there doesn't seem to be anything to spend my money on.\n\nThen there's my armor: it's at 429/1135. I'm not finding any armor cyberware that brings my actual armor rating (429) anywhere close to it's capacity (1135). What am I missing? Why do I have such a humungous armor capacity that I can't find any way to use?\n\nAnd finally there's carrying capacity. It says I can carry up to 409 kilos, but I'm actually carrying like 95. (Again I break down (scrap? whatever it's called) everything I pickup that I don't need (that isn't better than what I'm already carrying). And remember I loot everything. Why do I have such a huge carrying capacity? What am I missing? What should I be carrying that I'm not? Does this have something to do with armor rating?\n\nAgain, at level 40 and max street cred, I feel like I should have a better grip on this game, but I'm just feeling like I'm missing out on so much.\n\nWhat am I missing out on?\n\nPS - I rarely use any of my cyberware unless it's called for on a mission. I'm not sure I really get how it all works, when the game's not walking you step-by-step through a mission, either.",
