They are correct that the rating is too high and thats because of them and people like them. They wanted to own the last jedi and this movie gave them all their stupid wishes like Rey being related to someone and an explanation for snoke etc. So they did the opposite of the Acolyte and gave it tons of positive reviews to send the message to Disney. Im not saying that every positive review for this movie is from people like that. Just like how some reviews for the acolyte that are negative are just because people genuinely dont like it. There are definitely people who like this one but the reason its so high is because of them.",
