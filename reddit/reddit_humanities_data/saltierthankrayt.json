They wanted to own the last jedi and this movie gave them all their stupid wishes like Rey being related to someone and an explanation for snoke etc. So they did the opposite of the Acolyte and gave it tons of positive reviews to send the message to Disney. I\u2019m not saying that every positive review for this movie is from people like that.

There are definitely people who like this one but the reason it\u2019s so high is because of them.",
