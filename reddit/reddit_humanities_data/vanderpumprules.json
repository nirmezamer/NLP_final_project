        "content": "We\u2019ve seen a massive uptick in reports of comments and posts that do not violate our rules, so we wanted to remind people to review our rules in our side bar before posting or reporting. We appreciate reports as we cannot always capture rule-breaking comments if they\u2019re not flagged by our filters, but some reports lately seem to just be purely over disagreement in opinion, which is abuse of the reporting feature. \n\nJust because someone has a negative opinion of a cast member, a scenario, an episode, etc. does not necessarily mean it\u2019s trolling or hate speech. We know it may be hard to believe, but some people have a minority opinion. Some people genuinely do like cast members such as Sandoval or Schwartz, for example. Just because users post in favor of these cast, for whatever their reasoning is, does not automatically mean it should be reported as trolling. We are aware there is a majority opinion in this sub, but we can\u2019t remove posts simply because it goes against this, provided it does not violate our specified rules. \n\nFor example, calling a cast member slurs or curse words such as a bitch, a hoe, or the like *is* hate speech and should be reported. Baiting users into arguments, mocking users, leaving sarcastic/snarky replies unwarrantedly, name calling *are* examples of trolling and violations of our rules. And just because one user does it does not permit you or others to return it back. Report the violation and move along. \n\nOur fired cast rule has remained the same. Users are permitted to post about Jax, Stassi, and Kristen regarding their time on VPR. We do not permit posts regarding their life currently if it does not directly relate to the show, and any content regarding Jax and Kristen that pertains to their time on The Valley will be denied as The Valley has its own subreddit. \n\nWe spend hours combing through the queue each day. There are 6 moderators for 200,000+ users. Please be patient with us. If your post does not fit our guidelines, removal reasons are provided via comments or modmail. If you have a question, politely contact us to inquire about why it was removed. Reporting the removal reason comments will result in a permanent ban for abuse of the report button. ",

It's been, what a year? And another year and a half before it goes to trial? So, he gets what he wants by still living there dragging this out cause he can't afford to refinance? And people wonder how she can still have anger. He is still cheating her. Dude, you moved on from the relationship years ago, move on. Get your own life and finances and quit holding that house hostage.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

He lived there for free for over a year. He never made a single mortgage payment. Finally we have a court order and since he can\u2019t afford to rub two nickels together to buy me out, the house is on the market. He\u2019s evil and did so much of the same stuff Sandoval did. I can\u2019t wait for the house to sell to be completely rid of him. I feel so deeply for Ariana.",

            "The really sick part is that I don\u2019t think that he could have ever been in a house like that *without Ariana*. Over the years \u2014 and well documented in other threads \u2014 he has thrown money at the most ridiculous whims. I would suspect that it was Ariana who came with both the capital and the credit to get *that* particular house. \n\nI generally believe her to be emotionally intelligent and she\u2019s portrayed as someone who makes well-thought decisions.  It\u2019s wild that she let him borrow against the house for his weird bar.  Did he whine and wear her down?  Was she blind to his faults?  Did she just love him so much she wanted to see him succeed with something of his own?\n\nI don\u2019t understand. I think watching it play out has put many young women on guard to protect themselves in an unmarried-with-property situation.",
            "sandoval is becoming a hobosexual, because he's basically squatting in a house he only has 50% ownership of, refusing to do the **NORMAL HUMAN BEING THING** which is putting the house on the market to sell and split accordingly. Nooooo he's dragging his feet because he doesn't want to live anywhere else **BECAUSE HE IS INCREDIBLY SELFISH** and is taking advantage of the situation THAT HE CREATED AND WAS EXPOSED FOR DOING IN MARCH OF **2023** BY CHEATING ON ARIANA FOR AT LEAST 7 MONTHS WITH THEIR SUPPOSED GOOD FRIEND. \n\nDisgusting and subhuman behavior",
            "No idea how it works but I wonder if it is determined they have to sell, if he\u2019ll be required to pay her back for the portion of the mortgage she\u2019s paying while not living there \ud83e\udd14 or if that\u2019s something she\u2019d have to sue him for",

I always knew of the major players and who everyone was, but just never watched.\nAnyway, obviously Jax is a socio and Sandoval is a narcissist and the list goes on. But there is just something extra diabolical to me about Schwartz. The way he speaks to Katie and then blames her for starting it all. Or how he loses the marriage certificate twice and acts like it was an accident. And then the cheating etc etc etc. And then he puts on that little boy act and talks like a baby when apologizing.

            "Schwartz is my least favorite person on the show. He\u2019s manipulative, spineless, and overall just gross. The way he treated, talked to, and talked ABOUT Katie for a decade is just repulsive. That people think he\u2019s this lovable goofball is honestly mind boggling to me for anyone who has legitimately watched the show. Ugh I will die on this hill - he makes me so angry and I\u2019m so glad Katie finally got out.\n\nI\u2019m adding more because that\u2019s how much this guy rages me. His whole shtick was to poke and prod and antagonize Katie to no end, she\u2019d eventually react, and then he\u2019d be like \u201cYou see! Tequila Katie! Rage texts!\u201d Blah blah blah. But she was 99% of the time reacting to him tormenting her. He\u2019s said and done so many mean things to her he makes Jax taylor seem like a standup husband.",
            "God I always think about that time they were all at dinner, and Katie was rightfully very sad about something (idk what), but instead of comforting her, Schwartz started making digs and called attention to her mood and everyone started attacking her, calling her a bitch, saying she was ruining their dinner. All Schwartz had to do was give her a hug and tell her it\u2019d be okay, but he made her feel even worse. \n\nThat\u2019s when I realized how awful he truly is. It was just heartbreaking to watch :-(",
            "Listen, I just have to say on this sub lately there have been a TON of posts and comments about how bad of a person Tom Shwartz is. \n\nAnd I'm here for everyone of them. Fuck that dude. He's the absolute fucking worst.",
            "One of the most annoying things to watch is how The Worm paints the relationship between Katie and Schwartz are abuser and abused. When her frustrations with him are totally understandable. He says terrible things to her all the time and when she gets upset The Worm calls her \"evil\". That trio, the Toms and Jax is so startlingly toxic. They enable each others bad behaviour and demonise anyone who tries to hold them accountable.",

He\u2019s actually disturbing to me and he\u2019s incredibly abusive. You can also see how Katie became lighter after they decided to part ways. He is also really manipulative.",
            "It\u2019s crazy because Schwartz is literally my (ex)baby daddy\u2019s favorite character and I feel like that just speaks volumes to who he is as a person. He\u2019s a huge manchild just like Schwartz lmao",
