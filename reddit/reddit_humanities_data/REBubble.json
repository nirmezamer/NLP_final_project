But it's not at all the case, but San Francisco with their 800k has some of the worst homeless in the nation. \n\nBroadly it's boomers, but I'm gen x and we've gotten enough of a cut that we are invested in the status quo too. Millennials and Gen z can have a clean conscience but they are the victims.\n\nIt's both stupidly simple to fix and near impossible bc x plus boomers outvotes the newcomers.",

To me it is kind of like the fentanyl crisis - been going on for 10 years, nobody in either party even talks about it, clearly nobody thinks it\u2019s an important issue- and so it continues.",

            "Yeah, I just don't want to raise a child in a society that is basically condemning them to a consistently worse standard of living. That is cruel. You see poorer people having more kids, but those kids are going to end up in a worse position than their parents. If there was optimism, even educated people would be having more kids. But once you realize what a struggle life is now, you can't help but imagine a horrible future for the next generation."

The worry is that borrowers will be overstretched but still approved because Affirm doesn\u2019t know a borrow has plan with another BNPL. Then it come all crumbling down. On the other side, the estimates for BNPL is dwarfed by credit card debt.\u00a0"
