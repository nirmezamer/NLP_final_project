        "content": "This thread is aimed at answering common beginner questions about the game. However, it is not intended to teach in-depth strategies. \n\nIf you have a simple (1-2 sentence) question that's not answered below, leave a comment and I or another community member should be able to help. If your question is more complicated, feel free to make your own post about it.\n\n**General:**\n\n**1.** Are there any official mobile ports?\n\n* Yes! There is both an [IOS port](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/slay-the-spire/id1491530147) and an [Android port](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.humble.SlayTheSpire).\n\n**2.** Why does Slay The Spire keep crashing on my IOS device?\n\n* Make sure Low Power Mode is turned off when you launch the game. You can re-enable it once you start playing.\n\n**3.** Do the Android and IOS versions have the same content as the PC version?\n\n* Android and IOS are both up to date with the current PC version of the game.\n\n**4.** Are there any card/relic tier lists or decklists?\n\n* No. Decklists and following an archetype is not encouraged, since what card/relic is \"the best\" depends heavily on what your deck currently has and what enemies you're going to be facing in the near future.  \n\n**5.** How do I unlock the characters?\n\n* The Silent is unlocked by completing a run with the Ironclad, and the Defect is unlocked by completing a run with the Silent. You do not need to win these runs, just complete them. The Watcher is unlocked by winning a run with any character while the Defect is unlocked.\n\n\n**6.** Will there be any more new characters or card changes? Does the card [\"Foreign Influence\"](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Foreign_Influence) mean there's going to be a 5th character with the yellow color?\n\n* Unfortunately, the devs have said they [aren't planning on making any more new characters](https://www.reddit.com/r/slaythespire/comments/kcleuy/v22_hot_fix/gfsdodp/), and on Discord, they stated that [they can't majorly change cards anymore due to localization.](https://i.imgur.com/w1YfU1u.png) They also confirmed that the yellow string [is not referencing another character.](https://imgur.com/Wym6Cv0)\n\n**7.** Is the final boss based on what deck I've built?\n\n* No. Just like the map layout, store contents, and enemies you face, the final boss is determined when the run is first generated.\n\n**8.** Is there anything beyond Act 3?\n\n* Spoilers: >!An optional Act 4 can be unlocked with the [Keys](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Keys).!<\n\n\n**9.** Do I get anything for winning?\n\n* When you defeat the Act 3 boss with a character, you unlock Ascension levels with them. These are incrementally challenging versions of the game, providing scaling difficulty for those who want more of a challenge. Spoilers: >!If you beat the Act 4 boss with a character on any Ascension level, you unlock Beta Art for that character's cards. If you defeat the Act 4 boss with all characters, you unlock Beta Art for Colorless and Curse cards as well.!<\n\n**10.** Do I keep anything in-between runs?\n\n* No. However, your points are retained, and at certain point levels, you'll unlock new cards and relics that can show up in future runs.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n**1.** How do I get good at each character then?\n\n* In general, simply playing the game and learning what works in what situations is the best way to learn, However, a few general tips would be: \n\n> 1. Don't try to force an archetype (like a deck of all poison cards). These can be effective, but skipping good cards in the hopes of getting more archetypal cards will hurt your chance of winning.\n>2. Think ahead to what elites and bosses you'll be fighting this act. Many of them require your deck to have different capabilities (such as [Reptomancer](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Reptomancer) requiring you to have AOE damage, and [Giant Head](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Giant_Head) requiring you to have scaling damage.\n>3. Always try to have a well rounded deck. Don't go all-out in getting defensive cards and neglect offensive cards (and vice-versa). If you can, try to have a mix of Burst, Scaling, and AOE damage, so you can deal with the various enemy types you'll run across.\n\nA very helpful post by user /u/screwyioux with more detail on how to learn strategy and why certain choices matter can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/slaythespire/comments/ev8mhx/slay_the_spire_high_ascension_guide/). I highly recommend taking a look if you feel like you're stuck losing and want to improve your play.\n\n**2.** Scaling? AOE? Burst?\n\n* \"Scaling Damage\" refers to sources of damage that continue to get stronger the more you use them in combat, such as [Claw](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Claw) or [Poison](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Poison). \"AOE (Area Of Effect)\" refers to cards that deal damage to multiple (or all) enemies at once, like [Whirlwind](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Whirlwind). \"Burst\" refers to being able to deal a lot of damage all at once, like having several [Backstabs](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Backstab).\n\n\n**3.** Is [Snecko Eye](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Snecko_Eye) good or bad?\n\n* Snecko Eye is very good, unless the majority of cards in your deck are very low cost. The +2 draw alone makes the relic worthwhile, and the effect that randomizes card costs will on average lower the cost of cards in your hand. Snecko also gets dramatically better the more card draw and high cost cards you have in your deck. Content creator [Jorbs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpjr4aOTbpvat8Y77e8dd_Q) has [an in-depth video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScSRbp9bfAA) discussing the value of Snecko Eye.\n\n**4.** Why do I see so many posts about [Corruption](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Corruption) and [Dead Branch](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Dead_Branch)?\n\n* Corruption is a very strong card on its own, since being able to play all your defensive cards for free can let you end hallway (and possibly even boss) fights quickly and efficiently. Dead Branch makes this even better, since it'll often generate more block or helpful cards that snowball you to victory.\n\n**Other:**\n\n**1.** \"Deck\" Vs. \"Draw & Discard Pile\"?\n\n* Your \"Deck\" is the cards that you start each combat with. Your Draw Pile & Discard Pile are a temporary version of your Deck that's used in combat, and all changes to it last for that combat only. Most enemies that debuff you in combat (like the [Sentries](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Sentry)) will affect your Draw Pile. Most cards that permanently affect your run (such as [Lesson Learned](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Lesson_Learned)) effect your Deck.\n\n**2.** Why didn't Fairy In A Bottle/Lizard Tail revive me?\n\n* You probably have [Mark Of The Bloom](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Mark_of_the_Bloom), which prevents all healing.\n\n**3.** What do the subreddit user flairs mean? How do I get one?\n\n* Check [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/slaythespire/comments/km48fd/new_flairs_added_for_achievements_including/) for an explanation on all the user flairs, and how you can assign one to your account.",

            "Sorry for the noob question but strategy point 1 says to plan ahead for elites. How do you tell what elites are coming up?",
            "A breakthrough for me in skill level for this game was to think about how I would handle each elite in Act 1 and to pick a path that hits as many elites as possible. Collecting relics makes winning easier. I still default to my comfortable strategies but having a plan for the elites has helped me hit higher ascension levels on each character. For eg, Ironclad I almost always go for a Perfected Strike deck, and Silent is either poison or shiv. For Watcher I go high draw cards with Mantra, and Defect I go either Orbs or Claw, whichever I am given. Just hit Ascension 10 on all characters relatively easily but I can feel I've just scratched the surface of this game. Incredible game, can't believe I only discovered it this year.",

            "I'm pretty new, and something I've noticed is that I never really feel like my decks for the non-Defect characters ever quite achieve that \"aha!\" moment that I have with the Defect, where I hit critical mass and start to dominate encounters. Mummified Hand with a power build is such a clear and simple progression that I always fall back to it when I play the Defect.\n\nIn particular, I'm interested in the Silent, because I've never thought I was making a truly well-tuned deck with her, and I'm not sure what I'm missing. I tend to go for Shiv + Poison builds because those seem clearest to me, but I saw a video on here where they were doing a Calculated Gamble build that cycled the hand a lot to generate a lot of resources. I always avoided those kinds of cards because it seemed bad to rely on cards I can't play normally, but it's got me curious. What's the line of progression like in that sort of deck?",

Use it to save a bit of hp, even like 5-6 most of the time is good enough for smaller potions like this. You dont need to use them as a silver bullet, you get enough that you can chuck them at floor fights sometimes just to make it a bit easier and save hp for elites and bosses",
