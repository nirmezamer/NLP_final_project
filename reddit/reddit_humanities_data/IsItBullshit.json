This is especially true in this case, when facts are still very unclear and news is constantly emerging. \n\nWhile nobody should use reddit as their only source of information, subreddits like /r/worldnews have ongoing live threads on the situation, and /r/news has posted many megathreads. We urge anyone to seek out as many other sources as they can.",

I saw this video where a woman and her husband in in Knoxville, Tennessee, USA said that their dog (a Siberian Husky probably) killed their 6 week child. The comment section is a complete shitshow with some people arguing that the couple was lying while others say it's the dog's fault (One of them even cited dogsbite.org, which is not reliable because they are an organization that argues for BSL (Breed Specific Legislation), a type of law with opposition that includes organizations like AKC)",

            "Many different breeds have resulted in the fatality of adults or children. Pitbulls and XLs are not the only ones. (However they are the most prominent due to irresponsible breeding, ownership etc. there\u2019s a huge issue of people intentionally breeding one or both dog parents which have shown aggression. Which makes it much more likely for the pups to inherit the same tendencies)\n\nHuskies definitely have the capability to do severe damage if they react aggressively. Without knowing the exact situation and how dogs were with day to day life we cannot know why the dogs reacted how they did.\n\nHowever no animal regardless of species which can bite should be left near enough to a baby where parents cannot keep the child safe if the animal bites. \n\nThis story does seem to be true. And the reason for occuring could be a wide range of things such genetics (yes genetics can play a huge part in aggression. No I don\u2019t support BSL), lack of training/socialising, the dog showing signs of the \u201cladder of aggression\u201d which was consistently ignored by parents such as lip licking, stiff body language, slow wagging tail, avoiding eye contact, showing teeth, growling etc. Or it could be due to an undiagnosed health condition causing an outburst. \n\n(XLs and pitbulls can live happy lives without ever hurting anyone. However there is an issue with irresponsible ownership such as people leaving their infants alone or very close to a dog. I don\u2019t support BSL due to non aggression dogs being caught up in it. however I do support making it illegal to breed dogs with a bite history/history of aggression towards people or other dogs. (I support working with a behaviourist to manage reactivity within reason)",
