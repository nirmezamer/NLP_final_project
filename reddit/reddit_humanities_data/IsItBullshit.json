            "Any kind of physical activity slows down your digestion because the body takes blood from the internal organs and sends it to your muscles. The main reason people used to say not to swim after eating is they were afraid you might get a cramp and not be able to swim properly\u00a0",

            "The conventional wisdom is \"Don't swim after eating or you'll get a cramp\".\n\nThis isn't really \"dangerous\" unless you're in a survival situation swimming in the ocean for hours and you'll need every last ounce of strength.\n\nIt's not total BS, ask any runner if they have a big meal before they go for a five mile run. It's a bad idea. When you exert yourself really hard it makes your body divert resources from things like digestion. It's why running really hard after a big meal makes you want to puke. \n\nBut for recreational swimming, splashing around in a pool or a lake, It's not a real danger. That part is BS.",

            "Bullshit, but there's a tiny little bit of truth in there.\n\n\nSimplifying it a lot, our bodies have two \"modes\". Activation of the sympathetic nervous system (exercise, fight or flight), or the parasympathetic system (rest and digest).\n\n\nExercising kinda directs away energy from digestion to focus on your muscles. We don't want that because it can cause indigestion and feel kinda bad.\n\n\nWill it kill you? No absolutely not. The most worrying thing would be drowning, but it's not a certain thing.\n\n\nDoes it freeze digestion? Not really, the nervous system isn't exactly like a flip switch between the two modes, so there can be a certain balance. It might be slower, and you might be uncomfortable, but it's not something actively dangerous.",

That being said it would still be a reasonable suspicion for the police to have that they were military associated due to them being more likely than non-military to have paracord on hand at any given time.",

        "content": "This one has alot of topics. Lots of contrarian opinions with things like\n\n* Is saturated fat really bad?\n* Are seed oils bad?\n* Is consumption of meat bad?\n* Was Ancel Keys wrong?\n\n\nI follow many doctors on social media. Most who are cardiologists, bariatric surgeons and others too. One thing is they are all pretty much universally of the belief that Saturated fat is bad, seed oils are fine and consumption of meat, especially red meat is correlated with CVD and higher rates of cancer. I've looked into it myself a bit and from what I find yes it does look like they are correct. \n\nThe reason I make this post Is because I am seeing people in real life now eating like mad men. Super high saturated fat and red meat consumption. Cutting out seed oils for fats super high in saturated fat like coconut oil. Fear of sugar and sometimes even so much as not eating vegetables anymore. \n\nThe problem is when you look up studies with this mindset. You will also be able to prove that seed oils are bad, saturated fat is unjustly vilified, meat maybe isnt so bad, salt isint so bad either. But because you can always find a study it's impossible to know. \n\nLots of doctors on social media really go against these beliefs but it's an endless torrent of people who are now believing it. \n\nSo are these beliefs bullshit or is there some truth to them?\n\nPlease try to only reply if you're a subject matter expert or if you're very confident about your knowledge. \n\nThanks",

            "The broad answer is that it's just not that simple.\n\nNo idea who that person is, but balanced diets are important for long term health. \"Is X bad\" misses so much context as to be useless.",
            "Nutrition is very frustrating in general. One of the problems is that people have no sense of scale. They point to one study showing that people who eat X have a 1.1 in 10,000 chance of getting cancer instead of a 1 in 10,000 chance and talk about X like it's the worst poison ever. \n\nWhen you ask if something is bad, you really need to define what you mean by bad. Do people who eat a lot of meat have slightly higher risks of certain kinds of cancer? I think that is the case. You can Google to find the right number if you want. Does that number mean that you should never eat it? That's really a question of your own values and risk tolerance.\n\nIt's easy to get really wrapped up in all the details. If you want to keep it really simple, you can just follow the advice of some major reputable Institution. Look up what Harvard Medical or the WHO recommends and do that. Or you can decide that you don't really care that much and just eat what works for you.\n\nIf you have a specific health issue, or a specific family history that you're worried about, maybe err a little bit more on the side of caution.\n\nIf you're trying to lose weight, in my opinion it's probably more important to figure out whatever lets you personally eat less without being too hungry even if that means no carbs or a ton of diet soda or whatever. On that note, you should be aware that empirically speaking most people who lose weight gain it back and that the only long-term treatments that seem to work for most obese people are surgery and the new GLP1 medications.",
            "If you heard about this on tiktok, it's bullshit. People on social media have to eek out these dumb niche messages because everything that seems sensible has already been covered by people whose bread and butter isn't attention seeking.\n\n\nThis should be stickied on this sub as it's the answer to 99% of the questions\u00a0",
            "I don't know what the current research shows, but a lot of historical research on saturated fat combined saturated and trans fats into a single category. We know trans fats will kill you, now. But the research on saturated fat, in isolation, didn't seem to have nearly the same results. So take a lot of what people tell you about saturated fat with a grain of salt, unless they're citing more recent research.\n\n  \nNB: It's possible my knowledge is out of date. I haven't looked into this in about 4 years.",
            "The claim that seed oils are straight up poison is basically just social media influencer drek, usually being pushed by someone selling a class or app or supplement. Same fuckin goofs who tell you to not drink water to hydrate yourself and record themselves raving shirtless in the grocery store.",
            "Do you have an example of one of these posts?",
            "The seed oil thing is internet fear mongering that, as of right now, isn't well supported.\n\nMeat in moderation is good. We're omnivores, after all.\n\nAt the end of the day, aim for balance and variety. Avoid excessive amounts of excessively processed food. Avoid diet fads.\n\nfyi, Harvard School of Public Health is the source I trust most for detailed questions.",
            "\"A\" and \"lot\" are separate words. They shouldn't be written as a compound word.",
            "Whole: Rethinking the Science of Nutrition and The Future of Nutrition were really awesome books that changed my whole opinion on how I view food and nutrition.",
            "Studies can't be taken out of the larger scientific context, i.e., most studies can't be used in solitary. It's why most will have dozens or more citations just in the introduction. When people just look at abstracts to prove to themselves something it means they don't understand research, let alone are capable of performing it. It's actually a highly specialized skill.\n\nNutrition is quite complex, something may increase X biomarker (bad!) and simultaneously increase Y (which is good!). It neither makes the food category good nor bad, as it all depends. The larger trends and meta analyses are better, but still can't be used as solitary pieces of evidence.\n\nThis is made more complicated with predatory journals which will publish anything, for money. MPDI is often accused of this as well as frontiers in... journals. These should not be considered as peer reviewed research.\n\nBest is to listen to actual experts, not those doing it for views. Looking up studies yourself is a skill people think they can easily master, but often make fools of themselves as it requires years or more of reading the literature."
