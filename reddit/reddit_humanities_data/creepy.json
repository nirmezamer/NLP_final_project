            "I used to pull low voltage cable for a large well known hospital. Most floors have an access space in the ceiling where all the utilities are run, all around in every floor was cigarette butts, coffee cups, snack wrappers, graffiti, etc. It seemed to be from the workers that built the place in the 50s but maybe it was her and her friends partying up there all along lol. Kind of unnerving though being up there in the dark alone at night with only a flashlight. The shadows could really get to your imagination if you let it lol.\n\nSorry  for the ramblings, this image reminded me of that.",
