            "I feel like she is only good into those champs if they try to be aggressive on her.\n\nOtherwise if she try to be aggressive then she'll be easily punished by a gank/roam.\n\nEven if she's good in lane it's a trade-off with her not having any side lane pressure because she can't push fast and lacks mobility to escape. So if it's between having a good lane versus having map pressure I think nowadays teams will choose the latter.\n\nI don't think she'll be bad but I don't think she's necessarily as much of a silver bullet as you think she is. Taliyah IMO is a much better mage pick.",
            "Trist + Corki win the lane/go neutral into cassio because of fleet and picking AP mid leads to having to pick an AD jg which is just worse right now compared to the insane clear speeds of AP jgs because of fated ashe.  Cass also has way less sidelane pressure. She definitely can be picked into a blind ahri though which has been happening whenever trist/corki aren't available/drafted towards.",

            "Orianna, Syndra and other mages who outrange Cassio are really bad match-ups and really common. You also have to think about the enemy teamcomp not outranging and kiting her either. Very situational champion but really good when pickable.",
