People were mega-positive about it last year, so this year I thought I'd do it once more!\n\n**Last year's reached over 500 entries!** [Check out 2k23's!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Gqe22GUiwKl5E_Z-3btEOO_PXmb-LHQUwDlJDNZGrao/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nSo far I've got over 50 in this years - but this is just the start and I will be adding more most days!  \n\n\n**Changes from last year**\n\n**Attires and In-Game Model Alts** \\- I left out attires and in-game model alts out last year but this year I will include them - I think I'll separate them out on to their own tab\n\n**New Filter Views** \\- You can filter the sheet to see just men or just women, or to filter to see only WWE, AEW, or NXT - I'll be adding more as I build out the sheet  \n\n\nPlease let me know what you'd like to see! \n\nAm i missing any good ones? Let me know!\n\nWould anyone be interested in a digest/newsletter with all the updates every week?\n\nThanks!",
