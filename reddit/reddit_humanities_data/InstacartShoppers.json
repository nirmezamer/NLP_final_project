        "content": "I live in the middle of nowhere. \nI sometimes end up delivering to places where the population barely hits 2k. \n\nI deliver to older folk all the time. One time, an older woman tipped me in 3 strawberries. :) \ud83c\udf53 \n\nToday, I was in my car waiting for an order, and the only order that popped up? A grocery store 47 MINUTES AWAY, and her home a total of 42 miles from me. \n\nI sighed, but figured I had nothing else going on today, so I accepted the $20 order. \n\nI traveled, I shopped, loaded up and drove some more miles. When I arrived, I didn\u2019t even know if I was at the right place. I peaked at the locked up fence and overgrown yard. 4 unleashed dogs lost their marbles when I approached. (I learned quickly they were just protective. They were actually very sweet)  I just stood there, gazing around for about 10 minutes. I tried calling and texting the customer and all, no answer. \n\nI took one final peak passed the gate and there she is, an old woman sitting with her wooden stick of a cane on her concrete stairs. I had a hard time unraveling the chained up fence, but I managed, and carried her groceries up her overgrown driveway. \n\n\u201cSorry about that Joyce, I didn\u2019t see you there!\u201d \n\nShe kinda nodded her head and kept telling her dogs to shut up. This poor old woman. My soul freaking hurt for her man.\n\n I said \u201care you alright darlin\u2019?\u201d \n\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m sick, but I just need to take my iron and once I\u2019m better I\u2019m getting the heck out of here.\u201d \n\nShe also apologized for not opening the gate for me. She said she has a hard time walking down there. I said it was no worries at all. \n\nInstead of leaving her semi-heavy groceries outside, I offered to put them inside for her, to which she said I could leave them on the floor near the fridge. \n\nI unbagged and put her items on her counter instead so she wouldn\u2019t need to crouch down for them. \n\nI came out and told her I was all done, and she thanked me. Then I asked, \u201cyou live out here all alone?\u201d Yup. She did. \n\nShe had no car, and no family to check on her. She said she usually orders from Walmart, but the last delivery she placed was TWO DAYS LATE, and her + her dogs went without food for that time. \n\nI asked if it was okay if I left my number for her, that way if she ever needed anything, she could just call me, and I\u2019ll make every effort to be there. And that\u2019s what I did. Wrote it in bold with my name. I wished her a good day, she blessed me, and I headed on out but man\u2026 it shook me up so bad. I hope she\u2019s alright. I hope she calls when needed. :(",

            "This almost made me cry. I understand because I feel the same way when I do those types of orders. And like you, I do always leave my number and feel so bad just doing that. There have been a time or 2 when someone very much older and/or crippled have offered me CASH tips, but I never EVER like to take it. I figure that could be my grandparents or parents or me someday and what would I want someone to do. \n\nAfter talking to my grandma about it, she told me that if they are super persistent, then I should take the tip and maybe leave it inside their mailbox or use it to bless someone else. She said when I refuse (her opinion, of course), I'm taking away the blessing from that individual. I guess I never looked or seen it that way, but I can see how that could be possible. It just doesn't make me feel good at all. \n\nI always offer to put the groceries away and leave out anything they may need for that evening, etc. It's really sad when you learn they are all alone and it sounds like she was way out there in the middle of nowhere. You did the right thing and you will forever be rewarded.",
