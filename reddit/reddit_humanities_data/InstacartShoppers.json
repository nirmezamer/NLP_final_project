This post isn't meant to discourage discussion, if someone has a question not covered in this quick reference, please do ask.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"A good rule of thumb is to tip $10 or 20% whichever is greater on Instacart, as you would for any service based business\u2026 like a restaurant, or nail salon, or hairdressers.**\n\n**Instacart Shoppers are paid similar to waitstaff.**\n\n**You can find suggestions for tipping from NY Magazine's exhaustive tipping guide\u2026 (20%) and** [**Gigworker.com**](https://gigworker.com/instacart-tipping/) **did a stint as an Instacart shopper he also recommends 20%.\" -** /u/InstacartDoctor\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile I included a link to the Gigworker guide to tipping, I was unfortunately only able to find a [slideshow](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/s/cOdeH1aVQ8) of the NY Magazine guide to tipping.  It doesn't necessarily touch on Instacart, but shows how other tip driven jobs and gigs tend to operate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7opsf17s10qc1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=408a4ad9ff83e8fbb0ca9fa1ac973cad2e52f5bc\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9nfrkits10qc1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9c11b38def7eb941ca60d4a58cc01fd9901d5a23\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yq2m20et10qc1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dc993fe86e6cfab35ee2801818e87b7473653a75\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/odin6byt10qc1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c2a771d7c87768baace9bef8897250ad0ddcdda9\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rpvsjlhu10qc1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a0d6e8f9ee132d470a8fe1010e1887e0adb84169\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wilag47v10qc1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4f1b58aaf510e241fe678fdde317c3698b37308c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/puiabvnv10qc1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ea9e05d85ada5c85ce1f76f7b76c38b340991033",

            "Yes. They stores are responsible for their catalogs and there's often missing items.   Message the shopper who can enter the item manually.  There used to be special request items where you entered a description or picture and it showed as a special request on the shopper side but I haven't seen one on an order in a while.",
            "Yes.  There is an option to add an item on the ahoppers screen. If the barcode is not found you can manually enter the item in.  However, Walmart, Sam Clubs, and Costco do not allow manual entry so I will find another item with the same price to scan.",

            "I add stuff all the time that my regulars forget or can not find in the catalog.\n\nIf you have a new shopper who is not familiar with how to add stuff that might be an issue but there are ways to do it.\n\nThe other day I bought poster board for a regular doing a vision board and some plain white candles that were not on app. Just typed in white pillar candles and added manually."
