You can now download large semantic models, Power BI enhanced report format (PBIR), and Subfolder support in Power BI Report Builder.  There is much more to explore, please continue to read on!\n\nhttps://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/power-bi-june-2024-feature-summary/\n\nWhat's your favorite feature this month? ",

            "The ability to download large storage models is a nice addition! Now if I could also download models with incremental refresh, I'd be all set!",
            "Anyone else lose the refresh pop up when refreshing data? The loading data, loading content to model, etc pop up?",
            "I'm really hoping the visual calculations update comes thru for me. I keep running into weird UTZ calculations publishing from desktop to the app.powerbi.com service",
            "As of this update, I can no longer deselect a selected object on my canvas by clicking the wallpaper area.",
            "# \n\nDid they break certificate trust again? I'm getting this bad boy again - \"SSL Provider, error: 0 - Certificate chain issued by an authority that is not trusted\", and it's a MASSIVE disruption to the business. Is anyone else encountering this on Desktop?",
            "It seems that only bookmarks that are not grouped are appearing in the pbir \n\nI can see the groups as well, but it only gives me a bookmark and name that appears under the group. I can't see any properties of the individual bookmarks that are grouped.",
            "Did anyone else experience an issue with bookmarks associated to a button not working when it came to clearing slicers? I'm not sure if this is associated to this update but it started in June. The Business Unit had Clear All buttons (mainly in reports built out in 2020/2021) that would clear out slicers that existed in a conditional bookmark. For whatever reason that Clear All Button stopped working for those slicers. That being said it still does work for the filters on this visual & page within the Browser UI but not for the conditional hide/show slicers within the report itself. Browser being used is Microsoft Edge. Yes Business opened a ticket.",

            "I\u2019m a dumbass. Thanks Microsoft! I had no idea this got introduced, despite trying to stay up to date with the blogposts, etc.\n\nI knew about the new DAX query view, but haven\u2019t really use it as \u201cold habits die hard\u201d I guess.",
            "Lol have never noticed it. Thanks",
            "Is it available for those on 2022 version? We got version control at our company",
            "I had no idea either. Nice!",
            "Which is true, and I made reference to it in my original post, but there is some potential concerns about using such websites if your operating in a critically sensitive environment, etc.\n\nI use it sometimes at my current job, but I suspect it will not be permitted at my next one (as the environment I am applying for is a bit more sensitive).",
            "You can do that now, all you need to do is to select Dynamic in the format settings and then write a separate DAX for formatting rules (using SWITCH or IF functions)."
