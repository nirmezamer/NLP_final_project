        "content": "# Welcome to the 2025 application cycle!\n\nAMCAS, AACOMAS, and TMDSAS are all open for submission[.](https://imgur.com/a/pMgZxRU) If you've had a chance to submit your primary application and want to get ahead on writing secondary essays, this post is for you. Verified AMCAS applications will be transmitted to schools on **June 28th** at 7 am EST. AACOMAS applications are sent to schools as soon as you're verified. Same for TMDSAS.\n\nIf you want to track how far along AMCAS is with verification you can check the following:\n\n* [The AMCAS Verification Tracker](https://amcas-tracker.hpsa.org/)\n* [The sidebar of AAMC's AMCAS information page](https://students-residents.aamc.org/applying-medical-school-amcas/applying-medical-school-amcas)\n\nHere are some resources you can use to prewrite essays, track which schools have sent out secondaries, and monitors schools' progress through the cycle.\n\n**Student Doctor Network (SDN):**\n\n* 2024-2025 Threads: [MD Schools](https://forums.studentdoctor.net/forums/2023-2024-md-medical-school-specific-discussions.1198/) and [DO Schools](https://forums.studentdoctor.net/forums/2023-2024-do-medical-school-specific-discussions.1199/)\n* 2023-2024 Threads: [MD Schools](https://forums.studentdoctor.net/forums/md-medical-school-specific-discussions-prior-years.962/) and [DO Schools](https://forums.studentdoctor.net/forums/osteopathic-medical-school-discussions-prior-years.603/)\n\nI recommend you follow all the current cycle threads for your school list. Once secondaries have been sent, the prompts will be posted and edited in to the first comment in the thread. If secondaries have not been posted yet this year, refer to last cycle's threads for prewriting.\n\n**Reminder of Rule 10: Use SDN school-specific threads for school-specific questions.**\n\nThe biggest issue with Reddit is that it is not organized to track information longitudinally. Popular posts get buried after a day or two. Even if you do not like SDN, it is set up better for the organization of information by school over time. We will still ask that you use SDN school-specific threads for school-specific questions and discussion, sorry.\n\n**Consider using** [**CycleTrack**](https://cycletrack.org/)**!**\n\n* [Explanation of CycleTrack](https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/uxo150/cycletrack_an_application_cycle_tracker_and/)\n* [CycleTrack School Explorer](https://cycletrack.org/explorer)\n\nCreated by [u/DanielRunsMSN](https://www.reddit.com/user/DanielRunsMSN/) and [/u/Infamous-Sail-1](https://www.reddit.com/user/Infamous-Sail-1), both MD/PhD students, \"[CycleTrack](https://cycletrack.org/) is a free tool for creating school lists, tracking application cycle actions, visualizing your cycle with graphs and contributing your de-identified data to make the application process more transparent and more accessible.\"\n\nGood luck this cycle everyone!",

Doing some prewriting for secondaries and was hoping for feedback on NYU Grossman prompt.\n\nI am wanting to answer this prompt:\n\nThe most meaningful achievements are often non-academic in nature. Describe the personal accomplishment that makes you most proud. Why is this important to you?\n\nI was originally going to talk about how I committed to my college for a sport because I had to work my @\\*\\* off to do this as I was a very NON-athletic kid but I knew I wanted to play this sport in college. However, I marked my sport as a meaningful activity and kind of already spoke to it in my primary. I don't want to be too repetitive. So, as a second option I was thinking of talking about how I decided NOT to retake my MCAT although my score wasn't exactly where I wanted it. This was a huge growth moment for me as I am very hard on myself academically. However, I decided to enjoy my senior year and spend time with friends/professors/classmates rather than focusing on being a perfectionist. Third option would be an essay talking about the impact I've had on my older brother after my dad passed. He started to skip school/hang with the wrong crowd and I was kind of his rock/worked to show him all that he was capable of.\n\nAny thoughts? Or should I bag both of these ideas....",

        "content": "This is a little long, I apologize in advance. \n\nI am an incoming M1. I think about how stressful undergrad was for me and I have a difficult time believing medical school could be worse (but all of the nightmare stories make me feel like it's possible). \n\nIn undergrad, I paid for my tuition out of pocket by working a flexible job. When I wasn't in school, at work, or studying, I was trying to fulfill my EC's by volunteering at the hospital or joining premed clubs. I did not have free time at all. Thankfully, I averaged about 5-7 hours of sleep each night. I had little to no money, usually about $35 on average in my checking and savings. I paid for all of my own groceries, car insurance, car repairs, and supplies. I did not have money to go to the doctor, so I just ignored my health. I could not afford fast food, scraped by with paying for gas (drove about 2 hrs total each day between school, work, and home). My mother allowed me to live with her and I did not have to pay rent, but our relationship was strained so there was no emotional support at home. My stress triggered periodic seizures (I have been recently diagnosed with with Epilepsy). My life was wake up, go to school, study, go to work, study, go to sleep, do it again. It was bad some days. I am grateful to say that I still graduated with a good GPA, so my study habits were likely efficient. \n\nI also had a boyfriend that helped me cope. He recalls us hanging out, which meant me studying in the same room that he was playing video games in. I haven't been on a true vacation since I was a child. I am not writing this to gain sympathy, but to paint a picture of my daily life in undergrad. So could medical school be worse? I am trying to guage what the experience will be like. For reference, I was about 20-22 in undergrad and I am 25 now. \n\nThank you very much to anyone who can contribute a story. ",

            "Obviously everyone's experience is different, but for me, I feel like my undergrad experience was worse. There's just so much to juggle in undergrad between academics and ECs and more, and the uncertainty of it all weighed on me a lot. I go to a P/F med school and I think that really contributes to my med school experience being better, on top of the fact that really outside of school/prepping for step1 I didn't have much else to handle in my first year.\n\nI will say that either way, you just need to have a good sense of boundaries and work-life balance, and be good about taking care of yourself. As someone who's not very good at that sometimes, that can make the experience much worse than it needs to be.",
            "P/F preclinical is \u201ceasier\u201d when you\u2019re focused on learning and passing without necessarily shooting for an A in every class. Outside of (some) basic science stuff the content also feels much more relevant to day-to-day practice and that\u2019s a potent motivator to study hard. Ton of volume but not overwhelming if you chip away at it every day. I almost never studied past like 6 or 7pm M1 and M2. \n\nClinical years have their own stresses and you\u2019ll work harder but it\u2019s not comparable to undergrad. People don\u2019t flunk out during M3/M4 for doing poorly on exams, they flunk out (very rarely) for unprofessional behavior.",
            "Dawg, you're going to be a doctor. Drink some chamomile tea, watch a movie, and go to sleep. You'll be fine, and you'll have outstanding people by your side to help you through everything you need. A big shoutout to you for getting accepted - I'm shooting for that this cycle. Proud of you for the strength to get as far as you have, trust me, I know how difficult life can be with your story similar to mine. \n\nI'm 27, and although I don't know how medical school is personally, I do know that adcoms never would have accepted you into their school if they were not confident in your ability to be an amazing and successful student at their institution. That shows people believe in you, need just need to believe in yourself.",
            "This will depend on what specialty you\u2019re interested in as well. Want to do primary care, Neuro, psych, pathology, etc.? Then you can just get by passing and not worry about the rat race of research. If you want something like ortho, ent, plastics, optho, and the likes, then it will be similar to undergrad in that you need to pump out resesrch and ECs. BUT you won\u2019t be working so that\u2019s a huge load off. Since I don\u2019t wanna do anything surgical, med school has been super chill so far and I just focus on studying, socializing, and doing bare bones research. Med school is fun so enjoy it!!!",
            "I was a chemistry major in college and junior year in college when I was taking 3+ upper division chemistry classes per quarter (including Pchem) was the most stress I\u2019ve ever had in my educational career. Way worse than studying for Step 1 and Step 2. Going to a med school with P/F preclinical years def helped a lot. Med school will be busy and stressful, but tbh you develop your skills and it\u2019s very manageable",
            "My undergrad experience was quite similar to yours (although I didn\u2019t have the same health concerns and I hope you are doing well now!) in that I worked multiple jobs and was extremely stressed and busy all of the time. Constantly struggled with money and funded everything myself. I have also lived on my own since my senior year of high school. I felt like I learned to thrive in the chaos. My undergrad classes were very tough (Chem major) and as a non trad I was basically taking all science all the time. I had many breakdowns about balancing it all. \n\nThat all went away in medical school. It was the first time I was ever \u201cjust a student\u201d and sure there\u2019s a lot of volume, but it\u2019s manageable. Honestly, it was far far harder for me to adjust to having so much of my own time to manage, and not having a job/being out in the world/contributing financially to the household ect. than the content. I think studying is a balance and it depends if your school is true P/F and when your exams are. We had exams every Monday during M1 and every other during M2. This made hanging out of weekends kinda tough, but we still made time even if it was only a couple hours bc of an exam. You can 100% do this!!",
            "For what it\u2019s worth, I am enjoying med school way more than undergrad so far and I think that\u2019s helped me in addition to P/F",
            "They are different. I sleep a lot more in med school than I did in college. The volume of content of medical school is much more challenging.",

            "Thank you for your input. I have made personal goals about my health and I definitely want to maintain them in med school. My school will also be pass/fail and I think that will ease the mental load. Thank you for your feedback!!"
