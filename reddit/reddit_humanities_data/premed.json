        "content": "# Welcome to the 2025 application cycle!\n\nAMCAS, AACOMAS, and TMDSAS are all open for submission[.](https://imgur.com/a/pMgZxRU) If you've had a chance to submit your primary application and want to get ahead on writing secondary essays, this post is for you. Verified AMCAS applications will be transmitted to schools on **June 28th** at 7 am EST. AACOMAS applications are sent to schools as soon as you're verified. Same for TMDSAS.\n\nIf you want to track how far along AMCAS is with verification you can check the following:\n\n* [The AMCAS Verification Tracker](https://amcas-tracker.hpsa.org/)\n* [The sidebar of AAMC's AMCAS information page](https://students-residents.aamc.org/applying-medical-school-amcas/applying-medical-school-amcas)\n\nHere are some resources you can use to prewrite essays, track which schools have sent out secondaries, and monitors schools' progress through the cycle.\n\n**Student Doctor Network (SDN):**\n\n* 2024-2025 Threads: [MD Schools](https://forums.studentdoctor.net/forums/2023-2024-md-medical-school-specific-discussions.1198/) and [DO Schools](https://forums.studentdoctor.net/forums/2023-2024-do-medical-school-specific-discussions.1199/)\n* 2023-2024 Threads: [MD Schools](https://forums.studentdoctor.net/forums/md-medical-school-specific-discussions-prior-years.962/) and [DO Schools](https://forums.studentdoctor.net/forums/osteopathic-medical-school-discussions-prior-years.603/)\n\nI recommend you follow all the current cycle threads for your school list. Once secondaries have been sent, the prompts will be posted and edited in to the first comment in the thread. If secondaries have not been posted yet this year, refer to last cycle's threads for prewriting.\n\n**Reminder of Rule 10: Use SDN school-specific threads for school-specific questions.**\n\nThe biggest issue with Reddit is that it is not organized to track information longitudinally. Popular posts get buried after a day or two. Even if you do not like SDN, it is set up better for the organization of information by school over time. We will still ask that you use SDN school-specific threads for school-specific questions and discussion, sorry.\n\n**Consider using** [**CycleTrack**](https://cycletrack.org/)**!**\n\n* [Explanation of CycleTrack](https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/uxo150/cycletrack_an_application_cycle_tracker_and/)\n* [CycleTrack School Explorer](https://cycletrack.org/explorer)\n\nCreated by [u/DanielRunsMSN](https://www.reddit.com/user/DanielRunsMSN/) and [/u/Infamous-Sail-1](https://www.reddit.com/user/Infamous-Sail-1), both MD/PhD students, \"[CycleTrack](https://cycletrack.org/) is a free tool for creating school lists, tracking application cycle actions, visualizing your cycle with graphs and contributing your de-identified data to make the application process more transparent and more accessible.\"\n\nGood luck this cycle everyone!",

            "So first off, you are right to be feeling like you're freaking out. You work for a man for 4 years and what? He betrays you and throws you under the bus. I was in a situation a little bit like this BUT the fact that the PD is willing to write you a letter is great! This set-back is taken care of thanks to them and your plans should still be on track. \n\nHaving the PD insult or speak poorly of the dreadful doc may not be optimal though, maybe rewording it to say you excelled in a program/environment with a high rate of attrition would work better? It would still indicate tenacity and serious dedication, which are things you definitely possess.",
            "Cut your losses with the PI. There is no convincing him, and even if you did, that is not a letter I would trust to send without reading it beforehand. \nI would stay away from anything negative in applications, especially LOR. Dont play into the my Pi sucks angle, even though its true. Just showcase your accomplishments and hard work",

I understand that your PI has basically been gaslighting and abusive to you for nearing half a decade so youre feeling down on yourself.\n\nThe key reason why you CAN convince an adcom and not this PI is because adcoms are reasonable people and your PI is not. No matter what you did, it would never be enough for your PI. Thats not your failure but their unrealistic and inflexible expectations. Meanwhile adcoms are groups of people that, believe it or not, actually want to recruit great talent like yourself to their medical school.",
            "What an absolute motherfucker. Is there anyone in your program who handles student-faculty conflicts? It seems like this needs to be handled at a higher level. Not saying youll get the letter you deserve from this guy but at least youd get something to check the letter box that combined w the letter from the program director and your publication list would do the job",

Some people on adcom are the same, but thankfully admin wont allow them to admit 0 ppl, so they have to accept someone lmfao."

I think the landscape is second to none and I have at least 500 hr complete on GTA V so I know for sure.  There is no other medical school where I can be studying krebs cycle while reminiscing of the good ol' days where I conpleted the Fleeca Bank heist in Blaine County.     \n   \nI prefer this to the grimy but honorable vibe that GTA IV esqe schools give off such as Downstate.  Dowstate though does have a place in my heart because the immigrant serving mission would have been of use to Niko and Roman.  Also, lots of things to do in NYC like bowling with your cousin. The reason Downstate isn't #1 is that they weren't able to provide the mental health to save Niko.  Altogether, UCLA has easily the best culture based on my diverse, equitable, and inclusive experiences.   \n   \nHonorable mentions:  \n- UCR - Loyalty so commendable, it has made a reputation for it nationwide.  They don't even let the Bay Area or LA cornballs come in, spectacular    \n- George Washington - Pretty gangster to have your school printed on all US $1 bills.  \n- UMiami - So cool they chose to make the next GTA here.  \n- Wake Forest - CP3 played here.
