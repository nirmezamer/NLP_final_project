            "Holy crap. They decide they can legally accept bribes and then the same week they decide they can decide on issues that corporations have a vested interest in turning in their favour. They can place and order and pay for it and the justices of the SC can deliver it to them. \n\nThe USA is going to dissolve pretty quickly if this is the case.",

            "This was not just a power grab it was a coup. They didn't just kneecap the executive branch. They gutted Congress's ability to legislate as well. \n\nHow exactly is Congress supposed to legislate now? 40 years of laws have been written under the Chevon doctrine. The courts made the will of the American people irrelevant.",

            "Get the Boebert moderator.   He challenged everyone on anything he knew was false. He demanded non pandering answers.  I'm not sure if I've even seen a moderator own his debate more than that.  He actually might have helped her win the primary.  He was equally tough on all candidates.",
            "If his mouth is making sounds...he is lying.",
            "They never planned on moderating.\n\nThey are fixated on Ratings.  The more viewers the better.  That means allowing it to be a shitshow.",
            "I stopped watching when Trump was talking about post-birth abortions and other than Biden saying that Trump was lying, there wasn't any repercussions to his blatant lies and now given an even larger stage to tell them.  I couldn't take anymore.",
            "I'm repeating myself, but: And, Jake Tapper was USELESS!!!",

            "I found the bit where trump would say things like \"everybody knows it, the hosts know it (insert blatant lie)...\" the most annoying and telling of CNN abject debasement."

Like, he didn't answer the questions and just kept talking about immigrants. It was actually funny.",
            "Its not that Trump won, its a matter of how poor Bidens performance was. It straight shook democrats seeing him so low energy and fumbling. If he had made all the same statements and mistakes, but delivered like he did the very next day we wouldnt be having this conversation.",
            "One aspect of for-profit TV is how the debate becomes a match. Instead of scrutinizing policies, we scrutinize their performance",
            "Yeah, because he won the debate. Biden turned his age into the biggest issue of the election. It cannot be overstated how catastrophically Biden fucked up here.",
            "Bidens follow up rally was night and day. I wish he was like that during the debate.",
            "Either it was a debate and Trump disqualified himself by veering off topic and lying, or it was an improv competition and Biden got his ass whooped.",
            "It's the correct interpretation, based on historical precedent. That was a disaster. The debate rubric is different for republicans and Dems. It is what it is. We're more discerning voters than they are. \n\nThat said, we're going to vote Biden anyway. He's not my pick by a long shot, but he gets my vote anyway.",
            "Its unfortunate that this is the country weve got at the moment.",
            "That's because the debate winner in America is who's more confident, not who's spoken the most truth or sense. The moderators let loads of things slide and didn't press for answers when their questions were avoided. Shocking performance from them.",
            "I thought that Trump won simply because I dont trust the American voters. Trump wouldnt be within 30 points in a sane country, and he was already President once."

            "Trump didnt add anyone. He just reminded America that hes an unhinged, hysterical fraud",
            "I mean, Biden performed poorly, but Trump came out and showed hes still Trump. Not sure many folks are crazy about voting for a guy, whom claims without proof, that the Dems are allowing for late term and post term abortions. Trump presented nothing new for undecideds than what they have already seen. That doesnt even mention  the litany of crimes he is currently indicted for. I think most folks are just waking up to the bite of the shit sandwich we are going to have to take this time around and are grumpy about it. The Dems could toss a literal flaming pile of dog shit on the stage and itd still get my vote because its not going to try and destroy our democracy.",
            "TBH I think Biden helped himself a bit today when he acknowledged his age and that he did poorly during the debate.  Self-awareness about such things is good.",

            "> A group of undecided Latino voters said they would vote for President Joe Biden after watching his Thursday night debate with former President Donald Trump.\n\nWhile this is still positive, the title is intentionally misleading. Biden was winning the Latino vote regardless. 90% of trumps points were about how Hispanic immigrants were trying to destroy the country.",
            "I am going to wait for the next polling.  Just because.",
            "Newsweek is trash. The headline suggests voters at large have expressed that opinion, but the article is about a particular group of Latino voters. Id like to take the headline at face value because its reassuring, but Newsweek is being deceptive as usual in order to profit from clicks.",

Hes a good man, but its time for him to step aside. A late replacement will give the party energy and a chance at beating Trump. \n\nTrump wins handily against Biden because there is no enthusiasm for Biden and turnout will be down. Trumps voters will be there. Bidens will stay home.",
