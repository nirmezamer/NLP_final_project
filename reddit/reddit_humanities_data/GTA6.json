            "im really hoping for a huge map, something thats about 3x times bigger than los santos. RDR2s map, despite being smaller Im sure, is so filled to the brim with unique activities and buildings that no location is identical.",
            "My wish is really small, let the first person camera be more independent, more free, dont switch to third person when i submerge a car in the ocean. Let me have a look at the car interior, extended field of view settings and the like. I just hope the first person view isnt anything like rdr2 or gta 5",
            "I wish to have a possiblity of making polls here; I want to ask people when the next trailer will be",
            "My BIGGEST wish is to be faithful to the name of the game. Grand Theft Auto. Can it be about stealing cars? \n\nI remember playing III for the first time and being like, wait, I can get into ANY of them? Even the ones people are driving? Now, no one steals cars in GTAonline cause you cant keep them and none of the good ones spawn anyway and if you did steal a random persons car theyll probably put a bounty on you. ",
            "Girlfriends returning and boyfriends, with Jason and Lucia in an open relationship.",
            "who is ready for GTA VI6 two come out 2025 it seems like a lot of fun can't wait it is better and then GTA VI am hoping they making it for PlayStation 4",
            "Me too but I also want more than one island to make the inclusion of planes and boats even more worthwhile. A small version of the Bahamas or Cuba would be amazing",
            "yes, since Cayo Perico was added into GTA Online it showed up also in FiveM as a new portion of map and it was great that you had to use a boat or a plane to reach the island",
            "###I wish for some things.\n##1. Cars\nI want to buy myself a car and not use the default of the protagonist and have the one I drove with before just disappear into nowhere\n##2. Outfit consistency\nIf I give the characters an outfit I want them to keep that outfit and not change it after each mission especially since you can't change them from the menu like in online\n##3. Clothing quantity\nI want more clothes even more than in online. In V the protagonists had so little clothing and I just want more options.\n##4. Better personalisation\nI want to really personalise the protagonist. Hair, beard, hair colour, tattoos, shoes, legwear, underwear, t-shirt, jacket, headwear, wear the hood of a jacket/hoodie, face wear and most of all I want to wear more than one accessory not just one watch ore bracelet, not just one necklace, also I want a holster for my pistol and my big weapon just like in rdr2\n##5. Property\nI want to choose where I live once I got enough money. Look at different houses/apartments and choose the one I want to live in, maybe buy some small sage houses to hide from Cops. And I want to decorate them to my wishes. Also I want more use for them something to do in there.\n##6. Better cars\nIn the story mode (in my opinion)  none of the cars looked very good. Look at Just Cause 4 for example, every car in that game looks so beautiful even the slow ones that are middle class and not expensive\n##7. Better police ai\nI don't think I need to say anything about that one.\n##8. The option to fully undress\nyes put me in horny jail, **BUT** the game is for adults why shouldn't it be possible.\n##9. Normal prices\nA car should not cost 10 million, especially when you only get 7-15$ per pedestrian\n##10. not all missions should be character specific\nI want to choose which protagonist I send on which mission\n##11. And this is my **BIGGEST** hope\nStory mode coop. I want to be able to play the story mode with friends. The best games are (often) the ones with story mode multiplayer: Baldurs's Gate 3, Lego Star wars, terraria, spelunky 2, actually almost every Lego game, raft, Escapists 2, the forest, satisfactory, ark and some more I probably forgot",
            "a lot of ppl said 2025?!?!?! NO I WANT IT TOMORROW!\n\nBruh WTF.\n\nBTW no it's not coming for PS4 time to upgrade to PS5 or buy a gaming PC"

            "I don't know where this \"backporting\" thing came from but any developer will tell you backporting is the least desirable thing and consistently avoided in pretty much any field. Some V Online vehicles being forward ported makes more sense. It's a better workflow and helps with development for the next game. If they're making it for Online anyway, why not throw it in VI instead of making everything from scratch\n\nA lot of people assume new vehicles are from VI because they have higher poly counts. But the reality is, V is no longer a PS3 only game. They have newer hardware to work with, meaning increasing poly counts are doable",
            "**TL;DR:** The vehicles you see in GTA Online are most likely intended for GTA 6, but as this person explains, it doesn't make sense to bring the detailed models directly over from GTA 6.\n\nThem being made for GTA Online first, and then updated for GTA 6, is more likely than downscaling a high-quality model from GTA 6 over to a game that's a decade-old by now.",
            "We dont even need him yo say it, its like, why would they downgrade a model from an UPCOMING game. One thing for sure is they will port some or all the cars from gta 5 to gta 6, wich is obvious and they already did that with 4",
            "I mean we could see gauntlet interceptor in the trailer and few months later they added it in the update. It's definitely not exact same model as that admin said but honestly I don't like the way Rockstar introduces them. Lots of new GTA charm was discovering new vechicles that we couldn't see in previous games, adding them to GTAO kills that charm",
            "It did make me laugh when people were shocked that the GTA VI trailer had similar looking cars to GTA V... do they actually go outside and see the real world? Lol.",
            "Same with character \"import\". I still don't understand that some people really think, they will let you transfer your GTAO character(s) into GTAO 2.0. We will create completely new characters. GTA6 will run with the next rage engine. Simply for that fact alone wouldn't backporting not be a thing. They never did that in any GTA games anyway. GTA6 will maybe have this truck, but not a \"GTA5 version\". It will be it's own, improved GTA6 version. That's logical common sense.",
            "Now that Im really looking at that granger, I see we are getting a new declasse logo, closer to the Chevy bowtie",
            "Finally someone Made that CLEAR",
            "Wait, damn, this changes a lot in that regard. Why hasn't this been debunked months ago?",
            "Side, notw. that a cool looking truck. If I still played online, I'd pick it up"

            "It's been almost 7 (SEVEN) months since the first trailer dropped! Time really flies! Just have some patience... The 2nd trailer will probably release at the end of this year.",
            "According to a janitor at Rockstar Games, the GTA VI Trailer 2 is located inside Mt Chiliad in GTA 5 but you need to solve the mystery first, this can be done by equipping a sniper rifle, pointed towards the mural painting that depicts puzzle - then simply put down your controller, get down on your knees and chant \"GTA VI Trailer 2, GTA VI Trailer 2, GTA VI Trailer 2\" for 666 times into the microphone of your headset. This should unlock the mystery and reveal a URL link to the Trailer 2.\n\nGood luck.",

            "A trailer should come out in august but in the end, its rockstars decision to release GTA VI news when they want to.",
            "Thinking about how rockstar had released the previous game trailers. The next trailer should include the story and cutscenes from the game and should be released like 5 or 6 months before the release of the game. I really think it would only drop next year. I heard about it rumoured to be dropping soon, but I dont think its real",
