            "Please let there be a photomode day one, I know we\u2019ll have a phone that we can take pictures with and that\u2019ll be great, but I also really hope for a Photomode too.\n\nAlso I hope they change their photo saving method that they have in GTA V & RDR2 with it being saved inside a gallery in the game, and then having to upload it to the social club, then having to go onto the social club and downloading my images to my phone/laptop. Most games nowadays when taking images in photomode it automatically puts it in your consoles gallery, which I then can seamlessly transfer to my hard drive, then to my Laptop.",
            "Over the weekend I got the itch to play GTA5 online. But I was suddenly reminded why I dont play it that much. Tried to do the Cayo Perico heist and it froze on loading screens back to my sub three times. Finally I just exited out and played something else. Coming from playing a lot of MMO's I love the concept of GTA online and would play it a WHOLE LOT more if it wasn't so buggy and the menus were such garbage. I obviously played it a lot more when it was newer (2013-2017). But slowly stopped playing it regularly due to difficulty loading into sessions or trying to join a friends session then getting kicked.  I've still popped in for updated content here and there but its always the same. Start playing it, convince other gamer friends to join and eventually we all get frustrated with kicks, freezing loading screens or just game breaking bugs in general. I've always said I would be happy to pay a $5-$15 monthly fee if that meant R\\* would actually maintain their servers. I know a lot of people, especially in this type of game genre would absolutely scoff at the idea. But coming from MMO's where its either pay to win or has a monthly sub, I would have no issues with a monthly sub whatsoever. Again, given its less pay to win and the servers aren't complete dog s\\*\\*\\*. \n\nAlso did I mention the menu system in GTA5 online is also hot garbage? Game matching menus included. I hope they fix that too."
