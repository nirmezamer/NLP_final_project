Its just disheartening for new players to get ranked plat and then sink in rank because their MMR is still calibrating. Calibrate from the bottom and the experience will be better. Let the players who lack the emotional maturity to play competitively get stuck at the bottom. Your state of mind affects how you play and if you tilt so easily, no matter how skilled you think you are, you belong at the bottom.",

            "Why is this game so unrewarding ?\n\nSo I use to just play qp but as of the last year have been playing more comp because I wanted some more gold weapons.\n\nFirst thing that happens, over a few months, I get 2400 comp points but then Jade weapon skins are introduced so the points get shelved and I can no longer use them so I start from scratch.\n\nSo I grind and grind, managing to work my way into plat tank and support. Finish the season expecting my end of season comp point reward and.. nothing.. no more end of season rewards, just a name title.\n\nOkay.. so I keep grinding, thankfully the system of \u201cComplete 30 games, wins are worth 3 and get 100 comp points\u201d came in clutch and as of this week I finally got a new gold weapon.\n\nNow I\u2019ve been playing a bit, winning and actually enjoying the game for a change and now I notice the \u201cComplete 30 games thing\u201d is locked due to a cap??\n\nSeriously blizzard? Why make gold/jade weapons so impossibly hard to obtain. Are we all expected (after we complete our 30 games cap) to win 300 comp games per season just so we can have a gold gun?\n\nCan someone please rationalise this to me because I want to keep playing this game but I just genuinely do not see any kind of reward to it now.",

            "5v5 vs 6v6 isn\u2019t the true battle. The true battle is how to not have a role in the game feel BAD to play at any given time. The player base plays what is the best experience is usually. \n\nMy thoughts are mostly that they pick the wrong heroes to be the strongest.(The ones that are in the camp of \u201cVery strong when not counterpicked: Way too strong when not counterpicked\u201d).",

            "Their POV is just going to boil down to \"6v6 has its pros, but 5v5 is better overall\" because saying otherwise would pretty much be admitting they've had no idea what they're doing these past couple years.",
            "The 5v5 is just so tough on tanks. If even one of your dps is not on par with your team then your just going to spend most your time mitigating damage rather then fulfilling your role unless you can play two ranks above your current rank. With two tanks the damage from 2 dps was spread more evenly between them and one could wait for cooldowns while the other did tank stuff.",
            "I'd be surprised if it isn't mostly stuff we already know. Maybe if they explicitly laid out all they did to try and fix queue times before swapping to 5v5, we wouldn't have so many people adamant that 6v6 would work.",
            "Its one of those things that is a lose lose. If they say nothing it makes them seem silly in their descion and makes them look bad. If they say anything you majorly piss off either side.  \nI personally think 6v6 is the correct choice overall, but I do want to hear their thoughts",
            "We all know they likely won't go back. There are arguments for and against going back to 6v6, but I never expect them to actually backtrack on that change. I know queue times are very important to them and the community (rightly so) but I feel like the game balance doesn't function in 5v5. Maybe they recognize that maybe not, but there is no perfect world so not everything can work the way the devs or community want it to. 6v6 is better as a format though and I'm hopeful they are seriously considering it as an option.",
            "Bro, I was okay with the 5v5 because I thought additional PvE content was coming. Going to 1 Tank has been the single worst experience for me in a competitive game. I'm a fucking DPS main."

We figured it would take a few times before we got lucky, but in fact we got placed against each other on the first game.\n\nLong story short, I got steamrolled in one of the funniest gamest I've ever played. After informing everyone of the situation and imploring my team to help me beat my wife, she capped the first point quickly with a bubbled gengi assassinating my Mercy. I warned Mercy it would happen as my wife always demands her team \"kill Mercy firsty.\" But my wife's bubbles were better timed than mine and Mercy went down easily.\n\nAfter that first cap, both teams were hitting me with toxic \"spouse diff\" and \"can I swap to your wife's team\" and \"divorce him\" type comments. All the while my wife zapping me and my teammates and laughing in my face. \"I got your mercy! I got your moira!
