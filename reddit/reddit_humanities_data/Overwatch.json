Not a weapon-inspect, the thing from the Season 1 trailer BTW, just a \u2018flourish\u2019.\n\nWith it being just a hammer, Reinhardt\u2019s shield and charge are probably the same as normal, since Firestrikes and Earthshatter come from the hammer.",

            "it's 10 bucks to get the premium BP.  Just do your weeklies and your dailies when you can and you should get all of the stuff you need in a season.  It's not likely that you'll like all of the Mythics that they release, so you'll have a chance to stock up points towards things you want.  And if you play enough and finish the BP, you are getting the next BP at a discount because you earn the coins you can spend on the BP while playing the game and progressing through the BP.  Plus, the Progession Weekly Challege nets you coins as well (though that one will get harder and harder to earn the more you play the game.",
            "Blizzard gave more mythics, without taking anything back = players mad.\n\nIt's as clear as day that the new mythic weapons are for people who aren't reluctant to buy mythic prisms + good alternative to people who don't main a character with season mythic skin. Really doubt they're going to lower the price",
            "it took 1 season for them to ruin this. we should've known the mythic shop was just another attempt to take money.",
            "Apex legends have mythic weapons that cost $300. People still spend the money for them.\n\nOW2 is pretty \u201cfair\u201d in that you at least get the option to choose what you want to unlock.",
            "Yeah I think it\u2019s a bit absurd. \n\nWhen the mythic shop came out and we all saw how expensive mythic skins would cost it wasn\u2019t too terrible because it kind of just reinforced that the BP is a pretty good deal. \n\nBut now you can\u2019t get every mythic cosmetic just by keeping up with the BP. Even if you\u2019ve bought every BP to date, if you want all the mythic items you\u2019re going to have to actually spend that exorbitant amount that previously didn\u2019t apply to you."
