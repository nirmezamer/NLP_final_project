Do not ask questions that treat all men as a singular being.    \nDo not post questions that assume all men think a single way, and you want to know why.  You're already on the wrong path.    \nYour boyfriend/husband/SO is an individual not part of collective male mind.  If you want to know why they did something - ASK THEM, NOT US.    \nYou want to buy your boyfriend/husband/SO a gift, and don't know what to get them, HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THEM.\n\nYou didn't have a dad growing up and want to ask a question - we got dads here.    \nYou didn't or don't have many male friends and don't understand a reference - we got dudes here.    \nYou never learned how to do a thing that \"every dude\" seems to know how to do, and want it explained - we got those guys here too.\n\nI am saying all this, because lately there has been a swarm of [really anti-female shit being said around here](https://media1.tenor.com/m/eB7HcRqPP-MAAAAC/you-dumb-af.gif), people feeding into it, and then other (usually either anti-male or pro-fem) subs using it to buzz around and [incite fights, flaming and other bullshit.](https://media1.tenor.com/m/LGI22J-z3JIAAAAC/joker-batman.gif)  The bots catch a lot, but the mod inbox the last two weeks has been [full to the brim.](https://media1.tenor.com/m/97Yg4GE43E4AAAAd/jurassic-park-shit.gif)\n\nThis is a safe space.  Liberal, Conservative, Gay, Straight, Bi, Trans, Cis, Married, Single, Poly, Child-free, parenting, POC, White, Religious, Atheist, whatever...thats all part of the male experience, so it's all valued and all valid.\n\nWE THE MODERATION TEAM ARE ASKING - when you see hateful shit, when you see people behaving badly, when you see people being wrong - fucking report it.  if it's reported, report it again - three reports takes it down.  Or message us with a link - and title it \"This Fucking Person\"\n\nWe will act, but we have to know about it.  We need your help to keep this place a good place to be.

            "I think maturity plays a huge role in how I'd feel. If they're a mature 18 y.o. with a semester of college under their belt, 26 is about as high as you could go before I'd start calling it really weird. \n\nIf you're immature, vapid, etc. I'd raise my eyebrows at anything over 20.",

            "If she's 18, then its none of my business and she can make her own decisions. I'd try to make sure she isn't being manipulated or treated badly, but I'd do that at any age",
            "Past the age of 30, age really is just a meaningless number so a gap of several years wouldn't necessarily bother me there. But at 18, even a few years difference feels like a chasm. Once you reach mid-late 20s, 18 year olds start to look like children. And on a more practical side, once I passed 21 I was not interested in dating someone who couldn't (reliably) get into bars or clubs with me. So IMO, 22 is the cut off, but to each their own."
