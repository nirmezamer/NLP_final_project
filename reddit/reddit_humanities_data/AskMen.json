Do not ask questions that treat all men as a singular being.    \nDo not post questions that assume all men think a single way, and you want to know why.  You're already on the wrong path.    \nYour boyfriend/husband/SO is an individual not part of collective male mind.  If you want to know why they did something - ASK THEM, NOT US.    \nYou want to buy your boyfriend/husband/SO a gift, and don't know what to get them, HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THEM.\n\nYou didn't have a dad growing up and want to ask a question - we got dads here.    \nYou didn't or don't have many male friends and don't understand a reference - we got dudes here.    \nYou never learned how to do a thing that \"every dude\" seems to know how to do, and want it explained - we got those guys here too.\n\nI am saying all this, because lately there has been a swarm of [really anti-female shit being said around here](https://media1.tenor.com/m/eB7HcRqPP-MAAAAC/you-dumb-af.gif), people feeding into it, and then other (usually either anti-male or pro-fem) subs using it to buzz around and [incite fights, flaming and other bullshit.](https://media1.tenor.com/m/LGI22J-z3JIAAAAC/joker-batman.gif)  The bots catch a lot, but the mod inbox the last two weeks has been [full to the brim.](https://media1.tenor.com/m/97Yg4GE43E4AAAAd/jurassic-park-shit.gif)\n\nThis is a safe space.

I believe the verbiage used when he asked her out included some variation of \u201cin love with you.\u201d She turned him down. I think later on he made a pass at one or more of her friends from outside of work. Nothing creepy, to her or her friends or anyone hearing the story, but a brazen show of interest and maybe a little desperation.\n\nAnyways, the crazy part is that\u2026 absolutely nothing came of the rejection. They have remained cordial and professional at work ever since. Your situation might be the most important thing on your mind right now, but if she says no it\u2019ll just blow over and turn into a funny little story.\n\nThere is a caveat, however, that it will likely be a story that is shared with your coworkers. I had no business hearing about the story I shared; I learned it against my will at a company mixer from a particularly catty colleague. That might be a little embarrassing for you, because these things tend to awaken the inner high schooler in people who only know you as a corporate robot. But you have nothing to be ashamed of. For everyone who hears about it, take pride in the disruption that your pursuit of a relationship caused in their monotonous work life. \n\nLet me also tell you the story of another dude who gave another chick his number at an office mixer for the same company. He made his move like 5 years ago and they\u2019re getting married this summer. Don\u2019t buy into the \u201cdon\u2019t shit where you eat\u201d crowd. Thousands of people meet their future spouse at work.
