            "## **[PC-EU]** **Grayskull**   \n*Social, Casual, Grouping, Events, PvE, Mixed*\n\n### Who we are\n**Grayskull** is a social guild of currently about 70 members with heavy focus on kindness and helpfulness. We are active and talk a lot in guild chat in game as well as use Discord and voice chat. We have a nice Guild House with plenty of accommodations such as a transmute station and trial dummies. Our guild consists of mainly older people (40s, 50s, 60s) but younger too, who just want to have fun playing the game and enjoy our time together. Helping each other out is a big part of our guild. We enjoy grouping up for any type of content.\n\n### What we do\nWe have Weekly Events ranging from Trials to Fashion events but it is all is pretty low key. There is no crazy gatekeeping for most of the things we do as we play this game for fun and like to keep it fun *even when doing the harder content*. We gladly, and often do, take on lower levels and the more inexperienced players along on bigger events including trials. We just want everyone to have fun and be able to enjoy *all* forms of content in this game. We don't expect anyone to be in the top 1%. Don't expect to see any form of rage-quitting, namecalling, etc if something does not go as planned. We are generally calm and patient and will simply try again. We run content every day like pledges, RND, veteran dungeons, trials, achievement runs, or anything else when and if there's a want for it.\n\n### What we are\nWe are not a hardcore raiding or trading guild, but we sure are a *fun* guild. So if you're looking for a place to feel at home just give us a call. Your skill or level does not matter. You could be new to the game or a veteran player just looking for a change. We have people from all walks of life and skill and will happily add you to our ranks if you resonate with the above.\n\nYou can apply by contacting me here, or by whispering `@WildCatra` or `@Noble-Bear` in-game.",
