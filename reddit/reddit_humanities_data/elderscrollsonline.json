            "## **[PC-EU]** **Grayskull**   \n*Social, Casual, Grouping, Events, PvE, Mixed*\n\n### Who we are\n**Grayskull** is a social guild of currently about 70 members with heavy focus on kindness and helpfulness. We are active and talk a lot in guild chat in game as well as use Discord and voice chat. We have a nice Guild House with plenty of accommodations such as a transmute station and trial dummies. Our guild consists of mainly older people (40s, 50s, 60s) but younger too, who just want to have fun playing the game and enjoy our time together. Helping each other out is a big part of our guild. We enjoy grouping up for any type of content.\n\n### What we do\nWe have Weekly Events ranging from Trials to Fashion events but it is all is pretty low key. There are no crazy requirements for most of the things we do as we play this game for fun and like to keep it fun *even when doing the harder content*. We gladly, and often do, take on lower levels and the more inexperienced players along on bigger events including trials. We just want everyone to have fun and be able to enjoy *all* forms of content in this game. We don't expect anyone to be in the top 1%. Don't expect to see any form of rage-quitting, namecalling, etc if something does not go as planned. We are generally calm and patient and will simply try again. We run content every day like pledges, RND, veteran dungeons, trials, achievement runs, or anything else when and if there's a want for it.\n\n### What we are\nWe are not a hardcore raiding or trading guild, but we sure are a *fun* guild. So if you're looking for a place to feel at home just give us a call. Your skill or level does not matter. You could be new to the game or a veteran player just looking for a change. We have people from all walks of life and skill and will happily add you to our ranks if you resonate with the above.\n\nYou can apply by contacting me here, or by whispering `@WildCatra` or `@Noble-Bear` in-game."

            "Still kinda insane that you go to the other alliance zones and slaughter your own alliance troops lol",
            "The real reward was the friends you made on the way.",
            "People sometimes forget that when ESO launched, set amulets and rings were rather scarce.  There was no way to craft your own, which is why sets such as Willpower and Agility were popular in builds, so getting a blue necklace for a quest reward wasn't entirely terrible (although, as Cadwell himself admits, it's hardly a suitable reward.) \n\nWith no dark anchors in Coldharbour, if I am remembering correctly, the only other way to get jewelry for this set was via treasure chests, and one certain delve boss dropped a green-quality necklace.\n\nAlso, the Meridia's Blessed Armor (originally Akatosh) set was not craftable, and only available from Coldharbour,  It was a decent set: blocking an enemy gives you a 33% chance to blind them, causing them to miss all attacks against you for 5 seconds, with a 10 second cooldown.  It could only be applied to one target at a time, though.  This was later changed to give you 100% chance to avoid all incoming attacks for 5 seconds when blocking, with a 25 second cooldown.",
            "The real reward was hearing one extra line from John Cleese, well worth it!",
            "I think it would be awesome if you got Daedric Prince artifacts from doing Daedric Prince questlines. If Meridian gave you the Dawnbreaker sword style motif, that'd do it for my first Harborage completion. Now, if ZeniThesda *really* wanted to reward their players for playing Harborage, they would make armor set motifs to go with it to keep you playing it more times.",
            "I thought you also got the cauldron hat for doing all three?",
            "I love that necklace and I carry it locked in my inventory along with several other quest related sentimental items \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f but I'm more into sentiment than anything",
            "Gold rewards in ESO are so menial it\u2019s not even worth doing those side quests. 10 years and it\u2019s still the same.",
            "I still have not completed Cadwell's Silver and Gold, and I've been playing since 2015, cause it's just not fun. Can't bring myself to complete the story two more times, when I could be doing dungeons or running round in Cyro.",
            "We have enough DLCs they should make the factions mean something again... PvE raids of cities or something..."
