            "As Nick Bostrom predicted about a decade ago: \u201cGiven the extreme security implications of superintelligence, governments would likely seek to nationalize any project on their territory that they thought close to achieving a takeoff. A powerful state might also attempt to acquire projects located in other countries through espionage, theft, kidnapping, bribery, threats, military conquest, or any other available means... If global governance structures are strong by the time a breakthrough begins to look imminent, it is possible that promising projects would be placed under international control.\u201d Whatever you may think about OpenAI or the likelihood that we are on the road to superintelligence, it\u2019s difficult for me to conceive that our government and intelligence agencies aren\u2019t monitoring this space VERY closely, because there is a very real chance they may have to abruptly step in and nationalize one or more promising projects at some point over the next five years. So I don\u2019t find this development overly surprising from that perspective (even though it\u2019s an odd feeling to see the pieces slowly coming together).",
