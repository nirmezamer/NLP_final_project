She was badass with a spear and machete, but maybe not so great at defending while going up staircases.\n\nAnybody know of a mod or some file-fu to export her diary?",

            "I have a question about a sticky situation I'm in on a multiplayer server I play on.\n\nLast night I was driving a car and it got stuck due to the black void and for some reason zeds spawned around me so I couldn't get out of the car to run away. I just logged off due to panic, now my question is what's going to happen with my character? I haven't logged on since as I'm afraid she might be dead already, or I'm still surrounded by the hundreds of zeds I left behind. I'm scared to log in, what should I do?\n\nMaybe it's a silly question, I don't know but I'm genuinely seeking help with this. Also it's a live server meaning time goes on even without players being on, will the zeds move away from me in this case?",

            "Well muldraugh police station is about to become a sick base location",
            ">As another part of us bedding down in the lore, meanwhile, we are also making sure that characters in broadcasts, flyers and newspapers who have an evident place of work (or place of demise) have their zombified forms spawn at the relevant location on the map.\n\n>This is something of a side project for a few of our coders, but will hopefully pay dividends for when players are exploring new locations and getting to know the locals.\n\nFuck yeah!",
            "Friendship ended with Rosewood Firestation, now B42 Muldraugh Police Station is my best friend",
            "This is exciting. I was getting rather worried about how almost every \u201cupdate\u201d regarding build 42 also involved showcasing some sort of new deep mechanic being added. Not that I don\u2019t appreciate everything TIS does or that I think I know better, I just love the game and am rather excited! \n\nI\u2019m sure it\u2019s challenging to gauge what goes into an update and what doesn\u2019t - especially when working on something you\u2019re so passionate about. \n\nYou see similar in other games. Stardew Valley dev decided to add more features to the 1.6 update in a bug fix patch a few weeks after 1.6 dropped. And he\u2019s still going to have to port all that over to console! Just creating more work for himself out of the love of making the game better haha. \n\nI\u2019m sure whatever ends up being added will satiate most of us for a while. Especially once mods will be able to settle back in and utilize new features / improvements.",
            "Good god they put a cap on feature creep, they actually did it! Can\u2019t wait for the unstable release good on the devs",
            "Thank goodness they reeled in scope creep! There\u2019s so much to look forward to already in this build that I\u2019d gotten nervous a few thursoids back when they stated they planned to duplicate the entire crafting tree. I\u2019m happy keeping my trucks running through scavenging for now, thanks!",
            "12/31/24 is still this year, lol",
            "I had no idea about the map glow up! That alone is giving me hype.",
            "So it's a least 2 months away at minimum for unstable, even with them holding back some of the work. I was hoping this Thursdoid would be the one they announced it. Oh well. I'm sure it will be worth the wait.",

            "I have a few mods that enhance the depression experience; one gives a trait that gives my character depression at random and one where they'll cry out of force if they're depressed for too long.\n\nI imagine that at random moments outside of fighting the dead, my character will remember that their family and friends are among the dead and will start feeling unmotivated to survive yet have to continue forward because it's all they can do now and if I don't do something about their depression, they have a crying fit because they're remembering too much of the old life where things weren't so bad and they're going to be alone forever. But then I have them read a hentai book that removes their depression completely or drink some liquor so they can sleep peacefully for the night.",
