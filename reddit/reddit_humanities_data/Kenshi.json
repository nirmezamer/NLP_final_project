That's right, a new Rookie Help thread!\n\nHere's a link to the last [episode](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenshi/comments/pera0a/rookie_help_thread/). Fun fact, if you follow all those links back to 2019 you unlock a secret cutscene of me panicking over where the time went!\n\nAs always, feel free to fire any kenshi related questions you may have our way! There's plenty of veterans flapping around in this thread as well, and if you are in the mood for it feel free to join them and lend a hand!\n\nAnd who knows, maybe you'll learn something new yourself, too!\n\nOne thing to remember! Obviously a lot of new folks are going to be here so remember to spoiler comments so they can experience the game blind just like you might have back when you were new! You can do that   > ! Like This ! <  minus the spaces! But honestly it's just built into the chat replies nowadays so you don't have to get too fancy with that- unless you like playing hackerman.\n\nThanks guys!",

            "I feel like this is either a super obvious noob realization or just super dumb but I am starting to get the feeling that boots don\u2019t matter at all. I already avoid samurai and plated boots because they make you slower and I hate that. Is there literally any reason to use boots that aren\u2019t the sandals with the athletics boost?",
            "I\u2019m training a stealth skeleton calling him the shinobot any tips what to do I\u2019m already part of the thieves guild",
            "So Ive never gotten to the point where I\u2019m taking on entire factions before, I want to roleplay going on a guerrilla war against the reavers with my ~15 person squad. If I just go into their territory and fight patrols, raid camps, beat people up, free slaves, etc. will it make a difference? Is all of the fighting meaningless unless I take out the leader?",
            "Is there a benefit to \"killing\" someone.  I'm like an hour in the game and saw a wounded bandit hobble pass.  They were prob attacked and she escaped.  I knocked her out and took her shoes.  She kept playing dead and I would beat her up again.  She doesn't have anything on her person and I am too weak to actually kill her.  Is there a benefit to me doing it or once they're KOd and not hostile to me, should I move on.",
            "Approaching 20 party members. We get bodied by mostly everyone but we are getting better (we are called the band of losers lol ). The only issue I have is feeding everyone is annoying because I have to put food in everyone\u2019s inventory individually, but sometimes if I give all the food to certain characters other characters will eat the food in their inventory. So which is it? Can I keep all the food on one character or do I have to distribute it. (Also can someone give me stat rundowns of what my characters should be so that they don\u2019t get brutalized by dust bandits)",
            "I\u2019m reaching my first mid-game slump. my biggest bottleneck is ancient science books. my other bottleneck is that i now have around 30 recruits in my faction. i feel this size group is too big to manage, especially because some of the group is low stats, some are mid-average, and others are nearing the high 70s-80s. we have an autonomous mining outpost outside the Hub, with a crafting and research station inside the town walls. this base is productive and barebones, no walls, and my team can withstand raids. i feel it may be time to leave, but have no clue where to set up next. i like the hub because it\u2019s central for travel. \n\nhow do i effectively manage from here? i think i should have a small squad that i control around the map to explore and trade, and leave the bulk of the group at my outpost. i guess my biggest question would be what size squad is best for exploring the world safely?",
            "No question just something that happened to me, I just download the game and tried the default start, walked around and recruited a doctor, we went together through the swamp and when we were VERY close to crossing it we got attacked, some crabs killed and ate the doctor and some bandits showed up out of nowhere and KO'd me, I thought I would get up after a while and a weird green thing showed up and ATE ME, then nothing happened, I was just looking at my sword and boots for 5 minutes until I realized the game was over\n\n10/10 game so far",
            "I turned in a 2k Bounty in Squin while the jail was full and the guard dumped the prisoner in a cage I had built on the roof of my house. I seem to have the ability to pick them up and take them back to the captain to collect the bounty again. Have I unlocked American style private prisons in Kenshi?",
            "I suck at the game and will read this thread.  Found what maybe is a known exploit.  I was sad when my pack animal was killed by dust bandits but found my main char could carry a fully loaded pack animal corpse (!). As long as you don't keep it on the ground too long it won 't dissolve. (?)",
            "seriously thank you for making this thread, this game is frickin awesome but a little overwhelming so this thread helps so damn much."

            "Honestly \"its ready when its ready\" is such a vibe. \n\nWhile I really wanna know when it comes out, I say that to people all the time at work. I'm going as fast as I can stop interrupting me for stupid status updates.",
            "All aboard the hype train. As a rule i dont preorder, but would absolutely make an exception for kenshi 2.",
            "game is great but lets be honest - devs are lazy. game been developed for a long time yet it has massive jank, is missing QoL and in general feels like an early access game. I dont belive making a new game while not finishing first one is a good idea and makes me feel like they will do it again with kenshi 2.",
