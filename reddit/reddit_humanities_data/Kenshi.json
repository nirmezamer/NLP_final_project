There's plenty of veterans flapping around in this thread as well, and if you are in the mood for it feel free to join them and lend a hand!\n\nAnd who knows, maybe you'll learn something new yourself, too!\n\nOne thing to remember! Obviously a lot of new folks are going to be here so remember to spoiler comments so they can experience the game blind just like you might have back when you were new! You can do that   > ! Like This ! <  minus the spaces! But honestly it's just built into the chat replies nowadays so you don't have to get too fancy with that- unless you like playing hackerman.\n\nThanks guys!",

            "To those having difficulty fighting here are my tips:\n\n1. At super early levels (1-10 skill points) lure starving bandits and dust bandits to gate guards or bar guards and join in the fight \n2. Train toughness. Raising toughness is the best way to get stronger. When your toughness gets above ~25 you can attack large groups of vagrants. You\u2019ll pass out, but just get back up and fight again. \n3. When taking early fights be very cautious about tending to all wounds immediately. Any leg wounds means the fight is over. You don\u2019t want to get caught in a dangerous situation without working legs. \n\nTLDR;\nBait starving vagrants/dust bandits towards gate guards and join in\nRaise toughness. It\u2019s the best stat. Take as many safe fights as you can early on. \nBandage wounds ASAP. Run from fights upon taking leg wounds.\n\nI got to 70 toughness and 40 martial arts by day 45 on a solo run with no mods and no save scum",
            "Melee weapons types and their uses at a glance, for rookies:\n\nSince I see so many \"we're good with katanas right now\" comments by new players - I thought I'd post some brief thoughts on weapons. If you think I'm wrong or just want to comment, I welcome your comment!\n\nShort of it: all weapons are good in the right situation. Some weapons are good in a broader set of circumstances. And a few are good in very specific situations. This is a short explainer, without going into the numbers. You can dig for those if you're interested. On that note: Crossbows are always good, and other than you can't cheese diplomatic status opponents with it, it's the strongest weapon type if you get it going. It also takes forever to play crossbow only, and even a few tanks with a line of shooters is so much faster - and more fun.\n\nMy personal melee weapon preferences, ranked. Keep in mind that lower on the list doesn't mean bad - some lower categories have one weapon in the class that would individually make my top weapons:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Heavy Weapons - The Falling Sun and Plank are bonkers weapons that will punch through the maximum amount of opponents in the shortest time. The Fragment Axe is crazy too, but requires robotics enhancements to wield Edge 3 and Meitou axes to their max potential (it's not stealing if Seto takes her mom's axe, right?). Cons: Heavy and you can't wield crossbows at all with this specialization. They also have serious indoors penalties, so lure your opponents outdoors.\n2. Hackers - Hackers are extremely versatile, armor-penetrating weapons that have anti-human and anti-robot specialization in damage. You can switch to a Short-Cleaver to use crossbows in this specialization (although Edge 1-3 do not exist for it other than homemade versions, and this means there's just 1 Meitou laying around for the highest end of this neat weapon). The larger series of these weapons are all good, and the Paladin's Cross eats robot opponents while the Flesh Cleaver lets you carve up people. Cons: mediocre vs animals, and larger cleavers just pale in comparison vs Heavy Weapons in damage.\n3. Blunt - Blunt weapons clobber robots and heavy armored opponents - the most dangerous kind that are out there. The Spiked Club should be granted the third place spot by itself. Easily the most powerful weapon that you can carry as a sidearm for your crossbow, the Spiked Club has a nice combination of blunt and cut damage, and preposterous bleed damage, making it more like a blunt-heavy Hacker class weapon. The Jitte is insane as a defensive weapon indoors, making the entire large sabre line sort of obsolete if you can keep opponents inside. Heavy Jitte is comical for knocking out lightly armored opponents. Cons: weighs a lot and training this skill provides mediocre amounts of dexterity.\n4. Martial Arts - Against a single opponent, this is by far the most damaging attack type in the game, even compared to heavy weapons. Cons: time consuming to train to higher levels, the flying kick animation makes it almost impossible to even attack when you're surrounded, and you need to be very selective about heavier armor to remain effective due to martial arts penalties on a lot of armor. Sucks vs groups in general when solo due to dodge/attacking animation, especially if you're being shot at by toothpicks.\n5. Sabres - The Longsword is the reason to use this class. Longswords have a decent amount of blunt damage for a light small weapon and they have only half (-15%) the armor penetration penalty vs armored opponents that katanas do (-30%), and a vastly lower penalty against robots (-10% vs -39%), making them much more versatile as a Crossbow offhand than katanas as a cut damage choice. The large Sabres are nifty defensive weapons. Cons: if you want a defensive weapon, the Jitte from blunt is really the best there is, making the Longsword the only real keeper here. The Desert Sabre is a novelty that's good against things that aren't really all that dangerous.\n6. Polearms - More versatile in the damage they deal out than the sabres, polearms are good for killing armored opponents and animals, and the Naginata Katana is a fairly good weapon against a myriad of lightly armored humanoids that fight outdoors, from Cannibals to Fogmen, due to good reach. Polearm/Heavy Polearm are good at penetrating armor and the Polearm does a ton of blunt damage, too. Cons: big indoors penalties, and the Spiked Club sort of covers some of the Polearm/Heavy Polearm role, while leaving space for a crossbow.\n7. Katanas - Katanas are best at killing naked humanoids and training your dexterity. If something has armor, is a robot, or is an armored robot, katanas are near useless. The naked thing category is large, but it leaves out large numbers of pretty powerful opponents. The Topper is the exception - it has lower armor penetration penalty, more reach, and more blunt damage than any katana type, but like the Short-Cleaver, there's no Edge 1-3 versions that exist, just the homemade ones. And the Meitou version is in an pretty unfriendly area. Cons: robotic damage and armor penetration penalties are very large, no blunt damage other than the Topper, limiting their usefulness vs anything with metal on it.\n\nMy top 5 favorite weapons:\n\n1. Falling Sun\n2. Spiked Club\n3. Plank\n4. Paladin's Cross\n5. Longsword",
            "I feel like this is either a super obvious noob realization or just super dumb but I am starting to get the feeling that boots don\u2019t matter at all. I already avoid samurai and plated boots because they make you slower and I hate that. Is there literally any reason to use boots that aren\u2019t the sandals with the athletics boost?",
            "Just fired it up, spent 2 long making my character. Ran in to the wilderness, looked around, scratched my head and said to myself. Ummmmmmm I am going to starve at this rate. Now I find myself staring off in to the wilderness. on just what to do first?\n\nUpdate: Got attacked, taken as a slave, the poeple that took me got killed by what looked like pigs, I took their armour now walking to a town with bad limp.\n\nUpdate: Went to a town, got attacked on the way in and now imprissoned.\n\nUpdate: got crippled escaping.

            "So Ive never gotten to the point where I\u2019m taking on entire factions before, I want to roleplay going on a guerrilla war against the reavers with my ~15 person squad. If I just go into their territory and fight patrols, raid camps, beat people up, free slaves, etc. will it make a difference? Is all of the fighting meaningless unless I take out the leader?",
            "Is there a benefit to \"killing\" someone.  I'm like an hour in the game and saw a wounded bandit hobble pass.  They were prob attacked and she escaped.  I knocked her out and took her shoes.  She kept playing dead and I would beat her up again.  She doesn't have anything on her person and I am too weak to actually kill her.  Is there a benefit to me doing it or once they're KOd and not hostile to me, should I move on.",
            "Approaching 20 party members. We get bodied by mostly everyone but we are getting better (we are called the band of losers lol ). The only issue I have is feeding everyone is annoying because I have to put food in everyone\u2019s inventory individually, but sometimes if I give all the food to certain characters other characters will eat the food in their inventory. So which is it? Can I keep all the food on one character or do I have to distribute it. (Also can someone give me stat rundowns of what my characters should be so that they don\u2019t get brutalized by dust bandits)",
            "I\u2019m reaching my first mid-game slump. my biggest bottleneck is ancient science books. my other bottleneck is that i now have around 30 recruits in my faction. i feel this size group is too big to manage, especially because some of the group is low stats, some are mid-average, and others are nearing the high 70s-80s. we have an autonomous mining outpost outside the Hub, with a crafting and research station inside the town walls. this base is productive and barebones, no walls, and my team can withstand raids. i feel it may be time to leave, but have no clue where to set up next. i like the hub because it\u2019s central for travel. \n\nhow do i effectively manage from here? i think i should have a small squad that i control around the map to explore and trade, and leave the bulk of the group at my outpost. i guess my biggest question would be what size squad is best for exploring the world safely?"

The time and cost involved with just stopping by to check things out isn't worth it. Far off settlements either survive or fail based on their own merits.\n\n\n2. The Empire never ceased to exist as you say, but the ones on the planet are just watching because Kenshi is just a really long-running social experiment. \n\n\n3. The war that signaled the collapse of the First Empire was actually a conflict spanning all over the galaxy. Or at least as much as the Empire had settled.
