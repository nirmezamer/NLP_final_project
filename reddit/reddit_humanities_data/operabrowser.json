Then, repeat for ```google.com```.\n\nThen, goto the URL ```opera://settings/clearBrowserData``` and clear \"cached images and files\" for all time.\n\nThen try things out on Youtube to see if they're better.\n\nIf you still have issues, disable your extensions at the URL ```opera://extensions``` one by one and test to see if one is causing the issues. If you're using Opera GX, do the same thing with mods at the URL ```opera://mods``` and also disable shaders at the URL ```opera://settings/shaders_settings``` and webmodding at the URL ```opera://settings/web_modding_settings```.\n\nThe idea is to disable anything that might cause Youtube to think you're using an adblocker (or remember that you *were*) so that Youtube doesn't punish you with deliberate bugs and issues.\n\nIf you need an adblocker, try using [uBlock Origin](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm) instead and make sure it's updated to see if you can get away with adblocking on Youtube without it being detected. And, if you have any Youtbue issues with it, check the Youtube sticky thread at r/uBlockOrigin to see if there's a solution/workaround.\n\nIf you have performance issues on Youtube in general, goto the URL ```opera://settings/system``` and make sure \"Use graphics acceleration when available\" is enabled. Then, [adjust the Angle flag for your GPU](/r/operabrowser/wiki/opera/known_issues/#wiki_opera_on_windows_is_slow).\n\nAlso see <https://reddit.com/r/operabrowser/wiki/opera/known_issues/#wiki_can.27t_log_in_to_twitch> for how you can have Opera pretend to be Chrome.

            "Opera only retains the last 3 months of history. So, entries older than that *should* be wiped automatically.\n\nThere's also [this specific History wipe issue](/r/operabrowser/wiki/opera/known_issues/#wiki_deleting_history_entries_can_wipe_out_all_history_when_opera_sync_is_enabled) if you're using Opera Sync.\n\nAlso, changing your user account password on your OS can sometimes cause current data in some of Opera's files to not be readable by Opera anymore. Not sure if this affects the History file though.\n\nAlso, using Sync in general can be dangerous. Sync can be buggy.\n\nBesides that, like with anything else, if Opera ever crashes, history can get corrupted. If Opera doesn't shut down properly either, its files can get corrupted. For example, make sure to always close Opera yourself before shutting down or restarting your computer. Letting the OS force-close Opera can damage Opera's files.\n\nThere are also cleaner programs like CCleaner that can be set to clear Opera's history.\n\nSince you have signs of corruption at least, I would avoid syncing history for a while if you are. And, I would goto the URL ```opera://settings/clearBrowserData``` and clear browsing history and download history for all time. Then, goto the URL ```opera://about```, take note of the \"profile\" path, close Opera and delete the \"History\" file in the profile folder. That will cause Opera to create a fresh one so that you know you're working with a non-corrupted one.\n\nIf you have file system corruption or your hard drive is going bad, that can cause Opera's History file to lose entries too."
