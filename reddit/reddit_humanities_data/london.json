        "content": "#Hello, welcome to London!  \n*Visiting us?  Moving to study or work?  Brief layover? Moving to a new part of London? Any small questions about life here, if you're new or been here your whole life, this is the place!*\n\nWe get a lot of posts asking very similar questions so this post aims to address some of our most Frequently Asked Questions, and give you a place to ask for assistance.\n\nYour first port of call should be  \n#[the r/london wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/index)\n\nIt includes sections on:\n\n**What should I see and where are the non-touristy stuff and hidden gems?**  \nWe've written about the big must-sees [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/thingstosee) and we highly recommend [TfL's Experiences site](https://tfl.gov.uk/travel-information/visiting-london/experience-london).   \nWe've listed some of our favourite lesser-known stuff [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/secretlondon)\nAnd the cheap/free stuff [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/lowbudget)\n\n**How do I pay for the Tube/bus, and what's an Oyster card?**    \nYou don't pay cash.  You can use a number of contactless payments systems such as your Contactless bankcard (which is widespread in the UK, but maybe not so much elsewhere), Apple Pay, Android Pay, or you can buy an Oyster card and top it up with credit.  See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/gettingaround) for more.\n\n**Where should I live? What's x area like?**  \nHave a look [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/living)  \nIt includes recommended sites to find places to live and rent, and has a section on what particular areas are like.\n\n**How do I get from this place to that place?**  \nUse [Citymapper](http://citymapper.com).  Honestly, we're not shills for them; it's just a really good app and is used by most of the locals on this sub.  \n\n**Is x area safe?**  \nYes. Bad stuff can happen in any large city, but London is generally very safe.  There aren't any no-go zones.  Even under the shadow of terrorist attacks, most Londoners feel safe.  See [our safety page here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/safety) for more.\n\n**Where can I watch the baseball/basketball/football/handegg match?**  \nA comprehensive guide to all London football matches in all leagues can be found at [tlfg.uk](http://www.tlfg.uk). Use [Fanzo](https://www.fanzo.com/en/best-pubs-in-london/3128) to find pubs showing a variety of sports and see our list of other places [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/sport)\n\n**How do I get a UK SIM card for my phone?**  \nAdvice on networks and how to get a SIM card is covered [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/connectivity).  \nIt also includes suggestions of caf\u00e9s and other places where you can get free wifi and do a bit of work.\n\n**Is the London Pass worth it?**  \n[Probably not](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/londonpass)\n\n---\n\nOther subs that you may find helpful:\n\n* /r/LondonSocialClub - Meeting new people for events, activities and/or pints.  \n* /r/IWantOut & /r/UKvisa - Check if you need a visa and how to get one if you want to work here.  \n* /r/LegalAdviceUK - Good for all sorts, especially for questions about landlords and contracts.  \n* /r/UKPersonalFinance - Another goldmine of sage advice.  \n* /r/AskUK - Great for general questions about UK life that aren't specific to London.\n\n---\n\n**Tips for posting:**\n\n**Tell us about you** - If you want us to suggest things for you to do then you need to give us a good idea of what you enjoy. Don't just say \"I like music\", say what type of music. Don't just say you want \"somewhere nice to eat\", say what type of cuisine you like (or don't like). The more specific you are the better, otherwise you'll just get pointed back to the generic guidebooks, blogs and our wiki.\n\n**Tell us your budget** - If you're on a budget then tell us what it is and we can bear that in mind when making recommendations. There's no point in us coming up with ideas for things to do and places to eat if they'll clean out your wallet within the first 5 minutes. Saying you want something \"cheap\" isn't really helpful because what's cheap is entirely subjective.\n\n**Tell us where you'll be based** - Let us know where you'll be staying so that we can give local recommendations.\n\n**Asking about hotels or hostels** - We have homes here so know very little about what the hotels are like. Look on review websites such as TripAdvisor. However, if you say \"I've been looking at these three hotels. Which do you think is the better location?\" then that's the sort of thing we can answer.\n\n**Non-touristy stuff** - There are no secret corners where we hide the good stuff from outsiders! This is one of the most written about cities in the world, so when we want to go to a museum, or gallery, go window shopping, or whatever, we look at the same sources as tourists (listings sites, blogs, etc - see front page of the wiki). \n\n---\n\n^(These weekly posts are scheduled to post each Monday at 00:01.

            "Hello. Me and my partner are moving to somewhere between Sutton and South London, likely around Croydon but who knows. We've rented in other places before and just used RightMove to search, but because I've heard so much about London and the ridiculousness of renting anywhere near, I want to take advice. Is there anything I should know about any part of the renting process that is unique to London and I won't have experienced elsewhere? Anything to watch out for? Or other places to search other than RightMove? Basically, anything you might only have found out by actually renting/living in London. Cheers.",
            "Hi, I'm trying to plan a journey that takes me to Highbury & Islington, but I noticed that the TFL (and National Rail) website refuse to suggest a route including the Victoria Line, even if I put the start point as one of the stations on either side of it.\n\nThe websites don't explain any problems with this station besides \"minor delays\". Is there actually a reason I can't use the tube to get there, or are the websites just screwing up?",
            "Hi! Visiting London for 3 days in early July and need hotel recommendations. I would love to stay at a smaller hotel (think bed & breakfast or Inn), but the biggest thing is it must be within walking distance to major tourist sites. I'm looking at the areas of Holborn/Soho right now. I'm okay with a bigger/chain hotel if it's in the right area and price is right. Budget is <$200 per night. I'm a solo traveler but I've never been big into the idea of hostels and having my own bathroom is a must. TIA!",

        "content": "Hello folks,\n\nJust a follow up and some clarification on how we'll handle Rule 1 during the General Election. \n\nIn general (hurr hurr), election-related stories are national news, so go on UK national subs. Good places for election stories are:\n\n- r/UKPolitics\n- r/UnitedKingdom\n- r/AskUK for your election questions\n- r/GreatBritishMemes for your memes\n\nIf you can find a London-specific angle to the election, though, please do post by all means. Posts that meet our guidance for Rule 1 would be things like the following:\n\n- How possible policies affect London uniquely and specifically, e.g. housing, transport, etc.\n- News about key London battleground seats and how the parties are engaging with them.\n- News about candidates in particular seats (although we'l need balance here).\n- News about any notable election-related events happening in London, such as rallies, protests, or community meetings.\n- Information about hustings, debates, townhalls, and community meetings.\n- Information about organising and campaign in London (again, ideally with balance)\n- AMAs with London candidates ([please contact da mods!](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/london))\n\nWe'll be posting our typical megathreads with reminders to register to vote, how to vote, candidates in each London seat, and so on.\n\nIn fact, **[DO IT NOW. GO REGISTER TO VOTE](https://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote)** (if you haven't already - doesn't matter if you do it twice!)\n\nStories that would not be ok under Rule 1:\n\n- Prime Minister who lives in London calls election\n- Party leader makes national policy speech from location in London\n- TV debate tonight coming from Broadcasting House in London\n- How this party's policies will increase/decrease the cost of living which is a problem in London\n\nThese are better left to the UK subs.\n\nIf we get completely swamped with election threads we may put a rate limit on them and try and achieve some kind of balance. While the election is certainly very important, not everyone wants every sub full of just election posts.\n\nI hope this makes sense, leaving this open for comment for a bit.",

            "Maybe helpful as there's regular posts for people looking for odd jobs: quite a few local councils are looking for extra staff for the elections (just search for your borough + election staff or poll clerk or something like that). Poll clerks for the polling stations, counting staff who'll work overnight, and postal vote openers who start in the days before the election. \n\nNot going to make you an amazing amount of money, but it is a long day so might be a nice bonus for people struggling to find other opportunities?",
