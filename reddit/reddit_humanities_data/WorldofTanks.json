Both RDDT EU and RDDT NA have TS servers with addresses on the sidebar. Anybody is free to use them, you don't have to be in a RDDT clan.\n\nIt's probably best if you follow a template, I've borrowed one below for both adopters and adoptees (use it as is, the Reddit formatting will be as intended that way).\n\n# Templates\n\n    \n**Adoption Wanted**\n    Server:\n    Area of Improvement/Focus:\n    WoT Username:\n    WN8/Win Rate:\n    Tomato.gg/tanks.gg: Profile\n    \n\n\\-\n\n    \n    **Adopting**\n    Server:\n    Area of Expertise:\n    WoT Username:\n    WN8/Win Rate:\n    Tomato.gg/tanks.gg: Profile",

            "I'd like to know how to grind a tank line... do you move crews around or do you keep getting new crews, etc.",
            "Quick question. How do you replace crew skills? Not putting them on a new tank but changing what you've trained on them (perks, etc.)?",
            "I think a hetzer shot me with indirect fire in a game. Not sure about that, but I believe it's possible to target things behind obstacles by using an arc in your shot. I'm curious if that's really part of the game or maybe I just got shot by a hetzer and spg at the same time, or if maybe the hetzer hit my cupola, etc.",
            "Can someone explain what adopting a tomato is?",
            "It depends on how many skills your crew has and if you're keeping the tank you just ground.  At low tiers if you're under 1 fully trained skill, you can retrain your crew to a new tank for free.  I'd keep the  same crew until you pass the first skill or find a tank you want more experience with.  Don't rush through the tanks if you're new, take time to learn the basics.",
            "> Not sure about that, but I believe it's possible to target things behind obstacles by using an arc in your shot. \n\nYes, that's doable. It's part of the game.",
            "There is no skill/WTR based match making in randoms.",
            "Experimental just seems to be a mix between previously implemented equipment. Bond can be hard to buy based on your bonds available/ cw or event rewards. Which need to be upgraded for 3m credits to be a couple of % values higher than standard equipment values. Basically, you just save the highest value eq for the taks you either love playing or t10s. Because t10 to me is the hardest tier to learn and become consistent good at. Just demount the stuff you want every time you play. Is is the most efficient way to maintain credits. With that being said, wot+ is spent with real-time money. So make the decision how you want to dice up equipment. Personally for me I just did the trial for wot plus and if im missing equipment for my e.g obj140 and my leopard 1 has a piece or all the pieces I need. I just go to the Leo 1 demount what I need and apply it to the 140.",
            "I would be willing to discuss basics with you. What heavies / td are a main focus for you right now?",
            "Thanks for your answer. Someone downvoted it, not sure why."

It's just a great feeling when people actually play like a team and I feel like it increases your chance of winning the battle too when there's some sort of appreciation of each other. Please don't let mean comments get to you man, it'll be at least 2k battles until you have somewhat of a grasp of the game. Play tanks with good armor so you can relax a little bit more and not have to worry about stuff as much. I recommend the T110e3 line, it's filled with good vehicles that have high pen.",

I think this community has too much ego, more than other competitive games I've played, everyone thinks they're right and they're just not most of the time, maybe it's the lack of a skill based MM making some players think they're way better than what they are. In my experience I've gotten flamed ingame (percentage wise of encounters) way more by quite below average players (ignorance) or blue-lvl players (dunning kruger) than by average or elite players.",
