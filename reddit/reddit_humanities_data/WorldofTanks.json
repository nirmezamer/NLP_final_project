This seems really smart, and a nice goal to have and work towards but is there any other advice for equipment?\n\nGenerally I just start a line and buy the relevant equipment and it sticks with the tank forever or until class upgrade is required.",
            "Presently I'm playing the T-28 with the 57mm Zis-4, using only standard ammo, working on most of the T4 stuff while grinding battle pass. Looking into the stats on this tank, the most remarkable thing about it is that it has basically no armour. Am I right that this is the most important thing about the tank?\n\n  \nAlso, is there a best site out there that I can go to to learn about the mechanics of the game? Specifically right now I'm interested in learning about guns vs. armor, including HE shells and spaced armour. I know I've seen some good sites in the past but often there's a bunch of links to redirect sites turding up the search results (e.g. a world of tanks page but for a different region, then you get bounced to their splash page for your region)."

            "It is possible. I myself hold a 86% win ratio on a tier IV tank. It is of course nowhere close to a whopping 93%, but I make a lot of stupid mistakes that end up costing games; if not for that, I would be at 90%, easily; besides, I sometimes play in a platoon of 2 instead of a full platoon of 3, or even in solo occasionally\n\n\nAnd there are no OP tanks like PZ V/IV at tier IV. The players' skill level might also be lower at ASIA server, I actually have no idea\n\n\nThere are even months when I have over 90% WR (of course 50+ battles are not comparable to 4k+, but still), no boosting involved\u00a0"
