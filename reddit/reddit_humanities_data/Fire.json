I don't know that I ever properly thanked her for that, but I certainly appreciated the gift.\n\nSo today was my last day of my current, perhaps last job. I cannot seem to stop saying, \"FUCK, YAH!\" with a shit-eating grin on my face.  I don't mind working and like it a lot in the right environment. But I guess the standard question here is, \"how much is enough?\"  I figure that we're in pretty good shape, and should have plenty of happy and healthy years ahead of us, with a strong financial foundation.  \n\nThe equation settles out on the side of shutting down the career. I'll keep an eye out for cool opportunities, but would only take something that seems super interesting and fulfilling. The paycheck won't be the motivator it once was.\n\nMany people are demonstrating that retirement doesn't suck.  I'll try to model that as well. \n\nSo, \"Fuck yah.\" Carry on, and best of success to all!",

We have been renters for the last 7 years.  \n\n35 years in tech, starting with IT outsource support business, software dev, consulting  & management. 2-earner family, and always lived well below our means. Have been fortunate in some investments. Split 1/3 in retirement accounts, 1/3 with a wealth advisor, and 1/3 with a personal investment \"play money\" account which became substantial with a very fortunate return (by far the best of these tranches at 38%/yr over 12 years, but haven't tracked that number of late).\n\nWage Income varied a lot--Took a year off at 32 to ski and travel, then a pre-tirement for 5 years in my 40s, after getting my MBA. Still lots of tech dabbling and learning during that period to scratch the itch and keep current.\n\nWorked 5 more years after that. Did some angel investing in that time which probably set back retirement a couple of years.  I don't recommend angel investing, as getting good deal flow at good valuations seemed relegated to the well-connected, mostly\n\nFortunate and  good-sized bets on tech companies included FB, TSLA, MSFT, Tableau->CRM), along with some dogs. Never touched crypto or any other zero-sum games.\n\nSo I'm relatively late compared to the retirement ages here, but young enough, and have already enjoyed 6+ great life-changing years of pretirement early on.\n\nNow wondering how long it will take to settle into this new idea.",
