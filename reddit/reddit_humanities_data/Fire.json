        "content": "Hi, I\u2019m a 26 year old accounting major in my last year of college and I\u2019ll probably spend about another year working toward my CPA.\n\nI\u2019m not someone with very high ambitions and I\u2019d like to eventually get my finances to the point where I can FIRE. Mostly just for peace of mind, knowing that I won\u2019t have to struggle financially. \n\nIf I only made 50k-75k, would it still be possible to FIRE? \n\nI\u2019d also like to attempt being a landlord by buying and renting out a multi family while keeping one unit for myself. So that I can reduce living expenses and maybe even cash flow it. ",

            "You'll almost certainly make more than that once you have a CPA and some experience. If you can maintain your $50k/yr lifestyle as your salary increases, you'll easily be able to retire early. Save 10-15% now, and then increase it with every raise.",
            "Probably could. Is marriage or kids a possibility down the line though?",
            "FI - financial independence is possible with discipline and long term saving and investing plan. \n\nrE - retire early you may need to work longer or look to moving to low cost location.  Head the advice of the previous post.",

Investing a little from each paycheck now and it grows so much.\n\nWorking for really good companies with good benefits help (matching/ESPP)..but if you pay off debt and sock a little away, it grows. Compounding interest is the key.",
            "Depends on how low you can go with expenses. Buying my home for cash, it was a foreclosure during the 2008 crash, was the best thing I did. Not having to pay rent or mortgage allowed me to funnel that money into my 401k.",
            "Absolutely! My salary is $67k and I will be FIRE in ten years time. You just need to cut out more expenses than other people. Lower cost of living=more savings. You could pick up a side gig for extra income. Maybe during tax season since you're a CPA? I've done that in the past to pay off college & car loans.",
            "I agree, its just that public accounting horror stories sound gruesome, so worst case scenario I end up working at the IRS (which Im fine with if thats what I have to do)",
            "Maybe marriage but definitely no kids. But Im mostly planning for being single",
            "Youre definitely right. I plan to start in public accounting in the tax sector, and if you can survive that youre pretty much on track to make 100k in 5-7 years. But there are tons of horror stories, so if I cant handle it, Ill likely try to find a small firm or maybe apply for the IRS. I did one internship and really enjoyed it, and its also possible to start my own business once I have my CPA. So best case scenario, I could easily clear $250k. But I want to be realistic and slowly work my way up"

Hike length is based on whether the next day is an inside or rest day because of thunderstorms or planned activities like coffee with friends."

Have been fortunate in some investments. Split 1/3 in retirement accounts, 1/3 with a wealth advisor, and 1/3 with a personal investment \"play money\" account which became substantial with a very fortunate return (by far the best of these tranches at 38%/yr over 12 years, but haven't tracked that number of late).\n\nWage Income varied a lot--Took a year off at 32 to ski and travel, then a pre-tirement for 5 years in my 40s, after getting my MBA. Still lots of tech dabbling and learning during that period to scratch the itch and keep current.\n\nWorked 5 more years after that. Did some angel investing in that time which probably set back retirement a couple of years.  I don't recommend angel investing, as getting good deal flow at good valuations seemed relegated to the well-connected, mostly\n\nFortunate and  good-sized bets on tech companies included FB, TSLA, MSFT, Tableau->CRM), along with some dogs. Never touched crypto or any other zero-sum games.\n\nSo I'm relatively late compared to the retirement ages here, but young enough, and have already enjoyed 6+ great life-changing years of pretirement early on.\n\nNow wondering how long it will take to settle into this new idea."
