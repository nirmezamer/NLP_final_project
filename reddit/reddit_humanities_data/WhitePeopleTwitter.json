He had to be reminded to address the question he was being asked, but it should have been knocked on the head within 10 seconds of him talking about other shit. I havent watched the whole thing (you couldnt pay me enough to listen to Trump that long) but Im guessing he did a lot of not answering what he was asked over the course of the debate",

            "This needs to be on every left leaning podcast tomorrow.  Just to enrage this orange turd. I thought this was a joke when I read the post but it's actually there. I want to see him at his next rally denying he shat himself",

            "I'm going to say it: Biden and Obama came in the wrong order. Obama was President when the US needed Biden - a political veteran and experienced lawmaker who knows how to strike bipartisan deals. Obama never had quite the legislative success that would have been necessary. And now that the country needs someone well-spoken and energetic, like Obama, now it's Biden. The US would have been SO MUCH better off with Obama as Biden's VP from 2009 to 2017 than it is now",
            "I think as soon as they said they didnt have live fact checkers it let Trump run loose. He was allowed to say whatever he wanted with zero consequence. He didnt need to be prepared for anything because he could just say whatever came to his mind. Biden trying to come back and say you lied didnt do anything. And Biden trying (and sometimes failing) to remember his truths came off poorly. Im voting Biden because Im voting for more than just him (his cabinet, his policies, the future of fucking democracy and this country). Its the idiots who are undecided who will be swayed by Trumps lies (theyll lap them up because he was confident telling them) and Bidens senior moments. Its a god damn travesty and I just hope enough people show the fuck up and vote",
            "To quote a moderate Conservative from 2023, if Biden were dead Id still vote for him over Trump. That man is the worst human being on the planet.",
            "Just the fact that people can admit he was bad makes it so much different then the cult.",
            "Yup, people thought Romney was a shoe in after the first debate with Obama and then Obama kicked ass on the next two debates and won. Even if Biden never kicks ass at a debate, I'm still voting for him.",
            "Joe Biden surrounds himself with well qualified experts in their fields while Trump surrounds himself with unqualified loyalists. I will vote for any form of Joe Biden over Donald Trump because of that, and because Dems would use the 25th amendment on their own guy if necessary, but Republicans would not.",
            "I dont necessarily disagree. Ill vote for my left ass cheek before I vote for Trump. But will this messaging work on the independent voter who passively pays attention to politics and watched Bidens performance last night? I fear minds were made last night and Biden wont be able to shake it. His hair isnt getting darker, his skin isnt getting smoother, and his brain isnt getting sharper. Even if he yells with high energy at his next campaign event, every public appearance from here on out will remind people of the old man they saw on debate night. If he truly wants to beat Donald Trump in November, he needs to step down and let a younger candidate take the reins.",
            "Its the end of June. Elections are not won or lost in June because the American electorate has the attention span of a dead squirrel",
            "The majority of people voting for Biden are really voting against Trump. We could field any one of 20 candidates that would get those votes.",
            "Almost everything that came out of Trump's mouth during that debate was a lie. He looks right at the camera and said that he did not have sex with a pornstar.. anyone who would hear that and think that he is capable of telling the truth ever is lying to themselves"

            "Biden is the old guy at the company that is kind of slow and awkward but has been there for years, shows up, does his work, tries to be helpful, and maybe cracks a funny joke now and then. Is he as productive or innovate as the new young folk coming in? Probably not but you know hes gonna be there, doing the work. And he already knows everyone in the company.\n\nTrump is the old guy that spends all of his time making sexist and racist jokes at the water cooler and turns in subpar work and HR is just waiting for the inevitable sexual harassment lawsuit from one the new interns so they can finally fire him right before retirement.",
            "It's not so much the \"energy\" it's the fact that he got up and faced the blowback. He took the heat. He kept going. He stayed the course. So what if he needs to get to bed early, Hell I need to get to bed early. I'll take sleepy grandpa who believes in this country 8 days a week over felon, sexual assaulter, braggart with pancake makeup who lies about jesus. Trump is like a state college frat guy dressed up like Tammy Faye Baker",

            "Not saying it was a good performance from Biden (it wasnt), but fuck this country and fuck the media in it that demand perfection from Democrats at all times while Republicans are given a pass and even commended the few times theyre not complete ghouls.",
            "At this point Biden needs to just be an old man that dont give a you know what. You know the old man that says anything and everything without recourse and stop being politically correct. Call 45 a dickhead and a lying POS on live tv and that would help a whole lot than playing nice guy with a guy whos been a national politically incorrect menace for the past 8+ years."
