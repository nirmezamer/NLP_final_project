If Biden on Adderall is what it takes to prevent that, then hook that man up with the rx and giddyup. \n\nThis is a make it or break it moment for us and people need to take a lot more seriously than a lot of them are. This is NOT the election to sit out or do some protest vote just because you don\u2019t like that one policy from Biden. \n\nIf you vote for Trump, you are a racist traitor and a despicable human being full stop, no excuses."
