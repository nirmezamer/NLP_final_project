            "They took entire countries, what's a little artifact or two? \n\nIn India it was not uncommon for a starter Raj era bungalow to be spread over 30 acres with palatial amenities like private lawn tennis courts. These were not the bungalows of governors and viceroys, but of ordinary British tea planters who had barely been to school - who could afford a hundred Indian servants.",

            "As a Brit or perhaps I should say Bri theres some real thin skinned Briish people in hereand anyone expecting stereotypes, whether true or not, to stop are deluded. Brits are poor with bad teeth, bad food and who apparently burgled the planet. Americans are fat, stupid, gun toting murderers who cant afford their own healthcare and Aussies are culture less racists who think theyre the only ones to say the word cunt. Its never going to stop so grow up and get over it, its that simple.",
