            "I would greatly appreciate some help on deciding what deck to use going forward. I\u2019ve been hesitant to upgrade cards, not knowing if I\u2019ll use them in whatever deck I choose to use for a while. My Wild cards and books are starting to overflow so I need to pick a new deck soon in case anything is drastically under-leveled. Between meta changes, the new update, and everything else, I\u2019m not sure what I should go with. Preferably the deck I use would take advantage of the cards that I\u2019ve already gotten to higher levels and my evolution cards. But if it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s not the end of the world.\n\nAny help would be GREATLY appreciated!!\n\nHere\u2019s some background info:\n\n\u2022\t\u2060Level: 39\n\u2022\t\u2060Arena: 17\n\u2022\t\u2060Hotel: Trivago\n\u2022\t\u2060King Tower: Lvl 13\n\u2022\t\u2060Cannoneer & Tower Princess: Lvl 13\n\u2022\t\u2060Dagger Duchess: Lvl 11\n\u2022\t\u2060Baby Goblins: Lvl 9\n\u2022\t\u2060Cards not found (5): Goblin Machine, Goblin Curse, Little Prince, Monk, Archer Queen, Mighty Miner, & Skeleton King\n\u2022\t\u2060Lvl 14 cards: Musketeer, Knight, Arrows & Log\n\u2022\t\u2060Lvl 13 cards: Barbarian Barrel & Goblin Barrel\n\u2022\t\u2060Lvl 12 cards: Valkyrie, Spear Goblins, Dark Prince, Goblin Barrel, Golden Knight, Poison, Goblin Gang, Pekka & Miner\n\u2022\t\u2060Lvl 11 cards: 35 total\n\u2022\t\u2060Lvl 10 cards: 59 total\n\u2022\t\u2060Remaining 2 cards are Lvl 9\n\u2022\t\u2060Evolutions Unlocked (8): Battle Ram, Knight, Archers, Bomber, Wizard, Mortar, Firecracker & Valkyrie\n\u2022\t\u2060Magic Items: Book of cards (2x Common, 2x Rare), book of books, 6 wild evo shards, and also full on all wild cards\n\u2022\t\u2060Player Tag: #VRRPLGUC8",

Wizard gives air coverage that the deck desperately needs while Demolisher is cheaper and can be used on top of troops for death damage.\n\nI can't decide which one to go with, or if there is a better alternative.",

            "The goblin machine seems hilariously overpowered. Honestly they\u2019re all pretty strong i\u2019d say.",
            "Goblin Machine needs an emergency nerf in the worst way. Even when SuperCell releases a cash grab it's not this overpowered. It feels like this just wasn't tested at all\n\nRocket damage reduction by 40% and maybe a 6-8% hit point reduction and we're possibly looking at him being in the realm of balanced",
            "Here are my thoughts on each of the three new cards:\u00a0\n\nGoblin Machine is ridiculous. I know it\u2019s important not to jump the gun over new card releases but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s hard to understand why this troop is comically overpowered. It effectively shoots mini-rockets that do the same damage as fireball but without the spell tower damage reduction, which means that it\u2019s very easy for this troop to do absurd amounts of damage to crown towers without even being near them! Its huge bulk doesn\u2019t make matters any better, letting it go toe to toe with pretty much any melee troop, which are supposed to be this troop\u2019s best answers. Both these attributes let Goblin Machine fulfill pretty much any role, whether it's as a melee or ranged support troop, or as a reliable win condition that does more tower damage than it has any right to. Because of its extreme versatility and power level, it is nearly impossible to answer well, especially when mirrored since multiple Goblin Machines are able to act as their own support, either tanking for one another or blasting down anything that isn\u2019t a Pekka.\u00a0\n\nAs seen during Phoenix\u2019s launch, if a new card causes Mirror to skyrocket in usage, the card in question is likely to be overpowered to an unreasonable level and warrants an emergency nerf ASAP. Goblin Machine is absolutely no exception and will hopefully be addressed over the coming days, though I wouldn't hold my breath if SC kept it OP for a while longer.\n\nHere are a couple of my suggestions to balance this troop:\n\nOption 1: Elixir Cost 5-> 6, Rocket Damage to towers 100% -> 25% (588 -> 147 at lvl 11)\n\nThis is the most straightforward option. Since Goblin Machine is already expensive, bumping its cost to 6 isn\u2019t unreasonable and is probably the single quickest way to balance it. This cost increase is effectively a 17% value decrease, which I think is a significant enough change to curb its power while still keeping it viable. The rocket tower damage reduction puts it in line with poison\u2019s, significantly reducing its tower damage potential while still allowing it to contribute effectively in other roles.\n\nOption 2: Hitpoints -15%, Rocket Hitspeed 3.5sec -> 4sec, Rocket Damage -10%, Rocket Damage to towers 100% -> 25% (530 -> 132 at lvl 11)\n\nIf the Goblin Machine is kept at 5 elixir, a more nuanced approach is needed. The HP nerf would put it in line with other tanky 4-5 cost troops, such as Mighty Miner, Skeleton King, Bowler, and Monk. The reduction to the rocket hitspeed should give people more time to react to the constant rocket barrage and place down their answers, easing the overwhelming pressure that it can apply. The rocket damage reduction would let Magic Archer, Zappies, and Mother Witch survive one of its rockets.\u00a0\n\nWhile Goblin Curse isn\u2019t as overtly busted as Goblin Machine due to its minimal damage,\u00a0 it\u2019s still an absurdly powerful spell that should be looked into as well. In my opinion, the damage amplification is easily the main culprit; a 2 cost spell that causes any troop within its radius to take 50% more damage while turning any troop killed into a goblin makes Goblin Curse far too adept at shutting down pushes with minimal support or weakening opposing defensive troops. I believe the first course of action should be to half its damage amplification effect, so troops only take 25% more damage rather than 50%. This should significantly neuter Goblin Curse and make it far more balanced, but if it's still OP I\u2019d cut its lengthy duration by a second or two.\u00a0\n\nGoblin Demolisher is definitely strong, but time will tell if it needs any changes. As of right now, I find it to be a very fun troop with unique applications without feeling unfair or cheap.\n\nLet me know your thoughts on the new cards below!",
            "Goblin Mech plays like Giant Skeleton, where you should be able to distract it so it doesn't obliterate the tower- but it's ranged. And melee troops can't distract the nuke. \n\nWhen placed at the bridge, you have a very short windo to react with something that can actually tank the mech at the bridge, and the mech still needs to be DPSed. But now the rockets can kill the DPS troops? That melee distraction can be killed by troops behind the mech in safety of their own tower, and you can't set your distraction in the middle of your side as the mech can lock onto tower. \n\nIf the mech gets like 3-4 spaces into your side, it locks on for a free 500 damage hit, and can repeat it at a very short time! It's almost a royal giant who can also punch enemies, and one shot archers trying to shoot it.\n\nI think that a tower damage reduction a la spells/miner is an essential baseline nerf: 20-30% probably. \n\nThis still makes it very hard to counter for equal or positive elixir... Mini Pekka should be able to do it. Mighty Miner can but ewiz stops that. Idragon can't do so because it wont distract. Buildings just get nuked, I don't think any of them can trade, but I may be wrong, and normal buidling placement often brings him within tower nuking range (run him bridge spam with hog? They can't building both effectively). Maybe the rocket needs to be reset by stuns, like sparky- idk if I like this answer but I don't know a good way to address his other problems.",
            "Game feels like a mod\u00a0",
            "Demolisher seems to have the same problem Giant Skeleton used to- I don't think he's as egregious as the other two, but wiping all defenses off the face of the earth- or even stronger is wiping beatdown offenses away- seems like too much. \n\nI'd like his demolition effect to be a building counter- give it the giant skeleton or earthquake treatment. Hit buildings hard and troops not so much.\n\nIt also feels like a lot of damage for a stray on your tower, but I'm partly of mind that I'm just skill issuing when that happens so I don't want to try to address that part.",
            "goblin machine is single handedly the most annoying and no skill card ever added to this game and I've playing for 6+ years. It's one of those cards where the ***delete*** button is way more fitting than the nerf button.",
            "I love the goblin curse as a 2 cost card. I think having ticking damage to delete skarmy (at a slower rate than zap) is a great tradeoff for goblin conversion.\n\n50% damage increase is not balanced at all on a 2 cost card, and I'm not sure that damage number can be balanced for ANY value card. It's just an insane buff to any troop, including things like 3musketeers or pekka. It's about a 4 elixir increase for these. Goblin curse also effects spell damage! Spend 5 elixir on a cursed void and that tank might as well be a skeleton. Not even night witch bats can help much with the poison ticking.\n\nIf we compare to rage, it's a 35% attack speed boost, which has the benefit over straight damage boost by not having the pekka overkill problem and helping against swarms, but not having any effect over some other things like wallbreakers (admittedly curse doesn't effect buildings either). Just off of the DPS increase alone, we could merit a 50% damage increase to cost 3 or more, ignoring the poison or the goblin conversion effect.\n\nMy ideal change would be to split this in two. Give it its initial poison tick damage (pre-nerf), leave it 2 elixir, remove the damage increase. MAYBE it could have a small damage buff like 10-15%. THEN split a damage increase spell into another spell. I don't know what they could do to make it distinct from rage, since attack speed is almost always better than damage increase other than single hit scenarios, other than having a distinct elixir jump.",
            "Machine and Curse are stupid broken. I'm gonna enjoy them as much as I can before their inevitable nerf. It seems to me that every time a card is introduced, it's way stronger than anyone thinks it will be.",
            "i'll be honest i won my first challenge by spamming goblin machine and pekka, the latter is only good rn because it can actually counter two goblin machines(everyone is spamming mirror, this is NOT a good sign). This card needs a HEAVY nerf, i'm more inclined towards option 2, since 5 elixir seems the right spot, but the game could use some more 6 elixir cards. In the end it's all the same shady tactics supercell does every time: release broken card>people pay/make hype about it>slight nerf after a while>ruin card with big nerf>walk away with money it's not something new and they know it.\n\nThe other new cards only need some simple tweaking, but i think demolisher a small hp nerf, and the more problematic one, goblin curse, should only amplify damage by 30% AT BEST, after years of gaming, i realize 50% more damage anywhere is just busted."
