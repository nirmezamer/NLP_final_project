While addressing the login issue that prevented some players from accessing the app, we inadvertently caused a problem with the auto refunder.  \n  \n**What's happening:**\n\n* The auto refunder system is not functioning as intended and is revoking a large amount of magic items unfairly.\n\n**What do you need to do:**\n\n* Nothing. After we fix the issue, your refunded magic items will represent the actual amounts.\n\nWe sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this has caused. Please know that we are actively working on a fix for this issue and greatly appreciate your patience and understanding during this time.",
