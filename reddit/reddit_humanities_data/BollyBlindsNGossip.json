            "buddy i\u2019m not saying you can\u2019t post gossip about punjabi people here. i\u2019m just saying there\u2019s a seperate sub to appreciate all kinds of music",
            "My point wasn't about discussing Punjabi music. I don't post anything about Punjabi artists after my birthday post for Sonam Bajwa was removed(somehow similar posts for South Indian actors are  allowed). Posts about Punjabi artists who are not named Diljit aren't allowed here.\n\nMy comment  is related to comments devaluing Diljit at Jimmy Fallon show. I don't think they would have said same if Arijit Singh was there.  Even political comments against him are allowed."

She clearly despises Aditi for building what\u2019s essentially a new career after shaving a decade off her age and getting tons of work done. I feel for actresses who have to do this to keep their careers. The industry is so misogynistic. But Aditi has also taken the whole \u201cpretending to be a decade younger\u201d thing too far and I can see Richa being like fuck this, I\u2019m not a party to your fake persona.",
