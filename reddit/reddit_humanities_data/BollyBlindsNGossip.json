            "Would Brahmastra be a bigger hit if it was released around this time?",
            "Punjabi movie makers must take risk.\n\nI don't see why Amrinder Gill can't play Lala Hardayal and Diljit as Ajit Singh and make a Ghadr movement movie",
            "I think more than the timing the content was the issue. It never connected emotionally with me, the character arc of Alia was especially disappointing.\n\nAlso, if the romance was at the core concept of the film, they never really built it up for us to root for these characters. The whole thing felt just like a montage which filmmaker use in the dead wife revenge trope. At the end of the day it felt more like a movie that you troll with friends instead of admiring the world building that Ayan might have done.",
            "Nope. A film like Fighter which is comparatively well-made became an average so Brahmastra being a genuinely very inferior product than that would\u2019ve been a disaster. The time it released was the peak it could\u2019ve achieved since that year itself was stale and this was the only \u201cevent\u201d film happening that year.",
            "It would've been trolled even harder now, had it been released after kalki",
            "After people got the taste of Pathaan, Jawan, Animal etc, hardly, infact comparison with them would hit it harder.\n\nAyan Mukharjee can't do mass appealing cinema, it was him, not the timing of release.",
            "They anyway juiced Ranbir Alia wedding and pregnancy to the max at that time- despite that it failed. Abhi toh woh bhi nahi milta ulta baaki better films se compare hote",
            "Why is nobody talking about inaccuracies in Kalki regarding Mahabharata??Either Nag Ashwin deliberately takes liberties for his plot or he genuinely doesn't know. Either way it doesn't work.\n\nIt's a genuinely likeable movie and the VFX other than some sequences is very good. The fight sequences are executed well.\n\nI want to make a post about this but I think it will get deleted by mods.",
            "Which Historical personality deserve RRR type of movie?\n\n\nMy pics\n\n\nAjit Singh(highly underrated movie. Didn't even feature in the legend of Bhagat Singh)",
            "Nope"

            "Just watched the movie in telugu. The first one hour was a drag but the rest of it came through and whoa, it was captivating. The sequences between Prabhas and Big B gave goose bumps.\n\nThe cameos are a visual treat. They kept giving.",
            "I haven't said this before, not even once but yeah Nag Ashwin Cooked.\u00a0\nThe movie comes with its flaws,\u00a0 which I am ready to overlook for its pros any time of the day.\u00a0",
            "It\u2019s amazing to watch. I am so happy that sci fi with such vfx are being made in India. Yes the first half is a drag, yes some vfx are bad but everyone was sincere and it reflects. And the screen presence of Bachaan Sahab is just amazing.",
            "Omg I am mindblownnnn! What a movie.",
            "Not the greatest, but absolute Paisa vasool, never seen such visual design and VFX from any Indian movie, plus the last 30 min and Mahabharat scenes are the highlight of the movie. Kamal haasan as the villain is great as well.",
            "those who have good knowledge of Mahabharat will love this movie because of the details and references.",
            "No spoiler please, just want to ask who dubbed Amit ji in Telugu version? I am confused between Telugu and Hindi version (I don't mind subtitles to be clear)",
            "Just watched the movie - the first half was slightly draggy but still had great world building and introduction of the main characters. The second half was much better and the climax was simply spectacular!! Such a treat to watch on the big screen - truly loved everyone\u2019s acting, especially the magnificent Amitabh Bachchan and luminous DP \u2764\ufe0f Happy for Prabhas too!!",
            "Being totally familiar with the heroes of the Mahabharat helps to truly get into this movie. For me, Amitabh ji stole the show. The animations were enjoyable and I left the theater excited for the next installment. Disha patanis cameo was a solid waste of a good 10-15 minutes, you can time your popcorn and toilet break for her entry because it's random and so disconnected from the main story. Deepika was glowing, it's hard to take your eyes off the screen when she's there. Overall I am thoroughly entertained and cannot wait for the next installment. Watched it in Telugu, but planning to re-watch in Hindi to see how different then dialogues and dubbing etc are. \nEdited to add:I feel sad I forgot to write about Brahmanandam sir. I expected him to elicit the most laughter but I weakly chuckled once at best. Could've been much better utilised."
