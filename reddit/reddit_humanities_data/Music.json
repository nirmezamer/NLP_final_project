            "I really wish theyd played Jonas, Holiday, and especially, Only In Dreams.",
            "Weezer gets too much hate when really their only crime is releasing too many albumshalf which are great and the other half not so much. But Rivers has written an insane amount of catchy tracks and they can shred too. If they condense their discography a bit, its extremely solid.",

        "content": "**It already exists**\n\nAtleast in very produced \"crisp\" sounding genres. I mean, there's already AI generated Djent and EDM that exists right now that sounds almost identical to any generic modern Djent or Metalcore or poppy EDM artist. But do you actually know anyone who GENUINELY listens to this??? Do you know anyone who's favourite Djent song is an AI generated song, or someone who actually listens to AI generated music and has an AI generated YouTube channel as their \"favourite band?\". Someone whose top tracks on spotify are ai generated?\n\nI think for an overwhelming majority of people the answer is \"no\". Because while we like music, what we also like equally as much are MUSICIANS. We like the idea that a band had intention behind this album and is working on a growing discography. We like learning about the members, following our favourite popstars or our favourite niche indie artists. Someone AI generating a Bring Me The Horizon song doesn't bring the same excitement as the band releasing a track themselves. There's plenty of AI generated features of famous rappers on random soundcloud tracks, but no Kanye West or Drake fan is genuinely interested in an AI imitation of those guys.\n\nYes, it may replace the background music used in a Colgate commercial, or a 24/7 lofi livestream, but I don't see any universe in which any scene of music's fans will genuinely start listening to AI generated music over actual human bands or artists in the scene.  Obviously some people will, but the idea that a majority of people will stop listening to human music because they can just generate AI music is absurd to me.\n\nIt's the same reason you rarely see someone hanging up an AI generated painting on their wall, or the same reason people commission artists to paint their wedding portraits sometimes even though a photo is technically \"better\" at capturing the moment. The novelty of a human creating a piece of art is what gives it half its value.\n\nAudio and visual media that doesn't exist as \"art\" (commercial art, the rendering of CGI for a specific shot, background music for commercials or malls, presentation slides, etc.) may be almost entirely replaced because they exist in commercial settings and have tasks that need to be as efficient and cost-effective as possible, but \"art\" that seeks to be artistic will always have a thriving human scene, because it's just more interesting when it has people behind it, and we can see that happening right now.",

            "The reason is that AI is shit at making music. And while the imitation may get more uncanny, it's never going to be able to actually feel feelings and communicate them. It's a cyborg wondering \"what...izzzz ....luvvvvv??\"",
            "It mashes up everything that's already been done, so it's never going to have that spark of originality that makes you love a song. It'll be like that generic stuff music documentaries use when they can't afford to license the artist's actual music. And that is indeed dire.",
            "Its also mines popular examples to mimic and if the internet and social media media has taught us anything the past decade, its that populism =/= quality",
            "Thing is (at least IMO) an audience isn't restricted to liking only AI or only human made music (or whatever hybrid of the two comes along). I say this as an artist and musician.\n\n What I listen to as background noise whilst doing a workout or cleaning my house isn't always the same thing as what I want to see at a live show or headline a festival. I don't always need to connect emotionally to every part of my life's backing track. In many cases however, I do seek out that connection which AI doesn't provide. At the end of the day our audiences have room for both.",
            "Its completely indistinguishable from any of the generic pop music thats been pumped out of industry studios for the last 25 years, specifically when they started using auto tune in everything and quantisation in Pro Tools became standard practice. \n\nThe industrys hubris is will be the death of it.",
