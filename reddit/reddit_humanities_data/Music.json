            "I got the email earlier today, it was confusing. So you're raising my price... but then you're also offering me a cheaper plan that's the same price i used to pay, with all of the same functionality i was previously using, but i need to manually select it... the \"tyranny of the default setting\" ladies and gentlemen. Spotify just made hundreds of millions of dollars from people who don't check their email and don't care about audiobooks.\n\n\nIs this a \"dark pattern\"?",
            "Take out everything except music. We golden.",
            "Spotify launched the new audiobooks option and automatically migrated every user to it, in order to claim subscribers were paying for a \u201cbundle.\u201d It was a crass attempt at a workaround to avoid paying songwriters and music publishers a couple hundred million dollars this year. And now songwriters and publishers are suing the bejeezus out of them. Source: I know things. Go back to the music only tier because it\u2019s a buck cheaper, sure, but also because it will ultimately substantially help songwriters.

            "Could we also make one without Joe Rogan, so Spotify can save whatever gazillion dollars? It feels like not paying billions for a single podcaster would help \"to become a profitable\".\n\nI don't know the stats, but i doubt that many people come to Spotify for podcasts or audiobooks.",
            "Where's hifi? Lossless audio..... Still don't have it.\u00a0",
            "I'm not sure if I just haven't been paying attention and am somehow grandfathered in, but I'm still on a Premium Individual plan that seems to come with Hulu - the new plan comparison layout doesn't seem to show hulu on that plan moving forward when the price goes up, and it looks like I'd lose that along with the audiobooks thing if I downgrade to the basic individual. Anyone know what the story is with that?",

Or \"it's 2024, nobody wants this now\". \n\nAm I the only one who still goes back to 90\"s and 2000\"s rap and thinks about how I wish it was still the same? Hounding feels like a taste of the old days, with some funky, up best tunes and his classic slim shady lyrics to go with it, to this day I still throw his old music on before I touch newer stuff, I don't understand the mentality. \n\nCan someone from the other side explain? I don't get it, old slim shady is the goat. ",

            "People don\u2019t actually say what they want, they just say what they think is popular. Stop listening to almost everyone is my best advice. If Slim Shady being back pops off, you bet TikTok will lose its mind and turncoat.",
            "The Eminem discourse online has been an absolute dumpster fire for over a decade. Just ignore everything and keep listening to what you like. While non fans scream about whatever they feel like today as Em keep slaughtering records.",
            "Because they're wrong. Slim shady era is OP as fuck",
            "People forget,  other than the Slim Shady LP, he really only had one Shady song per album. It was the lead single to generate excitement and get on MTV, and then the rest of the album was Eminem spitting fire.  I think he'll stick to the formula with the new album.",
            "Slim Shady era can never come back. That was his era of popping pills and not giving a fuck. Man is 51 years old and can\u2019t really sell the \u201cidgaf\u201d attitude to his music like he did with the Slim Shady era. Sure he still has the \u201cidgaf\u201d attitude but you can tell it\u2019s more mature and honed rather than the wildcard \u201cslim shady\u201d persona when he was younger.\n\nCan\u2019t live in the past and expect an artist to stay the same, they all evolve or they will eventually \u201cfall off\u201d. Plus i don\u2019t think any real fan expects Eminem to go back to his Slim Shady era because it will eventually become monotonous and get stale real quick. Especially in this day and age when everyone is onto the next very quickly.\n\nRegardless of all that he will always remain a top tier lyricist."
