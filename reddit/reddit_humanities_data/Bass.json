            "Is it normal for a brand new bass to have Vaseline (or some other sort of gel?) on the gears of the tuners?",
            "I use a helix floor for direct gigs and a mark bass little Marcus 800 plus 2x10 cab for non-direct gigs plus minimal pedals. The helix is so versatile if you use ears and have a quiet stage. A stomp plus di would be a great rig. I know a lot of players will do stomp + compressor + di and have a lot of success with it. I have the floor since I also play guitar a lot, and it\u2019s wonderful for bass.",
            "I don't believe so, no. Any lubricant used at the factory should be cleaned up after so that's really weird. What brand is it?",
            "After a double header gig weekend, I'm thinking about streamlining away from an amp + cab to something that;ll fit into a gig bag.\n\n  \nLooking at the Line 6 HX Stomp, the Ampeg SGT-DI, and the Darkglass Microtube infinity after some pedalboard peaking and internet scrolling. I know these are pretty different, but curious if anyone has transitioned away from a traditional amp/cab setup and feels good about these as DI options",
            "Got some new strings in:  \nLa Bella gold flats for 5 string\n\nLa Bella copper white tapewounds for 5 string\n\nI've had Sadowsky blacks on this bass (as my first stringset on my first bass, a Cort Curbow V) for about 8 months now. I was considering an upgrade of my bass for a while, but decided that's an investment for much much later on than now, since bass is basically my 3rd or 4th instrument. So, I figured it would be fun to \"scratch the tone itch/timbre curiosity itch/GAS itch\" by buying some unique strings. My sadowsky set is still good imo, so I'll have 3 stringsets at my disposal, I guess.\n\nAnyway.... I'm very curious about these strings and I'm looking forward to hearing them. No time to put them on just yet! I can't decide which to try out first.\n\nI'd be willing to leave a review, but I've only been playing bass for less than a year so I don't know if that would be helpful to very many people lol."

            "No worries about damage but switching back and forth daily would drive me nuts - this is the best excuse ever to buy another bass.",
            "Nah, you'll be fine. My main player goes between Eb and drop C# multiple times whenever I practice, and up to E standard whenever I fancy playing along with something different. Other than a little difference in string tension and *maybe* the feeling that a little truss rod tweak would make a certain tuning play a tiny bit better, then there's no issues.\n\nMaybe if you were going from standard to BEAD constantly or something there'd be a bunch of reasons to get a second bass (or maybe a 5 string). Half a step up or down though? You're good.",
            "I retuned a bass from standard to Eb to Drop D to D standard everyday for years. No issue at all.",
            "Half a step down? No.",
            "No.  These things are stronger than you think",
            "lol no.  If you\u2019re worried about it have your bass setup for  flat tuning but it\u2019s not going to require a trust rod adjust just because of half step tuning.",
            "If you like your action *super* low you might find having slightly less string pull on the neck could get a bit fret buzzy when tuning down, but if you're low but not crazy low (or anything higher) it should be fine.\n\nMy experience of doing this is your strings will lose their bright zingy new string sound a bit quicker, but you won't damage anything.",
            "Only matters if you down tune really far, say a whole step or lower, and keep it that way for months on end. If you down tune for only a day or a week, you'll be fine",
            "For convenience, get yourself a pitch shift pedal. Digitech drop is a pretty standard one, HX One has pitch shift on it plus a ton of other stuff to justify the purchase a little more. Personally I use my HX stomp \"simple pitch\" effect when I'm practicing and don't feel like switching basses.",
            "I don't know about damage per se, but changing tuning changes string tension and could result in needing to make a truss rod adjustment. I changed strings on an acoustic of mine to Nashville strings. While I elected not to make a truss rod adjustment, I was able to measure a .005 increase in the bow of the neck due to the lesser tension of the Nashville strings."
