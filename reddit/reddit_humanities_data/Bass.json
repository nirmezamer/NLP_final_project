            "Based on the title it seems like the PERFECT spot to ask my question.\n\nTo set the stage (so to speak)... I'm a drummer. It's been the **only** instrument I've played. I've **always** wanted to learn another instrument. Next month I turn 55. I've decided I'm going to learn how to play the bass guitar (and properly learn to read sheet music... you know how most drummers are, they can only read one line \ud83d\ude09).\n\nAs I was starting my research I was browsing through the [this page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bass/wiki/faq/#wiki_i_want_to_learn_to_play_bass._where_do_i_start.3F) and this subreddit. The common phrase I see (paraphrased) is \"how does it feel to play\"? \ud83e\udd14\n\nSo, here's my question... if you are new to the instrument, will you notice a significant difference between let's say a $100 Rogue special (see, I've been reading up \ud83d\ude09) and a good quality bass?\n\nAnd, for the record, this past weekend I believe I've found a beautiful candidate for purchase next month. That color just CALLED out to me. \n\nThanks. \ud83d\ude0e\ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffb\n\n[https://ibb.co/prq676v](https://ibb.co/prq676v)",
            "Audio-Technica ATH-M40x vs ATH-M50x? I'm leaning more towards the M40x.\n\nDoes the bluetooth adapters perform just as well? Is there any lag?\n\nOr should I just put up the cash for the bluetooth version ATH-M50xBT2?",
            "How do bass players in doom/doom-adjacent bands tune so low on stock instruments? Obviously you need thicker strings but I've never seen a nut on a 4st that can fit a .130. Are y'all modifying them or something?",
            "I\u2019ve been having a problem with my amp and was wondering if anyone experienced this. When the bass is plugged into the amp, the sound will sometimes cut out for a second or two. I assumed that meant my cable was messed up, but when i plug headphones into my amp as well and use the same cable for my bass, there is no cutting out of sound. Would that mean the cable is not the issue and there\u2019s something loose on the amp itself?",
            "Hey! I have two amps currently, but I really only need one. Which one do you all think is worth keeping?\n\n  \nOption 1: Newish Fender Rumble 25 1x10, I like that it is light weight and easy to transport because of that, I also like that there is a serviceable overdrive built into it but it has less options for EQing, but with my pre-amp, not the biggest deal.\n\nOption 2: Older Acoustic B20 1x12, this one comes with a low-mid and high-mid EQ knobs and sounds a little more solid, not more full, but like more predictable in general if that makes sense but she heavy. \n\n  \nThank you for your help!",
            "Weston Thunder 1 1982\n\nI started playing bass recently and am looking to get my own bass as I\u2019m currently using a borrowed one.\n\nAnyhow, i found a  Weston Thunder 1 1982  that seems to be in a good condition for about 320\u20ac (with original hard case) and I\u2019m thinking of buying it because, honestly it looks amazing. \n\nBut I realize looks are not everything. \n\nDid anyone of you own one? Would it be good for a beginner? \n\nI have no idea what exactly I want to play in the future so I was wondering how does it sound and how versatile would you say it is?",
            "My daughter has expressed interest in learning bass.  She is 13 and wants to do some sort of online class at home.  She played upright in orchestra so she understands the basics but she has never messed with amplification or frets.\n\nI'm looking for recommendations for an online course or lesson series as well as a beginner instrument.  Should she get a full-sized based or something a little smaller?",
            "Where do you learn all your words? Just, I can't understand what people say on here, all the terms are waffle, without people to learn this stuff from, where do you learn it?",
            "How do you get judged? Like, I believe im now good enough to play along to something and be judged, as a practicer/starter level thing i think rather than \"oh im the don dude check this shit\", thats not me at all, but what do you do if you aren't band hunting or have a large social/family group to tell you to turn it off/up/more chorus? It's important to know if ultimately you're actually improving and also just as important to see if your just deluding yourself.",
            "Yes."

            "After a double header gig weekend, I'm thinking about streamlining away from an amp + cab to something that;ll fit into a gig bag.\n\n  \nLooking at the Line 6 HX Stomp, the Ampeg SGT-DI, and the Darkglass Microtube infinity after some pedalboard peaking and internet scrolling. I know these are pretty different, but curious if anyone has transitioned away from a traditional amp/cab setup and feels good about these as DI options",

            "Got some new strings in:  \nLa Bella gold flats for 5 string\n\nLa Bella copper white tapewounds for 5 string\n\nI've had Sadowsky blacks on this bass (as my first stringset on my first bass, a Cort Curbow V) for about 8 months now. I was considering an upgrade of my bass for a while, but decided that's an investment for much much later on than now, since bass is basically my 3rd or 4th instrument. So, I figured it would be fun to \"scratch the tone itch/timbre curiosity itch/GAS itch\" by buying some unique strings. My sadowsky set is still good imo, so I'll have 3 stringsets at my disposal, I guess.\n\nAnyway.... I'm very curious about these strings and I'm looking forward to hearing them. No time to put them on just yet! I can't decide which to try out first.\n\nI'd be willing to leave a review, but I've only been playing bass for less than a year so I don't know if that would be helpful to very many people lol.",
            "I use a helix floor for direct gigs and a mark bass little Marcus 800 plus 2x10 cab for non-direct gigs plus minimal pedals. The helix is so versatile if you use ears and have a quiet stage. A stomp plus di would be a great rig. I know a lot of players will do stomp + compressor + di and have a lot of success with it. I have the floor since I also play guitar a lot, and it\u2019s wonderful for bass.",

        "content": "Just got done playing a gig with the Darkglass AO 500, and unfortunately, it kept cutting out and shutting off on me mid-set. It would be one thing if this were a first-time thing, but this is the third time.\n\nAbout a year ago I decided to plunge into the world of class D heads and took a bet on the AO 500.\n\nThe first night I plugged it in for a practice it shut down on me after about 30 mins. I ended up contacting support and they were great, I was told that it had something to do with the fan and overheating. I sent the amp in for repairs, which was returned to me promptly.\n\nPlugged the *repaired* amp in, and it was running great during practice until it shut off on me again. I contacted support again and this time they ended up swapping out the whole unit for a brand new one. I was stoked.\n\nThe *new* unit was great for a few months, it got me through practices and a couple of gigs with no problem, until tonight. Mid-way through the set the amp kept cutting out and visibly turning off and on with a strong burning smell. I was able to finish the set after tweaking some knobs and switching my active bass to passive for the rest of the set, but by the last song it was shutting off again.\n\nI am more than bummed out, I liked this amp but after tonight I think I need to lay it to rest and get something else.\n\nI am looking for some recommendations on a replacement, I'd like to stick with class D for the portability but I'm apprehensive. Does anyone have any thoughts on the Ampeg Venture V7 or something similar?\n\nTLDR; Darkglass AO 500 is unreliable for me and I am looking for a change.",

            "I'm under the impression that Darkglass stuff is fairly reliable, seems odd to have multiple units fail. Can you elaborate on your band situation? Are they loud? Are you typically running the head at max/near max volume?",
            "This is very bizarre.\n\nThere is definitely a wide spread issue in one or more batches of darkglass amps caused by overheating. It happened to my Microtubes 500 as well, the fan was literally not kicking in. However, I sent it for repair and now (touches wood) it works perfectly, and the fan very much kicks in. \n\nSeems weird that it happened to you across multiple heads and after repair!! Very unlucky.",
            "Yeah for sure, I agree that it\u2019s also a bit strange. My band isn\u2019t particularly loud or heavy. I\u2019d say we are an indie rock/alternative. I usually run the master at 11 -12 o\u2019clock with the mids scooped a bit on the eq, and I have the on board compressor on. \n\nThe gear I run to it is either a Fender Meteora active bass or Fender P bass to a tc electronic polytune pedal into the amp. And then I have the amp sending to two tc electronic bc208 2x8 cabs."
