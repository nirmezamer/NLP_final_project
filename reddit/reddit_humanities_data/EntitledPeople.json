She decides to sit on a couch and has me put her wheelchair by it. \n\nFriend, Dana lies down on couch and I put my jacket over her. I am nursing a sore knee Dana tells me to use her wheelchair as support if I need it. \n\nI see a water refill station nearby and tell Dana about it. She said we should refill our water bottles. We went through a lot of water during the convention and we need it.\n\nSince my knee is really sore I use the wheelchair like a walker to help steady myself. I am filling Dana's water bottle and I get a tap on my shoulder. There is some guy standing by me.\n\nGuy: Hey, you need to put that back. It's not yours.\n\nMe: of course not, my friend is over there and said I could use it.\n\nI am setting Dana's bottle in the seat of the wheelchair, then fill mine. Guy suddenly decides to take it from me and wheels it back to my friend who is on the couch.\n\nMe: Hey dude, she said I need to fill the other bottle\n\nGuy: The wheelchair is hers.\n\nMe: There is another bottle in the back.\n\nGuy: Then come and get it, you're not disabled.\n\nMe: it isn't yours either, so let me refill the bottle\n\nGuy: then get it. You can walk.\n\nDana: No she can't! She left her cane in the hotel room. Let her use my wheelchair please.\n\nGuy ignores her and continues to put the chair back and locks the wheels so I can't move it. \n\nGuy: I am just helping.\n\nDana: you need to mind your own business!\n\nGuy: she shouldn't use your equipment.\n\nDana: this is seriously none of your business, OP, can you help me back into the chair.\n\nI hobble over and I get shoved away.\n\nGuy: I am right here I can help.\n\nDana: Not you, I don't know you.\n\nI am able to help unlock the chair and help her back in. She and I are frustrated and decide to go back to the hotel room.\n\nWe are both mad because we just wanted to relax and get some water. \n\nEntitled guy thinks I am stealing my own friend's wheelchair. He acts like he knows what's best and doesn't realize that he is being the entitled one. ",

One day out grocery shopping a neighbour took it upon himself to call the cops for us illegally parking in a handicap spot and using a stolen wheelchair.
