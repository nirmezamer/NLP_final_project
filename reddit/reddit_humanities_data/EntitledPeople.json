        "content": "This happend to me a few years ago but thought I\u2019d share with all the plane seat switching drama these days.  I 30\u2019s M at the the time was heading from NYC to Denver for some skiing.  I was flying by myself and meeting up with some friends in steamboat.  The flight to denver is a good 4-5 hrs and it was a friday and I was a surgical resident so pretty tired, so I had booked an aisle seat as it\u2019s my preferred seat as i\u2019m 6\u20192\u2019\u2019.   After I get into my seat 2 guys who are friends and have had some drinks sit next to me.  A little later another friend of there\u2019s who is clearly wasted  shows up and is assigned to the middle seat across the aisle.   He approaches me and asks if we can switch.   I tell him that I don\u2019t mind switching seats but only if it\u2019s for another aisle seat as there is no way i\u2019m sitting in the middle seat.   The guy loses his shit and becomes apoplectic screaming at me that i\u2019m a fuckin asshole and telling me to go fuck myself.  I just ignore him and he finally sits down.  His two friends understand where I\u2019m coming from and apologize for their friends behavior as he has too much to drink.   Nevertheless for the next 30 mins of the flight this guy gives me dirty looks and keeps flicking me off.   The guy was super sloppy and I probably could have gotten him kicked off the flight but I just didn\u2019t really want to deal with it.  I mostly ignored him but did flick him off a few times and told him to go fuck himself as well.  Pretty childish.  A couple hrs into the flight he sobers up and apologizes to me.   ",

            "Wow. What an absolute asshole. \n\nI have never sent food back in a restaurant. Granted, I've never been served burnt food, but the staff did get my order wrong a few times. Eg. There were no mushrooms with my cream and mushroom chicken and another time where I ordered fruit filled crepes and got chocolate ones instead. I did point out these errors but said it was fine as I could see they were in the weeds. The place that forgot my mushrooms took the cost of my salad off the bill for not sending back the chicken and the restaurant that served the crepes offered to remake them but I told them not to worry. The owner came out to apologize with a free glass of wine. And yes, on both occasions I still left a tip. At the end of the day, the food was still good and the service was impeccable. \n\nNo, I'm not a pushover. I just don't care to kick up an unnecessary stink. Also, we're frequent diners at many of our local establishments and I'd rather see staff happy to see us come back rather than roll their eyes thinking, \"Oh shit, not these assholes again.\"\n\nI have seen this level of entitlement like the sumo wrestler and the \"burnt\" pancakes. It's not only annoying to staff but guests too. It's a pain in the ass to be sitting next to entitles assholes at the next table so we usually ask them to tone it down and treat the staff with a little respect.",
