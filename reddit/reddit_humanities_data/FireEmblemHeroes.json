            "Free arena summon got me my first Lene, who is also my 1000th hero. Exciting to reach that milestone.",
            "Do we know for sure that the next emblem hero will be blue?",
            "I dropped a Felix and wondered if I should fodder his a/s finish to OG!Lysithea. She already have special spiral 4, not any idea on wich special to give her, though. Any idea ?",
            "Finally, I got bonus doubler 4 in HOF and Marth is done. I'd been trying to find it for days.  Caeda was already finished. Fallen Maria is good too, but I suppose I can fish around for another C skill.",
            "I'm trying to decide who to spark on the AHR Bottom 8 banner. There's no unit I don't have that I particularly want to use, so I'm mostly just looking for a good fodder choice. On my way to the spark, I got a WEdelgard (who I wanted to give her Prime skill to Ashnard), a Veyle, a LCamilla, and a NYSeidr. Both Sanaki and Gullveig are obviously great fodder options with their precombat damage skills, and Veyle is also an option to finally buff up my OG Micaiah. Or I can grab another Edelgard to give Haar Atk/Def Prime or Kurthnaga the ploy skill or someone else her armored special? I could also grab an Altina merge, though I'm not sure I'll be trying to +10 her",
            "I forgot to finish TT and missed out on ~3 orbs... probably forgot to reclaim the heroes's journey reward too. The game's kinda losing its steam since there's nothing engaging to do with your barracks of hundreds, of which most are outdated and unusable.",
            "I put BoL4 on my attuned Caeda. With her being on the banner tomorrow, I plan to pull as many as I can. Are there any other major skills I should put on her before I start throwing her attuned orb around like candy? I considered LF4 of course, but unless there's a way to get LF1-3, it'd end up making it so you could only get LF4 and BoL4, right?",
            "Why is it when I fight emblem ikes they are basically unkillable walls of death that nothing can touch but when I use my emblem Ike he folds like paper to like half the units in the game",
            "Are there any particular units that would want the resonance skill? Already pulled the new celica but wondering if I should get another for the skill fodder",
            "Planning on giving my +7 summer Claude Deadly Miasma (eventually with Flared Sparrow too), how good is Deadly Miasma on him? Hes practically tied to a Menace skill but mine needs some real updating"

            "Hello all - hopefully you folks have had a pleasant June and my condolences to my fellow Americans for... whatever the hell the last 48 hours have been.  Good lord.\n\nAnyway, setting aside irl politics whinging for its whimsical fantasy counterpart, we've got a remarkably green (inexperienced, not favored over lances) lineup of swordies duking it out - a bit of a rarity nowadays for a non-Engage centric selection.  We've got 5 singletime participants and 3 rank newbies, with only Mareeta (she managed a somewhat dominant win in mid 2020 while her status as a premier godsword was still in effect) and Felix (he managed a finals berth in Santa gear with a surprising win over Winter Altina and a... less surprising loss to Hilda) making it out of R1.  Speaking of Felix, as both the most modern/powerful unit here and our reigning Men's CYL runner-up, he seems like an obvious frontrunner pending any results, though Ayra and Marisa especially seem like possibilities on the ladies' side.  However, given a solid half of our gauntlet champs this year have started out as 7th seeds or worse (Julian, Gharnef, and Nergal)... It's probably best to stay somewhat unnattached lmao :P\n\nGood luck and have fun, y'all :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n/=====================================\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the sake of posterity and future projects, I would like to document the Top Scoring players for each voting gauntlet team, ideally in picture form. Maintaining 8 separate accounts just to check scores is often infeasible, so any help you fine folks can provide is greatly appreciated. If youre interested in contributing, here are the required steps:\n\n1. Reply below with your team selection if you would like to help out.  If a team is already claimed (struck through in the section below), there's no harm in still volunteering to future-proof against a wide swathe of mistakes, mishaps, and malfunctions.\n2. Pop open the Voting Gauntlet event tab sometime after reset and prior to selecting your Round 2 (or 3) team. I, by default, provide a reminder ping here around FEHs reset timing for each round (6 am UTC during DST/7 am UTC otherwise), but I can adjust that timing as necessary.  If you would prefer an alternate notification method (DMs/chat on an assortment of sites including Reddit/Twitter/tumblr/Discord), please message me so we can work out the specifics.\n3. Click the \"Round 1 Rank\" button in the middle and switch from Current Standing to Top Players.\n4. Scroll all the way up to the top and snap a picture. Realistically, only the Top 4 players scores + IGNs are necessary for any future tasks, but it is possible to fit the Rank 5 finisher as well by slightly scrolling down until you partially cut off the \"Rank 1\" text [like so](https://imgur.com/a/8P14Kzn).\n5. Post a link below. Whatever site you host the image on works for me, but please try to not delete it for at least a month or two in case I'm slow downloading them locally.  Ideally, please try to do a permanent link if possible though.\n\nI'm also interested in the scores/rank of anyone who finishes in the Top 100 of the Total Rank  (colloquially Cumulative) stat, though that doesnt become relevant until the tail end of Round 3. These are the [three types of pics](https://imgur.com/a/Y2BcM9X) of interest with more detailed explanations if youre curious.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n/=====================================\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor this gauntlet, my R1 team is probably going to be **Team Karel** (Say'ri if the match is promising), but I have multiple alts available to fill in any last minute representation gaps.  Currently, the following Round 1 teams are unclaimed:\n\nKarel | Felix | Navarre | Kagetsu | Ayra | Mareeta | Marisa | Say'ri\n\nAnyone who contributes gets credited in the main google sheet (linked below), so feel free to still help out if your team is already spoken for. One can never have too many back-ups for a project like this :)\n\nI should be able to cover all R2/R3 teams myself without too much trouble, but any and all pics you are willing to provide there as well is greatly appreciated (the same suite of notification options are still available).  In the event I need help with a particular match, Ill try to let you know ~24 hours beforehand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n/=====================================\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next few sections feature the #1 player(s) and a link to the main source picture, (hopefully) updated as they come in; the full Top 4/5s can be found written up in a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1le0bhMSAhD3qpg5ppuPly8tzXYGrLes2qxjd6731NP8/htmlview), along with what documentation I have for previous gauntlets.  If you have any past results that arent featured there (or speak Japanese and notice any errors with names as I transcribed them), please shoot me a message or post them in \\[this thread\\] - December 2021 to the present is near complete for Army Ranks, but earlier gauntlets (and 99% of all Cumulative Ranks) are patchy at best.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[Round 1\\]\n\n-  Team Karel #1 Score: \n\n-  Team Felix #1 Score: \n\n-  Team Navarre #1 Score: \n\n-  Team Kagetsu #1 Score: \n\n-  Team Ayra #1 Score: \n\n-  Team Mareeta #1 Score: \n\n-  Team Marisa #1 Score: \n\n-  Team Say'ri #1 Score: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[Round 2\\]\n\n-  Team ??? #1 Score: \n\n-  Team ??? #1 Score: \n\n-  Team ??? #1 Score: \n\n-  Team ??? #1 Score: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[Round 3\\]\n\n-  Team ??? #1 Score: \n\n-  Team ??? #1 Score: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[Cumulative/Total Rank Top 100\\]\n\n-  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n/=====================================\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you so much to all who have helped this month, currently including:"
