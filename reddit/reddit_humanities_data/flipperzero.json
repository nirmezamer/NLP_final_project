We're actively working on removing them, but please remember that **the only official stores for Flipper Zero are listed here:** [**https://flipperzero.one/how-to-buy**](https://flipperzero.one/how-to-buy)**.**\n\nAll the sales are done through store webpages, **if you have to DM someone to buy the device from us - you're getting scammed.** All our social accounts are listed at the bottom of [our website](https://flipperzero.one), anything that's not present there (e.g. \"regional\" Instagram accounts) are in no way related to us.   \n\n\nTLDR: If someone with a Flipper profile pic/username wants you to DM them to buy a Flipper Zero - that's not us, that's a scam.",

I asked the seller why so high a price when anyone can buy it on the manufacturer's website for $165.  The response:  \"*Well first if you buy it from the website it\u2019s $200 after tax and shipping, second takes over a month to get to you and even then they get seized all the time. It\u2019s extremely hard getting these.*\"  I say horse crap to that.  I bought mine from Flipper Devices Inc and got it for $169 (plus tax and shipping (shipping was less than $10)) and it shipped in about two weeks.",

You may even be given tech to access your spot but you don't own that tech nor do you have the right to mess with it clone it etc... you could lose your house tampering with their property why risk it same with a work badge. get clearance first or don't play with it"
