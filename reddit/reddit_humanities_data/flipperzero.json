We're actively working on removing them, but please remember that **the only official stores for Flipper Zero are listed here:** [**https://flipperzero.one/how-to-buy**](https://flipperzero.one/how-to-buy)**.**\n\nAll the sales are done through store webpages, **if you have to DM someone to buy the device from us - you're getting scammed.** All our social accounts are listed at the bottom of [our website](https://flipperzero.one), anything that's not present there (e.g. \"regional\" Instagram accounts) are in no way related to us.   \n\n\nTLDR: If someone with a Flipper profile pic/username wants you to DM them to buy a Flipper Zero - that's not us, that's a scam.",

The response:  \"*Well first if you buy it from the website it\u2019s $200 after tax and shipping, second takes over a month to get to you and even then they get seized all the time. It\u2019s extremely hard getting these.*\"  I say horse crap to that.

Shine a bright light through your card and ensure that it's not using two different technologies: https://www.asiarfid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/RFID-smart-card-02.jpg.

That or the Flipper isn't talking to the reader (make sure you have updated your firmware to get the latest NFC stack).\n\nEdit: This question was solved on the Discord. The tag is MIFARE Classic using UID \"auth\", there are no nonces from Detect Reader because there's effectively zero security on tag."
