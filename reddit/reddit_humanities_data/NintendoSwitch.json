            "I have read the guides and googled and I\u2019m still confused, if not more. \nI have a Lite. Yesterday I got an OLED. I gave my daughter my Lite. She\u2019s playing Barbie on the Lite and I\u2019m trying to play a different game on the OLED and I can\u2019t. It kicks one of us off. We can\u2019t even play different games on each switch? And I can\u2019t transfer her games (Bluey, Peppa, and Barbie) to a new Nintendo user account, I\u2019d have to rebuy, correct? Either way we can\u2019t both play two different games at the same time unless I want to be out another $100+? Thanks!",
            "Oh boy did I get scared earlier today. I was playing Monster Hunter Rise, ranked up and talked to NPCs who had quests for me (keep in mind the game autosaves after each interaction), created custom food buff sets and took pictures with the ingame camera feature for one of these quests. I then proceeded to go on a quest and had to put my Nintendo Switch in sleep mode to do some chores.\n\n\n\nOnce I was able to play again I tried to wake up my Switch but nothing happened. The screen didn't brighten, plugging in the charger didn't cause any reaction and the only thing that helped was forcing the console to turn off and on my staying pressed on the power button for a while. Everything seemed normal, I did expect the game to be closed since the console restarted so I launched it again.\n\n\nThen I realized something was wrong. Loading up my save brought me back right before I talked to the NPCs, created my custom stuff ect. but it shouldn't be possible since the game autosaves after you do basically anything. What's weird is that I still had the pictures I took in the ingame gallery ! So I lost progress on what I did but still retained the pictures ? That's just weird.\n\n\nBecause I like to understand I tried to just close the game without going back to the main menu and see if indeed the autosave feature was just bugged and only completing quests saves the game but no, launched the game again after doing what I did previously and that time the progress didn't reset. This weird sleep crash my Switch experienced had this weird time-travel effect on my game I cannot comprehend.\n\n\nDoes the Switch have many different saves it keeps and in case the latest one corrupts an older one is used ? Please Nintendo Tech Bros, I need an answer for my sanity"

            "A lot of them really:\n\n**Mario & Luigi: Brothership:** Mario RPGs are back in full force and I can't be more happy. I have been waiting more than a decade (Because Paper Jam sucked) for a truly new Mario & Luigi.\n\n**The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom:** 2D Zelda finally comes back eleven years after ALBW with a twist that makes it as creative as TOTK is. Can't wait to try it out and see how I solve some of those puzzles in the most absurd ways.\n\n- **Dragon Quest III: HD-2D Remake:** It's... it's beautiful. Also more information that has came out hinted at new story beats, new classes and even physical skills being added. And then they drop the bombshell of 1 and 2 also getting remade. Day 1 Purchase.\n\n**Super Mario Party Jamboree:** Finally a game that feels like a true sequel to MP1-8. Super Mario Party was so underwhelming while Superstars had amazing gameplay but lacked in new content. This has both and I can't wait to make new frenemies that want to punch me thanks to this game.\n\n**Ace Attorney Investigations Collection:** Beyond hyped to finally get AAI2 localized, because that game is such a masterpiece and the new HD sprites look so amazing and smooth. This got my biggest scream out of the Direct.\n\n**Donkey Kong Country Returns HD:** It feels dissapointing to get yet another release of this game instead of a new DK... but then I realized that for Returns we have either a jaggy SD version with wiimote waggle to roll at 60 fps, or a portable version that looks way worse at 30 fps but uses buttons and has new levels. Now we have the best of both worlds, the Definitive version. Excited to replay Returns more often now thanks to this.\n\n**Metroid Prime 4 Beyond:** After 7 years of waiting... it's finally here. The hypest part of the trailer was that forest area shown at the very end. I'm so eager to explore it. Maybe I should replay 2 and 3 before it comes out (Welp, it's time to dust off the Trilogy disc and get AA Batteries for the Wiimote).\n\nAlso I'm not really a Fighting game fan but the **Marvel vs Capcom games** (Especially MvC2) getting re-released is such a huge deal, no one thought I'd ever happen again.\n\nWhat a banger of a Direct. Both my time and money are going bankrupt from September and onwards T_T",

If you haven't been following this series closely you probably don't realize how big of a deal this is. The MVC series basically just went from \"This series is dead forever, it is what it is\" to \"Holy shit MVC4 might actually happen\" in seconds. MVC2 getting re-released is also a huge deal since it hasn't been purchasable in 10+ years and is going to revive the community in a notable way.",
