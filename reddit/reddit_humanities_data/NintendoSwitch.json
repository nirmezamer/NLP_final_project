            "Apologies if this is a dumb question - but do physical copies of games get updates? \n\nI am pretty new to having a switch and was thinking of buying No Man's Sky as it's on sale at my local game store. I read that the earlier version of the game was very glitchy, but updates have improved things. Do physical games get the benefits of updates? Are the updates somehow uploaded to and stored in the Switch system? On the cartridge?",
            "I heard that the Switch version of Tales of Symphonia is the worst one, but recently I saw 65% off in Australian E Shop (sales ended some time ago) which is basically US$14 and it was patched, though I heard I doesn't improve that much.\n\n\nIs 65% worth getting the game for a switch only person?"
