            "**very** interested to see what Eminem & BabyTron sound like together. I was hoping Eminem would collab with him but I thought itd never happen just due to the generational differences and differences in rapping style. But Im intrigued.",
            "Big Sean I could've seen, but BabyTron? Crazy features",
            "Both artists showed up in Cole Bennets Doomsday pt2 video. Denzel Curry, Teezo Touchdown, JID, Swae Lee, and Cordae are now on the table as realistic features for this album",
