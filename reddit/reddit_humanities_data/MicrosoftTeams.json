            "Hi all. A company that I freelance for added me to an organization on Teams using my Gmail address. At the time, I seemed able to connect following the link in the \"You have been added as a guest\" email. Since then, I haven't been able to get in at all with my Gmail. Desktop and mobile all insist I log in with a Microsoft account, but my Microsoft accounts aren't added to the organization. Just my Gmail.\n\nToday I got an email notification about a mention on Teams (like an @ everyone, idk what the Teams terminology is), so I'm clearly still \"in\" the org, but I can't figure out how to get into it to see the mention. Any ideas?",

            "Hello everyone, i am trying to acces the teams voiceanalytics api but for the life of me i cannot get it to work. from within postman i cannot acces the api trough token+app registration in azure. is there someone who has accesed the voiceanalytics api and uses it in a custom app or powerautomate flow?",
            "One of my notifications broke/got lost in the transition to new teams. \n\nI'd like to get a Mac level notification when the Workflows app messages me. We work tickets from those assigned through workflows, and I'm not getting alerts like I used to when we used the Planner app. Is there any way to have this happen, without enabling notifications for *all* users?",
            "Within a meeting chat, using the Approvals app, I want to post an approval request that I created using a custom template. I can create a basic approval request (just using the basic provided template) in the meeting chat, but if I want to use a custom template that I created ahead of time, it's not available in the meeting chat - I have to go to the Approvals hub to do it, and then it doesn't get posted in the chat.\n\nAny suggestions?",
            "First time using the app so it's likely I'm just being completely blind, but I can't seem to find an option to link my Android 11 phone with my Teams desktop. The app is installed on both the phone and desktop, the desktop version shows me an option to link and even offers a QR code for it, but I don't see anything on the android app that gives me an option for accessing the phone's camera, linking, or doing a scan. What am I supposed to look for please?",
            "I can\u2019t unmute myself on Teams calls that are being recorded. I\u2019m using the new MacOS Teams app (Work or School). On two calls this past week I was muted and could not turn it off. On one call, they stopped/started recording and you could see my mic mute/unmute on its own. \n\nI have the mic and camera allowed in the OS security settings. Switching mics does nothing, nor does the keyboard shortcut to unmute. I even cleared caches by using the Terminal."

        "content": "TLDR; channel meetings are causing problems in my organisation. When a meeting is booked people claim they do not know who is expected to join, results in people accepting erroneous meetings or missing meetings because \"they cannot tell who is optional or required meeting notifications seem random and unfocussed\" is this likely because:\n\n* channel meetings are lacking basic common sense functionality\n* admin need to refine global settings or help users change settings such that they do work\n* users need educating, channel meetings work perfectly well and they're all troglodytes;\n\n/\n\nI work in a medium-sized technology company. From my standpoint our use of modern information management and collaborative tools is pretty archaic, circa. 1990s era mentality.\n\nI'm an advocate for Teams/ SharePoint. It's no where near perfect but it's at least firmly in the 21st century. For me the benefits of a properly implemented Teams/Shareapoint environment is self evident. Most colleagues need convincing, mainly because they are oblivious to the current problems and the potential solutions.\n\nChannel meetings are the tip of the iceberg, but it illustrates how the bugs in Teams can undermine attempts to modernise:\n\nWe spend too much time mapping out business meetings for a project, these constantly change and stakeholders want an overview. New people to the team should have access to the meetings that are going on and instead miss key meetings for months because they're not visible and people forget. This for me is a classic case of benefit of channel meetings. Book all meetings in the channel, add a calendar tab: immediately everyone has access to the relevant meetings happening in the group, they can view them for information and join them if they wish.... simple?\n\nProblem is when I book a channel meeting, regardless of who I invite I just get everyone accepting/ or joining without any rhyme or reason. When I ask what they can see, they claim they have no idea whether they're required or not. This seems like a very basic flaw in the software... or is it?\n\n* software issue. It should be clear who is required in the meeting. Even better those that are not named attendees shouldn't even receive an invite but can still see the meeting in the channel calendar. Another example of nice idea, poor implementation.\n\n*admin issue. It's totally possible that channel meetings can work well. It's just that Teams global settings need definition (we have an admin who is knowledgeable, but lacks vision/understanding for how Teams might be used in business)\n\n*people issue, the information on who should attend should be very clear and they need training. Furthermore, you wouldn't walk past a meeting in progress and barge in assuming you were required to be present. Why would you do it in a digital environment?!\n\nIt's this kind of stuff that drives me insane. I can see how Teams, properly implemented, can be transformational. Of course, the old ways are worse beyond measure - but people are married to their shitty ways of working and love it when the new system has some flaws to justify the old ways. This is the infinite struggle!\n\nLong post! Hopefully the TLDR makes sense. Thoughts/advice?",

            "A channel meeting kind of insinuates that anyone that is a member of the channel can / should attend the meeting. To your analogy of barging in to a meeting in progress a channel meeting is like having a standup meeting at your desk and not inviting you. If you only want specific people attending then don\u2019t use channel meeting",
            "'Can' I agree with. But it seems to me the Venn diagram of people you want in a channel and people you want in a meeting (depending how channels are used, granted) will overlap almost never, so as to make channel meetings basically useless.\n\nIf you're saying this is normal. I guess my personal view is, it's pretty bad functionality!"

Here is a full list of issues that are on the New Teams but whilst on the Old Teams cease to exist:\n\n\n\n- Cant pick up some Teams calls\n\n- Doesnt show inbound Teams calls\n\n- Wont let people call out\n\n- Missing notifications\n\n- Everyone appearing as unknown user\n\n- Wont let people join meetings\n\n- Keeps defaulting to an alternative account\n\n\n\nAnd before the general response, we have done our own fixes that still havent worked. We have cleared Teams cache, updated Teams and Windows, reinstalled Teams, checked all Teams permissions on Windows and the Teams \"app\". The microphone and camera are functioning correctly, notifications work on the Old Teams - not the new one, the Users that appear as unknown were NOT recently added to Azure, it is all of the users who appear as unknown. Windows focus Assist is not diablsing Notifications nor is any other application.\n\n\n\nThis is a serious issue that needs to be resolved, as this new \"app\" does not function for the many users, and why fix something that isnt broken. The new web loader is slow, ineffective, removes Contacts and is overall a worse experience.",

            "Hi, I recommend putting in tickets with Microsoft, as you are really one of thousands who are experiencing this. Microsoft initially tried to claim that most of the issues were hardware related (despite it often being hardware recommended by them specifically as Teams compatible). It took us over a year, but we are finally getting fixes applied to newer versions on the new teams. Reddit isn't going to resolve any of these issues, you need to go to the source and raise hell.",

For reference, I'm with a Big 10 university, soooo, we're not small beans to them, but they definitely were treating us as such for a bit. Just keep persisting with them.",

There should be a download button in the right hand side of the address bar after you login.\n\nI switched to it Thursday and it still sucks but now it only takes up 50mb of ram and 5% of 1 core to do video conference calls.  New teams was making my i9 mac (that can run 100 apps at 20% cpu if they aren\u2019t made by Microsoft) max out all 8 cores and overheat to the point that it was scolding hot.\n\nNow if they could get vscode and outlook and excel and word to stop trying to murder a supercomputer while simply idling that would be great.",

But now I am forced to use a different version that foesn't work?\n\nCurrently, something has triggered the automatic launching of the \"New\" teams, but it is utterly broken and I can no longer do my job, I cannot share my screen with the new app and I need to present to colleagues and clients!?",

Being forced onto new teams makes it pretty clear that a lot of people are having issues.\n\nTeams is the only app I run on a mac that can consistently pin 8 i9 cores at 100% and overheat the computer while literally doing nothing.  Just leaving it run for long enough and having a few calls will result in 100s of threads that never go away.\n\nVscode does it too but at least it still lets you close it when it becomes unresponsive.  Teams will make the computer get so hot it literally freezes.  In 15 years of exclusively using macos that is a unique experience.\n\nThere is something wrong with that software."
