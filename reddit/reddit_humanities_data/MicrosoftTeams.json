            "I was supposed to join a Microsoft team for a job interview.  I joined it and left it a bunch of times prior to the time of the interview.  The time of the interview was upon me and I clicked to join as I had done before, but this time I got an error message\u2026 I restarted my computer 3 times.  I powered it on and off as well.  No matter what I did I still got the same error message.  Can somebody plz help me out???

But there are several problems \n\n* One receptionist is reporting that incoming call/call waiting notification boxes are not popping up for her. She will be on a call with Party A, Party B will call, but while she hears the OBNOXIOUS call waiting tone on her end, she sees no option to swap over to that other caller. \n* The call waiting noise is highly intrusive and loud - is there any way to dial that down? \n* Do TEAMS phones have a \"page all\" type function where everyone can be called at once (for example, if there is a fire in the building, telling people \"Get out now?\"",

Here is a full list of issues that are on the New Teams but whilst on the Old Teams cease to exist:\n\n\n\n- Cant pick up some Teams calls\n\n- Doesnt show inbound Teams calls\n\n- Wont let people call out\n\n- Missing notifications\n\n- Everyone appearing as unknown user\n\n- Wont let people join meetings\n\n- Keeps defaulting to an alternative account\n\n\n\nAnd before the general response, we have done our own fixes that still havent worked. We have cleared Teams cache, updated Teams and Windows, reinstalled Teams, checked all Teams permissions on Windows and the Teams \"app\". The microphone and camera are functioning correctly, notifications work on the Old Teams - not the new one, the Users that appear as unknown were NOT recently added to Azure, it is all of the users who appear as unknown. Windows focus Assist is not diablsing Notifications nor is any other application.\n\n\n\nThis is a serious issue that needs to be resolved, as this new \"app\" does not function for the many users, and why fix something that isnt broken. The new web loader is slow, ineffective, removes Contacts and is overall a worse experience.",

Microsoft initially tried to claim that most of the issues were hardware related (despite it often being hardware recommended by them specifically as Teams compatible). It took us over a year, but we are finally getting fixes applied to newer versions on the new teams. Reddit isn't going to resolve any of these issues, you need to go to the source and raise hell.",

But now I am forced to use a different version that foesn't work?\n\nCurrently, something has triggered the automatic launching of the \"New\" teams, but it is utterly broken and I can no longer do my job, I cannot share my screen with the new app and I need to present to colleagues and clients!?",
