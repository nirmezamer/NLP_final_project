            "I really like the conflict between Clark and Kara this episode and what it represents. Clark represents new beginnings and he shows that with real memories of making a new life, while still holding onto a glimmer of his heritage, but he doesn\u2019t let it define him. Kara\u2019s entire personality and ideology is based on memories that aren\u2019t even hers. She\u2019s been told her whole life that things were better before, and we have to get back to the good old days. \n\nThey\u2019re both staunchly proud of their identities but one is based on truth and love while the other is based on lies and false promises. \n\nAside from that I loved the sibling teasing from Clark to Kara, was a much needed comic relief this episode.",
            "Brainiac's VA is amazing in this.",
            "It feels so refreshing just getting a straight up evil and competent character, not the bs misunderstood or something. \n\n  \nBut lois, Jimmy...\n\n  \nWHY ARE YOU IN SPACE!!! YOU ARE NOT AN ASTRONAUT NOR A SUPERHERO! YOU CAN DO LITTLE TO NOTHING TO CONTRIBUTE OR HELP!",
            "This show is soooooo good. Freaking loved this episode, had a nice feeling of Invincible in it. \n\n  \nMy only complaint about the show is he robotic designs lol I can't get myself to like the triangular shapes",
            "I love how Clark and Kara act like siblings despite the fact Kara kidnapped Clark\u00a0",
            "\"I will not crush Jimmy Flamebird!\" I don't think he'd complain.",
            "This episode got dark! Braniac is quite the cold hearted villain.",
            "Wow brainiac is just straight up evil and is not hiding the fact he enjoying it he just jumped straight to Mind Control for Clark instead of Gaslighting like he did for Kara I think he might have had grudge against Jor-el because he was giddy watching Clark getting kicked around.",
            "Was that Green Lantern from the comics? That\u2019s a sick ass design, I hope we learn more about that guy. (Probably not, but let me dream \ud83d\ude2d)\n\nLoved this episode though. Having Clark and Kara interact as family was funny and heartwarming, which made the ending of this episode with Kara finally realizing what she did more powerful. Can\u2019t wait to see how Jimmy and Lois got into space with the goats."

I just didn\u2019t feel *as much* of a Lois Lane vibe as I would\u2019ve liked. She had a lot of very sweet interactions with Clark but I just think she was a little too \u201cgirl next door\u201d. The Lois Lane I know is a hard-headed smart-ass.",
            "One of my problems with MoS is how it stripped the *fun* out of so many characters (which is to speak nothing of their quality, a lot of people liked the movies and I'm not here to harsh on that). Won't go into Superman's characterization but Clark was kinda just \"guy\", Lois was just \"female reporter\", the rest of the Daily Planet staff were just so humdrum and unexciting. Realistic, sure, but not as fun.\u00a0\n\n\nGive 'Superman: The Animated Series' a watch if you want a really good Lois. Every other Lois get compared to her, for me. Really hoping we'll get that from Rachel Brosnahan (and I think we will, given how Lois-like her Miss Maisel was).\u00a0",

Regardless of the actress, I didn\u2019t think Lois was well written in the movie, she didn\u2019t feel like \u201cLois Lane\u201d in most scenes. She and Cavill also didn\u2019t have the best chemistry either, which didn\u2019t really help.",
