            "I love how Clark and Kara act like siblings despite the fact Kara kidnapped Clark",
            "\"I will not crush Jimmy Flamebird!\" I don't think he'd complain.",
            "This episode got dark! Braniac is quite the cold hearted villain.",
            "Wow brainiac is just straight up evil and is not hiding the fact he enjoying it he just jumped straight to Mind Control for Clark instead of Gaslighting like he did for Kara I think he might have had grudge against Jor-el because he was giddy watching Clark getting kicked around.",
            "Was that Green Lantern from the comics? Thats a sick ass design, I hope we learn more about that guy. (Probably not, but let me dream )\n\nLoved this episode though. Having Clark and Kara interact as family was funny and heartwarming, which made the ending of this episode with Kara finally realizing what she did more powerful. Cant wait to see how Jimmy and Lois got into space with the goats.",
            "Okay the nice Green Lantern easter egg in the combat simulation, alongside the reference to Thanagar, and the stuff with Lois being offered the job in Gotham and Silver St. Cloud makes me think they're building up a sort of animated Universe with this stuff, similar to the DCAU. Which, honestly? I'm all here for, Animation has always been the best format for comic adaptations, so it's nice to have one for modern audiences. At the very least it would be somewhat similar to the other shows where characters would appear for specials and whatnot.",
            "Man, I cannot wait to see what the next episodes have in store for us. But Green Lantern easter egg and a parademon great world building stuff. I mean Gotham City and Vicki Vale mentioned, my guess they will eventually have Batman in it, and potentially more DC stuff.",
            "Honestly tho Kara as an antagonist was cool Im glad shes not taking too long to come to her senses and its also cool to see her and Clark actually connecting as cousins",
            "Before I get into the episode proper: Holy shit, that's the most metal title I've seen in a while!\n\nEdit: Was that a parademon?! I'm sorry, are they implying Krypton conquered *Apokolips*?!"

            "You know how every single adult goes around and punches babies in the face because they are stronger than them?\n\nNo? Doesn't happen? Huh, I wonder what that could mean....",
            "The similar powersets, costumes and themes are the obvious reasons why Homelander and Superman are constantly compared, but are these people forgetting Starlight exists in the same show? A country girl who grew up with loving parents who believes in the traditional superhero, and rose to the ranks of the Seven because of her image as the kind and friendly hero? Her personality more resembles Superman and she is a person that exists in The Boys.",
            "Hancock is a more realistic depiction of modern Superman than Homelander tbh",
            "a guy who was raised by loving parents on a farm VS a guy who was raised in a lab",
            "How do they miss the fact Homelander was raised horribly from birth before saying that's obviously exactly how an irl superman would be...",
            "I dont think it has anything to do with edgy super hero stories at all.  I think its more about peoples perception of the real world rather than other fiction.\n\nWe see humans abuse power imbalances every day in virtually every way imaginable.",
            "Lex Luthor is one of the most realistic characters ever because theres way too many people in real life who are so unable to imagine a guy like Superman who is just a genuine nice guy and imagine anyone in his position would be a nutjob with a god complex (theyre projecting)",
            "Homelander and Superman were raised completely differently. Homelander was raised in a lab by uncaring scientists and was brainwashed into being the ultimate product. Superman was raised by two loving parents in a small farm town in Kansas. He was instilled with the values of doing what is right rather than what is easy. But most importantly the difference between the two is how people react to them in universe, Homelander is treated like another rich pompous celebrity who is only in it for himself, While in universe Superman is down to Earth people look up to him not because of his movies or media tie ins but what he represents and who he is as a person",
            "Homelander is not a realistic depiction of someone with supermans powers, nor was he ever meant to be. Maeve, Deep, A-Train, sure, theyre mostly meant to be just regular celebs with superpowers. \n\nHomelander was bred in a laboratory as a dissociative sociopath. Saying hes a realistic depiction is like saying Ted Bundy is a realistic depiction of normal people."

            "With the exception of the piss jar and jolly rancher scene,he really does things resembling normal Lex but Eisenberg essentially turned him into Schumacher villain who makes Micky Mouse noises.\n\nSpacey was good when allowed to be Post-Crisis Lex but was 99% of the time forced to be an imitation of Hackman.",
            "He's a great interpretation of lex luthor on crack",
            "Snyder was thinking \"New 52\", similar to his decision to make Superman's outfit look like space armor.",
            "He's everything Lex isn't supposed to be.",
            "I just hope all new versions of Lex have a scene where they slowly push a Jolly Rancher into another persons mouth.",
            "Eisenberg was playing this Manic Pixie Boy who I couldn't for a minute buy that he was one of the smartest people on the planet.\n\nKevin Spacey may have been one of the best casting choices in *Superman Returns* but we run into another major problem with that movie, and that would be the fact that his plan is terrible. Even dumber than dropping California into the ocean and hoping no one notices.",
            "Elisenburg was hot after his performance in the social network, so I think he was over indulged in his choices of character interpretation. Also Zack Snyder  is a director more concerned with visual spectacle more than in-depth exploration of motivation or character arcs out of his performers",
            "He should've of been the Riddler instead",
            "He was trying to Jokerize it, because Snyder really thinks Joker is a cool villain and doesn't really get Lex? The post JL tease with him was closer to the \"right\" version of this actor-role combo but in BvS the character was Lex in name only."
