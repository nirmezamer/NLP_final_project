        "content": "Below are some FAQs and some helpful notes for beginners. Feel free to add anything in the comments.\n\n# **FUT CHAMPS** \n\n**1)** You play rivals to earn fut champs points. \n\n\n**2)** You can use those points to gain entry to champ qualies. Here you have 10 games to get 20 points. 4 points for a win and 1 point for a loss so that's 4 wins, winning 4 will reward you with a finals entry token. This can be done at anytime during the week. If the season ends and you havent finished your qualies you'll lose your progress.\n\n\n**3)** On the weekend you can redeem your finals token. Here you have 20 games to get as many wins as possible\n\n\n**4)** once the games are over you repeat the process. Depending on your win bracket you can skip step 1.\n\n\nExtra - You can only enter finals once a week. If you don't use your token you can save it for a future week. \n\n\n# **WHEN TO OPEN PACKS**\n\nOpen when you want, it's all luck, if the current contents of the packs interest you then open them, if not then don't.\n\n# **XP**\nXp is only earnt via objectives or rivals rewards, champs finals and squad battles rewards. Usually towards the end of the season they release more XP. Best way to find out it's to wait. XP can also occasionally be bought via select packs or kits.\n\n# **WHO TO PICK**\nUse something like futbin or futwiz to check a players price, this usually gives a rough idea in who's better. If they're not worth much and none help your squad take the highest rated for fodder. If they're all similarly price take whoever helps your team.\n\n# **HOW PEOPLE GET GOD SQUADS**\nThese recent fifas are very easy. The game throws fodder at you with the season progress. There's also a crazy amount of packs available in rivals, champs, qualies and squad battles aswell as objectives and milestones. We also have plenty of sbcs to get more packs, fodder and players\n\n# **WHERE IS COMPENSATION**\nIts EA,  nobody know when they'll release compensation \n\n# **NOT RECEIVING SQUAD BATTLE POINTS** \nCheck the top right and see how many matches you played. You get 32 matches a week, unplayed matches count as played when you refresh. You can still play and earn progress to challenges and objectives but you won't receive any squad battle points until the refresh\n\n# **SEASON 7 LADDER PLAYERS** \nThese are the players from the season progress.\n\n# **NEW LOAN TYPE** \nThese new loans are based of time and not games. They will expire once the Euros is over. Currently they are bugged and inly last 7 games but that will be fixed(applying contracts on the app seems to be a workaround)\n\n#**STARTING 11 VS FULL SQUAD**\nIf an objective says full squad then that means your full squad, so starting 11 and subs. If an objective says starting 11 then it's only the starting 11 you need.\n\n#**MAKING A CARD RED**\nPurely a cosmetic change so use who you like. Keep in mind any card with a chem boost (such as radioactive or MYM cards) will lose their boost",
