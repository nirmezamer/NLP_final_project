            "Hey all, recently getting into turntables and such, and I was able to get my hands on a Garrard Synchro Lab 55b for 50 bucks. My girlfriend bought me some speakers to go with it as a housewarming gift, Electrome Bookshelf Speakers (EB10), and I just set everything up. Went to play a record, and even though the volume on the speakers are turned all the way up I can barely hear the music coming from the speakers. RCA cables are plugged in properly, but maybe they\u2019re too old and damaged? Could that be an issue? If not that, what is the likely problem?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wmb5p74h8d9d1.png?width=3024&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5d1474dcf588e8a54e905ae599f56f52887532f",

Im a newer type of collector as in i havent been doing this as long as most. Ya'll have made me believe dust is the devil and its going to destroy the grooves in my precious/rare records if i cant get every spec.

            "Today I got a brand new record (Chemtrails Over The Country Club by Lana Del Rey) and while playing it, my cat decided to jump on the turntable. She got scared and jumped off but left behind a pretty nasty scratch. Luckily it was on the second to last song, but now it loops the same 2 words over and over again. I googled it and watched videos, and after trying many methods it\u2019s seems I\u2019ve done more harm than good and now there are multiple loops (in the same spot). I\u2019d much rather that section just skip than loop. It\u2019s only a 10 second portion of song and isn\u2019t the chorus or anything. If anyone could give some tips on how to get the issue to stop please let me know.",

            "Scored on a new player yesterday! It\u2019s a Technics model SL-1950. It was priced at 20 but was half off, so I got it for $10. I don\u2019t know much about the brand, but I knew this was an older table and looked well made and in good shape, so I took a chance on it! I currently use an Audio Technica AT-LP120-USB, which funny enough, I thrifted a year ago. I don\u2019t know a ton about record players, but I\u2019m curious which one y\u2019all prefer and would keep personally. I figured out this funny-looking arm thing on the left is for stacking multiple records, which I think is a hilarious feature. I\u2019m curious if anybody has used this model table before and what their experience is with owning it also if y\u2019all know how to fix a sticky cue arm let me know!",

The fancy spindle is for 45's and double LP's with sides labeled A-C, and B-D or 1-3 and 2-4, stacked properly on the spindle they will automatically drop.

For father's day, my family very kindly gifted me this ultrasonic cleaner that finally arrived yesterday. After getting it assembled, I was able to throw about 36 records through it last night. Most records weren't super dirty as I was just picking out some ones I had easily accessible so I am excited to find some of the worst ones to see how well this thing can clean. Overall the records I put through already look great!",

I\u2019ve hand cleaned a good 2,000 records in my collection and have had great results. \n\nI\u2019ve also been curious on the effectiveness of cleaning 1 at a time vs a stack, like you\u2019re showing - do the bubbles get in to clean between the records, the same as they would with a single album?  If I got one and need to clean 2,000 records, one at a time\u2026ugh\u2026\n\nHappy Father\u2019s Day!",

On the other hand, a collection of video game soundtrack records I bought from iam8bit have just enough of a different shape around the label that water was able to get in - and under - the labels.\n\nIf you plan to use it with expensive newer records, keep an eye on the machine for the first few minutes to make sure the labels are OK.  For older stuff, it's not a problem - I've run at least a few dozen records from the 50s through the 80s in it with no problems.",
