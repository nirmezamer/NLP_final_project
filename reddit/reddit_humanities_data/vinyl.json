            "I always dust off a record before playing, then i spritz it with a cleaner, then a microfiber cloth, then a drying bush. theres always a bit of dust left. i mean they look MUCH cleaner than the start. no more fingerprints, smudges and less dust than previous. but no matter how much i clean em seems like theres always a few flecks of dust I cant get off. Im a newer type of collector as in i havent been doing this as long as most. Ya'll have made me believe dust is the devil and its going to destroy the grooves in my precious/rare records if i cant get every spec. How much should i worry, and is there a better way to clean those pesky dust flakes.",
            "Today I got a brand new record (Chemtrails Over The Country Club by Lana Del Rey) and while playing it, my cat decided to jump on the turntable. She got scared and jumped off but left behind a pretty nasty scratch. Luckily it was on the second to last song, but now it loops the same 2 words over and over again. I googled it and watched videos, and after trying many methods it\u2019s seems I\u2019ve done more harm than good and now there are multiple loops (in the same spot). I\u2019d much rather that section just skip than loop. It\u2019s only a 10 second portion of song and isn\u2019t the chorus or anything. If anyone could give some tips on how to get the issue to stop please let me know.",
            "Does county/location of plant matter when figuring out if something is an original pressing? For example I have the original US release of Let It Be, Would that be considered the OG pressing or not because presumably the UK version was pressed first during the same year?",

I would like to ask what are some basic maintenance practices you should have with your records and, above all, the best cleaning products and sleeves, without spending a ton of money on it. Thanks in advance ;)",

This record isn't rare ENOUGH for anyone to pay anything for this, especially in a discobag. Anything else I could do with it other than trash it? Already got a refund.\n\nPearl Jam - Ten (Europe 1992)",
            "Hi,\nAnyone know of any portable, battery-operated record players, with 16 and 78 rpm and/or enough pitch control to these speeds? Looking for a brand new one you don't have to plug in, that has these features, plus with belt drive turntable that is full size to hold 10\" or 12\" records. How about the best stylus to use to play 78s? or LPs or 45s in stereo or mono? Thanks!",

            "Scored on a new player yesterday! It\u2019s a Technics model SL-1950. It was priced at 20 but was half off, so I got it for $10. I don\u2019t know much about the brand, but I knew this was an older table and looked well made and in good shape, so I took a chance on it! I currently use an Audio Technica AT-LP120-USB, which funny enough, I thrifted a year ago. I don\u2019t know a ton about record players, but I\u2019m curious which one y\u2019all prefer and would keep personally. I figured out this funny-looking arm thing on the left is for stacking multiple records, which I think is a hilarious feature. I\u2019m curious if anybody has used this model table before and what their experience is with owning it also if y\u2019all know how to fix a sticky cue arm let me know!",
            "I have that pressing on black.made in Germany sticker. Pressed at Pallas Germany. Exquisite sound.",
            "Great score! I got mine for $17  about 7 years ago off a goodwill shelf, instantly recognized it from the strobe, and grabbed it. The fancy spindle is for 45's and double LP's with sides labeled A-C, and B-D or 1-3 and 2-4, stacked properly on the spindle they will automatically drop. You can find manuals online for users, and technical. \n\nI'd bring it to the shop, and have an Ortofon red properly installed and balanced, a cleaning and lubrication, you'll be good for another decade with a classic vintage turntable.",
            "That\u2019s definitely a sweet find (model and price). Take good care of it and it\u2019ll last you a lifetime :-)",

            "You scored an excellent vintage turntable. \n\nI have an SL-D1 and the SL-1600. Both are absolute workhorses and should serve you well for a very long time.",
            "Nice! I've got an SL-1900, it's a beaut.",
            "I used to have an SL-2000 from 1977, which seem to share a lot of parts, but yours is automatic and looks to have a better tone arm (just judging by looks). It was an incredibly fun and dependable turntable. I also thought it sounded great. Only issues I've had to solve was cleaning the speed adjustment pots to solve unstable speeds, replaced the RCA cables with an RCA bracket because it would hum badly or lose signal when moving the cable slightly. I also should have refilled the cue lever with some damping oil, as the tonearm lowered a bit too quickly, but I didn't know about this fix at that time.",
            "Hell yeah, welcome to the thrifted Technics club! Hope it lasts a long time!  I have an sl-3350 I found for $60 that\u2019s been trouble-free for around 12-13 years."

            "I buy Japanese records of Japanese artists. And they are hard to come by. \n\nJapanese pressings of U.S./British bands\u2026 I don\u2019t really care. If I can get a clean copy at a good price with OBI sure. But I\u2019m fine with a European or N. American press of the time.",
            "U can squeeze a couple more upvotes out of them if there's an extra ribbon with japanese writing on it\u00a0",
            "I\u2019m a huge Beatles fan and I\u2019m Japanese. From my experience, Japanese Beatles LP have great packaging, but generally speaking (with some exceptions here and there) I really don\u2019t like their EQ choices. They favor boosting treble and lowering the bass on a copy (sometimes, not so great 2nd or 3rd generation one) of master tape. This is actually generally true for many albums by a US/UK rock bands from 60s, 70s and 80s. I understand most modern systems allow you to fix the eq but no thanks. I cannot be bothered to fix more stuff every time I want to play a record.  For Beatles LPs, I\u2019m gonna stick to UK, Germany and Netherlands pressings. For me, obi, high quality dead-quiet-between-the-tracks vinyl and horribly translated lyrics sheet (the curse of knowing how to read Japanese)  don\u2019t justify the prices these LPs are going for. From a collecting point of view, I totally get it, but sound quality is what makes vinyl special for me and unless we\u2019re talking Jazz or Japanese artists, generally speaking, Japanese records don\u2019t cut it for me.",
            "The other point that I can't see already mentioned, is that second hand LPs from Japan are typically very well looked after and often down-graded by sellers (e.g. a 'VG' from Japan might match a 'NM' from sellers in some other regions). This has at least held true on each occasion I've imported from Japanese stores.",
            "Japan never really dropped physical media, especially vinyl and CDs, like the US. It\u2019s remained a significant part of the market there for decades. Because of this active and dedicated market, the pressings and packaging tend to be high-quality.",
            "From what I've read, Japanese pressings have, in most cases, always used fresh virgin vinyl for their albums. And compared to other parts of the world, also tended towards smaller numbers in a pressing leading to the master disc getting less wear and tear which leads to overall better quality of the albums that are pressed from it.",
            "Just discovered a Japanese act called Mrs Green Apples\u2026apparently they\u2019ve been around for years\u2026new single \u201cLilac\u201d most creative and interesting pop I\u2019ve heard in years (and I\u2019m in my late 60\u2019s) Obviously I don\u2019t understand a word. Nevertheless,have already asked my son to pick me up some albums when he goes skiing in Japan later in the year.",
            "Japanese albums are just overall higher quality. From the actual vinyl, to the cover, and to the mastering, Japanese albums were made with quality as the priority so most of the problems that other countries albums could have, such as occasional pressing flaws, are much less common. While Japanese mastering may not necessarily sound the best in all instances, it is said they were meant to replicate the masters as well as possible, not improve them. Whether that is fully true or not I\u2019m not sure, google it and find out for yourself. Also people just like the OBIs",
            "They were pressed on the best vinyl in the world. Incredibly silent. \n\nHaving said that, mastering can be hit-and-miss. But when they get it right, they\u2019re as good as vinyl can possibly get.",
            "Japanese mastering engineers and pressing facilities have always been top-notch, some old pressings are indeed better, just because the pre-pressing process has been done with extreme care to avoid any misalignment during the different steps leading to the final pressing matrix. I remember one such Japanese actor requesting we send them a copper master instead of lacquer for example, lacquer was just not admissible in their process for some doctrinal reason i guess  - very very careful and precise mindset."
