Their destinies lay in different worlds: witch and Muggle; magic and science; Scotland and London. Then Alex came up with the idea of selling potions to Muggles. Their waning bond is revived, but can it last while running a nascent illegal business, the challenges of school and new relationships? Fem!Harry, Time-shifted AU, Pre-Hogwarts, Years 2-4.\n\n\u2728More details \u2728\n\nSet in an AU that's moved closer to the present, Fem!Harry makes a friend at the age of seven. This Muggle friend has a Squib mother and she learns magic and the Wizarding world sooner than canon. The family has secrets of their own that she's not privy to, and it's all about Holly and Alex trying to maintain their unlikely friendship while running a \"potions for Muggles\" business.\n\nThis fic was inspired by a number of ideas: ones where wizards secretly sell magical items to Muggles, Harry/Muggle OC fics (and the lack of Fem!Harry/Muggle fics), Squib/Squib discrimination fics a la The Second String, fics where a witch or wizard (Muggle-born or half-blood) befriend Muggles in childhood, but instead of bailing on them at 11, they're let in on the secret, and a few more to be revealed.

But Lt. Columbo is convinced this was no accident. Jim Carrey, Willem Dafoe, and The Muppets guest star.\n\nThis one's a wild ride from start to finish, but it's brilliant and fun despite the murders.

It has a rare trope I'm nuts about, where one character is being rescued but is certain that it's just a hallucination and not actually happening.

Seungmin looks a little like a too good to be true remedy to that lack served to him on a silver platter. But is it so bad to want to be wanted?\n\nHonestly blown away by this gem, an instant favorite and sure to be a personal classic over time. A fine balance between funny and (very) hot!",

All the characters are written very well, and it can be read fandom-blind on either side of IT or DEH likers (though no IT characters show up aside from the clown- it's more the DEH characters are the Loser's Club. Probably a little harder to read fandom blind on the DEH side, though I'm pretty sure you could). Genuinely great! Check it out if you like scary/creepy fics with queer romance (both f/f and m/m) with discussions of mental illness and a good helping of freaky clowns.  \nTrigger warnings are at the top of each chapter and tagged appropriately, but for safety's sake: Blood, gore, intrusive thoughts, self harm and suicide, paranoia, body horror, and dissociation. It's pretty rough, so read the tags if you check it out.",

I'm not done, but what I have read is good. MacCready is shown in a believable and respectful light, and has motivation so relatable (saving his family) it's heartbreaking at times. The new friendlies are well-written, the enemies are complicated, and the setting is very well portrayed.

So when a failed attempt to cheer him up by the Six Sins leads Lucifer Morningstar, lord of the Seven Circles of Hell and Rubber Duck Enthusiast, into a random bar in a random city the last thing he's expecting is to strike up a conversation with someone who understands the pain of lost love.\n>\n>Naturally, things quickly spiral out of hand as Lucifer, now Lucius Magne, tries to date the lovely Camila Noceda while hiding his true nature, completely unaware that Camila is doing the exact same thing with the true nature of her daughters college... and her other daughters species. Add in some troublesome earth-bound imps, Some troublesome Sins trying to 'help' him, and trying to run an entire dimension sized kingdom and you got a romantic comedy for the ages.\n>\n>One could almost call it a Divine Comedy.\n\nIt started out as a crack ship fic but is genuinely well written and has only grown in detail and complexity. It puts in a lot of work to combine the lores/universes of The Owl House and the Helluvaverse and actually gets pretty creative with it. The characterizations are solid and actually makes Lucifer Morningstar and Camila Noceda a compelling couple. It\u2019s not just a romcom and does have some angst in it. It also follows the perspectives of multiple characters and has multiple storylines going at once. It takes place after the finale time skip in TOH but before the pilot of Hazbin Hotel. Obviously very canon divergent but in such a fascinating way as the actions taken by characters that only change because of Lucifer and Camila\u2019s romance stack up to make such interesting ripple effects. \n\nIf you like either or both fandom I highly recommend it. I don\u2019t know what confusions could arise from not being into TOH and the Helluvaverse, but it explains things pretty well and I don\u2019t doubt that most details could be learned through context.",

And then they would just sigh and look at the camera and say 'This isn't going very well, is it?'. \n> \n> I'd look out at the audience and see 200 souls leave 200 bodies because they were just told they were not getting a good show. But that's not showbusiness. Showbusiness is 'You're getting the greatest show in the world!'\"",
            "Okay, but like...what about the \"sorry, no beta\" thing? I've come across it MANY times and it never deters me from reading something. It just reminds me that the author is one person and mistakes are bound to leak through no matter how many times they've edited. That doesn't mean they don't care or don't have confidence in their writing or that their work isn't worth giving a chance.\n\nAnd although I agree with the sentiment of having pride in your writing without apologizing, it seems that based off of some of these comments, I (personally) think that some readers can be ridiculously hypercritical.",
            "I automatically believe you. If you think it's bad enough to apologize for it, that tells me I shouldn't read it.",
            "My mentor told me this when I was still articling: \"no one (especially a client) wants a lawyer who opens up to the judge with, 'sorry, this is my first time, I might not be good at this.'  It immediately undermines you in front of your audience.\"\n\nFake it 'til you make it.  I think most people are definitely guilty of it at some point, but you just have to take the plunge.",
            "Yes... except for when they say English isn't my first language because most of the time that is an indicator for me that it is gonna be most likely brilliant.",
            "If anything, I'm all the likely not to click on any story that specifies \"this is my first story\" or any other such explanation or apology.\n\n\nPeople should just let their stories speak for themselves. If it's bad, no amount of apologies or justifications will make the story *not* bad, and if it's good, I don't think any explanations matter anyway.",
            "hard agree. it\u2019s a big pet peeve of mine",
            "This, and also, just own your writing in general and don't apologize or call your own writing bad. It's off-putting to the readers and you're bringing down your own self-esteem for no real reason.",
            "You raise a very good point that I think applies to self-deprecation in general. That is, when we talk poorly of ourselves for any reason, that doesn't always affect only us, even if we don't mean to put anyone down other than ourselves. This is something that I've had to be mindful of over the years, and it's changed the way I talk about myself, at least publicly.\n\nI used to hold myself to ridiculously high standards for no valid reason. If I wrote less than 5k every day, I would get really down on myself- it was kind of delusional, honestly. The way I felt was very real, though, even if it was silly for me to have that mindset. I was genuinely upset with myself for not keeping up with what I expected of myself, and would lament as such among friends. I was so caught up in my own nonsense that it didn't dawn on me that it was discouraging someone close to me who wasn't able to write as often as me. If I didn't think what I was doing enough, then what did that imply about what they were doing? In actuality, I'd never impose my absurd mindset onto anyone else and I genuinely assert that getting any writing done whatsoever is a blessing, but in getting caught up in my own head I was still hurting someone whether I meant to or not. I tend to be a bit oblivious to social situations at times, but when I realized what I was doing, I resolved to give myself a reality check and be a little more conscientious of how I talk about myself and my writing around others."
