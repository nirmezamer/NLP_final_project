Their destinies lay in different worlds: witch and Muggle; magic and science; Scotland and London. Then Alex came up with the idea of selling potions to Muggles. Their waning bond is revived, but can it last while running a nascent illegal business, the challenges of school and new relationships? Fem!Harry, Time-shifted AU, Pre-Hogwarts, Years 2-4.\n\n\u2728More details \u2728\n\nSet in an AU that's moved closer to the present, Fem!Harry makes a friend at the age of seven. This Muggle friend has a Squib mother and she learns magic and the Wizarding world sooner than canon. The family has secrets of their own that she's not privy to, and it's all about Holly and Alex trying to maintain their unlikely friendship while running a \"potions for Muggles\" business.\n\nThis fic was inspired by a number of ideas: ones where wizards secretly sell magical items to Muggles, Harry/Muggle OC fics (and the lack of Fem!Harry/Muggle fics), Squib/Squib discrimination fics a la The Second String, fics where a witch or wizard (Muggle-born or half-blood) befriend Muggles in childhood, but instead of bailing on them at 11, they're let in on the secret, and a few more to be revealed. Starts the summer after 2nd year with flashbacks to pre-Hogwarts events.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcab**Other Harry Potter fics (all rated T)**\ud83d\udcab:\n\n**A Date With Destiny**\n\nGenre: Angst/Adventure\n\nAO3: https://archiveofourown.org/works/37456591/chapters/93476185\n\nFFN: https://www.fanfiction.net/s/14046756/1/A-Date-With-Destiny\n\nSummary: After awakening from a magical coma to discover his best friends now dating, Ronald Weasley sets out to forge his own path, discovering who he is by discovering who he isn't.

Keeping Harry alive and away from the Weasleys while maintaining her Prefect status is no easy task, and that's before a certain Weasley starts sneaking around with a Slytherin... Crack/Parody, H/Hr pairing. 5th-year subplot.\n\n\n**Tale of a Weasley Tail**\n\nAO3: https://archiveofourown.org/works/54672061\n\nSummary: After the events of Ron\u2019s second year, the Weasleys go to Australia instead of Egypt.

I know I sound cranky, but I've lost count of the amount of frantic posts I've seen where people are like \"I can't find this fic anywhere, HELP\" only for me to find it within minutes by just entering a few keywords and tags to find it.

It's great that we have this community where people can spread the words about things they enjoyed reading. Besides, you get to talk to people about common fics that you read. Sometimes when I give recommendations, people come back and tell me how much they enjoyed it.

            "Okay, but like...what about the \"sorry, no beta\" thing? I've come across it MANY times and it never deters me from reading something. It just reminds me that the author is one person and mistakes are bound to leak through no matter how many times they've edited. That doesn't mean they don't care or don't have confidence in their writing or that their work isn't worth giving a chance.\n\nAnd although I agree with the sentiment of having pride in your writing without apologizing, it seems that based off of some of these comments, I (personally) think that some readers can be ridiculously hypercritical.",
            "My mentor told me this when I was still articling: \"no one (especially a client) wants a lawyer who opens up to the judge with, 'sorry, this is my first time, I might not be good at this.'  It immediately undermines you in front of your audience.\"\n\nFake it 'til you make it.  I think most people are definitely guilty of it at some point, but you just have to take the plunge.",
            "Yes... except for when they say English isn't my first language because most of the time that is an indicator for me that it is gonna be most likely brilliant.",
            "I automatically believe you. If you think it's bad enough to apologize for it, that tells me I shouldn't read it.",
            "hard agree. it\u2019s a big pet peeve of mine",
            "This, and also, just own your writing in general and don't apologize or call your own writing bad. It's off-putting to the readers and you're bringing down your own self-esteem for no real reason.",
            "It\u2019s a common defense mechanism of amateur writers who are just starting out. It\u2019s hard putting stuff out in front of strangers, especially when you know just enough to know you\u2019re not amazing. They think if they denigrate it first, then it will protect them from criticism and make them feel less vulnerable in front of their audience. Fortunately most grow out of it eventually.",
            "Go in the other direction. Sorry, my fic will keep you up all night. Say goodbye to your sleep schedule.",
            "Another type of apology I've seen sometimes is like \"Sorry I wrote this at 3am while high and drunk\" type of stuff. I definitely didn't need to know that. That makes it sound like a low-effort mess, so, of course I'm not going to read it. Then again, maybe it is a low-effort mess. I guess I'll never know.",
            "I like when people introduce their fics like a villain. Subject us poor mortals to your strange and niche interests, then take the unsuspecting readers as thralls, blast us with the plot beam and kick us down the cliffhanger lmao"
