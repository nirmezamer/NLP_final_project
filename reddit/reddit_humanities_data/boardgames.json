            "Me and my boyfriend love 7 duel we have all the expansions we also have some cute games like sabobatage. My personal favourite that we have played together is Watergate. He enjoys complex and strategic games and I do as well, we like war themes or something with a good story that plays at around 2 hours or so. We aren't really looking for a quick 20 minute game but one that plays longer with more strategy and depth. Looking to buy one today has anyone got any recommendations? Thank you! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nWe are looking for 7/10 complexity\n\nWe have enjoyed:\n7 Duel\nSabobatage \nWatergate \n\nWe have not enjoyed:\nMusket and Pike\nPandemic (we are not into cooperative more competitive games!)",
            "Twilight Struggle might be right up your alley.",
            "**War Chest** is a great chess-like game with a unique bag building mechanic and satisfying weighted poker chips for pieces. Each player controls 4 unique units that are different from what their opponent has. A pregame unit draft makes things even more enjoyable. Games take an hour or so.  \n\n**Targi** is a 2P worker placement game that any fan of 7WD should try. It\u2019s completely different gameplay, but both games have this nice tension between choosing something that\u2019s good for you and something that hurts/blocks your opponent. Targi combines these two forces in a really interesting way. 45-60m playtime.\n\nBe careful asking for a \u201c7/10\u201d complexity game around these parts of the internet; people might start recommending Lacerda games. BoardGameGeek complexity/weight ratings for 7WD and Watergate are both under 2.5 out of 5, aka 5 out of 10.  \n\nHere\u2019s a BGG search for games that support 2P, have a weight/complexity of 3 to 3.5, and take 1.5-2.5 hours to play: [LINK](https://boardgamegeek.com/search/boardgame?sort=bggrating&advsearch=1&q=&include%5Bdesignerid%5D=&include%5Bpublisherid%5D=&geekitemname=&range%5Byearpublished%5D%5Bmin%5D=&range%5Byearpublished%5D%5Bmax%5D=&range%5Bminage%5D%5Bmax%5D=&range%5Bnumvoters%5D%5Bmin%5D=&range%5Bnumweights%5D%5Bmin%5D=50&range%5Bminplayers%5D%5Bmax%5D=2&range%5Bmaxplayers%5D%5Bmin%5D=2&range%5Bleastplaytime%5D%5Bmin%5D=90&range%5Bplaytime%5D%5Bmax%5D=150&floatrange%5Bavgrating%5D%5Bmin%5D=&floatrange%5Bavgrating%5D%5Bmax%5D=&floatrange%5Bavgweight%5D%5Bmin%5D=3.0&floatrange%5Bavgweight%5D%5Bmax%5D=3.5&colfiltertype=&searchuser=sideburns&nosubtypes%5B0%5D=boardgameexpansion&playerrangetype=normal&B1=Submit)  \n\nSo maybe check out Terraforming Mars? Or one of its slightly more approachable siblings, Ares Expedition or TM Dice Game. I would not buy Scythe for 2p. And games like Puerto Rico and Power Grid also need at least 3p to work, and are best at 4.  \n\nThere\u2019s a tier of games just slightly lighter than the above search results, which would include things like **Lost Ruins of Arnak** and **Great Western Trail** and even classic worker placement games like **Agricola** and **Castles of Burgundy** - maybe check some of those out?"

I bought myself an acoustic guitar this week, and I am so excited about playing and learning again. I love the way it feels and sounds.\n\nWhat musical instrument can you play?

I have the 2nd edition, which includes a letter from Tolkien where he was trying to justify to his publisher that they should publish it alongside LotR and describing what his vision was. In that context, I see what he was doing, but... I don't know, in the end it was a little too dense for me.\n\nAnd then, for something much lighter, there was [*Help Fund My Robot Army!*](https://www.johnjosephadams.com/projects/help-fund-my-robot-army-other-improbable-crowdfunding-projects/) \n\nBut mostly at this point I'm excited that my hold of *Tidal Creatures*, the newest in the series that started with *Middlegame*, is marked as in transit at the library.",

You have a mission, and getting side-tracked by random monsters is not helping you achieve it. You are simply wasting time playing the super hero. Taple top RPGs and video games have taught us that you can ignore the main objective to focus on random side quests without any consequences, but that's not how it would work in real life.",

I haven\u2019t played in years and looking at the current cards confuses the hell out of me, but that article is probably essential reading for any game designer.",
            "I mean, honestly, it's pretty legendary. It innovated on so many gameplay mechanics we take for granted today and other games have built on top of - collectibility, the mana resource system, the color pie.\n\nIt's flexible enough to have lasted for 30 years and counting, and still have new innovations being built on top of it today, but the core fundamental mechanics are still clear enough that you could easily open a starter deck from decades ago and play it.\n\nThe only thing I would probably count against it is that the color pie occasionally gets imbalanced at any given period of time. I believe right now green is probably right now the more \"overpowered\" color, but at given times throughout Magic's history, it's been blue or black too. Some better Magic historians might know, but I can't think of a time off the top of my head when white or red would have been considered the dominant colors.",
            "I think it's very impressive how solid a system it is and that it hasn't completely buckled under its own weight. My positive feelings about it boil down to respect/admiration.\n\nAs a modern day game it's not at all my cup of tea though and kind of the antithesis of what I like about games. It's overly complicated, has lots of keywords that are constantly added to keep the game relevant, a million little micro-phases, awful mana system, boring combat, has necessary homework to understand new sets, is a TCG.",
            "I legitimately think that the mana system is a straightforward mistake. Nobody should lose to mana flood or mana screw as often as happens in MTG, and more modern similar systems (like Lorcana or Star Wars Unlimited) are straight-up improvements.",
            "For most games, the adage \"if I have seen far, it's because I stood on the shoulders of giants\" applies.\u00a0 Almost every game out there is building off of other ideas, which isn't a bad thing, generally.\u00a0 Using good ideas to make better ideas works great.\n\n\nFrom a game design perspective, Magic was standing on the shoulders of toddlers.\u00a0 It's absolutely incredible how seamless the design was given how little like it existed when it was made.\u00a0 It's like if the first movie ever made was Shawshank Redemption.\u00a0 Like, that's totally crazy that the first try for a TCG is inarguably top tier.\n\n\nPeople hate on the mana system, but it's actually really good.\u00a0 It creates so much variance in gameplay that you don't get in the other TCG's that \"improved\" on the system.\n\n\n\nAnd all that's not even touching on the fact that it's completely modular.\u00a0 There are dozens of ways to play, and you can even essentially use Magic as a framework to design your own games.\u00a0 It's called \"cube.\"\u00a0 You put together a pile of cards that you think will be cool, and you (and all the other players) draft from just that pile and pretend no other cards exist.\u00a0 It completely changes the power level of each card because it's always dependent on the cards around it.\u00a0 How many other games is that possible with?!\n\n\nI won't claim that Magic is perfect, but it's great.\u00a0 The designers make a lot of mistakes, but they make a lot more hits, and they've honestly had a pretty good track record.\u00a0 You can't get too mad when Tom Brady throws one interception, you know?",

Knowing how to play your deck is important, but owning a powerful deck is even more important.\n\nOf course it has financial reasons, but as we set this subject aside... Well, I think playing a game should happen during the game itself.",

It has its drawbacks and issues, but very few of them are mechanical. It\u2019s wild because even with the power creep of recent years, some of the most powerful magic cards of all time are the old cards. That\u2019s impressive game development.",
            "Magic is an incredible game. It wouldn't have been as successful as it has been if the base game wasn't fun and if they weren't good at refreshing it several times per year. If you are at all interested in games in this genre, and familiar with Magic, you could easily buy some carefully-chosen Magic cards, put them in a box, treat this as a board game, never buy another card, and have it be a 10/10 game... and one for which there are many many expansions available if you ever want them (though this might not appeal to players who are completionists). (You can also achieve this with proxies, if you want the expensive cards)\n\nIt is several games in one - for example, each new set is created for limited, competitive constructed, and casual constructed formats - and this means that some of its design choices are not ideal for any one of them. For instance, there are powerful rares for constructed that make limited less fun, and cards that are necessary for limited that won't be ever played in constructed. Though on the flip-side, it's pretty impressive that the same set of cards can be used for so many different formats. Some similar sacrifices are made due to its business model, for instance putting various necessary cards at higher rarities.\n\nThe mana system is often complained about, to the extent that there have been tens or hundreds of CCGs that have attempted to fix it. Most of them are dead.\n\nUnfortunately, it's both an expensive game, and one with a business model that has some problems... but this is tied to how great a game it is. Wizards is willing to spend a LOT of resources on making Magic a great game (seriously - it has whole departments of people working full-time on its design, compared to individual designers for most board games), because it makes them a lot of money, because it's selling gambling to kids.",
            "I love it. I mean there are TCGs out there that had better gameplay IMO, but they died out, VS being the most notable one for me. I think the most enduring thing about it is that it was created without being tied to another IP so they had no issues with licensing and other problems that other TCGs had"

        "content": "There have been a few posts the last few days of people having negative experiences with Arcs. While of course it is perfectly okay to not like or even hate the game; in both instances the original poster played their first game with an expansion and then got frustrated when not knowing the rules or basic strategy. \n\nTo clarify, there are essentially 3 \u201cmodes\u201d that you can play Arcs in. **None of them are a training mode or a tutorial**. \n\n1) Base game Arcs\n\n2) Arcs + Leaders and Lore\n\n3) Blighted Reach Campaign Expansion \n\n\nBase game Arcs without Leaders and Lore is a complete game. You could very well play the game this way every time. This is not a tutorial, it is not a walkthrough, it is not a watered down version of the game. This version of the game is not asymmetrical. Everyone has the same rules and no one has any special powers or abilities. **This should be the way you play the first 1-3 times you play the game**. If you prefer a game that has less rules overhead and no asymmetry then you could always play this way. I don\u2019t know how this thought got out there that this is boring/watered-down/training version of the game. It\u2019s not. \n\nLeaders and Lore is an add on you can play with with the base game (there\u2019s some L&L cards in the base game and an additional expansion that adds more). As is stated in the rule book in big bold letters, **You should play and understand the base game before you add Leaders and Lore**. Leaders and Lore gives players special starting positions/pieces and special powers/abilities/perks. While some might look at the cards and think they don\u2019t add too much rule overhead and so start with this mode, L&L does add asymmetry that can make it much harder to know what to do or stop other players if you don\u2019t know the base game. **Even if you have played asymmetrical or heavy games before, don\u2019t start with this mode**. As stated above, this isn\u2019t the \u201cfull game\u201d mode. It\u2019s just additional asymmetry and variety that you can add if that is something you want.\n\nThe Blighted Reach Campaign expansion turns the base game into a 3 game mini campaign. **Do not play this expansion until you feel confident with the base game + Leaders and Lore**. Seriously, starting with the campaign is not going to be a fun experience. The campaign assumes you have mastered base game +leaders and lore and throws a bunch of wrenches and craziness at you. Again, you might assume that since you\u2019ve played heavy games before that the rules aren\u2019t too crazy, but to enjoy the campaign you really need to understand the strategy and nuances of the base game. There also seems to be this idea that Blighted Reach is the \u201cfull game\u201d and the base game doesn\u2019t stand on its own. This is not true, they are very different things.\n\nTl;dr:\n\nBase game: always start with this. Best continued play for players who want a tight / strategic game without asymmetry (think Pax Pamir) \n\nBase + Leaders and Lore: add it in when you know the base game if you want something with more variety and asymmetry (think Root)\n\nBlighted Reach: should only be played after fully grasping L&L. Play this if you want a branching mini campaign with crazy rules and swings. (Think Root and Oath mixed with more story handholding) ",

            "I really enjoyed the interconnectedness of the base games systems. The utilization of the rescources while they are at the same time important for scoring, was a quick realisation. The importance of control was a little bit lost in the first game.\n\nSadly the emotional rollercoaster, that Arcs is, was a little bit too much for the group that evening. It goes very fast from \"OH, YES!\" to \"OH, FUCK NO!\" and the opportunistic mindset one has to enact, adapting from round to round and board state to board state, wasn't everyones cup of tea.",
            "My favorite game is Twilight Imperium. I played my first game of Arcs using just the base game (and without breaking the rules like some other negative reviews have done).\n\nI am so glad I did. I love the game, but leaders+lore would have resulted in a much worse experience thanks to the asymmetry.\n\nI also love how Leder has created 3 experiences here that all play nicely. I can ease people in with the tight base game, get them excited to try leaders+lore, and then work folks up to doing a campaign. Unraveling the game is a genuinely nice experience because the game continues to surprise.",
            "I agree with OP\u2019s general sentiment, but I don\u2019t think Leaders and Lore is a necessary step to the campaign. Leaders and Lore is great way to add asymmetry to a one off game, but it doesn\u2019t really teach you anything you need to know about the game to step into the campaign.\n\nThe base game, with or without Leaders and Lore, is a complete experience in and of itself. I think a lot of people who haven\u2019t followed the game might view base Arcs as a lesser experience because you\u2019re not using all the stuff, which I suspect might be why some go straight to the campaign. As a completionist who\u2019s into very heavy games, I get it, but it\u2019s not the right approach here.",
            "Pssh ya right why would I listen to the game's designers? \n\nI know what I'm doing and th- wait what the fuck how does this part work? These rules are confusing I don't understand how these systems work together and this strategy seems broken after one play. \n\nShit game 0/10",
            "It's not IMPOSSIBLE to start with The Blighted Reach... but any such players should go in with the knowledge that they're being tossed into the deep end of a very turbulent pool without water wings on.",
            "I bought the base + L&L because I see Blighted Reach is twice the price of the base game. What will I be missing out on if I don't get Blighted Reach? I'm just a bit skeptical that the expansion costs more than the base game.",
            "How good is this for 2 players?",
            "I think that \u201ewatered down/training\u201c version argument comes from the elitists that have to show constantly how smart they are and that their brain cannot be bothered to play anything below a weight of 3.50. \n\nI mean, I love playing Parks, dog park and other light games as much as heavier games. Having an easier to get into, but with still deep mechanics game like arcs is great. And the possibility to make it meatier for people who have the time and motivation to go deeper down the rabbit hole is great. Doesn\u2018t mean it makes base game redundant by any means. \n\nDefinitely going to play base game everytime a new player is there.",
            "I appreciate this post. Played my first (base only) game last night and had a blast. \n\nI was certainly glad that we didn\u2019t add in Lore and Leaders. There\u2019s so much to learn (not necessarily rules, but strategy and interactions of players and mechanics) that adding in faction asymmetry would have surely melted my feeble mind.",
            "I get and agree with the sentiment, everyone should probably follow the recommendations in the rulebook but this post feels a bit like gaslighting:\n\n>I don\u2019t know how this thought got out there that this is boring/watered-down/training version of the game.\n\nThe big selling pitch of the game during the Kickstarter when most people bought it was a limited campaign and Cole was clear this was his original vision of the game. They also said they found it works really well without it but one of the few early reviews, from Space Biff, was not exactly glowing. \n\nI mean base Arcs from what I understand is lacking in the titular arcs that the Blighted Reach adds. \n\nIt's pretty easy to see where this idea comes from, hopefully the fans appreciate that the game has developed alot since then and that includes the best way to get into the game but for so many people buying in, they bought it for what the Blighted Reach adds."
