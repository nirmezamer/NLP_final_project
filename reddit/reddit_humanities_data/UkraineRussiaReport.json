            "BREAKING: African leaders are on an emergency flight to Moscow with a new peace plan for Shoigu and Prigozhin.",
            "Got banned from /r/CombatFootage and suspended from reddit for 3 days for posting ... wait for it... combat footage on the /r/CombatFootage sub BEFORE reddit introduced a rule specifically targeting anything anti-Israel. This site is a joke. Even more so than when the Russian invasion began.",
            "Biden: If Putin wins against Ukraine he is coming for all NATO countries therefore we should admit Ukraine to NATO because Putin will be scared to attack a NATO country.",

            "Just imagine Prigozhin is just drunk sitting in his tent making angry messages on telegram and the entire Russian state shat itself and stationed tanks in Moscow and Putin fled on his train in reaction to it.",
            "So Wagner has shown that you can march on Moscow with a few thousand mercenaries, unsuccessfully coup the government and still end up with no reprisals. Certainly a good sign for a healthy state.",
            "Henry Kissenger is dead and shockingly just about everyone is ecstatic in these divided times. From the Cambodia sub, the Chile Sub, Leftist subs, the default news sub, and way more are happy. Even the Conservative sub has little kindness for him and his actions. Can't say it's not deserved though."
