I have an artillery military specialization (doing command post math) and officer rank that I got after completing the military classes and training along with my main math major in a regular civilian university (kinda standard thing in Russia, inherited from USSR). This is not equal to the full military service though.\n\nIn summer 2023 my parents received a mobilization notice for me (povestka). Since I don't permanently live in Russia I can be detached from the service (weird but its the law). I did that legal procedure and came to Russia for this New Year.\n\nLeft Russia normally without any issues.\n\nP.S. Enjoyed my stay. The weather was great",

If Russia transfers even old Soviet technology - the NK ICBMs gain 10 warheads each, plus penetration aids. That's 100 nukes (plus penetration aids) to intercept and the task becomes impossible.\n\nThe article is also ingenious on South Korea. It says:\n\n>\"Reports from earlier in the war say South Korea may have provided 155mm artillery shells to the United States to replace 155mm rounds sent to Ukraine.\"\n\nIt is common knowledge, verified by video evidence, that SK provided millions of 155mm shells for Ukraine.
