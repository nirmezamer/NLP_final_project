I was taken back by her request -- I really thought it had something to do with the nursery or diaper brand. I said I was sorry but only my mom and my husband will be there. She made a face, got quiet for a while then brought it up again. just kept pushing saying she is as much of a grandmother as my mom and that she just wanted to be there for support and get the opportunity to see her grandbaby's first moments. my husband sided with her.\n\nI just stared at her and said \"it's alright, you can have the opportunity to be in the delivery room when it's your son who's giving birth\". everyone stopped eating and my mother in law left the table in an instance. My husband had me got up although I wasn't finish with dinner but he said we should leave.\n\nIn the car, he lost it on me asking \"what brain cell\" made me think it was a good idea to tell his mom that. I told him his mom kept pushing after I'd already given her an answer. still he said this was the most fucked up shit he heard me say. I replied that I was just frustrated and didn't mean to hurt her feelings and cause issues. he argued that if I don't want issues then I should stop making shit difficult and just say yes to his mom's request. he then ranted about how it's his son too and then said if his mom isn't allowed in there then he won't be there too. now I don't know if he really meant this or just said it in the hear of the moment but it had me fuming.\n\nHe's been ignoring me when I try to talk to him and act like I'm not in the room.

        "content": "I (34F) recently lost my sister (41F) to cancer. It was devastating, and I'm still processing the grief. My sister was a single mom to three kids: Jake (14M), Emma (12F), and Lily (8F). In her will, she named me as the guardian for her children.\n\nHere's where things get complicated. I've never wanted kids of my own. I love my nieces and nephew, but I've always been the \"fun aunt\" who takes them out for ice cream or to the movies. I've never had to be responsible for major decisions about their lives.\n\nI have a demanding career as a corporate lawyer, often working 60+ hours a week. I live in a small one-bedroom apartment in the city, which is perfect for me but definitely not suitable for three growing kids. My lifestyle involves a lot of travel and late nights at the office. I'm also in a relatively new relationship (10 months) with my loving boyfriend, who's childfree by choice like me.\n\nWhen my sister first told me about her decision to name me as guardian, I expressed my concerns. I told her that I didn\u2019t feel comfortable with that role because I didn\u2019t think my boyfriend, job, and lifestyle wouldn\u2019t survive it. She assured me that it was just a precaution and that she was sure she'd beat the cancer. I didn\u2019t press the issue because I thought/hoped she would beat the cancer, and also because I wanted her to remain optimistic. We never really had another serious conversation about it.\n\nNow that she's gone, I've told my family that I don't think I can take the kids. I've suggested that our parents (mid-60s, retired) take them instead, or possibly our older brother (40M) who has two kids of his own and lives in a large house in the suburbs.\n\nMy family is furious with me. They say I'm selfish and that I'm abandoning the kids when they need someone the most. They argue that it was my sister's dying wish for me to raise her children and that I'm \u201cpissing all over\u201d her memory by refusing. My parents say they're too old to raise young kids again, and my brother claims he can't afford three more children.\n\nThe kids themselves are understandably upset and confused. Jake, the oldest, overheard a conversation among family members and then Skyped me, visibly upset, saying that I'm abandoning them just like their dad did (he left when Lily was a baby).\n\nI feel absolutely terrible about the whole situation. I love my nieces and nephew, and I want what's best for them. But I honestly don't think I'm equipped to raise three kids. I\u2019m also dealing with my own grief, and I'm worried that if I take them in I'll end up resenting them or not giving them the care and attention they deserve.\n\nI've offered to contribute significantly, financially, to their care, whoever ends up taking them in. I've also said I'd still be involved in their lives as their aunt, but I just don't think I can be their full-time guardian. My brother told me my life has changed and that I need to embrace it. I feel trapped with no way out, and most of my days are spent crying.",

Make the argument! Your brother is the best candidate! You won\u2019t pass a social services inspection and checks! (Play on that!).",
            "NTA - truthfully throwing 3 kids who lost their mother, and whose father abandoned them at someone who wanted to be childfree is a recipe for disaster. They are going to have emotional issues that are more than just making sure they live in a safe environment with their needs met. You are going to give up your job, bf, home and perceived future for them, so now there are 4 people living together in emotional hardship. This will be harder for you to manage than it would be for someone who just gave birth to 3 kids. This is the reason your brother and parents don\u2019t want the responsibility. They\u2019ve had kids and know how hard it is going to be in this situation, and they don\u2019t want to deal with it. They\u2019re banking on you being ignorant to that, and hope you can be guilted into being the sacrifice. \n\nI\u2019m not going to tell you what to do, but as a parent , I want you to know what you\u2019re stepping into before you decide. Your experience as a parent won\u2019t be like your parents or your brother. It   Is going to be exceedingly tough, so think carefully for all four of your sakes before you choose.",

I don't know how \"binding\" the (un)agreement is on you, but of course the children's welfare is paramount and a foster parent who doesn't want the kids (for very sound reasons, I agree) is not the best solution. The sibling with the big house and existing family seems best. NTA at all.",

You refuse to dedicate your life to a dying person\u2019s selfish \u201clast wish\u201d - if your sister cared as much about her kids as you\u2019re supposed to, she would have found a different guardian when you told her you\u2019re uncomfortable with it.\n\nSee, I\u2019m not involved, so I can be the asshole and state the obvious here.\u00a0",
            "NTA. Having someone who isn't interested in or wanting to raise kids take over three young kids is a terrible idea.\n\nFirst, for your brother, raising the kids would likely provide social security benefits & you could probably contribute significantly as well for the cost of raising them.\n\nFor your parents, they have the time & should support them.\n\nAnd finally, WTF is wrong with your family that they can't keep this wrangling away from the kids.",
            "NTA. Your parents are not that old and it\u2019s not like the kids are tiny babies. Also, how do they expect you to provide for the kids financially when you lose your job from it being able to fulfill all your work commitments bc you now have 3 kids? I\u2019m so sorry your sister passed on but it was shitty of her to even put you in this postion in the first place.",
            "Really tough situation. Was there any estate left? Will the rest of the family contribute to the care of the kids, or are you expected to shoulder all of it? Also depends how generous your income is - is a live-in nanny and a larger apartment doable on your income? Do you live in the same area as your sister? Also.. sorry for your loss.",
            "How did you find out you were named as guardian in your sister\u2019s will? Did you read it yourself or were you just informed? Are you sure you were actually named guardian? \n\nWhen most people set up a guardianship in their will, they usually name several people, provide an explanation as to why they were chosen, and outline guidance for how they want them raised. *Even if you are named as guardian in a will, you are allowed to decline the role.*\n\nI think you need to retain an attorney who specializes in guardianship to review the will to see exactly what was specified. As I understand it, the court will look at many factors to determine the best situation for the kids. A single woman *who doesn\u2019t want kids,* lives in a small city apartment, works 60 hours a week, and would take the kids only out of a sense of obligation is going to look a lot less favorable than the brother\u2019s position of having experience raising children, has a family home, and a two-parent household.\n\nYour sister\u2019s estate can set up a trust for the kids to help out financially, you have offered  monetary support, and the children\u2019s father should be held accountable.\n\nYou have an incompatible lifestyle for raising children and I personally don\u2019t think you should change your entire life\u2019s trajectory when there are other options - including foster care/ adoption by a non-blood relative. You and your family can still be very active in the children\u2019s\u2019s lives with the proper agreement of the foster family. My sister\u2019s grandchildren went into foster care (parents had mental health and drug usage issues) and my sister and her husband see the kids regularly. The kids are all together, well adjusted, and very happy.",

Her love of life was infectious. We would go hiking, eat at restaurants, go to theme parks, take walks on beaches, and everything else. We both loved the outdoors.\n\nAbout three years after we got married, my wife started changing. Instead of going out, she began to become something of a couch potato. She gained weight, started sleeping less, stopped cooking, and frankly became kind of a slob. I put up with this for years. I started cooking on most nights, and I had to hide vegetables in her food for her to eat them. I started doing the dishes every night because I knew she wouldn\u2019t. When I went grocery shopping I abstained from buying my favorite unhealthy foods because I knew she would devour them within hours. I tried to encourage her to start taking care of her health.\n\nNothing changed. Ten years ago, I finally reached my breaking point. I sat her down and gave her an ultimatum: \"Start taking care of your health because if it falls apart, I\u2019m not going to be here to take care of you.\" She was very upset with me, saying \u201cIn sickness and in health my ass\u201d repeatedly, but I told her I didn\u2019t care.\n\nAgain, nothing changed. I\u2019ve stayed active. I go jogging every day and maintain a healthy weight. But over the past five years, she has reached a point where she frankly kind of disgusts me at times. It takes her five minutes or more to get up from her typical position of lying down on the sofa. She has started waddling hunched over. She\u2019s 48 but she honestly looks 10 years older and acts 25 years old.\n\nA month ago, I finally got her to go to the doctor (another one of her reckless behaviors is never going in for check-ups). They discovered that she\u2019s on the verge of type 2 diabetes, has a mild case of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and her blood pressure is concerningly high. Naturally, after receiving such news, on the way home from the hospital she swung by a fast food restaurant to get some food and a shake.\n\nThe other day I sat her down and told her that I simply refuse to be a caretaker for someone who\u2019s not even 50 yet. I told her I would be filing for divorce, but left how we do it (either through lawyers or through a cooperative splitting of assets) up to her. She\u2019s absolutely furious with me, and my parents seem to be on her side.\n\nAm I really the asshole here?",
