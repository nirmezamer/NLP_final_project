        "content": "\nI, 33F, met my husband during university. A mutual friend of ours set us up, and we hit it off instantly. My husband made it immediately clear that he wanted to foster/adopt children in the future and that if I wasn\u2019t okay with it, I would be gone. For context, my husband was adopted when he was 7 and wanted to do the same for others. I also made it clear that I wanted biological children as well, which he was okay with. We ended up married after two years of dating, and both completed our degrees. We currently have two daughters, Rosie5(bio) and Julia7(adopted). We started fostering when my bio daughter was a newborn and adopted Julia around  year ago. Since then, we stopped fostering and chose to focus on our family. However, I\u2019ve noticed my husband clearly favors Julia over Rosie. He takes her out for bonding time but either leaves my daughter or drops her off somewhere else. He doesn\u2019t tuck Rosie into bed anymore, he doesn\u2019t make an effort to go to her events, and he practically ignores her when she\u2019s at home, unless it\u2019s to do something for him like chores. I\u2019ve brought this up constantly to him and I\u2019m at my breaking point. Rosie and Julia are both smart, beautiful, joyous girls. Rosie is both in ballet and gymnastics, highly advanced for her grade level, but has a hard time making friends. Julia has started cheerleading, makes lots of friends, but she does struggle a bit in school, which my husband uses as an excuse to not pay attention to Rosie. I\u2019m currently three months pregnant with our third child, and my husbands reaction to finding out was \u201cwhen can we start fostering again?\u201d Two weeks ago, my daughter asked me \u201cwhy doesn\u2019t daddy love me anymore\u201d and that was when I knew the problem wouldn\u2019t be fixed unless I made a drastic move. I contacted a divorce lawyer and he said nearly everything would be in my favor. We have a prenuptial agreement that allows us to keep nearly everything separate. The house is in my name, we have two separate bank accounts and one joint account, which would be split, I would not be required to pay alimony, and keep one of our cars. Considering I make a substantial amount more than my husband, (250k a year while he makes around 55k) I would be able to continue our lifestyle while he wouldn\u2019t. It also would like prevent him from adopting more children in the future. The situation is ideal for me, besides paying child support, assuming my husband would even be able to support our kids with 50/50 custody. I have no intention of keeping our daughters from him. After speaking with my lawyer I gave my husband an ultimatum, treat both our children equal or I would be filing for divorce. He was enraged after this, screaming about how I\u2019m a b*tch for trying to ruin his life goals and saying how I don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like for children who experienced the foster care system. That our daughter (Rosie) was selfish and she needed to understand why Julia needed more attention than she did. My girls ended up waking up from the noise and came downstairs crying. At this point I was both trying to calm my husband down and comfort my girls all at once. Finally, my husband stopped yelling and I could put the girls back to bed. But I have to admit, I\u2019ve started to resent Julia. I know very well it\u2019s not her fault and I don\u2019t let that affect how I treat my girls, but I sometimes find myself laying awake at night wondering how it would be if we just didn\u2019t have her. I always imagine myself with a toddler and our last one on the way, my husband loving all our kids, being so kind the way he used to. Again, I do not blame Julia whatsoever and I\u2019m very ashamed of these thoughts. However I\u2019m afraid if something happens again I\u2019ll snap and I don\u2019t want to shout at my daughters or husband. I have both girls in therapy already (Julia needs it because of her past, and we had Rosie go when started fostering.) Any advice is appreciated, as well as criticism. I\u2019m also willing to answer any questions. So AITA? \n\nAlso- these are fake names for my daughter\u2019s privacy as well as a throwaway account. ",

I was blackmailed and threatened by him to stay silent for so long. The bruises I had on my ribcage were hidden with clothing so the family never saw. But eventually, I got the courage to escape and ended the toxic relationship.\nI kept in contact with his mum Sandra who is like a second mum to me and we meet for coffees now and again. She doesn\u2019t know the real reason why I broke up with her son. While in therapy, Sandra texted to check how my sessions were going and asked to meet at a cafe afterwards. She knew I was going to therapy but had no clue what for. We sat in the car for a bit, chatted and I showed her briefly some work sheets I was given from my therapist. Basically a print out of a ppt they made about domestic violence. Sandra looked through the sheets, me forgetting that she didn\u2019t even know about it all. She became manic and worried and asked why I have therapy on domestic violence. I would feel terrible just lying to her face so I told her to park in a more private area to chat. I then explained that her son physically abused me. She was mortified to say the least, we both ended up in tears and hugged each other. I received a text a week later from Sandra that she recommend anger management centres and therapy for him, which he refused. So she said unless he seeks help, she\u2019s cutting him out of her life. She cancelled holiday, birthday and Christmas plans with him for the rest of the year. Did not expect that. I then get told by friends that my ex has said he is suicidal now because I told his mum about the abuse.\n\nI know it was her decision to kick him out and his actions to me are unforgivable, but I can't help feeling guilty for breaking up their family and causing her son to be suicidal.

It\u2019s now been a little over 6 years and it has been a roller coaster. We have completely different parenting philosophies as she does not believe in spankings or discipline at all for that matter. She thinks our 7 year old for whatever reason is able to rationalize between right and wrong. Our biggest argument occurred last summer when our son threw a rock at woman while we were hiking. We were above them on the trail and it hit her right on the head to wear she was bleeding so heavily EMS had to be called. I was embarrassed and so livid that when we got back to the hotel I snapped pushed him on the ground, stood over him, and gave him a piece of my mind. My wife was not happy and in turn took our son, got a different hotel, and told my mother in law that she was contemplating on leaving me because she fears for the safety of our son.\n\nThat was the only time I ever snapped at our kid and there have been so many other times where I\u2019ve wanted to. When he raised the window on our dog head and nearly decapitated her\u2026I had to back off. When he urinated in our neighbors pool in front of his young daughters\u2026.I had to back off. We\u2019ve done therapy and counseling. Needless to say that till this day nothing has changed. I decided to bring it up in one of our counseling sessions that I was considering getting a vasectomy and she flipped to the point where our entire ride home she was bawling because she felt as if I was giving up on our dream of having a big family. Her argument was that I was thinking about myself and weaponizing my body as a means to enforce my ideals instead of talking to her. However, thats thing. I\u2019ve spent the last several years telling her that what we\u2019re doing with our son is not working. The gentle parenting, therapy, medication is not working so the best thing I can do for myself at this point is not have any more children with the person who will not let me have any input when it comes to disciplining our child. \n\nSo this week I actually got the vasectomy and my wife was unaware from the time I scheduled to the day of the operation and I told her during breakfast. She has threatened to divorce me because she \u201cdoes not want to spend the rest of my life with someone who will go to such lengths to get their way\u201d. Every time we\u2019ve discussed me getting a vasectomy she\u2019s said that \u201cI\u2019m blowing things out of proportion \u201c and that having children were apart of our future. At this point, I don\u2019t even care anymore.\n",

She was only five years old and passed away from a rare illness. My husband and I were devastated, and we\u2019ve been trying to heal ever since. Iris was our only child, and we haven\u2019t had any more children since her passing.\n\nMy brother (30M) and his wife (28F) are expecting their first child, a girl, and they recently announced that they plan to name her Iris. When they told me, I was shocked and felt a wave of emotions. I told them I wasn\u2019t comfortable with it and that it felt like they were trying to replace my Iris. Iris was our rainbow baby since I suffer with fertility issues. We chose the name because Iris is the greek goddess of rainbows. That might be silly to other people but it means the world to me and my husband.\n\nMy SIL got really upset and said that they\u2019ve always loved the name and that it\u2019s a way to honor my daughter. My brother backed her up, saying that I should be touched by the gesture and that it\u2019s their right to name their child whatever they want.\n\nI understand that they can name their baby anything, but it feels too soon and too painful for me. I asked them to choose another name, but now my family is divided. My parents think I\u2019m being unreasonable and that I should be grateful for the tribute, whilst pretty much everyone else thinks it\u2019s insensitive of my brother and SIL.\n\nI love my brother and his wife and they were our rocks during the loss but they are also aware of how much that name meant to us and how long it took us to figure out a name that summed our baby girl up perfectly, she wasn\u2019t just a rainbow baby, she was our rainbow. She brought the colour back into our life. \n\nI would really like to know how other people would have reacted if they were in a similar situation and also advice on what to do next if you don\u2019t mind.
