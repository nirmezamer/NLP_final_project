Follow these rules and make helping you as easy as possible!\n\n* **Title:** Choose a meaningful title concerning your problem.\n* **Text:** Describing your problem with enough detail is essential. Please realize that helpers are not familiar with your project. Provide all relevant information, so others can immideately understand what you are struggling with.\n\n*Example: Say, you have a problem with lots of identical objects in your scene: Let us know whether you created these copies by hand, used the Particle System or Geometry Nodes.*\n\n* **Images/Videos:** When posting screenshots, show us your **full blender window** (not cropped, no monitor photos). This will make lots of helpful information available to helpers at first sight that may seem irrelevant to you (For example your Blender version). If you add video links, please consider adding time stamp info to the part you want helpers to see.\n\n*You can upload images and short video clips (up to 60s) to* [*imgur.com*](http://imgur.com) *and post the links in your question or as comment.*\n\n* **\\*.blend files:** Don\u2019t add links to your \\*.blend files when posting questions right away. Helpers will ask you for it if they need to take a look. Most people prefer reading a good description and looking at images to see what your post is about.\n* **'Solved' flair:** Once your question was answered, please remember to change the flair of your post to \u201cSolved\u201d, so helpers don\u2019t have to read into your question just to see it has already been answered. \n\n*You can change the flair by clicking on the small icon below your post resembling a label.*\n\n***EDIT: You can also include \"!solved\" in the comments to have Automod change the flair for you.*** \n\n**Be nice and respectful with each other :)**",

            "Reddit made me moderator recently. I simply asked for it and reddit looked into that and approved since the old moderators have obviously been inactive for quite a while now. I think, it would be a good thing if everyone who's interested can get an idea about what I intend to do now.\n\nThe simple answer is: Not too much, actually. I don't plan huge changes in r/blenderhelp, because I think it is pretty fine the way it is and I enjoy this sub. But, like many of you, I felt that this sub needed active moderators to adress the issues that made it more difficult and frustrating to help people lately. Improvements I'm hoping for at the moment are mainly reducing posts that are either spam or just don't belong in this sub as well as improving post quality. My hopes are that having active moderators will help this sub to stay productive and friendly as well as to keep it interesting and fun for everyone.\n\nAt the moment, I'm making myself familiar with the numerous tools and functionalities moderators can use which might take a moment :D I plan to reach out to active and capable people soon to get a few more moderators on board, so we can do this efficiently.\n\nLots of posts are made by first time visitors to r/blenderhelp and I hope that some of them will take notice of the stickied post and/or the rephrased post requirements (those show up when you create a new post). It would be nice if more people took notice of and followed our rules. Helpers could get enough information to work with right from the start and people asking questions could get the answers they are looking for maybe a bit sooner. We'll have to see how that works out.\n\nI updated the rules in the sidebar to hopefully be clearer and a bit more intutive, so people can remind others specifically, if something about their posts... needs some more attention:\n\n1. **Give enough details when asking questions!** (There should be a sufficient written description of the actual problem, what people want to achieve with their project and what their approach was that finally caused the issue)\n2. **Provide sufficient images & full screenshots (not cropped, no monitor photos)!** (Quite important, I think. There are just too many posts with terrible resolution/quality and oftentimes useless imagery)\n3. **No artwork, general feedback requests, tutorials or bug reports.** (From my understanding, feedback requests should not be completely forbidden as long as they ask for help/opinions about specific things. I think, this is in a broader sense also asking for help. An acceptable example would be: \"Does my scene lighting feel realistic? How can I improve it?\" Counter example: \"I made this. What do you think?\" Way too general and not problem related. There definitely is a gray area, I know. However, as long as the number of those posts is rather low, it should not interfere with the \"usual business\" of answering more specific questions. And it might encourage discussions where people can talk about different methods and approaches. If this turns out to be a bad way of handling things, adjustments could be made...)\n4. **Let us know when you've solved it!** (Helpful for sure. I'm aware that changing the flair to \"Solved\" and other functionalities are bugged sometimes. I'm currently figuring out if and how this is something a mod can fix or if that's a general issue on reddit - helpful insights are welcome!)\n5. **Be nice...** (That's a given for most people, but a few sometimes need a little reminder...)\n\n**I want to encourage everyone to remind people of our rules in a respectful way when necessary. It's so much nicer when people talk to each other respectfully instead of sending reports right away. That should be reserved for severe or clearly intentional misbehaviour.**\n\nFrom what I've seen, the vast majority of people has a very similar understanding of what this sub should be and how they want to communicate. The Blender community is full of very skilled and engaged people. Simply looking at the incredible amount of free tutorials and advice out there shows how eager people are to connect and help each other to improve and learn. This sub is simply another platform for people sharing this spirit.\n\nThat's it from me. Have fun :)\n\n-B2Z",
            "I don't know how you finally got the keys to the castle, but all I can say is congratulations!! I'm so thrilled to see the old inactive mods removed. Maybe now this sub can start to truly thrive again.\n\nCould you maybe add a mention to this about taking screenshots rather than phone pics? People are going to do it anyway, but for completeness sake :) You've covered everything else wonderfully.",

            "I added the screenshot over phone pic part. Thx for the kind input :)",
            "I think u/Avereniect is right. It's all relative. Maybe you just happened to watch the one very specific tutoral a day ago that helps you answering a question even if it's only day 3 of your blender journey. If you feel that you can contribute something, you should be allowed to do so.\n\nWhen I started to suggest solutions or approaches in this sub, my suggestions were terrible sometimes (and sometimes they still are :D). But if people point out better ideas or why your idea does not work, you can learn a lot in the process. That's one aspect I really enjoyed since I joined r/blenderhelp. If a suggestion is really good or really bad, it will be reflected in the votes and in many cases ppl also take the time to write a comment about why it's good or bad, so OP can make an informed decision. But thx anyways for taking the time to think about improvements for r/blenderhelp :)"

            "The scale seems off, I think the trees should be smaller. There should also probably be many more of them and additional vegetation. No natural ecosystem is homogenous. Also, I think your trees are floating because the shadows don\u2019t meet them. I\u2019d also add some more terrain detail on the camera-side of the mountains. Nothing major, just some hills or boulders or maybe a river. It\u2019s a good start though.",
            "Scatter the trees, rotate them all so none of them have the same rotation. You can see that they're just copypasted on the left.\n\nAdd some clutter and other vegetation, look at reference photos. Or alternatively just remove the trees altogether and put some large rocks on their place, those trees look wrong for that terrain.",
            "im a beginner too but id say you should work more on the mountains texture and add maybe more details and stuff",
            "I agree with the other comments that you need more vegetation and/or smaller details like rocks, etc.\n\nBut I absolutely love the shape of the mountain and its slopes! How did you make it, if you don't mind me asking?",

            "I'd add dust in the fore/midground, play around with shadows. What looks off to me is the color and shape of trees, I believe they should resemble overall dusty and sandy mood. Sand (especially right in front of the cliff) looks too clean and shiny, I'd make it more rough and add particles as well. Also dunes or some other types of foreground landscape features might help it too. Maybe more ambient occlusion could make it better too because you have a lot of angles there.",
            "Ground texture and displacement, Tree roots and stumps, dead trees without leaves, the lighting is cool but maybe working against it. Try playing with it. Overall the scene looks great with the mountains. Keep up the good work!\n\nEdit: I enjoy free 3d models as it speeds up the time to make a scene. Some sources for great assets are: Blender Kit, Blender Market, Bridge by Unreal Engine\u2014-they have the best photorealistic models but they have a no commercial license, Sketchfab, and Polyhaven\u2014they have great textures and models and can be used for commercially."
