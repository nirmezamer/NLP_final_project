If I saw that he was involved with a video or article, it was going on my to-watch/to-read list.\n\nI think that Cracked team had a very similar energy to Dropout - just funny, intelligent people doing whatever weird stuff they thought would make people (and each other) laugh.",
            "Oh wow, I liked the whole After Hours crew. I also followed some of his YouTube stuff after the cracked layoffs. Im glad he made his way into something else that I watch on the regular. Hopefully we can see him in front of the camera for something.",

Are Cracks seeping into the dropouts who were so humorous in college?\n\nYes, okay, that's a ridiculous stretch. But if they did an after hours dirty laundry they should really get Cody to barback for Grant. It would be hilarious to see him lurking around in the background again.",
