            "New series is fascinating, and I don\u2019t know of much of what it could be. Maybe the advice show that they may or may not have been shooting?",
            "friggin miffed that D20 is starting while i'm back-logging Comedy Bang Bang tour episodes on the daily. I need to retire to a Listening Room for a week or so",

            "Hooooly cow. Fresh off Never Stop Blowing Up. I usually have a hard time getting into Dimension 20. Even Mentopolis, a season that felt hand-crafted for me personally, lost my interest an episode or two before the end. I struggle with the format (ADHD), I've got bones to pick with Brennan's DMing style, I'm an avowed D&D hater... there's a variety of reasons.\n\nBut wowwwwwwww NSBU might be the best thing they've ever done. Absolute star-studded lineup (not that there's a *bad* Dropout lineup). Izzy Roland is the funniest human alive. Rehka Shankar is also the funniest human alive. Ify is HOT AS FUCK (and such a good character actor! what!!). Ally is fully feeling themself and we love to see it. Alex is perfect.\n\nAnd Jacob!! Jacob is so clearly made for this. (Which should've been obvious from his Dragon Ball moments on Sam Says.) He is completely in his element and I fucking love it. I want to say it's criminal he hasn't been on D20 before now, but I dunno if he would've been as good a fit with all the constraints of D&D. Here he can totally let loose and it's so so good.\n\nAnd oh yeah, Brennan is clearly having a blast and it just infuses everything with so much joy. I STILL HAVE A BONE TO PICK WITH YOU SIR but damn do you put on a fine show.\n\nLike, despite my ADHD, I was completely enrapt. It helps that every single one of these people is so good at embodying their characters. The body language, the facial expressions, they all add so much. \n\nthis is gonna be a good fucking season.",
            "Is there like an official schedule somewhere I can bookmark or add to my google calendar? \n\nI'm baffled by all these streaming apps not having a simple calendar somewhere with the release dates of upcoming episodes. (and don't get me started about Amazon putting literally the wrong release date on The Boys episodes)",
            "Why did I get a notification for NSBU Ep. 1 earlier today lol",
            "The new MSN is amazing but the laugh tracks are NOT it. They just got wildly distracting",
            "Yeah i get it birthdays are tough :/ Hope you'll feel better soon :)",
            "Happiest of Birthdays, love. Have an online hug and snug from this old lady\\~"

Of course I'm price comparing!

If I saw that he was involved with a video or article, it was going on my to-watch/to-read list.\n\nI think that Cracked team had a very similar energy to Dropout - just funny, intelligent people doing whatever weird stuff they thought would make people (and each other) laugh.",
            "Oh wow, I liked the whole After Hours crew. I also followed some of his YouTube stuff after the cracked layoffs. I\u2019m glad he made his way into something else that I watch on the regular. Hopefully we can see him in front of the camera for something.",

            "For anyone who doesn't know, Swaim was one of the major writers and stars of the Cracked YouTube channel which made a lot of pop culture related comedy videos that had a lot  in common with Collegehumor of the 2010s. That was until the company fired everyone in 2017. After Hours is a fan favorite that Swaim starred in.\n \n\nFor those who did know that, you might not know that Swaim has a channel called Small Beans which has some podcasts. If you miss the shorter videos with Swaim on camera then you can check out his new series back on Cracked about scifi technology or on Small Beans he does a funny weekly show called Please Send Help where he makes jokes about movie trailers.\n\nIf Swaim appears on screen in any Dropout media, I shall dub this era a RennaiSwaimce."

If you've never seen her old YouTube show on BUILD, it was a delight. She was also incredible as a host of The Pitstop. And, she is naturally, effortlessly funny (although really it comes from a decade+ of putting effort into her drag and starting out being on the mic doing local shows in NYC).\n\nWhat a terrific fit for her to get back to hosting via Dropout, where she could not match the vibe any more perfectly.\n\nI love that it looks like this show's panels will include Dropout regulars, drag stars, and comedy stars - seemingly with a bit of mixing and matching across episodes to make the groups seem not quite as homogenous as on Dirty Laundry.\n\nI'm happy for Mon\u00e9t, I'm happy for Dropout, and I'm happy for us. What a great trailer to drop at the end of Pride Month."
