            "Wiper motors are super hard. Humanoid robots won\u2019t be a problem though.",
            "For anyone interested in getting official recall info, NHTSA's site is here:\n\n[https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?gad\\_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw1emzBhB8EiwAHwZZxYqhVHVpjzQ\\_epmYrqcBHLE4hX5uxRrPeEbJkogNvp8x4ekfcKbP8xoCu8oQAvD\\_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds](https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw1emzBhB8EiwAHwZZxYqhVHVpjzQ_epmYrqcBHLE4hX5uxRrPeEbJkogNvp8x4ekfcKbP8xoCu8oQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)\n\nIf you look for a 2024 Tesla Cybertruck, it will show 4 recalls, 1 investigation, 7 complaints.\n\nThe recalls include the rivet in the pedal, incorrect font size on warning lights, wiper motor problem, and \"truck bed trim\" getting extra double sided tape to keep it from flying off.\n\nLet's look at the truck bed trim:\n\n*\"The Cybertruck is equipped with a* ***cosmetic applique*** *along the* ***exterior*** *of the trunk bed trim, known as the* ***sail applique****, which is affixed to the vehicle with adhesive. On affected vehicles, the sail applique or adhesion may not have been installed according to specification, which may cause the sail applique to become loose or separate from the vehicle.\"*\n\nYes, you read that correctly: The EXOSKELETON is COSMETIC...even if some Branch Elonian insists the sheetmetal adds \"some\" structural strength, because Elon would never lie - TSLA can't bullshit NHTSA as easily as its customers.\n\nAlso of note: on June 10, TSLA made a determination to recall vehicles...but didn't submit it until the 19th - post Technoking's money grab vote.\n\n  \nYou can also fish around in the 'complaints' section - IMHO, most of these are owners venting about terrible TSLA service.  Not really recall material, but interesting that presumably 'hardcore' Elongelicals (devout enough to over-pay for a Cyberstuck) are so frustrated that they vent to NHTSA.\n\n  \nAnd you can browse through the manufacturer communications - some of them are similar to TSBs - instructions on how to fix messed up seals, re-torque bolts that are known to come loose, install seals that were never installed, tighten door strap bolts, replace rear steering actuator??...allegedly for 'enhancement', replace front steering actuator.\n\n  \nNormally this stuff isn't that interesting to me - cars are made by the hundreds of thousands, and there are going to be problems.  But the Clustertruck has such a low production number right now...so each instance/problem represents an unacceptable defect rate.  Which in itself isn't damning - but juxtaposed with Banch Elonians reciting chapter and verse about how TSLA has futuristic \"technology\" and is a leader in design and manufacturing, well - its just a shit show isn't it.",
            "Tomorrow's 5 year Elonversary is an exercise in fabulism, Technoking skillfully steers his flock towards the fine details, lest they notice the absurdity of the big picture he is painting:\n\nStan: *\"How many people BFR new can carry to mars per one flight?\"*\n\nSenpai: *\"About 100, assuming people want cabins. Pressurized volume is similar to A380. Could take a lot more on shorter trips\"*\n\nStan asks the same question about point to point rocket travel\n\nSenpai: *\"\\~1000, as all seats would be \u201ccoach\u201d & no toilets, pilot area or food galley needed. Most flights would only be 15 to 20 mins. It\u2019s basically an ICBM traveling at Mach 25 that lands\"*\n\nStan: *\"Will passengers be allowed to move around during the flight?\"*\n\nSenpai: *\"That would be unwise. Probably needs a restraint mechanism like Disney\u2019s Space Mountain roller coaster. Would feel similar to Space Mountain in a lot of ways, but you\u2019d exit on another continent.\"*\n\nMusk really is a master of his craft...it truly is brilliant to get his parishioners thinking about all seats being \"coach\", so they ignore pesky details about the logistics of lauching 1,000 fucking untrained people at mach-alot strapped to a stack of deadly rocket fuel...seriously, go back and read what he typed: Mach 25!!!...for civilian travel.  What the actual hell?",
            "Fascinating development in the comp case. Elons lawyers submitted a proposed form of final order with a different verdict. Guess they missed the part where they lost. \n\nhttps://montanaskeptic.substack.com/p/musks-latest-tornetta-stunt-is-audacious",
            "As we approach the fabled 8/8... ride sharing as a whole brought in around 50 billion last year. Tesla obviously wouldn't be some large percentage of that even if they were a major player in robotaxis (which they obviously won't be). Even a very optimistic 10% of that... how isn't that already priced in to today's ballooned TSLA.\n\nStans talk like this is a trillion dollar industry any day now and Tesla will suddenly take like 90% of the pot.",
            "reading these headlines and its such bullshit. when tesla sales are down QoQ we're told to look at YoY. when its up QoQ were told to stop caring about the fact that the YoY illustrates that its an ex-growth company.\u00a0",
            "Andy Richter mentioning what would happen if we had a national day off creativity for kids.  (A bit on After Midnight - recommended show btw) (paraphrased)\n\n- a bunch of preschoolers would be asked to design a car. \n\n- they Elon musk would sue them for designing the Cybertruck \n\nAudience loved the joke.",

It\u2019s to sell to more than just those people. Now of course you can\u2019t be the best at everything but what is the cybertruck actually good at as a truck? Size wise is bad, towing is bad, interior is not really as spacious as they make it sound, fancy stuff has been in the industry from some time and been in higher end vehicles, storage is laughable, and suspensions is terrible. The \u201ctruck\u201d is having more issues that the Ford old 4.0 before they finally bulletproofed the engine properly. \n\nThe cybertruck was most likely considered for the Tesla bros who wanted a truck but couldn\u2019t stray from their daddy Elon.

Water froze etc. \n\nTook them 3 months to get the parts and they refused to even give a loaner or take my car back. \n\nQuality control is so bad that whenever I\u2019m using the recommended winter tires and I try to do a U turn the front tires both rub on the inside of the wheel well.
