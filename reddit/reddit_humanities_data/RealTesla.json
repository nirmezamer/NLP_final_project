It\u2019s to sell to more than just those people. Now of course you can\u2019t be the best at everything but what is the cybertruck actually good at as a truck? Size wise is bad, towing is bad, interior is not really as spacious as they make it sound, fancy stuff has been in the industry from some time and been in higher end vehicles, storage is laughable, and suspensions is terrible. The \u201ctruck\u201d is having more issues that the Ford old 4.0 before they finally bulletproofed the engine properly. \n\nThe cybertruck was most likely considered for the Tesla bros who wanted a truck but couldn\u2019t stray from their daddy Elon. Everything about it reeks of Tesla cutting corners heavily and tbh, as a mechanic standpoint, it\u2019ll be more niche than the Hyundai Santa Cruz, which I\u2019d say is more truck in specs and standard that the cybertruck is.",

            "Toyota so far down the list is very surprising. Ram no 1 is also very interesting.\n\nAll exclusive EV makers (Rivian, Tesla, polestar) is far worse than almost all of the traditional OEMs. Long way to go.",
            "These are numbers aggregated across the entire segment, all manufacturers lumped together.\n\nIf you dive into the details, all of the other BEV manufacturers are doing just fine on quality. But Tesla is doing so damn bad, it drags the entire segment down.",
            "It's more that the claims of \"less parts = less repairs\" were bullshit. It's a turn of phrase in manufacturing that should actually say, \"Removing unnecessary parts will generally increase reliability in an assembly.\" The key word there being unnecessary and the fact that we are talking about a specific assembly being more reliable than a version of itself if you remove an unnecessary part. It does not mean that system reliability inversely scales with part count in any meaningful sense for finished products.\n\nIt's also false in the sense that people are acting like \"1 battery, and 2 motors\" is 3 parts and not 3 assemblies, all made up of many parts. By that same logic \"1 engine and 1 transmission\" would be roughly how you evaluated an ICE vehicle.",
            "I think this is right. A lot of typical stuff that breaks on an ICE vehicle doesn\u2019t even exist on an EV like fuel and water pump, timing belt, radiator, alternator, etc. EV brakes last > 100K miles. The reliability we see in ICE vehicles is about process refinement and engineering to that end. EV makers are busy trying to scale and quality controls issues in that context are not unusual.",
            "Cybertrucks Georg is an outlier and should not have been counted",
            "Those issues are primarily plaguing vehicles that run on batteries instead of gas... So kind of related, yeah",
            "There\u2019s also the continual claims that MTBF as a concept applies as equally to mechanical systems as it does to electronics. Materials processing and general QC methods have advanced to the point where spontaneous failure of something like a rocker arm just doesn\u2019t happen any more. Yeah, things still go wrong, but in general, an engine or transmission can as bulletproof as a designer wants it to be, balanced against cost.\u00a0",
            "For me the big takeaway is:\n\n>Proponents of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) often state these vehicles should be less problematic and require fewer repairs than gas-powered vehicles since they have fewer parts and systems. However, newly incorporated repair data shows BEVs, as well as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), require more repairs than gas-powered vehicles in all repair categories. \u201cOwners of cutting edge, tech-filled BEVs and PHEVs are experiencing problems that are of a severity level high enough for them to take their new vehicle into the dealership at a rate three times higher than that of gas-powered vehicle owners,\u201d Hanley said.\n\nI'm sure a lot of these problems can be blaimed on user error, but the simple fact this these \"simple\" vehicles aren't as reliable as the \"complex\" vehicles.\n\nProbably because the \"complex\" vehicles have decades of refinement and the \"simple\" ones don't.",
            "If you read past the clickbait article title...\n\n>Following are key findings of the 2024 study:\n\n>**Frustration rising from false warnings:**\u00a0Often, owners don\u2019t understand what warnings mean. For instance, rear seat reminder technology, designed to help vehicle owners avoid inadvertently leaving a child or pet in the rear seat when exiting the vehicle, contributes 1.7 PP100 across the industry. Some mistakenly perceive it signals an unbuckled seat belt or cite the warning goes off when no one is present in the rear seat. Furthermore, advanced driver assistance systems, intended to save lives and reduce injuries, are irritating vehicle owners with inaccurate and annoying alerts from rear cross traffic warning and reverse automatic emergency braking features, a newly added feature to the survey this year.\n\n>**Owners want to cut the cord:**\u00a0Problems with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay persist as the feature remains one of the top 10 problems. Customers most frequently experience difficulties connecting to their vehicle or losing connection. More than 50% of Apple users and 42% of Samsung users access their respective feature every time they drive, illustrating that customers want their smartphone experience brought into the vehicle and also desire the feature to be integrated wirelessly.\n\n>**In-vehicle controls are out of control:**\u00a0Features, controls and displays is the second most problematic category in the study, slightly better than only the notoriously issue-prone infotainment category. From such seemingly simple functions like windshield wipers and rear-view mirror to the more intricate operation of an OEM smartphone application, this category is particularly troublesome in EVs. The PP100 incidence in this category is more than 30% higher in EVs than in gas-powered vehicles. This is exacerbated by Tesla\u2019s recent switch to steering wheel-mounted buttons for horn and turn signal functions, a change not well received by owners.\n\n>**One problem area that stinks:**\u00a0While, figuratively, all vehicle problems stink, there is one problem that is increasingly prevalent: unpleasant interior smell. This issue has worsened the most from 2023, with every brand except Kia and Nissan having an increase in unpleasant interior smell problems. \u00a0Problem odors are described by owners to be emanating from their vehicle\u2019s heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems.\n\nNone of these issues have anything to do with the fact the vehicles run on batteries instead of gas.",
            "A PHEV certainly won\u2019t be any simpler - it\u2019s basically got all the parts (and points of failure) of an ICE car, *plus* a bunch of EV bits added.\n\nPlus Ford and co have a century of experience building ICE cars of all sizes. They know that particular bit needs extra space for freezing weather in Alaska, the wiring harness needs a but of padding where it crosses something for hot summers in Arizona, whatever - a hundred little lessons from all the service calls and warranty stats across the planet. A Tesla service guy said they haven\u2019t quite figured out the waterproofing yet - so how does it cope with driving through thick wet snow on roads that have been sprayed with brine?\n\nLots of computer parts, sensors, wires, switches and of course batteries - getting very hot when charging, very cold in winter - still a lot of things to go wrong."
