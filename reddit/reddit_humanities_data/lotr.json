        "content": "There's been an influx of posts today about a certain announcement regarding Amazon's *Rings of Power* series that have violated our spoiler policy. This is a reminder to remember the following rules.\n\n1. **No spoilers in post titles!** If that means you have to change the post title (e.g., when sharing an article or something) so be it. *Posts with spoilers in the title will be removed*.\n\n2. **All posts about unreleased media need the spoiler tag.** Specifically, if you're discussing season 2 of RoP, use the spoiler tag. It's less important for the anime film and the newly announced Gollum film because so far we know very little about them and almost everything is speculation, but you can't go wrong using the spoiler tag. I can and will add the spoiler tag to posts that lack it (and need it) but repeat offenders may find their posts removed. It costs nothing to add it.\\*\n\n\n\n\\* ^(You do not need to add spoiler tags to discussions of any material that is already released, that is, the books, the Jackson films, etc. This applies only to new material.)",

It would be great if there was a \\[Spoiler Headlines Warning\\] post here whenever there's a bunch of spoiler headlines going around the internet, so I can steer clear of the media news sources for a couple days."

            "My partner wanted to watch the Extended Editions, but with our limited free-time, watching anything for nearly 4 hours in one sitting is not doable. I divided the three movies into 9 \"episodes,\" trying to ensure each one has a strong narrative arc on its own. Already we've had a few friends who're new to the movies watch them this way and reports have been good. Treating it like a TV-Show and watching just one 'episode' a week is fun too.",
