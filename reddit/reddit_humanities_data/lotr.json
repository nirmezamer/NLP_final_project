        "content": "There's been an influx of posts today about a certain announcement regarding Amazon's *Rings of Power* series that have violated our spoiler policy. This is a reminder to remember the following rules.\n\n1. **No spoilers in post titles!** If that means you have to change the post title (e.g., when sharing an article or something) so be it. *Posts with spoilers in the title will be removed*.\n\n2. **All posts about unreleased media need the spoiler tag.** Specifically, if you're discussing season 2 of RoP, use the spoiler tag. It's less important for the anime film and the newly announced Gollum film because so far we know very little about them and almost everything is speculation, but you can't go wrong using the spoiler tag. I can and will add the spoiler tag to posts that lack it (and need it) but repeat offenders may find their posts removed. It costs nothing to add it.\\*\n\n\n\n\\* ^(You do not need to add spoiler tags to discussions of any material that is already released, that is, the books, the Jackson films, etc. This applies only to new material.)",

It would be great if there was a \\[Spoiler Headlines Warning\\] post here whenever there's a bunch of spoiler headlines going around the internet, so I can steer clear of the media news sources for a couple days."

            "My headcanon is that he knew immediately, as he heard the screech and turned to look, that this would destroy the morale of his riders, and that\u2019s why his face fell. Its not a \u201cOh I\u2019m going to die\u201d, as he, already quite old, knew that he was going to his likely death, its a \u201cAll of my riders who see the Witch King kill me are going to have their courage shattered\u201d.\n\nHe was just yelling \u201cRally to me! To me!\u201d All the Rohirrim in the vicinity\u2019s eyes are on him, their king, right as (assuming Gandalf or indeed his own scouts explained who was riding the flying mounts) the enemy commander, the Witch-King of Angmar itself (himself also realizing the massive threat that the King of Rohan posed as a figurehead and strategic leader of several thousand raging light and heavy cavalry, and moving swiftly to deal with it and lessen the damage to his siege assault) diving straight for him. \n\nThat would be crushing, and it shows on Theoden\u2019s face, to know that there was just a chance they could drive the orcs away from the city, and now knowing hundreds of his men are going to see him be slain by a wraith riding a fell beast, right as the tide was turning in their favo\n\nEdit: also, Theoden must have sensed, with all the intuition of a great leader, that his men needed a quick rallying pep talk to keep their fires going, and so he also knows he\u2019ll be killed before he can deliver that rousing speech he was just about to launch into to keep them going hard",
            "Theoden led the Rohirrim on a death charge into pikes and archers, and defeated them handily; he again fearlessly led the charge to take down massive oliphants, rallying his men to his side; and just when victory was in sight, the mother fucking Witch King shows up on his fell beast. Theoden\u2019s face in this picture is that of a battle-weary warrior-king who had exhausted his every fiber to save his people and all of Middle Earth. \u201cWhat the actual fuck?\u201d he thought to himself.",
            "I think about this a lot. It's perfect. It's not fear or panic or even anger, it's... injustice? Exasperation? It's the \"really? _really?_\" of a person who's had rotten luck all day and then misses their bus.\n\nHe's not afraid to die. He's just annoyed that he's being taken out of the fight.",

            "*\u201dUpon the further side, some way within the valley\u2019s arms, high on a rocky seat upon the black knees of the Ephel D\u00faath, stood the walls and tower of Minas Morgul. All was dark about it, earth and sky, but it was lit with light. Not the imprisoned moonlight welling through the marble walls of Minas Ithil long ago, Tower of the Moon, fair and radiant in the hollow of the hills. Paler indeed than the moon ailing in some slow eclipse was the light of it now, wavering and blowing like a noisome exhalation of decay, a corpse-light, a light that illuminated nothing. In the walls and tower windows showed, like countless black holes looking inward into emptiness; but the topmost course of the tower revolved slowly, first one way and then another, a huge ghostly head leering into the night.\u201d*\n\nMinas Morgul always makes me sad.

I imagine that person to be someone who is really beautiful but not like someone goes around all of arda measuring the beauty of every female person and then tot's it up on a leaderboard.\n\nIn a movie adaptation screen presence is what heightens the beauty to that next level. So, in that sense, beauty comes second to screen presence."
