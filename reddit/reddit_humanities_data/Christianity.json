        "content": "Disclaimer: My goal with this thread is not to belittle or take a side on today's issues. The goal is to showcase a specific celebration as well as Christianity's role in it. These kinds of things are difficult to stay completely neutral on while still making a point relevant to the topic at hand, but I have attempted to do so.\n\nYou are more than welcome to use this thread as a jumping off point for discussion. You are also welcome to use this thread as a simple means of learning some history.\n\nThis month's banner represents Juneteenth. Although the Emancipation Proclamation was issued in the US in 1863, the 13th Amendment was not ratified until December 6th, 1865. Even then, the last slaves were not told they were free until June 19th, 1865. Juneteenth has evolved to become more than just a day of remembering a scar that plagued the United States, but it has become a month to reflect on what it means to be \"free\".\n\nChristianity played a very unique role in the days of slavery as well as the push leading to end it. One of the first names given to June 19th was Jubilee Day. This was in reference to Leviticus 25:8-54. What is described was a festival dedicated to the Lord. The Israelites were to forgive debts, release others from bondage, and even restore some tribal lands. The freed slaves saw this as a perfect representation to their newfound freedoms.\n\nDuring the time of slavery, many slaves throughout the Caribbean islands of Jamaica, Barbados, and Antigua were given a \"Slave Bible\" as to not give them anything that might lead to rebellion. This version of the Bible left out most of the Old Testament. What was left were passages aimed at telling slaves to be subservient. This says something about the strength Christianity holds on those who read Scripture. Slaveholders did not want slaves to muster enough spiritual or mental strength to recognize the strength they had to escape their captivity.\n\nEven then, [The Haitian Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haitian_Revolution) happened.\n\nThis obfuscation of the Bible is one of the several aspects of slavery that Christianity has had to wrestle with since the Emancipation Proclamation was signed.\n\nWhile it is clear the main push to continue slavery was for economic gain, a main source used to justify this push was God's word, at least what was presented as His word. This greed was not found only within the political institutions that ran the governments attempting to call for the continuation of slavery. This greed made its way into the hearts of some churches as well.\n\nIn 1838, Theodore Clapp, Unitarian minister of the Independent Unitarian Society, New Orleans wrote:\n\n>I would say to every slave in the United States, 'You should realize that a wise, kind, and merciful Providence has appointed for you your condition in life; and, all things considered, you could not be more eligibly situated. The burden of your care, toils and responsibilities is much lighter than that, which God has imposed on your Master. The most enlightened philanthropists, with unlimited resources, could not place you in a situation more favorable to your present and everlasting welfare than that which you now occupy...\n\nAt the same time, Scripture was a driving force in the Abolitionist Movement.\n\nTheodore Weld was one of the leading figures in the push to end slavery. Unlike his counterparts who were using God's word to push for the continuation of slavery, he saw God's word as overwhelming in favor of a freed people:\n\n>No condition of birth, no shade of color, no mere misfortune of circumstances, can annul that birth-right charter, which God has bequeathed to every being upon whom he has stamped his own image, by making him a free moral agent,\" Weld stated. \"He who robs his fellow man of this tramples upon right, subverts justice, outrages humanity, unsettles the foundations of human safety, and sacrilegiously assumes the prerogative of God.\n\nSince the Emancipation Proclamation, Christianity has had to come to terms with the role it played in slavery. As we see in this subreddit, the \"clarity\" surrounding God's word and slavery is still debated.\n\nI hope this look at Christianity's role in all aspects of slavery brings to light the importance of Juneteenth, and why I chose it to be represented this month. Yes, on the surface, Juneteenth is a day to celebrate the freeing of the last slave in the United States, but it has become much more than that. It is a time to reflect on the values we hold as human beings and to question where we are moving. It is also a time to reflect on the word of God and to take a hard look at those who use it as a means to an end.\n\nJuneteenth is a stark reminder that even the holiest of things can be used as a tool for subjugation. It is also a reminder that, in the right hands, the Word can be used to bring good back to the world.",

            "> At the same time, Scripture was a driving force in the Abolitionist Movement.\n\nThe Battle Hymn of the Republic makes this extremely clear. One of the later verses says, in no uncertain terms:\n\n> As he died to make men holy, let us die to make men free\n\nThe Union Army knew what they were fighting to end, and directly tied it to Jesus' commandment that the greatest form of love is laying your life down for a friend.",

            "Oh, also. Trivia to relate this back to Pride. You know how, for a while, the big talking point was civil unions and the difference between religious and governmental marriage? Yeah... If you look at when the government actually started issuing marriage licenses, as opposed to just using common law marriage, it's entirely plausible that they only did it to prevent miscegenation",
            "I need to say something here, playing a large role in something doesn't mean you were on the right side.  Any role that Christianity had in slavery and ending slavery was at best self serving at at worst only made things more difficult for Blacks to be accepted as equals in society.  Self serving evangelization i.e. presenting people with converting to your faith as a means to \"save them\" so you can feel good about yourself...this only furthered the idea that the Blacks were lesser because they largely followed African or Afro-Caribbean folk religions or traditional beliefs...this was the same treatment the native americans got and the answer from Christians was to \"save them\" by doing nothing about helping them save their land, but, taking every effort to convert them not only to Christianity but to a European way of life.  Juneteenth is not a Christian holiday by any means, but, is a day to remember that a group of  slaves in Texas were never freed despite the federal laws in place outlawing the practice and the owners...Christians.  Juneteenth should be to remember a horrible historic event and celebrate the freedom and equality we now have in our country and not an excuse for Evangelical Christians to pat themselves on the back.  Sorry if you this sounds harsh but I am only repeating historical fact"

            "And now for my random other updates:\n\nI found... definitely a weird anime, but in a fun way. Delicious in Dungeon. You know how every D&D player has probably wondered at some point whether they could eat the monsters? That. The party has to abandon the party healer when a fight with a dragon goes awry, but while they want to mount a rescue mission, they're also broke. So instead of spending the money they don't have on rations, they decide to just scavenge and eat the monsters they fight instead. The dub voice cast also includes a few moderately big names, like ProZD from Youtube as a dwarf chef, live-action Nami as an elf mage, and Yen Sid as a gnome mage who shows up in a handful of episodes. It also includes some generally positive autistic representation, as opposed to something like TBBT. Laios... isn't confirmed to be autistic, but between things like his special interest in monsters and utter inability to read social cues, everyone agrees he's on the spectrum. (It even gets played for drama, not laughs, one time, in a fight that was painfully reminiscent of my senior year of college)\n\nI actually had a refreshingly candid phone screen yesterday. The recruiter directly mentioned that he didn't have any interview slots left for the position he was interviewing for, but he *did* think I would be a good fit for a role a coworker was interviewing for, and was going to check if there were any slots left for it.\n\nAnd then it finally happened. After several years of getting long haircuts, I finally had a not-as-good one. I'm... just going to compare it to the inverse of [this](https://64.media.tumblr.com/bbab4b05296873ae42312d5d40e00a4c/024345188313996e-d1/s2048x3072/68756373e277f5f97813d51800ff369035271069.jpg), but it was more of a miscommunication on my part.
