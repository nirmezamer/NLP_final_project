        "content": "Hello,\n\nI am a 2nd year student in romania studying industrial engineering and robotics. Sorry for my bad english I am very angry. \n\nI am the student \u201eleader\u201c at my professor laboratory of industry 4.0 stuff. So we do plc programming, cfd/fem simulations, 3d printing, iiot, you know the usual. \n\nI am a programmer at heart. I love my python, my react, c++, c#, openCV, Unity and I am really really bad at mechanical engineering. Such is life. \n\nFor the last 6 months I have been begging my professor to get an industrial robot. Since you know, I love programming and a cobot is peak mechanical engineer that can be programmed to do ANYTHING. Also we are a robotics university, at the department of \u201erobotics and production systems\u201c. \n\nYesterday I got a phone call from *insert big robot company here* saying yes we will give a real industrial robot because you are a lab in a univerisity. And my professor was like no thanks. After I begged every company to give us one 4 free.\n\nHere is why I am furious. I have done a lot for that lab. Most of the projects there are even funded by me to some extent because election year and public money from the uni is impossible to get. I bought 14kg of 3d filament in total, vibrations sensors, microcontrollers, my old pc were all used for projects in the lab\n\nAnd he can\u2018t even say yes to the single thing I have been asking for??????\n\nI will probably remain at his lab and forget this all happened because I am gold fish but I am personally hurt even tho I shouldn\u2018t be.  \n\nAlso most of the projects he wanted to start have gone terrible wrong and usually only my projects go smoothly for some reason. I would like to detail in the comments later what projects he wanted to do. \n\nSuggestions on what should I do? \nIf I leave the lab, the team will literally not exist anymore. And next year I have a class with him sooo yeah",

            "Free robot arms aren't actually free. Who is going to maintain and repair it? Does the city your university is in have any licensed specialists who could maintain it or will the university need to hire and train someone whose sole responsibility is to maintain it? If so, how much will that training cost? And what is the expected salary range of the employee hired for the job? Where does the funding for this come from?\n\nFurthermore, what is the university going to do with such a device? An argument could be made if you were a Ph.D student who literally needed one to further their research, but typically universities don't go for big, shiny, and expensive to maintain toys just because some random fuck off undergrad thinks they'd be cool and fun, especially when that toy requires specialized (and costly!) installation and maintenance.\n\nFinally, it doesn't matter if your professors' projects go well or not, what matters is that they continue to get funding (grants); the university can ignore a LOT of bad behavior as long as the money keeps coming in. _Especially_ if they're tenure. You, on the other hand, appear to be a particularly entitled undergraduate who doesn't understand how universities are run.",

            "Why was 6 months of him saying no before not enough warning that he would also say no this time? \n\nAre you seriously considering leaving your lab because they won't buy you a big robot arm to play with? \n\n>Also most of the projects he wanted to start have gone terrible wrong and usually only my projects go smoothly for some reason. I would like to detail in the comments later what projects he wanted to do. \n\nThis comes off as very arrogant. Your professor presumably has years of research experience as he runs a lab. Does he have publications? Sometimes research goes wrong. I know I've wasted months chasing dead ends in the lab. You are a 2nd year undergraduate student, do you think it's possible your projects go smoothly because they are generally a little simpler and less novel, and not that you're simply better than everyone else?\n\nIf you really want an arm your best bet is to write a research proposal for a project that would require it and that you stand a chance of achieving. You'll need to determine required space, safety precautions, maintenance and upkeep costs, etc. because if you want to convince your professor to make a significant investment in equipment you need to actually have a use for it and already know everything that is involved in the ask. As others have said, for a master's student maybe. For an undergrad no way.",

They still graduated. Hell, when I was doing my undergrad there was a class known for its high failure rate. The school had to arrange for a special summer class for all the students because there were just too many to repeat it next year with the incoming students.\n\nIt's school. People fail. The smart one will learn why and do better.\n\nSeriously though, sit down and really thing about what happened here. Don't just say you'll \"work harder\" like that will solve everything. Here are some questions you should ask yourself:\n\n* What were you having difficulty with? Projects, assignments, exams?\n\n* Did you understand the material? If not what could you do to learn better? Can you talk to your profs/TAs for help?\n\n* How well did you manage your time? Did you stretch yourself too thin doing extracurriculars? Too many pubnights?\n\n* Do you study/work by yourself? Can you arrange study groups?\n\n* Is you major a good fit for you? (I knew a guy who switched majors in his third year.
