        "content": "Usually I don\u2019t update posts but this saga has convinced me I should give up work all together and become a communist. \n\nSo on Thursday I woke up early to go buy the admin lady chocolate as suggested by a user. I got her like 7 chocolate bars of her favorite chocolate (they only had small ones). This made me look ridiculous and probably a little crazy but it\u2019s all for the gratitude and I\u2019ve already made a fool of myself enough. This was a great idea and she really enjoyed it, so thank you Redditor! She ensured it was all okay and not to worry about it. \n\nThe rest of Thursday was great. The problem is today is Friday and the same cannot be said. \n\nThe day starts normal enough. I ride with another intern to one of our fracking sites (parking is super tight on these so it\u2019s better if we go together). I\u2019m feeling good. I\u2019m taking a nap. All of a sudden we get to this annoying road construction (they\u2019re paving this 1 lane one lane at a time so they have to stop traffic on one side of the road. The road isn\u2019t even that damaged. Small towns are so strange.) \n\nAnyways beside the point we\u2019re going through this narrow lane. There\u2019s like 5 road construction people doing shit all and one guy working. I\u2019m annoyed. All of a sudden I\u2019m not feeling good. There\u2019s ofc no where to pull over because this town of 454 people decides the roads need to be better. I\u2019m telling the other intern to pull over and once he does, folks it\u2019s too late. I vomitted all over this dudes truck. I tried my best to clean it up but no luck. While I\u2019m out of commission vomiting guess who he calls? The admin lady! \n\nSo now she\u2019s in charge of getting this truck I vomited all over detailed after I just apologized for making a mess for her. My luck, but wait it gets worse. \n\nIt\u2019s at this point an hour away from the office we decide I should probably do a day in the office if I\u2019m not feeling well. I just vomited but I felt ok, so I thought I\u2019d be able to maybe finish the day off doing some paperwork. In the hour drive it quickly becomes apparent that that shit is not happening. I have my head in a bag, I\u2019m mumbling words like Joe Biden. Situation is not good. When we get to the office I just crumble onto the asphalt and the other intern has to drag me to bathroom where, no surprises, I\u2019m back to vomiting instantly (honestly proud I made it to the bathroom.)\n\nGuess who this mfer gets to help me?! The admin lady. At this point it\u2019s apparent I\u2019m having a severe migraine or something, I\u2019m vomiting in a pitch black bathroom and this sweet angel just wants to help me. She grabs me a coke and some gold fish and leaves me where I\u2019m writhing on the bathroom floor in pain. \n\nThe worst part? This is bring your children to work day, which the admin lady, as her name suggests, is in charge of. Not only is she dealing with all sorts of children (and a bouncy castle), but now this sick young adult. \n\nY\u2019all. \n\nShe asks and gets my boss to allow me to go home early and then offers to drive me to the hospital/home. It takes me 3 hours of bathroom pain writhing to get it together enough to go. Hospital because a bitch is sick, so there goes all my sweet summer internship money. \n\nCurrently I\u2019m just waiting in the ER, feeling way better but hoping to figure out what could even be wrong. I\u2019ve resigned to be the intern known for either bad luck or throwing up in the company truck or ruining the carpet take your pick. \n\nTL;DR: Chocolate was a good idea but now I need a gift to apologize for vomiting in a company truck and driving me to the ER\n\nI\u2019ll edit this when I\u2019m less sick so sorry for any errors. \n\nPost-Hospital Update: So my white blood cell count is elevated which means I most likely had an infection. What kind? No clue because I discharged myself. \n\nIn fairness they gave me some nausea stuff and fluids and tests but I couldn\u2019t stay there any longer. My luck is truly terrible. The man I was sat next to in the pending area while waiting for test results had the same thing happening that my aunt recently passed from. Now she didn\u2019t die from this (we actually don\u2019t know exactly what she did die from) but it was the start of her declining health. He was a diabetic whose foot was starting to necrotize. I didn\u2019t think that was that common but I guess enough so that I ended up next to him. Guys I tried to hold on and I did for a few hours but when the nurse came and started talking about it I just had to leave. I was pretty hysterical and just sobbing. I was like crying to the nurse asking if I could get discharged. I have a way to get my test results thankfully so it isn\u2019t that big of a deal. \n\nI wasn\u2019t able to go to my aunts funeral cause the same thing happened there (spontaneously throwing up, migraine like symptoms) and it just hit me how much I miss her. \n\nI\u2019m doing an internship really far from home so the only person I know to drive me home is admin lady.  I had obviously been crying a lot and I think she thinks I\u2019m suicidal now\u2026 so\u2026 not great. She stressed the good support network around as well as triple checking with me that I\u2019d contact her if i need help. This poor lady is so kind.  So not only did I ruin a carpet, vomit in a truck, and need a ride to the ER, I also had a mini-mental breakdown. Don\u2019t know if flowers will cover this one boys. \n\nThis isn\u2019t even including the $300 copay I paid to find out pretty much nothing. \n\nIf anything crazy happens I\u2019ll update but for my sanity I hope the next update is just an \u201cit\u2019s over.\u201d",

            "Do you have a history of consecutive bad luck? Most of what you described is pretty typical of someone whos never worked before, albeit in quick succession. The migraine though, could very well have been caused by the amount of anxiety youre experiencing. \n\nI suggest taking the embarrassment on the chin, accepting what has happened already, and simply agreeing to pay more attention in the future. Every single person makes mistakes, its how you learn from them that counts. Good luck!",
            "A few summers ago I was working at a bakery just as a part time job to get some extra money between school years and on my very first day I had an anxiety attack and threw up on the floor. When I came in for my next shift my manager was shocked and said he thought he'd never see me again but applauded my courage for coming back in. It ended up being an OK job for a summer and I did not have any other major incidents but basically what I'm saying is people will generally applaud you for picking yourself up and getting back on the (metaphorical) horse.",

            "Wow. If I ever land an internship, Im gonna remember this story. Whatever I do, however I fuck up, Ill always know that its not that bad in comparison to this. \n\nIm sorry OP, joking aside Im sorry this happened to you. Im sure the ones who matter in terms of your position will understand that there wasnt much you could do. I wish you the best of luck",

Math never clicked for me until I worked 100s of problems. I took 5 years off between calc 1 and calc 2, only way I passed was brute force working problems for like 8 hours a day. I lived in the math help center. Use every resource you have at your disposal and ask questions to as many different people as you can who might be able to answer. Then work problems. \n\nNo shame in retaking classes. This shits hard, and it doesnt get easier.",
            "The way I managed was to first solve problems with the full solution in front of you. That way you start to familiarize yourself with the right steps you need to make to solve the problem, and prevents any bad habits (i.e. always making the same mistake at a certain point) from forming.\n\nOnce I feel like I'm starting to get it, I put the answer sheet away and try to solve the same problem without the solution. Don't be afraid to use the solution if you get stuck for a while, but before going to the last step make sure that you were able to solve the problem at least once without needing the solution.\n\nFinally, if that worked out well, start solving similar problems 'blind', i.e. try to solve them without looking at the answer beforehand. This prevents you from just learning a specific solution for a specific problem by heart, and forces you to learn the 'concept' that can be used to find any solution for any similar problem.\n\nIf you made it this far, congrats! You just learned how to integrate/differentiate/'insert math concept here'."
