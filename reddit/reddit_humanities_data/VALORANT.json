To avoid bug reports cluttering the subreddit and/or going unnoticed, a Megathread is posted after every patch so users may submit reports in one place. This allows Riot to easily keep track of the bugs by providing a central hub and also allows other users to confirm that they might have encountered the issue as well.\n\n##[**View the Current VALORANT Patch Notes!**](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-811/)\n\n> ###Official Sources\n\n>> #####[**Submit an Official VALORANT Support Ticket**](https://support-valorant.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)\n\n>> #####[**Official Article on VALORANT Error Codes**](https://support-valorant.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045619633-Error-Codes-in-VALORANT)\n\n>> #####[**VALORANT Server Status by Region**](https://status.riotgames.com/valorant?)\n\n\n> ###Community Help\n\n>> #####[**Find Additional Help on /r/ValorantTechSupport**](https://reddit.com/r/ValorantTechSupport)\n\n>> #####[**Seek Help In the /r/VALORANT Discord**](https://discord.gg/zGkN8upuf7)\n\n---\n\n# Reporting a Bug\n\n1.

When I started playing Pearl and haven were out of the pool.\n\nBefore the game even started I said over voice \"hey guys I haven't played this map yet bare with me\"\n\nThe Rayna on the team bailed in the first round so it was a 4v5 all game. We started on attack and we were even all the way up to the switch. At these point our Sova had 30+ kills and the Jett had 13 kills and I had 9 but I didn't get anymore because I somehow defended the wrong site everytime and because I still don't know the map well my rotation was slow\n\nNow the Jett decided they want to start talking shit. \n\nIn ranked I understand you grind all day and now someone is playing bad and it's going to lower your rank but unrated are you so unstable that you can't have fun when you are losing a no stakes game where people are clearly trying to learn.\n\nAlso I am pretty sure my Sova was cheating I'm not sure how but he always pinged exactly where the enemy was every round. A couple times and I can call it good game sense but evertime was a bit suspicious.\n\nSorry to rant but I just find it crazy that my unrated matches have been more toxic than my ranked matches.

One server based out of Christchurch, so that probably helped. Now if they aren't in your party, everyone is a stranger so that doesn't help.
