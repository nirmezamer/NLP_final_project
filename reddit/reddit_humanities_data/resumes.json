        "content": "Hello r/resumes \ud83d\udc4b\n\nI'd like to talk about a topic that is just outside of the normal scope of this sub (i.e., resumes), and that is job search.\n\nWith the recent layoffs that have happened in recent months, there will surely be a lot of folks out looking for jobs, many of which may be hitting a brick wall at various points of the job search process, such as:\n\n* Not getting call backs\n* Not passing the recruiter screen\n* Not moving forward during job interviews\n\nBelow, I'll talk about each of the above issues and provide some ideas as to why you may not be seeing the results you want.\n\n# First pain point - not getting any callbacks (or getting very few)\n\nIf you're getting less than **1 callback in every 10 job applications**, it's an indication that one of a few things is happening:\n\n* You're not qualified for the types of jobs you're applying to\n* Your resume isn't presenting a relevant value proposition\n* Job market (out of your control)\n* Strength of other candidates (out of your control)\n* If you're a student or new grad looking to apply for internships and jobs abroad, a common obstacle is the lack of sponsorship for visas. Many companies are hesitant or unable to sponsor visas due to the complexity and cost involved. This can significantly reduce the pool of opportunities available to international candidates, making it even more challenging to secure a callback.\n\n**Fixes:**\n\n* To make sure you're qualified, you should be checking off at least 60% of the requirements of the role.\n* If you're qualified, there's a good chance it's your resume. Most people's resumes contain mistakes that fall into one of three categories: improper formatting for ATS, generic content, or not enough personalization/customization. I provide more info about each of these in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/tq061t/biggest_mistakes_that_impact_your_resumes/) and [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/s2b37q/if_youre_applying_online_use_a_single_column/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1).\n* For international students and new grads, do your research and target companies and roles that have historically sponsored visas or are known to be more open to international candidates can improve your chances. Additionally, being upfront about your need for sponsorship can help set the right expectations from the start.\n\n# Second pain point - not making it past the recruiter screen\n\nIf you're getting calls from recruiters, but aren't making any progress after that, then there's something going on with what you're telling (or not telling) them.\n\n**Some Potential Causes and Fixes - Recruiter Screen**\n\n|Possible Cause|Fix|\n|:-|:-|\n|Your elevator pitch is unsatisfactory|Practice your pitch and ensure it aligns with what the company is looking for in this particular role. Your pitch should essentially answer these questions: Who are you and why do you want this job?|\n|What you're saying doesn't match what's on the resume|Memorize your resume and everything on it, including titles, dates, and responsibilities.|\n|You're asking for too much money (if you've revealed your salary expectations).|Don't reveal your salary expectations at this stage. If asked, just say that you'd like to learn more about this position before you can provide a realistic salary expectation. Do your homework on salary range for your position, industry, and company.|\n|You're not prepared, haven't done your research, don't seem enthused for the role etc.|There are a lot of other applicants. If you don't seem like you want the job, they'll move on. To prevent this: research the role/company and develop a good understanding of what they do (i.e., their market, products, services etc.). Look at company pages, read their mission statement, read the job description, show up on time, and try to sound neutral at the very least (excited would be good).|\n\n*Note: These are just common causes that may be behind your results. This isn't an exhaustive list and there could be other reasons not covered here.*\n\n# Third pain point- you're not moving forward during interviews with hiring managers\n\nGetting roadblocked during the interview stage likely means you're not performing well enough.\n\n**Common Causes and Fixes - Interview**\n\n|Possible Cause|Fix|\n|:-|:-|\n|You're not sufficiently answering behavioural interview questions|Practice! There are a lot of good guides all over the internet on this topic. See a brief guide to these questions below this table.|\n|You can't remember important details about past projects and accomplishments|Prepare a master list of projects and accomplishments you've been involved in throughout your career. Follow the STAR format. Memorize it.|\n|You're lacking key skills and experiences.|If you know you lack key skills/experiences, you'll need to provide a very good rationale for why you'd still be the right candidate for the position. If you don't have one, you probably shouldn't apply.|\n\n*Note: These are just common causes that may be behind your results. This isn't an exhaustive list and there could be other reasons not covered here.*\n\n# A note about behavioural interview questions\n\nEmployers love using behavioural questions because they give them a little bit of insight into how you'd behave in a particular role, how you'd react in a particular scenario, or how you'd solve a particular problem or task. They're also really hard to fake.\n\nA few common ones you've probably heard before:\n\n* \u201cTell me about a time when...\u201d\n* \"How would you approach X problem...\"\n* \"Imagine you're in the following situation...\"\n\nAnswering these questions is beyond the scope of this post today, but if you're struggling with these types of questions, you'll need to prepare and practice in order to respond effectively.\n\n# A note about the STAR Method\n\nYou've probably heard of this before, but for those of you that haven't, the STAR method is a simple and easy-to-remember technique for answering behavioural interview questions. STAR stands for:\n\n1. Situation: Describe a specific situation or event where you faced a challenge or had to solve a problem. Try to pick a relevant example that shows your skills and abilities.\n2. Task: Explain the task or responsibility you had in that situation. What were you supposed to accomplish or what goal were you trying to achieve?\n3. Action: Talk about the actions you took to address the situation or complete the task. Explain the steps you took and the skills you used to resolve the issue or meet the goal.\n4. Result: Share the results of your actions, focusing on the positive outcomes and what you learned from the experience. This could include how you improved a process, solved a problem, or achieved a goal.\n\n# Hopefully these tips help you!\n\nThis isn't a comprehensive guide by any means, but it can hopefully give you some ideas and point you in the right direction if your job search isn't getting you the results you want.\n\nGood luck!\n\nPS: If you found this post helpful, consider subscribing to my free newsletter, [The Launchpad](https://thecareerlaunchpad.beehiiv.com/subscribe), where you\u2019ll get weekly tips to help you network, find jobs, and make more money (not to mention the the freebies).
