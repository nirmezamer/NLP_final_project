            "Looking at buying a MacBook for my last year of my computer science degree. I may do grad school and plan to use it for my eventual job after my degree. I do web design, general programming, work with databases, and do 2D game design in my free time. I was leaning towards either getting the M3 air with 24GB of RAM or waiting for the next pro this winter and sticking it out with my current laptop. Can anyone with a similar workflow help me decide which may be best? I want this to be my daily driver for the next 3-4 years as I upgrade every other generation at earliest. It\u2019s not about \u201coh should I wait for what\u2019s around the corner\u201d it\u2019s more so I want to get what\u2019s best for my needs.\n\nAlso I\u2019ve never gotten a MacBook new before so I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re expected to refresh the pro this September or if it\u2019s going to be closer to December/January",
            "Is there a problem in not using magsafe with the macbook pro m2? It comes with a 140W charger, the problem is that I'm going to use a dock, and the macbook will only draw 89W from it. Can this impact performance?",
            "Hello! \n\nI am considering treating myself to a new laptop after my trusty 8-years-old Macbook Air has been having lots of problems. \n\nI used Mac Book Pro at work, and loved it, so thinking to get that. \n\nI just heard about 'Apple Intelligence' coming out, and that it will be a software update into Macs in M series. I want to have access to this Apple Intelligence feature / capability. \n\nEven though the announcement says it will be available to M series, so if I buy an M series Mac now, I will get Apple Intelligence... I wanted to confirm with this community of more experienced Apple consumers, before I make the purchase. \n\nWould I be better off waiting until Apple Intelligence has already been pushed out as a software update, and perhaps get the next version of Macs after that, to make sure Apple Intelligence functions properly / optimally by getting the next gen hardware? \n\nOr do you think just getting M series Macbook Pro currently sold at Apple will do the trick?  I am looking at M3 Pro, 12-Core CPU\n18-Core GPU\n18GB Unified Memory\n512GB SSD Storage\u00b9\n\nThere is also the 36 GB Unified Memory version which is $400 more. Is that better for the Apple Intelligence? \n\n\nSorry if these are naive questions, I am not an experienced Apple shopper..."
