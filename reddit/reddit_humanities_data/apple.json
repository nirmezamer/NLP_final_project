            "> I think that is that is the most sort of stunning open declaration that they know 100% that this is another way of disabling competition where they have a stronghold already.\n\nHow can Apple \"disable\" competition if they're explicitly choosing not to even participate in that market (in Europe)?",

            "I can't believe this isn't in place already. Its great that some carriers automatically unlock after you've fulfilled any financial obligation to them, but its always been shady that some will keep the phone locked or require that you request an unlock after the fact. \n\nThe phone is yours, you own it, not the carrier, so why do they control it?",
            "You guys still have locked phones in the US?",

            "Phones bought outright shouldn\u2019t ever be allowed to have a lock. Phones on a payment plan to the carrier should be locked until it\u2019s paid off and then immediately unlocked once the last payment goes through. Anything else is dumb and anti-consumer.\u00a0",
            "I'm against this policy since I abuse carrier deals that keep me locked for two years, I typically get new phones for the whole family and profit around $1000 every two years. Right now we have 4x 14 Pro Max, gonna sell them off for some really shitty older models (sell for 600 buy for 300), and trade those shitty  on a carrier promo for all new 16 pro maxes on 24 month contract. +$1200 plus everyone gets the newest phone. Been doing this for years.",
            "Here in Australia we have the choice of buying from retail outlets including Apple themselves or via our phone carrier. I buy mine via retail and then sell my old device at a 2nd hand store."

The adhesive was always tricky to replace quickly without messing up and making it even harder. And encasing the battery in metal makes sense for safety.\n\nAt the Bar techs are expected to repair each phone very quickly, so any change to make the fix faster and more consistent is helpful. And of course that extends to the self repair program as well.",
