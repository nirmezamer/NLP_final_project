            "Started playing Still Wakes The Deep. Its amazing so far",
            "Finished The Castillo Protocol. Still have Hardcore and hardcore ng+ to finish. Wife finished Frigment 1 and 2. Short games but those two are some great ones. Love the art style of them. \n\nWe might start Still Wakes The Deep this week.",
            "Started Resident Evil 2 on Hardcore difficulty. I don't get spooked easily, but Mr. X has made me scream more than once so far, lol",
            "Playing Sword and Fairy. Never played a game like that before and it is pretty cool, but I am never going to get it finished before it leaves. I always try and complete games that look interesting when they are about to leave, but quite a few I never manage. It does make me try things I wouldn't otherwise.\n\nReally wish we had at least an extra week's notice.",
            "Nothing I don't have game pass ultimate ",
            "GRIS. I mean, it's a very nice artistic game but I'm finding it a little slow for my liking. Might move on to Dead Space remake.",
            "Callisto Protocol - Finished it and its not perfect but definitely not a \"bad\" game. \n\nMy time in Sandrock - aside from the Crash to Desktop which took me hours and the fix is DDU and Driver installation . It has the same charm i missed on Farming SIm games like Harvest Moon\\Rune factory and Portia",
            "Lonely Mountains Downhill.\n\nI really thought it was gonna be relaxing.",
            "**Humanity** was an outstanding surprise for me. Absolutely loved all but a few moments of its campaign. **9/10 Masterpiece**",
            "Control. Gameplay is fun, the story and atmosphere is to be expected of Remedy, Awesomely intriguing with a little bit of horror and im all for it! i just finished the main story and am now taking a break before going back in with their 2 DLC's. If you love Science fiction, Psychological horror, and action, then you'll have a blast. (Having Played Alan wake and quantum break also adds to the story)"

            "I only have an Xbox x. But yeah the whole mouse dragging and not having the prompt already on the button for its port is wild to me. Theres a lot but going in without expectations Im having a great time. Glad youre enjoying it as well. Im honestly wondering if this going on game pass would help for a sequel with a bigger budget because that would be something to be interested in."

            "Go to your country's Gamepass page and check the list of games. If FC 24 and Jedi Survivor are on that list, you can play them on Gamepass. You might have to filter for console Gamepass games and PC Gamepass games because I *think* they are different.\n\nNo code to give but try it for 1 month, download a bunch of games, play them and see if you like having the service. Good luck."
