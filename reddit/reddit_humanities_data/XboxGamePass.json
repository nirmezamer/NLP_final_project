Minecraft dungeon has been great for this as well as things like Mario kart or Mario party mini games. I\u2019m not looking for story, because I don\u2019t want to dive into a story and either get hooked into playing too long or forgetting what was happening after a long break",

            "Sometimes you get free add ons in your gamepass perks. Even for games not on gamepass. So you might get a free outfit or map for any game available on Xbox, even if the game isn't a gamepass freebie.\n\nAlso, technically all Xbox games are available on gamepass. They're all gamepass games, they're just not all free with gamepass.",

            "This is the answer. Used to be called \u201cDeals with Gold\u201d but they changed that in favor of confusing labels and every subscription being a form of gamepass. Honestly very on brand for Xbox",
