I made this demo, and wanted to share some keyboard shortcuts that might not be apparent.  \n1-4 keys you can emit material, D key will delete around the mouse, A and R keys will attract and repel. Scrolling controls the \"brush\" size. And you can move the window around and the liquid will slosh around in it.",
