            "Hi, thanks for sharing this! I made this demo, and wanted to share some keyboard shortcuts that might not be apparent.  \n1-4 keys you can emit material, D key will delete around the mouse, A and R keys will attract and repel. Scrolling controls the \"brush\" size. And you can move the window around and the liquid will slosh around in it.",

He was a murderer, and after hanging nearly an hour, under- went the experiments about to be detailed.\n\nExperiment I. A large incision was made into the nape of the neck, close below the occiput. The pos- terior half of the atlas vertebra was then removed by bone forceps, when the spinal marrow was brought into view. A profuse flow of liquid blood gushed from the wound, inundating the floor. A considerable incision was at the same time made in the left hip, through the great gutteal musele, so as to bring the sciatic nerve into sight, and a small ent was made in the heel; the pointed rod connected with one end of the battery was now placed in contact with the spi- nal marrow, while the other rod was applied to the selatic nerve. Every musele of the body was imme- diately agitated with convulsive movements resem- bling a violent shuddering from the cold; the left side was most powerfully convulsed at each renewal of the electric contact. On moving the second rod from the hip to the heel, the knee being previously bent, the leg was thrown out with such violence as nearly to overturn one of the assistants, who in vain attempt- ed to prevent its extension.\n\nExperiment 2. The left phrenic nerve was now made bare at the outer edge of the sternnthyroidhus musele, from three to four inches above the clavicle, the cutaneous incision having been made by the side of the sternocleido mastoidens. Since this nerve is distributed to the diaphragm, and since it commo- nicates with the heart through the eighth pair, It"
