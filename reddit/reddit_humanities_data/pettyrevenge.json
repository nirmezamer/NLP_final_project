I've been in regular contact with management about it, and gotten approval for posting a security camera on my patio. Finally got one of them on video actively compromising the front door's latch. I will be sharing the footage with property management come Monday, but I wanted to give the guy at least one of his pennies back. Couldn't find any tape, so I sliced a delivery sticker that didn't rip up the packaging it was attached to instead. The first one I found read \"curbside pickup\", so I used that to stick his penny back onto his apartment door.\n\nI plan to sit down with management either over the weekend or on Monday to report. They have been clear that they will address this issue if I can provide solid evidence, and I finally... FINALLY have some.\n\nI'm just glad I was able to give the guy his penny back, he clearly needs it more than I do.",

        "content": "I worked as the lumber opener at Home Depot. The night crew ended their shift an hour later after I arrived. Every day I would see the crew preparing products except for one guy. He was always sweeping between the aisles or mopping which seemed out of place as we contracted with a janitorial service. I decided to ask how and why he was assigned this work. This is his story:\n\nThe guy was hired as part of the overnight shift. One evening, he was injured. The injury wasn\u2019t serious but not minuscule. Due to the large turnover of employees, the supervisor inquired if the guy could stay until the shift ended due to the large amount of tasks requiring completion. The guy agreed and completed the shift. \n\nA few days later, the guy was at a family reunion. He shared the story with relatives including his uncle, who is a lawyer. Even though his uncle did not specialize in work injuries, the uncle was aware the shift manager was required to send the guy home immediately and asking him to stay was illegal. The uncle explained the reason for such laws and offered to represent the guy for free. These cases are frequently addressed by a settlement rather than court. With initial hesitation, the guy agreed. \n\nThe result was a settlement. I inquired as the amount which the guy could not provide due to signing a NDA but did confirm the amount was higher than most assumed. \n\nI repeated the original question with more emphasis. Why was this guy still working at Home Depot? He smiled and answered. As long as he arrived to work and completed his tasks, Home Depot could not fire him. His uncle had said to immediately contact if the job was terminated as another lawsuit would occur. The termination easily could be viewed as retribution to the settlement.  Home Depot slowly lessened the guy\u2019s hours and assigned menial tasks as they anticipated the guy\u2019s patience would end. The guy informed that he didn\u2019t need the job anymore and finally had the money to attend college due to the settlement. However, in the months prior to college beginning, he would continue to work at Home Depot because his refusal to quit enraged the management/company. I laughed and thought \u201cthis guy is a legend!\u201d\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "This happened a couple of years ago when my wife and I were moving out of our previous apartment. So moving day comes, landlord shows up and we walk through the whole apartment with him to hand it over. Even though he has some minor complaints in the end he agrees to refund the deposit in full and we part on good terms.\n\nA couple of days pass and we get an long angry voicemail claiming he was renovating and noticed that the room that was my former office smells extremely bad, claiming our cats would have urinated in there repeatedly and we would need to come back and renovate the room ourselves or otherwise he\u2019d get a health inspector, contractors etc. all on our dime to fix it. And he means tearing down the wallpapers, replacing the wood flooring, painting the walls etc. etc.\n\nMy wife and I are dumbfounded, we do have cats, so we do not dismiss it outright. But we realize that this is basically impossible, as I used the room every day and we had the apartment professionally cleaned before handing it back and there\u2019s just no way that what he\u2019s describing was there when we left. Maybe it was a raccoon that got in during the days the apartment was empty or whatever but it wasn\u2019t our fault either way. So we call him to let im know we won\u2019t cover it and he gets really nasty making all kinds of claims about the state of the apartment, about how we would twist everything and how he would make sure we would pay for this. After 10 minutes of back and forth, I just hang up on him. \n\nExcpeting a massive bill to arrive at any point after this left us anxious and really started to mess with our heads during this time. And of course we don\u2019t get our deposit back neither.\n\nBecause of this whole ordeal and seeing my wife being worried about this all the time, I start to become really angry and dive a little deeper into our options. I discover that where we live, if a landlord does not formally claim a reason for holding back a deposit withing 6 months of the end of the lease, they are by law required to refund it. So I figure that revenge is a dish best served cold and we just need to wait it out for another 3 months or so and after that it\u2019s our turn.\n\nI calculate the exact date when the 6 months have passed and one day later just message him to please refund the deposit within two weeks. He just replies \u201cyeah, sure buddy\u201d. So we wait, no money comes, then we sent a formal letter setting a second deadline. Again nothing happens (I was actually hoping for that at this point). So we hire an attorney and let her collect the money on our behalf. The landlord starts claiming all kinds of ridiculous damages etc. which would let him keep the deposit which the attorney simply dismisses as the time for claims has passed.\n\nThen for some reason he pays only 80% or so of the amount due, so the attorney has to get at it again to get the full amount. Apparently, he is not realizing that all this is incurring hourly costs for the attorney which he also has to pay, as he is legally liable to refund. So in the end he pays the full deposit, interest and a massive bill for our lawyer far higher than the deposit. Needless to say, we are very happy with the outcome. \n\nOnce everything is settled, my wife and I just sat in our new home\u2019s garden, had a glass of wine and burned the old rental agreement while planning how to spend the deposit.",

I have been a landlord myself and always sent full deposit (unless there was a legit reason to hold anything, very rare and small amount) within a week of move out.",
            "This is why in the UK, deposits have to go through a third party company. \n\nI had one landlord demand damages to the full amount of my deposit. I objected and he didn't even argue the case on his side. So the deposit scheme people just gave me all of my money back without lawyers."

At the time of this story I (18 the time) was a senior and my brother Jimbo (16 at the time) was a sophomore.\n\nMy brother has always had a unique sense of style and to this day consistently rocks a brand of sweatpants overalls called Swoveralls. Back in high school, his favorite look was to have one long sweatshirt string and one short one. Sometimes in the hallway, one of his friends would grab the long sweatshirt string and they would play limbo with people going to class. Students and teachers loved it and they still managed to get to class before the bell.\n\nOne day the principal (who was in her first year as principal and on a power trip), walked up to them and told them to go to her office. Once there, she told them they were in trouble for bullying, alleged they made two students cry, blocking the hallway, and otherwise being delinquent. They explained that even teachers participated and if anyone asked them to move they would have done so happily. She didn\u2019t care and gave each of them a week of detention.\n\nHere comes the revenge. Someone made a group on Facebook: Free Limbo Jimbo! From the Facebook group, which garnered nearly 200 members in less than 12 hours, a plan emerged. The following morning everyone was to gather outside the school for one thing, the one thing that could bring us all together:\n\nA limbo protest.\n\nWe stood outside for all of homeroom and first period. Posters were decorated, shirts were made, students chanted \u201cfree limbo Jimbo, free limbo Jimbo!\u201d When the second period bell rang, we took to action. A large speaker played the limbo song as nearly 200 students limboed into our school one by one. Our principal was furious, she tried to take down names for detention but there were too many of us. \n\nWhen the last bell rang that day, my brother, myself, and about 20 other students walked to the detention room to pay our debt to society. The detention supervisor took one look at all of us and said \u201cI marked you as attended, if you run you might still catch the bus\u201d\n\nAnd there you have it. Today I dug out my old limbo shirt and happily wore it to commemorate the greatest protest in all northwestern NJ regional high school history.\n\nFin.",
