It is focused on joining, Basic Combat Training (BCT) and Advanced Individual Training (AIT), and follow on schools, such as Airborne, Air Assault, Ranger Assessment and Selection Program (RASP), and any other Additional Skill Identifiers (ASI).\n\nWe ask that you do some research on your own, as joining the Army is a big commitment and shouldn't be taken lightly. Resources such as [GoArmy.com](https://www.goarmy.com/), the [Army Reenlistment site](http://www.armyreenlistment.com/), [Bootcamp4Me](http://bootcamp4me.com/), Google and the Reddit search function are at your disposal. There's also the [/r/army wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/wiki/index). It has a lot of the frequent topics, and it's expanding all the time.\n\n/r/militaryfaq is open to broad joining questions or answers from different branches.\nMake sure you check out the /Army [Duty Station Thread Series](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/8u44b7/duty_station_thread_miscellaneous_general/), and our ongoing [MOS Megathread Series](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/9knq72/mos_megathread_series_cmf_35_military/).

            "So how does the volunteering for RASP works? Unfortunately, I wasn\u2019t given an OP 40 contract due to my GT score not meeting the minimum. Would that mean the cadres may care about GT scores when volunteering thus turning me away? Thanks guys.",
            "Hello everyone, I'm currently in a weird situation but was hoping someone here would be able to help me out. To put it short, I was (until 3 weeks ago) a recipient of the HPSP until my school dismissed me (due to getting 1 point from passing in a class). Currently I am just existing in a state of limbo because I have been getting absolutely no communication from my civilian contact for these few weeks, but want to go active and don't know who to go to in order to figure out what I could actually go into. Currently a reserve 2LT with a bachelor's and 2 years commissioned, was interested in working with the army ships but found that might not work out. \n\nWouldn't have come to ask here but I've had absolutely no contact from anyone and feel a bit lost, plus asking online has yielded no luck. Thank you ahead of time, anything is appreciated!",
            "I can't do a push up!! I leave for basic August 5th and I still can not do a push up? How did you get there? I try every day and still I'm just not getting it. It's like my arms and chest don't get any stronger. Now I'm going to be the person getting smoked or worse getting other people smoked which sucks!",

Is it possible to negotiate a deal with a recruiter to get them out or at least just one person? If so im willing to sign the contract on the spot.",

If it just treated veterans instead of always searching for reasons to exclude care, much of the horror stories that prevent enlisties from hearing the good the army can provide. New generations seeing failed aftercare of veterans over and over is cumulative and will diminish any surge the services expect in recruiting when they need it the most.\u00a0",

We are talking over 200# and standing 5'4\".\n\nSix months ago, he was cleared to return to drill status (profile ended, etc) and since then he's lost 20#.  Still puts him over weight and out of tape.\n\nHe's lost all the \"easy weight\" at this point, and so now its getting harder and harder to scrub off those pounds.  He is doing everything right, he's lifting three times a week and doing HIIT sessions followed by LSS work twice a week.\n\nBut its reached the point where he's just not losing the inches around the middle.  From May to June he lost four pounds and nothing off the waist.  \n\nHis body fat percentage increased by 0.4%.\n\nThis means despite lifting more (benching his body weight for the first time in his life, squatting his old body weight, and straight bar deadlifting in the mid 300's), rucking more, and doing HIIT (ok so his HIIT is 20/10's of jumping rope x10+3 minute rest x3, which I don't know how good is really), and passing his ACFT in the 430 to 450 range...his body fat actually climbed.\n\nHe's got to lose around 4% body fat in the next six months (or around 30#) and I feel like the only advice I can give him is \"Get swol son, that gut is going to take a while to get rid of, so pack on all the muscle you can, without failing your ACFT\"  and that's not great advice.",

            "Can\u2019t outrun a bad diet. \n\nThat being said, has he spoken with his provider about any of his surgeries or conditions causing weight gain or throwing off his tape test? It\u2019s rare, but it\u2019s in the regulation. Maybe he had some medication that wrecked his metabolism. He can avoid a flag if there is any factual medical issue that would make it unreasonably difficult to lose weight.",
            "You can refer him to the Army Wellness Center or dietitians (both are self referral) who can help him look at his diet and see where the disconnect is.",

            "What\u2019s that saying again?\n\nOh yeah, you can\u2019t outrun a bad diet.",
            "You can't just lift weight and expect to lose fat, and I can damn near guarantee that jumping rope isn't getting his heart rate high enough to be a meaningful HIIT workout.\n\nIf you want to lose 1lb of body fat per week you need to be at about a 3500 calorie per week deficit. That means first and foremost changing your diet, and doing *a lot* of long cardio sessions. When I'm cutting I'm doing no less than 45 minutes of cardio five days a week. Losing weight is not easy nor fast, takes an *informed and effective* plan, and commitment to that plan. As others have said, have him see a dietitian to get started.",
            "Yeah, wellness center stat. He can be doing all the PT he wants, but what has his diet been like? Sure, this may be body type dependent, but it sounds like a) his \"HIIT\" isn't really HIIT and b) if he isn't also trimming portion sizes and focusing on the right foods, he screwing himself.",
            "You mentioned drill status. So I presume you're NG or Reserves. You need to find the nearest regular army post with an Army Wellness Center (AWC) and have your soldier schedule an appointment with a BodPod and Dietician. additionally, track down a certified Master Fitness Trainer (MFT) hopefully local to your unit. Have your soldier take their guidance for their situation. \n\nAs good as your advise or research may be you should still have your soldier work with actual certified professionals to deal with their challenge.",
