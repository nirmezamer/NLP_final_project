No, not that one, the second one that happened *last month* as well.\n\nJust wanted to take a second and make sure - if you're impacted and still getting shit together, make sure you visit their office, they've given out a lot for those tornados recently.\n\nOtherwise, Rule 1 is in effect; enjoy the weekend!",

They didn\u2019t mention the line of shots that came with the tacos. I take like 4-5 shots and eat tacos. I go back to work. It\u2019s Friday and we expect to get off pretty soon. 1sg comes in freaking out in a Philippino accent \u201cclean this PUCKIN company the SMA is visiting.\u201d The god son of SMA Dailey was in my company. So, I guess that influenced his visit. The other team leader in my squad sees me nervously throwing dip bottles away and says \u201cI can smell your lunch my dude you\u2019re sweating it out.\u201d \n\nSMA arrives. Gives a speech about soldiering and blah blah. At the end, he tells every squad leader in the company to pick the standout guy from their squad to be recognized out back. My squad leader screams my name out, and everybody forms up outside. \n\nI\u2019m at parade rest but there is Patron dripping down my forehead. I\u2019m terrified. I\u2019m also the first in the line of dudes. SMA Dailey comes up to me. He\u2019s surprisingly short by the way I had to look down at him and I\u2019m like 5\u201911\u201d.  He says, \u201cWhere ya from son?\u201d And I answer, \u201cPortland, Oregon Sergeant Major.\u201d I can SMELL IT COMING OUT OF MY MOUTH DIRECTLY INTO HIS FACE. He smirks at me and stares for a sec. Then talks about how he loved his visit there and found the eastern part of the state to be a special beauty. Hands me a coin, thanks me for my service and that\u2019s that. I got my SMA coin drunk and with congratulations.",

SMA Tilley was driving by and saw us covered in mud trying to put up camo netting over the generator. Driver stopped and Tilley was asking questions. Got coined for hustle, while he asked my NCO leaders why they were all in the shade and not helping. \n\nNot sure if Tilley was a good SMA overall, but that kept me going mentally until I got out of there to a new unit.",

The night before the 12 mile I was washing *all* of my clothes pretty late at night when a silver fox looking guy walked in with a 6 pack to do some laundry. \n\nIn the course of conversation he dropped a couple \u2018hints\u2019 of his service. Stuff like \u201cit was around 2012 or so when I was the XO of (insert unit here).\u201d \n\nI pulled my clothes out of the wash around midnight and the washer didn\u2019t hit spin so they were sopping wet\u2026and I had to be awake 3 hours later.

After the 12 mile, I asked around to see if anyone knew who that guy was. One of my friends told me \u2018oh yeah! That\u2019s Colonel (insert name), he\u2019s from the 82nd\u2019 \n\nTo this day it is still my gold standard of what servant leadership *actually* means. Good guy.",
