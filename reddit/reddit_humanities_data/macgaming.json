Compatibility is broken down to Native ARM, Rosetta 2, iOS, CrossOver or Parallels.\n\nThe wiki is free to add information to, you can edit any page without an account.

            "There is a Mac version of Hades in Steam, which for me runs flawlessly. I'm assuming Steam counts as \"Native\"?",
            "Boot camp was a simple utility to permit easy booting of Windows x86/64 on Intel Macs. \nApple has since moved from Intel Macs to Apple Silicon.  Apple Silicon can\u2019t (natively) run Windows 10 for Intel. \nApple Silicon can (natively) run Windows 10 for ARM (via Parallels and a download of Windows 10 ARM Edition), and then within Windows 10 ARM Edition, Microsoft includes an X64 emulator (and now a x86 32 bit emulator too, I think) to emulate and run Windows 10 x86/64 apps (ie standard Windows apps).  But just be aware you\u2019re running MacOS, running the Parallels app, running Windows for ARM, and then using a Microsoft emulator to emulate X86/x64 on ARM.  That\u2019s a LOT of work.  While I\u2019ve done this, and it does work (on an 8GB M1 Air), I see it more as a crutch, rather than as something to use for full-time use. \n\nMaybe with the Apple Studio and many-cores, and those apps in Windows 10 (x64/x86) that are multi-threaded, maybe the experience will improve.  But \u2018even\u2019 with Apple Studio, the per-core speed hasn\u2019t improved - one just gets more of them.",
            "Great list! I've also built a simple site to find compatible Mac games along with their metacritic score and completion time:\n\n[macgameslist.com](https://macgameslist.com)\n\nYou can filter by genres and by Apple Silicon native games. The data used is mostly from applegamingwiki and applesilicongames, as well as personal testing (mostly to verify).\n\nI'm also trying to see if we can petition devs to port highly demanded games to Mac (see the most wanted games page).",
            "It would be good to add API to that list (OpenGL / Metal) so we can see which games we won't be able to play in 2024.",
            "Wasteland 3 does not run well on M1 Pro/Max. There is an issue that the devs are aware, but say can only be fixed once apple and Unity work on the issue.   \n\n\nI updated the list =(",
            "Im considering to coming back to wow. The game seems to run flawless and smooth on M1x chips",
            "Sorry, not sure how to go about editing the list but I\u2019d like to inform that 7 Days to Die (7D2D) had a recent developer update through Steam and is now fully playable native on M1 MBP Pro Max. \n\nI\u2019ve maxed out the graphic settings and logged at least 5 hours with no issues so far.",
            "This is too funny. MacOS on ARM now supports 10000x more windows games than Windows11 on ARM",
            "I noticed these were not confirmed in the Native column, I have played all of them on an M1 MacBook Air natively without issue:\n\n- Mount and Blade Warband (I've even modded this one with great success)\n\n- Total War Napoleon\n\n- Total War Empire\n\nAlso I was able to successfully run Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy \"natively\" using [Mac Source Ports](https://macsourceports.com/game/swjkja). Big shoutout to the person on the list who suggested this option and confirmed it works for Jedi Outcast for the inspiration.",
            "The Game Porting Kit has blown a hole wide open for new games to run. I hope the community continues to update the wiki with their results. Happy gaming everyone!"

            "Seeing how much I can push the ray tracing on the M3 Max. Granted, this isn't really a true test, as the multiple layers of translation, running through 2 sets of beta software, are hurting the performance. Have to use an FSR3 frame gen mod to get it to a playable frame rate. The frame gen causes a lot of artifacts. Usually in the bottom 25% of the screen while driving but easily noticeable anywhere with quick camera movements. Tested this with a lowered resolution, but high graphic settings. It is certainly playable like this, but not ideal. The ray / path tracing can get very noisy, but can look pretty damn impressive at times. One of the best showings of the path tracing comes in at the end. The orange fluorescent light that spreads out and fills the alcove, that gets broken up by lighter store signs, looks, mostly okay. I'm not sure if some of the floor tiles are a hard cut off for the ray bounces, or if they are actually a different color. Hopefully, the non max versions of the M4 chips can pull off RT performance like this. I feel like they might already have some solid hardware, that just needs some more fluent software. The frame graph is hilarious...",

            "Wow that\u2019s damn impressive dude. Might try this out. I have the same system as yours",
            "Thanks for sharing my very good dude! but TBH this kind of look awful? I mean the game. I have zero clue on how frame generation and path tracing work so I'm an absolute noob here. What are the frame rates when you push up the resolution?\n\n2 things that realy stood out:\n\n- The way the image reconstruct from a cloud of dots, exactly like real time editing in Blender. Is it due to path tracing?\n- Is it common for frame generation to miss 25% of the bottom of the frame like that, or do you think it's a software issue with the mod?\n\nAnyway, thank you very much for your post. Very informative.",

            "The thing is even if the performance is good the experience is pure garbage, the way ui reacts for full screen stuff is just atrocious"
