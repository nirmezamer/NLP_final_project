            "After finishing **Half Life**, **Half Life 2** and **Half Life 2: Episode 1**, I'm playing **Half Life 2: Episode 2** now. Half Life 2 looks like a tech showcase, while Episode 1 and specially Episode 2 look like a proper game. Everything is the same, but better and more fleshed out. In Half Life 2 it feels like Valve spent too much time and resources trying to innovate and weren't able to put a game together. Episode 2 is almost embarrassing, because it shows how disjointed and bad Half Life 2 actually is. So yeah, I like episode 2. I wish it was even weirder. The telekinetic alien in the barn? I wanted more of that. I also grew fond of Alyx in Episode 2. Is she the proto AI companion? I can see Ellie and Elizabeth in her.\n\n\nI also started playing **Slay the Spire** again. I liked the game the first time, but got burned out on how difficult it is. Now I think it finally clicked for me and I'm addicted to it. I'm still bad though. lol \"Finished\" the game with the first three characters, but still haven't beat the heart.",
            "I wrapped up the story in **Alien: Isolation** and the last few achievements as well. Still a solid game after nearly 10 years. It's amazing that Creative Assembly was able to make such an incredible AAA survival horror game after making primarily strategy games for most of their history.\n\nI continued playing through **Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners** as well and I finished the story after leaving the game dormant for 2 years. I'm now enjoying the Aftershock DLC and grabbing achievements as well which are surprisingly fun as they force me to grab certain materials or find certain weapons to complete them.\n\nI also started playing **Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy** yesterday and I'm shocked at how good this has been so far. I'm only two hours in but they're really nailing the tone, atmosphere and humor of the movies. Which is great because those films are probably my favorite from the MCU. I'm also glad because this game didn't go the route of Marvel's Avenger with the whole live service shit show it followed.",
            "I completed **Tunic** and **Sifu** this month. Both very satisfying games in very different ways. \n\n**Tunic** is the first game in a long time that made me actually break out the pen and paper, and I really appreciate it for that. The final puzzle is one of my favorite puzzles I have ever completed in a game. \n\nI also really like the boss fights. I know it\u2019s combat is a bit divisive, especially given how much harder than the rest of the game they are, but I really enjoyed them, especially the final boss. \n\n**Sifu** on the other hand is just pure flow state combat. The closest a game has come to feeling like John Wick.\n\nThen, like half of everyone else, I started **Shadow of the Erdtree** last night. It\u2019s bigger and harder than I expected, but that\u2019s a plus for me.",
            "I'm trying to play Mass Effect and there are moments when I can see what's great about it, but as wide as the game world is, it's so shallow...! yes you can go to so many planets, but each has the same underground base, all pickups are just weapons, all the collectables feel are just a journal entry. I hope I can get to ME2, but that will probably mean I just run through the story stuff and skip the skippable stuff.",
            "I beat SMT IV earlier this month, I started on 02/25/2024 then ended on 06/06/2024. I enjoyed my run a lot overall. In the beginning it felt slow but glad I stuck with it. I am playing the game again, >!I believe this isn\u2019t a spoiler but there is multiple endings so I did the Law route and now want to do Chaos through New Game Plus.!<\n\n>!I\u2019ve finally made it out of Naraku again earlier today!<",
            "Playing Mega Man 3. Only Needle Man remains to be defeated. Pretty good game. The weaknesses are less broken, so the boss battles are still challenging while using them, which fixes what I think is the main problem of 1 and 2.",
            "I\u2019m finishing up Prey for the first time, and it\u2019s great!\n\nNow I\u2019m looking for a palate cleanser \u2014 a really good monster tamer game. Anything I can play or emulate on a SteamDeck would be great. I have previously enjoyed Dragon Warrior Monsters but never played any of the sequels; similarly, I\u2019ve played SMT and Persona games and found that they were a bit harder than I was looking for.",
            "Started a Wrath of the righteous playthrough (for the sixth time in four years I think) and finally reached act 3 for the first time! The game is fun albeit a bit clunky, I'll probably spend the next few weeks on this before finishing Banishers Ghost of New Eden.",
            "I've been watching a lot of Jacob Geller and am now on the hunt for artsy fartsy \"eat your vegetables\" games that treat video games as an art form first and a form of entertainment second. :THE LONGING: is without a doubt my favorite example of this.

        "content": "Last time I posted here, [I played fallout 1 for the first time and declared it the best fallout game](https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/1cr72d1/fallout_1_i_died_to_rats_at_the_start_i_couldnt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Many commentators recommended playing Fallout 2 and using the restoration patch because it fixed the bugs and completed some content.\n\nSo I did and everyone was right. Fallout 2 is the best game and the most questionable in terms of lore and tone, especially working backwards from the modern games.  So these are more my rambling thoughts and experiences playing fallout 2, so you're not getting a cohesive essay with complexity and nuance.  More of a emotional reaction to the strangest parts of the game.\n\nEverything plays exactly like the first one. Same game play, isometric view, and leveling system. The developer gods were kind giving me a \"push\" mechanic when an NPC was blocking a doorway. I reloaded so many times in the first game because I was trapped  by an npc standing in the doorway. There's a lot of consequences and time constraints for some side missions, but the main game seemingly didn't have a constraint this time except a few spiritual dreams reminding me of my mission.\n\nAs for my character, I named him Propane Bobbie, the charismatic gunslinger going from town to town helping the citizens and becoming part of local folklore.\n\nOk, I start out as tribal member who must overcome a holy trial as I am \"The Chosen One\". This chosen one got his ass handed to him 3 minutes in and died, because I missed 100% of my unarmed throws at the last trial. Bobbie was not the chosen one, until I found there's a dialogue option that you can convince the guy you're fighting that \"violence is bad and pointless.\" My methods of persuasion will hopefully be handy this game. Now I'm off to find the Garden of Eden kit to save my tribe. Hell yeah let's see what happened since the last game.\n\nApparently there are ghosts in this game. Yeah I ran into a town and apparently there's a ghost you can meet and get a mission to return an object and bury them in a cemetery. Why? I dunno, I guess it seemed like a cool night time side mission. So of course I ended up ransacking the cemetery thinking there would be guns or that sweet power armor. -1000 karma off the first hour and this will not be the last time you're running into ghosts, there's some weird spiritual stuff on what I assumed was heavily scifi. \n\nI recruited some companions, a tribesman slave who speaks with a Jamaican accent, a tough barkeeper, Marcus the mutant sheriff, and my husband. Yes, I ended up getting married in this game. Very nice to know that sleeping with a dude for shits and giggles ended up with me in a shotgun wedding when the father came in the middle of \"fun time\". So now I'm married, I'm very surprised how progressive this game is with letting you sleep with male and female NPCs. Then my husband got killed in a random encounter with slavers. Our marriage couldn't survive the apocalypse sadly. So I ended up killing the head slaver in one of the first towns for revenge. Had to tell the father in law the passing of his son. Saddest moment for me.\n\nRoleplaying as Bob also comes with shortcomings. I visit the town where Marcus the mutant sheriff is chilling and I meet a scientist who is testing a smart serum on a Radscorpion. I lost a chess match (intelligence skill) and a lock picking (lockpick skill) challenge against a god damn radioactive lobster, he doesn't have hands to pick a lock. HOW??? the only thing I beat the radscorpion in is an eye exam (Perspective skill) . This game feels closer in tone to Fallout New Vegas: Old World Blue DLC at times.\n\nThis game is very big, bigger than the first game and matching expansive modern games. What Fallout 2 has over all other games though is a car. My sweet ride running of fusion cells and carrying the whole crew from place to place faster than ever. Then my car got stolen and had to investigate in a sketchy casino town.\n\nAll these random moments and stories that feel out of place in the modern games makes me wonder if the developers were throwing every idea at the wall because they had to make Fallout 2 in a year (insane!). You know what really surprised me though, Death claws can talk. I followed them to vault 13 and they freaking talk. I want the next game to have them talk, how come nobody in the Fallout subs memed on this?\n\nSo the main plot has you fighting the Enclave. They kinda sucked in the modern games where they came off as a nuisance to me. Here they are pretty metal, you don't mess with them as they massacre families in random encounters as they try to reestablish the U.S. Government.\n\nThen I get to the good old epilogue narrated by Ron Perlman as he narrates each side story about what happened to them. I saved my village, I reunited them with vault 13, I destroyed the enclave, saw NCR expand, and overall was immensely satisfied with my roleplay as Bob. So no complaints from me, except killing kids who pickpocketed my stuff gives me negative karma.\n\nHighly recommend the game as it holds up extremely well with it's addicting gameplay, consequential choices, and surprising don't care attitude about tone. No need to remake this game as it's still a fun game that runs well on modern PCs. ",

It\u2019s Fallout on crystal meth and the craziness is part of its charm. \n\nUnlike many folks out there, I actually don\u2019t have a problem with the humor most of the time, and think the controversy is overblown (as tends to happen on the Internet). But I have to say I never really liked the ghost quest in Fallout 2, and for me it stands out like a sore thumb. Doesn\u2019t ruin the game or anything, but it\u2019s the only part where I really think should\u2019ve been left on the cutting room floor, or as an Easter egg special encounter. \n\nBut yeah, Fallout 2 is a masterpiece, and every serious fan needs to play it.",

The original games were really great in that you simply COULDN'T experience the entirety of the game in one play through, and probably not even five play throughs. Many aspects and areas and choices are only available if you have a high enough skill, or base stat (or low enough), or karma (or low enough), or the right perk, or a combination of any of the above when you run into a given situation.  These situations and decisions can also chain into other aspects that chain into others and so on.  The game is VAST and does branching REALLY well, and really spoiled me when I tried Bethesda games later on and found them to be quite lackluster by comparison.",

        "content": "Just as the title says, i've been a MM fan for a long time, mainly playing the old games on other people's consoles until they started releasing collections. I absolutely love the classic and X series, and I'd kill for Legends 3, but I never had the money for 6 different BN games in the GBA era. I'm finally playing the first game (I'm at the power plant; 380HP; 7 Buster upgrades), and some of the game design choices are really putting me off. Like I am amazed children put up with this.\n\nTo start, the difficulty is all over the place, or maybe just random. The wrong random encounter at any time will give you a game over and force you to reload a save (no retrying battles why???) I generally save at the start of each new \"room\" in a dungeon, but I am learning that is not enough. \n\nWeirdly enough, major bosses are easy b/c I always save before facing them, and their consistent attack patterns make it easy to anticipate and plan for them with a little trial and error. It's just the random encounters that get me.\n\nThe progression system is also very annoying. Upgrades for your basic attack and HP total are few and far between (and very often, flat out hidden). I can't really find a way to upgrade armor, so attacks that deal 100 damage are always going to deal 100 damage. A lot of attacks seem to do 100 damage. (reminder: my current hp is just 380)\n\nYour primary growth comes through finding new chips, which each represent unique attacks. These are basically like trading cards you assemble into a deck, and every battle starts with you drawing a new \"hand\" of attacks you can use. You can then play multiple attacks if you have either 2 or 3 of a kind, or a straight, or via other mysterious and arcane conditions. (There's also an elemental system at play that doesnt' seem to mean anything?) This is fine and could be the grounds for a unique and fun battle system (I actually remember really loving KH:CoM, but maybe I wouldn't today?) except the cumbersome menus to manage your \"deck\" and the pace at which you acquire new chips make it probably my least favorite thing to do in the game. \n\nAnd there is no experience or leveling system to speak of. Grinding doesn't work, it only tempts fate to give you a battle that will send you back to your last save. The only rewards are chips, and money you can use to buy more chips. There are some shopkeepers that sold hp and buster upgrades, but I cleaned them out early, and afaik, they haven't restocked. They live out in a dungeon, so I'm reluctant to go out and check (even though its in a low level area).\n\nLook, I know people have nostalgia for these games, and I can see the glimmer of good ideas here. I know 2 is supposed to be a giant step up (and also the peak? doesn't bode well for 3-6...) I'm trying really hard to not use the cheats on the collection that turn the game into a cakewalk (I enjoy a sense of achievement from gaming), but I wonder if it's worth the frustration. If any fans have advice, I'd love to hear it, but if the best anyone can offer is \"you need to build a better deck\", then maybe the games aren't for me",

        "comments": [
            "Battle Network 1 to Battle Network 2 is almost the same kind of transition as classic MegaMan 1 to MegaMan 2.\n\nRemember the original MegaMan? They had weird design choices and ideas that were relics of expectations of how the genre *should* be based on other games in the genre. Like how enemies in MM1 dropped Score Pellets that incremented an old-fashioned high score counter that the game tracked. It felt very arcady and like classic platformers did at the time, like Super Mario Bros with a gun.\n\nWell in Megaman 2, they cut out stuff like that, axed the parts that didn't work well, kept and polished the bits that seemed good, and tried to build something new mechanically on top of that as a foundation. A lot of people will say that Classic MegaMan really came into its own and really understood what made it work with its second entry.\n\nBattle Network 2 follows basically the same development trend. Areas are more unique and visually appealing, network layouts are (a bit) less confusing by trying to differentiate pathways with different color palettes when they overlap, enemy design is a bit tighter including a wider variety and better animations, telegraphs, and learnably predictable behaviors. Plus they added new mechanics that lean into the RPG-genre more of growing stronger and gaining (hidden) experience. They cut out some of the questionable decisions and polished up the good bits to shine brighter and help it embrace its unique qualities more.\n\nIn my opinion and experience, very few people say that the series peaks at BN2. I think most in the community would say it peaked at BN3 and then had a heart-monitor-esque path of ups and downs the rest of the way through to 6. I personally enjoyed every entry very much with the poor English localization of the original versions of BN4 for the GBA being the biggest detractor for me (hopefully the collection release fixes the translation errors), but I think BN3 is the last game that the collective fan base seems to majority-agree was a good game in the franchise, with the split happening at 4 onwards.\n\n3 added more mechanical systems that felt very \"correct\" in terms of world-flavour and genre-leaning game design that a lot of people appreciated before 4+ added systems that were a bit more divisive in terms of reception. \n\nAll in all, much like Classic MegaMan, I only introduce new players to the 1st game in the series as a little teaser to showcase where it's roots come from. For an actual playthrough of capturing the real \"experience\" of the franchise, I introduce new people to Battle Network 2 as their first game, just like I usually have them play MegaMan 2 as their first game. They're both just better made sequels.",
            "Battle Network 1 is not a good game, and even the fans of the battle network series admit this. 2 is a huge step over 1 and 3 is a huge step up over 2. 4 is kinda mediocre, 5 is divisive, and 6 is also good. My recommendation is to always skip 1, and just start with 2.",
            "Most people consider 3 or 6 to be the best. I'd agree. I've played through all of them except 5 (for reasons).\n\nYou started with the hardest one to get into, which is good! Viruses are more unbalanced  in 1 than any other, and it also has the blandest chip library.\n\nElements do have a meaning. Mainly, elemental chips deal double damage to enemies weak to it. That includes you if you change your type.\n\nThe other games retain the chip progression, but add a lot of quality of life systems for combat like the Navicust. Unless you're of the same type, attacks will always do the same damage to you. Health is pretty much your only defense besides chips. BN1 has low max health,  but it replenishes after every fight. Later games are the opposite. You tend to have access to more health,  but it doesn't replenish without items/chips.\n\nThe layout improves significantly, too. MMBN1 has probably the worst net layout. I got lost all the time. This still happens in the rest, just less. Shops don't restock as there's a limited amount of chips. There's a point where you have them all, and they're specific to each vendor. \n\nEncounters will work the same throughout. Just how it is. It's supposed to encourage memorizing enemy patterns and prioritizing certain enemies. There's always gonna be a chip that works for a certain situation. That's why you got multiple folders. The grind is in getting the chips you want to make encounters easier, and having different folders for different situations. No retrying is because these were GBA games, and that's how it was back then.\n\nIf you feel up to it, I'd say give 2 or 3 a try. The difficulty curve is a lot better,  and they're less maze like with better balanced viruses and better chips and game systems.\n\nThe story will be pretty much the same in every game, so it doesn't matter much.",
            "While I never played Battle Network 1, from what I've seen and heard it's somewhat primitive compared to the rest of the series. Battle Network 4 is the other black sheep of the franchise (have played it, can confirm it sucks) while 3 is considered the best overall. So it's unsurprising if Battle Network 1 doesn't really click with you.\n\nChildren can surprisingly put up with a lot, especially when it's your only new game.",
            "My understanding is that there\u2019s little held nostalgia for 1. I have nostalgia for 3, but like 6 the most.",
            "I like the first game and tried to play 2 but just couldn't get into it. The major thing I like about the series is the Navi remix designs of the classic robot masters.",
            "I am also a longtime Mega Man fan that tried out the whole Battle Network Legacy Collection during February-March. I didn't love any of them (I thought 6 was okay), and Battle Network 2 might be one of my least favourite games of all time. Backtrack Network is a more appropriate title for the series. The anime is cool as shit though. Outside of the phenomenal battle system that excels in boss fights but is dampened by the frequent random encounters, the series doesn't do anything for me. I would've loved a spin-off focusing on the Liberation Missions in MMBN5.",
            "**TL;DR** - BN1 is frustrating and janky. If you like the theory but not the execution, speed through it to get to BN2. Big jump in quality.\n\nYou're criticisms are valid and shared by most, myself included. BN1 is a prototype for the rest of the series: you can see a good foundation in there, but what's built on top is questionable, frustrating, and sometimes downright bad. I played through it on an emulator a while back and only got through because of save states.\n\nBN2 fixes *almost* everything: better story, MUCH better difficulty curve, the internet is navigable (and interconnected), there's more variety in potential strategies with more chips and abilities, more extra activities to help you buff yourself and your deck, etc. \n\nI've seen BN3 considered the 'peak' of the series, and I think I agree. It sands the rough edges from 2 and fleshes out everything it did well even more.\n\nEither do what you need to do to get through 1 or just skip right to 2. You won't miss any story beats other than \"good guys won in the end.\"\n\nI hope this helps and you have fun with the rest of the series!",
            "These are common opinions even among fans. You won\u2019t miss a ton if you jump into 2 (I think I started with 3 or 4 since Gamestop on the 00\u2019s had varied inventory, before going back and playing the earlier games) and you\u2019ll have a better time. The story and mechanics are certainly better in the other ones. I still liked the later entries, but some of them have their rough points.\n\nAlso don\u2019t be afraid to use guides. 3 onward had official ones, but I used GameFAQs to get through the confusing parts as a kid and, as with many games from that era, sometimes things are nonintuitive. I love the series overall, and even like Starforce.",
            "I played the first 2 when they came out, they were alright. But even as child i realized the grind and conditions for more and better chips was ridiculous. Then i lost respect for the series at 3 (maybe already at 2 for certain end game stuff) when they started splitting the game, pokemon style. So now exclusive content and more work to one hundred percent.\n\nI'll always have nostalgia, but the one time I tried going back i slapped on some cheats to make it better, (infitite money, toggling random encounters), but still couldn't do it for long."

        "content": "This review will be a bit short, as I don't have as much to say about the game. Long story short is, I played it back in the day, and now, more than a decade later I've finished it again. \n\nI'll be honest and say that I'm not much of a connoisseur of tower defense games. I played a whole bunch in the internet flash games golden age, but after a few minutes I dropped them as I thought they were boring. More often than not the idea of putting your towers AROUND a path instead of walls IN that path felt stupid to me. I think that's why PvZ was so appealing to me, because settings your defences along 5 lanes felt more organic than just around a few roads. \n\nBut I'm digressing, but I wanted to say is that I LOVE how PvZ is a game that is not really hard, but still manages to introduce their mechanics slowly, getting the player acquainted with its systems. This is specially true when the new zombie type is vulnerable to the new plant unlocked I'll present some examples here:\n\n* 1st: one lane, peashooter and normal zombies. Impossible to lose\n* 2nd: three lanes, and now you should plant sunflowers for additional income\n* 3rd level: now you can destroy enemy squads with a cherrybomb but the zombies are tougher.\n* 5th level: first minigame, which serves to introduce you to different game modes (which happen in all level that end in \"5\"), introduce the only real character, Crazy Dave, and also gives you the ability to dig plants to start again\n* 6th level: now you got pole vaulters, so you should plant something quick so they jump it and move slower. Incidentally the new plant, the mine potato, takes time to activate, so if you plant this in the way it should work with the next zombie\n* 10th level: an easier level with no sun to pick with 7 out 8 plants you've seen already as a wrap-up. This will continue in all levels multiple of 10\n* 11th level:  Night. Bad news: you can only generate sun with plants. Good news: the new plants, mushrooms are cheaper than the previous ones, even with a free one, the puff-shroom. Also, you can get money that remains between levels and you'll be able to use to unlock a new plant slot!\n* 13th level: New enemy: a zombie with a screen-door-shield. New plant: a fume-shroom which can bypass this diffence\n* 15th level: now you access to an almanac that serves a plant-opedia with all the plants and zombies unlocked. \n* 16th level: New enemy: a footballer zombie, one of the best ones in all of the game. New plant: a hypno-shroom that can turn him against other zombies\n* ...\n\nI've realise I could spend an entire hour writing cases, but this shouldn't be as short as I intended. Nevertheless to say, this also happens between \"worlds\" when you unlock the swimming pool and swimming zombies, the night-swimming pool with its fog, and the roof with the catapult mechanic, not to speak of the minigames and side-games.\n\nAs a final question: is there any other tower defense similar to PvZ you recomment? Which other games would you say have a similar difficulty curve? On the top of my head I can come up with FFX, but I have trouble thinking of more. Interestingly, it's easier for me to think of games that do the opposite, that being hard then become easier.",

            "I remember playing the demo, which was time based and then buying the game. That first night, my gf, now wife, walks into the office and says, you know it's past midnight right? Id been playing it over 5 hours straight without realizing it. It's a perfect game imo.",
            "I don\u2019t remember the whole game super clear (played it as a kid), but 4th act (with night and fog) was much harder than anything else in the game. roof was too easy after this nightmare",
            "I used to live near PopCap before they were bought by EA and I knew the guy who created the game's art style, Richard Werner. I was a tester for PvZ2 and gave management all the feedback I could that the game sucks but if you've played it you'd know they didn't address my feedback. \n\nI don't like tower defense games but PvZ1 is so easy for me to pick up and play. I go through and beat it again every year or two. If there's any other games out there like it, please let me know!",
            "I will always hate EA for what they did with PvZ2 once they bought it.",
            "I still remember this game being uniquely fun in a very new sense of the word for a game, it just felt.. clean?",
            "I found the progression of difficulty to be rather slow, and most levels were easily beatable with the same strategy / build order. All the different conditions (night, fog, roof, ...) just change the type of shooting plant you need to plant, but the overall strategy is the same or very similar in almost every level.\n\nIt does introduce new challenges throughout the entire game, but each is too tiny of an increment to be meaningful, and more difficult zombie types aren't numerous enough to force you to change strategies between levels. And many situations that come close to being tricky are trivialized by using one of the bomb plants.\n\nI remember only a handful of instances where I felt challenged and/or had to do something out of the ordinary.",

        "content": "Do you like platformers? Collect-a-thons? Parkour? Giraffes?\n \nIf you answered yes to any of these then I have the game for you!\n \nCastle on the Coast is simple 3D platformer designed for kids or those new to the genre but the gameplay is such a joy that anyone who likes platformers and collect-a-thon games will have fun.\n \nYou\u2019re playing as George, the mascot of Valley Children\u2019s Healthcare. He\u2019s a goofy giraffe who is also a parkour artist.\n \nThe gameplay is tight and the controls are perfect. Think Mario 64, you have a triple jump, can wall jump, spin, dive, wallclimb, and can even unlock a jetpack at one point. Without much difficulty you can make George do whatever you want.\n \nThere are a few aspects of this game that really made it unique and a joy to play:\n \n* You can turn off invisible walls\n \nYes that\u2019s right, the devs had the foresight to allow the player to turn off those pesky invisible walls if they so choose.\n \nI like this design choice for a number of reasons. If you see an area, you should be able to go there, jankiness be damned. Sure the textures, models and skybox might pop in and out until you get to a stable area, but it give you a level of freedom seldom seen in most games. There are even a few achievements based around breaking the game! In fact, you can just skip the entire game and go right to the final boss if you choose.\n \n* Controls are fluid\n \nNothing tanks a game harder than poor controls. Here the controls are fluid and setup to maximize the fun. George is responsive and you can parkour him anywhere with minimal effort.\n \n* Aggressive checkpoints\n \nIts not easy to die in this game but it does happen. But no fear, checkpoints are everywhere so if you do you wont be going too far back, you\u2019ll be able to pick up where you left off.\n \nMy only complain with the game is navigating the castle can be sometimes be tricky. You use warp zones to get from one place to the next and they are not labeled, you just have to figure it out on your own. I spent a lot of time getting lost in the netherworld just trying to get from one place to the next.\n \nThe closest game I have placed recently that I can compare it to is Tinykin, except Castle on the Coast is way more janky but in a good way.\n \nOverall if you enjoy platformers, collect-a-thons and 3D movement based games then you should check out Castle on the Coast. It\u2019s a much better game then you might think at first glance.",

            "Game is on sale in steam right now too...$2.99(us)  \nFigured I will give it a go. I usually don't like platformers, I just find them frustrating, but why not its only 3 bucks.",
            "Game looks fun and the art style isn't too shabby. However, whatever this writing style is, whether it be AI generated or just sloppy work, makes me want to gouge my own eyeballs out. I feel like a soccer mom is trying to explain to me how RADICAL orange juice is for the body with it's AWESOME NATURAL POWERS.\n\nYou can just throw up buzzwords and expect people to care. Your key points that kept you interested the most are NOT what I would approach people with to sell the game as interesting. Oh a platformer has good controls? Well holy hell man, I wouldn't have expected that.",
            "It was a neat and kinda janky little collectathon for the $0.60 I spent on it in the bundle. The story, what there was, had more heart than I'd expected.",
            "Or you can pick it up for $1, or for $2.99 with **4** other games in [Fanatical's Build Your Own Nexus Bundle](https://www.fanatical.com/en/pick-and-mix/build-your-own-nexus-bundle).  (It's how I got it myself, there are higher tiers with more games and lower per-game price, but I only found 5 games total that interested me.)",
            "Luckily you don\u2019t really have to interact with the NPCs, but it\u2019s a game designed for kids so I wouldn\u2019t hold that against it. \n\nThe controls are better than most platformers. \n\nI made this post because many gamers would take one look at and say \u201cno thanks\u201d but it\u2019s absolutely worth a play. \n\nMyself included, I wouldn\u2019t have thought twice about playing this until a buddy suggested it. And I had a blast with the game"
