            "Still enjoying **Mafia II: Definitive Edition** especially the story as I've forgotten most of the finer details. But I've started to see a lot of the glitches that players have highlighted since release like missing textures/models and messed up clothes physics. It's surprising as I didn't run into any of these issues when I was playing through the DLCs earlier this week.\n\nWith the Steam summer sale going on now, I've started to poke around to see if any of my wishlisted games are at a good price. I've also browsed the main sale page and noticed that both Ghost Recon\u00ae Wildlands and Ghost Recon\u00ae Breakpoint are on sale for $5 and $6 respectively. How are these games for singleplayer?",
            "Finished New Vegas Bounties I. Nice little quest mod. It doesn't give a lot of room for role playing, but I guess that's expected given the nature of bounty quests. Unique weapons are my favourite part, especially the final revolver that is loud as hell. Downloading part II right now.",
            "Currently trying to get 100% completion on Dragon Quest 11... Currently sitting at 100+ hours! Didn't log this kind of playtime since my childhood days with Pok\u00e9mon games \ud83d\ude2d\n\nTruth be told, I normally never bother to do this kind of things, but coming back to my save file from, what, 2021? And keep finding new things (with the help of a guide admittedly) that make me really appreciate the effort the devs put in the game!",
            "I\u2019ve been taking a break from gaming for a bit but am coming back and trying to decide what to play after shadow of the erdtree lol. I\u2019ve got quite a few options. Witcher 3, Yakuza 0, RE4, Mass effect, fallout 3 or nv, control, Alan wake, DMC 3, or half life. Someone give me a recommendation:).",
            "Im currently having a blast playing Ghost of Tsushima for the first time. I choose to play with japanese dubbing and when i found out main character have the same voice actor as Roronoa Zoro from One Piece it made this game 10x better on the spot. Its so immersive with so many things to do and very satisfying combat. Im so happy i can play it on PC.\n\nI also bought RDR2 and Detroit Become Human on Steam Summer Sale so those two are next on my list after Kingdom Come:Deliverance couse i have it installed for months, i have to try it at some point and i only hear good things about it.",
            "Playing Chrono Trigger (DS) with the Delta emulator on my phone. This is my first experience with it, and it's been great so far. I'm about 10 hours in, and the story just keeps getting better. I love all the characters so far too. I can definitely understand the hype around it",
            "**Elden Ring** on PS5. Played through at launch on Xbox Series S but got a PS5 a little while later, so decided to replay it. Also bought the dlc, just have Mohg left to fight to unlock the dlc. But in all honesty, I might complete the base game first as I'm pretty much there anyway.\n\nAlso got into some platformers. As **Astro's Playroom** was pre-installed on PS5, I decided to play through recently and ended getting the platinum trophy for it. What an amazing little game! Really looking forward to the fully fledged Astro Bot game. As a consequence of really enjoying Astro's Playroom, I have been playing **Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time**, and what a game! It's extremely challenging, but really fun.",
            "So, a few days ago I said that I dropped Mega Man 3.\n\nWell, I managed to beat Doc Robot. Now I'm playing it again. I'm at Wily's Castle, right after defeating Yellow Devil.",
            "Spent the week playing **Prey (2017)** and am to Psychotronics on the Detour quest. I've been holding my own (minus a peek into the Trauma Center) but also feel like I'm barely scraping by (which I like). I'm a little concerned that I'm falling behind the power curve due to how I've used my neuromods, since outside of some very minor weapon upgrades, I haven't upgraded combat or stealth since picking up the 9mm. I don't think it'll stop me from progressing, but I also might need to make a tactical retreat and come back better prepared.",
            "I'm hating Pokemon Arceus.. I like the change of the gameplay since it's more fluid, fast and looks more close to the anime but the plot is just so bored and weird.. I don't know but i just press A to continue because the characters are horrible. Also, don't like that all you do is to defeat those special pokemons and thats all..\n\nI will try to advance only doing the main quest and see what happen in the future"

Why do JRPGs have to be so long? Do the devs feel like they have to pad their games out with boring sections that contribute absolutely nothing to the main story to justify the price tag? I'd take a 25 hour game with high production value over 100 hour game with a lot of fetch quests and story fillers any day. \n\nChrono Trigger is the only exception I can find in the JRPG genre. I beat the game in under 25 hours and I loved every single minute of it. The pacing of that game is almost perfect. The combat, the level design and the story are gripping from start to finish. There are slower moments too but they're emotional moments that have impact on character development. There aren't any boring fillers and you don't have to grind to be able to beat the game. ",

            "P5R is unusually long compared to most JRPGs made even now. The vast majority of them never hit the 100 hour mark for main story stuff and only reach that length if you\u2019re trying to 100% them.",
            "Chrono Trigger seriously feels like the only JRPG where all of the \"bad parts\" have been trimmed out in favor of a concise game where all 100% of it is \"the best part\".",
            "Short JRPGs are something I wish we saw more of.",
            "Length is my biggest issue with most modern RPGs, not just JRPGs.  It also feels like even though they are 2-4x longer than the oldies, most of that length come from too much dialoge, too many cutscenes or grinding for materials to make equipment.",
            "Immediately upvote. And yes, I do think that developers in general want their games to be longer for some reason, and sometimes for the worse. \nThe fact that chrono trigger is also considered \u201cshort\u201d is a shame imho. Chrono feels like the right amount of time between how much the story gives you and the side content",

I'm going to throw up.\"***\n\nTears of the Kingdom is a game that expects you both to have played **Breath of the Wild** and also completely forgotten about it. It's the same experience, only *more*, Link gets a superpower here that lets him fuse any two items together, like a rocket to a shield or a propeller to a raft. That's Tears of the Kingdom in a nutshell. You take something basic, then graft a random object onto it with a magic adhesive. More often than not the results actually *work*.\n\nJust as this game riffs heavily on BOTW, so to will I riff heavily on my own review of that older game. Only eight people commented on that piece, and three of them called me a tosser. So a little self-plagiarism or \"Self-Somerton\" is forgivable in this case. **This review contains no spoilers beyond the obvious: 1. Link defeats Ganon. 2. Snape takes a shit on Dumbledore's floor.**\n\n***Content Breakdown***\n\n* 253 Quests\n* 152 Shrines\n* 509 Compendium Entries\n* 135 Armour Pieces\n* 1500+ Collectibles\n\n***The first hour kind of blows.***\n\nRight on cue, Ganon's back and Zelda's missing. Link loses his right arm in the struggle, and he gets a transplanted limb from some Beerus-looking fucker. What follows is a beat-for-beat retelling of the tutorial of BOTW, and indeed the entire rest of the game. Acquire the four superpowers in the starting area, overcome the boss in each region, and face off against Ganon in the end. But playing like BOTW will put you at a disadvantage at the start. Because while the tutorial island looks open, it's actually highly linear. If you deviate from the intended path then you're in for a world of hurt. I wasted half an hour on my first playthrough running around as I'd overlooked the fact that Fast Travel had been unlocked, and I needed to return to my starting position. It's honestly not worth your time poking your nose around until you dive off the tutorial island. Even then, you still need to unlock such features like the paraglider, camera, and inventory expansions given by the broccoli man.\n\n***The game is a technical marvel.***\n\nSomehow, on this seven-year-old tablet, you have a seamless open-map that's also home to an underworld below and the skies above. Yes, the framerate slides when using Ultrahand in a busy environment. But there are no hard crashes, obvious bugs, or amusing glitches found in the average playthrough. If this were made by Bethesda on a high-end PC there'd be a loading-screen every time Link opens a door, and the human-proportioned Gorons would leer at him with unblinking eyes. This is a massive game shoved onto such a small cartridge at only 16 gigs in size.\n\nUltrahand is the sort of mechanic you'd expect to find in a promising Early Access game that releases five years after you were excited for it. What's impressive about this power is that it's simple, and it works, despite the complexity. You can pick up, move, orient, and attach any two mobile items together. From this you can create ladders, bridges, boats, and even airplanes. It's an iceberg of a mechanic that succeeds because you can immediately grasp its potential on first acquiring it, and craft even greater machines if you're audacious enough.\n\nThe long development time makes sense when you realize Ultrahand isn't the only innovation. Rewind is a convenience at first, letting you undo any movement an object takes provided that the object is still in view. This would be a novelty in a linear puzzle-game like **Portal**, but it's mind-blowing to see it function in an open-world, and it's next-level to realise you can combine it with Ultrahand and outright break the harder puzzles the game has to offer.\n\nYou can fault Tears for running at 30 FPS and using the same map and graphics as a six-year-old game. But it is a game first and foremost that experiments in wild directions. This is the twentieth installment of a series that stretches back to 1986, and it breaks ground in utterly new ways in how it lets players mess around with the physics sandbox. Nintendo didn't spend half a decade rendering the arse hairs of a sad dad protagonist going on another maudlin murder-spree like Sony. No, they stuck to their strengths and iterated on a fun gameplay loop, recycled assets be damned.\n\n***The game is a direct upgrade from BOTW for one petty reason.***\n\nThere are no gyroscope puzzles. You remember those shrines where you had to physically move your Joycons around to move a ball through an obstacle course? Yeah, they're gone now. I'm on a Switch Lite, and you can bet your arse I don't miss rotating my arms and torso like I'm trying to molest an invisible parrot. Sadly, like other first-party Nintendo games, there is no option to remap the controls.\n\n***Despite the fleshed-out presentation, the narrative falls flat.***\n\nIt's difficult to fault the main story of BOTW, because it barely existed at all. As soon as the prologue wrapped up, you're given the mission to defeat Calamity Ganon. There's no real mystery as to what happened in the past, and the four main quests all follow the same trajectory. The final boss is a brilliant spectacle, but otherwise not much happens in the ending.\n\nTears follows a similar arc to mixed results. In BOTW, Link could randomly stumble onto areas that awaken an old memory. You naturally experienced these memories out of order because that makes sense. People recollect their experiences when prompted with an old face or familiar scene. It's not going to be linear.\n\nIn Tears, Link can randomly stumble onto areas that awaken an old memory. They're not his memories this time but Zelda's, who is currently trapped in the story's B-Plot. Together they form a narrative with a beginning, middle, and end. The problem is that you will experience these scenes out of order, completely deflating whatever twists or swerves the story takes. So it's hard to give a shit when Sir Gufflechuck dies from a case of the glans, as this might be the first time you've even seen the character. Simply having the scenes play out in the intended order, regardless of where you find them, would have been an improvement.\n\nSetting the B-Plot aside, the A-Plot isn't any better, despite the actual gameplay being fantastic. Here, Link teams up with the champion of each region to take down whatever evil is threatening their home. In BOTW all the dungeons were samey, and the champions didn't get to do much. Now the dungeons are diverse and elaborate, while the champions all tag along and have an impact on gameplay. You've got a citadel underneath a volcano, waters flowing from a temple in the sky, a flying ship sailing inside a hurricane, and a pyramid full of bugmen. This is all good fun with great bosses and setpieces attached. But it's the framing that dampens these adventures. Anytime the arch-plot butts in it's all dreary lore and boring prophecy and shit. I believe you hear the same backstory about the same ancient war four times without alteration. It's boilerplate fantasy stuff lacking in ideas, passion, or emotional depth. **Majora's Mask** and **Wind Waker**, this is not.\n\nGanondorf makes an excellent final boss. The duel against him is that much more interesting than Calamity Ganon, as he's a human fighter on your level and capable of the same moves. You also can't cheese the battle by stocking up healing-items this time. But he's a flat villain, lacking in screentime and too much of a cipher to hate. Ganondorf honestly feels less imposing than his alternate self (?), Calamity Ganon. That abomination actually trashed Hyrule when it was released, laying waste to the land for a hundred years and killing the ancient champions. Ganondorf, on the other hand, just bums around his apartment for a few weeks, cigarette in mouth, waiting for somebody to visit. Hyrule gets scuffed a bit, with giant rocks falling from the sky and chasms opening up to hell, but that's par for the course in this fantasy kingdom. For as much as the gameplay soars, the story vanishes quickly from memory, like candy-floss in a raccoon's paws.\n\nKeep in mind I'm not one of those players who gives a shit how all these Zelda games line up in terms of continuity. The name of the series is \"Legend\", not \"Chronicle\", \"History\", nor \"Fan Encyclopedia written in Wank\". These games all tell and retell the same stories in different contexts and with different characters. There was only one Zelda game that actually examined the lore that ties each game together. That title was **Skyward Sword**, an experience akin to finding a bag of sick left behind in a hot car. The games aren't meant to tie together perfectly because that's not how the creative-process works.\n\nTears both succeeds and fails to account for sequence-breaking. For pretty much every side-quest you can skip ahead and find the object a quest-giver wants before they even ask for it. That's a feature I love in all good RPGs. Now, **The Witcher 3** is a character-driven game where you look for your missing daughter Ciri. **Fallout: New Vegas** is a choice-driven game where you look for Chandler Bing. You can only find Ciri in The Witcher after tens of hours and having exhausted every lead. While in New Vegas, you can find Chandler at any time, or even finish the game and never meet him at all. Tears tries both approaches for a certain plot thread to an unsatisfactory conclusion.\n\nThere's a major revelation you can find out early on, that by rights should affect every other quest. But the rest of the campaign has to play out as intended, even if means you knowing that you're on a wild goose chase. The story could have bandaged this error by giving the player a good reason as to why they'd keep this twist under their hat. Or just made the campaign more linear in parts. Either way, it would have been less baffling.\n\n***The game is far from short, but oddly proportioned.***\n\nWhen I beat the game, I was notified that there were still a hundred side quests to complete and half the map left to explore. Aww, Hell no. Like fuck am I going from defeating the Demon King to doing Beedle's laundry. Tears is enormous, but it feels oddly shaped. Like a man with hips as wide as a truck and a head the size of a pin. But enough about Clint Howard.\n\nThe sky was advertised on the box-art and the promos as a selling-point, but it's a sidequest at best. You've got two plot-mandated islands, two dungeons, and a two dozen isolated pockets that hold a shrine or some small challenge. Below the surface lies the depths. The depths are a dark mirror of the world above, full to the brim with horrifying monsters and covered in a malevolent sludge that saps the life from all it touches. It's worse than Detroit. Neither map is home to much in the way of NPCs or quests. The lion's share of the content lies on the surface map of Hyrule as before. Had I my way, the depths would have been smaller and occupied by some race like the Subrosians. Or the existing content been more evenly spread across the three maps. This segues onto my next point...\n\n***Why the grind?***\n\nThis is a single-player game that mercifully has no microtransactions or predatory DLC. You can blitz through the campaign in a few hours if you want. While the game is packed with activities and collectibles, there's no mandatory padding between quests as seen in the dreadful **Assassins' Creed: Valhalla** and **Dragon Age: Inquisition**. With that said, I'm baffled as to why the game goes out of it's way to make so much of its side-content pointless.\n\nAll inventions made with Ultrahand run on a battery that replenishes when not in use. You start with three pips and can upgrade it to a whopping forty-eight. You can earn five or six pips through questing, the rest can only be attained by constantly fighting mini-bosses and mining thousands of rocks. This is a process that takes literal hours, more so than finding Korok seeds a second time. Why couldn't the battery upgrades function like the other limited collectables (Heart Containers, Stamina Vessels, Sage Wills)? The game is long enough as it is, it didn't need a pointless spot of grinding. In my replay I upgraded my battery precisely once and then forgot about it.\n\nHigh-level armour is incredibly powerful, because the game relies on the stupidly simple damage formula that is **ENEMY ATTACK - PLAYER DEFENCE = DAMAGE TAKEN**. To mitigate how effective armour is, the system for upgrading it is completely busted. I have defeated Ganon and saved Hyrule twice, yet I'm still unable to upgrade a goddamn cloth hat. By my count there are over two hundred different items needed to upgrade the hundred-odd articles of gear on show. I want to play dress-up with my Link, but it's too much work to make his fanciest outfits battle-worthy. Like with the battery, I only upgraded a single set of basic armour twice and got by in combat with Link's generous supply of healing-items. It felt like a waste to defeat Ganondorf wearing the same Hylian set I had in the last game's climax.\n\nThe game is replete with these systems that you're not meant to engage with. There's a bog standard guard uniform in Hateno village that costs over 2000 rupees for some reason. Not the entire set, just the torso, You can earn medals for taking down all the minibosses loafing about. But why did there need to be hundreds of them scattered across the map, since they respawn after a Blood Moon anyway? The game has more than enough questing and exploring to last a hundred hours. There was no need for all these optional progression-systems that feel like work.\n\n***Observations***\n\nIt's normal for a sequel to feature new characters. It's unusual for a sequel to feature an entirely new ancient civilization that displaces the old one. Somehow all that Sheikah shit, like the shrines and the spider-death-robots, just up and vanished in six years. I'm sure they handwave an explanation somewhere, but ultimately the gameplay comes first, continuity be damned.\n\nBomb Arrows are the MVP. Common in shrines are large pressure switches that need to be hit with a large object or a great force. I'm sure I could have figured out that pinball puzzle given time, but lobbing a volatile explosive at the problem spoke to me on a deeper level.\n\nThe Triforce is never so much as mentioned and it plays no part in the narrative. For a franchise this old to keep trucking along, I think it's a good idea to retire old symbols and motifs every now and then. After all, it was the shift into the open-world genre that made Zelda relevant again. Where else could series go? First-person? Survival horror? Dating-Sim? If they keep this level of creativity up, I'm all for it.\n\nI think Ultrahand is worth spinning off into its own game. But I don't want to see it in the next console Zelda game, because it's simply too powerful. Since Link conquered Hyrule in the last game, he's allowed to be a god here able to circumvent any obstacle with ease. But the novelty will wear off come the third game. I hope the next Link has a far weaker arsenal to keep up the tension. Perhaps just a sword, a bow, a lamp, a grappling hook, and a mop for when a wizard disgraces the floor again.\n\n***Conclusion***\n\nBreath of the Wild was a sexy skeleton. Brilliant in a way, but clearly bare-bones. Many critics gave it perfect 10's at the time and I don't know they were smoking. Half the dungeons were a bust and there were only three regular enemies and five flavors of Ganon to fight. The underlying gameplay was strong, but it was very much a tech-demo in my eyes. Nice vibes, though.\n\nTears of the Kingdom is an actual game, adding meat to the same bones. You have major side-quests that tie into each other. The enemy ranks are filled out with giant pigmen, lethargic bug-dudes, walking trees, shield-eating slugs, working-class Ghidorahs, and a fucking terrifying take on the classic Wallmasters. There's unique treasure to be found in every cave and corner of Hyrule. By using the last game as the bedrock, Tears jumps off into a foreign and weird direction like all good mission-pack sequels.\n\nBut with the meat comes a lot of fat too. There is an endless amount of currencies and collectibles that you're encouraged not to bother with. On top of the last game's engine comes a whole host of new tools on top, and I feel some of the old toys could have been streamlined or cut. You can't fire an elemental arrow anymore without going into the quick-select menu before each shot. The length and world are twice the size, but they're out of sync, leading to miles of barren underworld and empty sky.\n\nThere are ten million reasons why the Zelda series will never go back to remaking **Ocarina of Time** again, at least not in the mainline 3D series. They've been bitten by the open-world bug and the prognosis is profitable. But by setting aside the endless padding and limp story, I had a fantastic time in my return to Hyrule. My enthusiasm for the adventure ran hotter than the Switch Lite that eventually burned my hands. In conclusion, Tears of the Kingdom is a perfect 8.8 out of 10.",

It's easily the most emotional catharsis I've felt from a game, with a long slog (that I managed to avoid a good amount of, somehow) where you're saved by your friends, followed by a terrifying boss fight that manages to throw in jumpscares in the UI/mechanics, then another fight that just Feels so epic, all leading to a beautiful resolution that bookends the start of the game. I was scared shitless, then cheering, then crying.",
            "Even more impressive about the game on a technical level is how they got everything to work. Basically, they're doing physics calculations for everything and just letting the engine do the rest.

I finished that near the start of summer, and made a post about it here pretty soon after talking about how I liked it. In short, I had a really good time with the game, which made me decide to just jump straight into the next entry in the franchise: Steins;Gate. This wasn\u2019t a blind playthrough, unfortunately, since I had watched the anime already, as well as played around 20 hours of the visual novel like half-a-decade ago, but I had forgotten enough about the details that there were multiple points in the game I found myself caught off-guard or surprised by plot-revelations and developments already present in the anime. I should also mention that I was playing the original visual novel instead of the Elite version, since I had heard somewhat negative thoughts on the re-release (remaster? remake? something like that), and that I was using the Committee of Zero -patch for the game, which improves some inaccuracies with the original translation and makes many of the CGs higher in quality, among other things.\n\n\n\nSo yeah, a week after starting, and around 60 hours of playtime, I finished Steins;Gate. I really wasn\u2019t expecting to read through it quite that fast (again around 20 hours slower than average, according to howlongtobeat, but still), but oh well. I had somewhat forgotten how much I liked the anime, and it was nice to be reminded of that here. I was pretty surprised by how different of an experience it was compared to the anime. It had a completely different sort of vibe to it, being way less energetic than I had remembered. Okabe especially felt a decent amount less over-the-top, which might have been helped by the fact that we were reading most of his thoughts. Kurisu also felt pretty different, though that one may just be me misremembering what she was like in the anime. The long, very elaborate conversations and lectures about science (and pretty much everything else too) changed the overall pacing pretty significantly from the anime. In some places, that was nice (like with a lot of the science and some of the debates they have in the lab), but in others, not so much.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s probably one of my bigger complaints with Steins;Gate, to be honest. It felt like there were a number of places which really dragged, especially when compared to the pacing of the anime. These points would be chapters 4, 7, and 8, I think. If you\u2019ve played Steins;Gate, you\u2019ll probably see what they have in common. Faris and Luka, in the anime, worked pretty well to further the story\u2019s themes without getting in the way of moving the story along. In the visual novel, though, chapter 4 is over 20 hours in, and chapters 7 and 8 both take a good couple of hours to beat. This isn\u2019t helped by the fact that chapter 7 is almost entirely a weird filler arc about a card game people take too seriously in-universe. Faris and Luka end up screeching the pacing of the story to a halt, in a really uninteresting way. Chapter 4 is right before the turning point of the story, and at that point sending d-mails is pretty familiar, so the slowness of everything very much starts to wear on you. Chapters 7 and 8 end up feeling like detours from the main plot, chores you need to get out of the way before things can actually progress. It was pretty interesting too, coming from Chaos;Head, since I felt like that one was paced really well. It felt like there was very little actual filler in Chaos;Head as a whole. I think it\u2019s one of those things which could have been fixed by just shortening these sections significantly, which is what they did in the anime, thankfully.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a shame that the chapters started being kind of boring, because I really enjoy the characters here. It was wild, being reminded what actually likeable characters were like, after having played through Chaos;Head. Like taking a nice breath of fresh air, it was. It\u2019s so much fun to just watch them debate something inane, like what to call their newest invention. I\u2019d almost forgotten what it was like, having fun watching characters interact. Mayuri\u2019s the goat, is all I\u2019m going to say. Though no, it\u2019s not all I\u2019m going to say, because RANT INCOMING\n\n>!Why in God\u2019s name is Mayuri in love with Okabe? It\u2019s dumb, like it is with all of the character routes. Is this like a visual novel thing? That if there are character routes, that means they must end in romance? I had the same problem with Chaos;Head Noah, but there it was less offensive because I didn\u2019t really care as much about the characters. Here it feels really jarring every single time. Especially when they had the easiest way to make it work, with the whole worldline shifting. Just have Okabe accidentally shift into a worldline where their relationship is completely different. They even somewhat did that with Faris\u2019 route, but then they *still* had her fall in love with Okabe even in the original worldline! Bro, I get it, but Okabe is not *that* hot. There\u2019s no chance every single person around Okabe somehow falls in love with him. The only acceptable ones were Kurisu, because she\u2019s the main love-interest, and Luka, because that\u2019s a very key part of his (hers? Both?) character arc. Please, let us have some platonic friendships in my media, just a crumb is all I ask for. Pleasse.!< \n\nRANT OVER\n\n\n\nI should also mention the soundtrack, because this shit rocks. You have no idea how many times I\u2019ve listened to Skyclad Observer. It\u2019s so good, as are pretty much all of the tracks in the game. Another special shout-out to Farfalla of Fate, which you should go and listen to right now. I especially love the lyrics of that one. The general sound direction of the game was really good, the voice-actors were absolutely stellar (Mamoru Miyano my goat of all time), though I did feel like Luka\u2019s voice-actor sounded weirdly out of breath in every single scene, for some reason. All in all, I think I enjoyed the anime a little more as a whole, mainly because of the better pacing, but this was still very much worth my time. I had a lot of fun. Next in the series is Robotics;Notes Elite, which I am very excited for, mainly because I know absolutely nothing about it. I went into both Chaos;Head Noah and Steins;Gate with ideas of what they were about, but Robotics;Notes is going to be a completely blind experience. I\u2019m excited to find out what it\u2019s like, even if I've heard some slightly more mixed opinions on it than about the previous two.\n\n\n\nSo yeah, onto the next one, which will probably take me longer than a week to complete. Probably.\n\n\n\nThanks for reading!",

            "Elite is awful, it's just worse version. Literally just took screenshots from anime and made VN out of it. I like original VN's artstyle much more.\n\nI played Steins Gate My darling's embrace relatively recently, which is just slice of life vn where every girl gets romance route. It's not great, but Mayuri's root is only route there that I actually liked, everything else felt half-assed.",
            "S;G is one of the few cases where I regret having watched the adaptation, at least when I did. Even more than 10 years later all the major plot points are so memorable that I still more or less went into the VN completely spoiled. Wish I could have gone in blind",
            "I have been on the fence about this one for quite a while. I was one who didn't really like the anime and I was similarly not fond of Chaos;Head so we will see if I ever give this one a try or end up skipping it.",
            "Yeah, I didn't really think about that very much when playing actually. It might be because I came into it straight from Chaos;Head, so the general otakudum and  so on felt pretty natural here too. It's really fun, seeing the way both Steins;Gate and Chaos;Head really encapsulate that specific feeling of early 2010-era internet lingo and culture. It's part of the charm for them, I think, and really helps ground them in the real world.\n\nAlso, yeah, I do think listening to all the voice lines added a significant amount to playtime. I get the feeling it would have gone a lot faster if I didn't bother listening to all the voice lines in their entirety. I also checked the backlog to reread what had just happened every two lines or something, which might have contributed.",
            "I did play Chaos;Head, but it was a long time ago, before the new version came out with the extra routes (which I have not played). I never had a sweet anime adaptation to rejog my memory like with Steins;Gate either. Robotics;Notes from what I remember doesn\u2019t indulge in that otakusphere culture nearly as much as its predecessors for better or worse. Its characters are more reserved and less nerdy (with one exception), but very relatable.",
            "I think there\u2019s something to be said about Steins;Gate as a visual novel specifically, because the way most players will have to sift around through all their saves in order to set the flags that will get them the true ending *absolutely* mirrors Okabe\u2019s experience of time leaping. This aspect of how S;G uses the form of its original medium isn\u2019t talked about much from what I\u2019ve seen, but it was what made it such an immersive experience for me. The anime is quite good but necessarily lacks this feeling due to the shift in medium.\n\nThe dialogue in the game is underrated. I used to think that S;G would one day be dated, but rather than aging poorly I feel that it has almost become a period piece? It\u2019s a very 2010 game and slaps you in the face with that fact constantly. I\u2019m reminded of how the original *Dracula* now feels like a story of an antiquated group of people fighting an antiquated classical villain, but when it came out it was about an extremely modern and contemporary group fighting an ancient evil using modern technology (cameras and what-not). S;G\u2019s constant references to 2000s otakudom, message-boards like 2ch, and use of flip phones *essentially* date it but also work so well with the subject matter (and all those real life conspiracy theories the game toys with) that I can\u2019t imagine it any other way. The reader-side experience of S;G will surely continue to evolve in the future as the gap between the audience and the original release date widens. A modern story becomes a time capsule.\n\nFrom a literary perspective, I think Robotics;Notes and Chaos;Child perhaps beat out S;G, in terms of complexity of themes and character depth (especially in relation to aforementioned themes). However, S;G isn\u2019t particularly shallow, and it\u2019s holistically more satisfying than either of those two games. It\u2019s also just really really hype. Best visual novel ever (although I\u2019ve not played many).\n\nI *am* surprised you took 60 hours. I got all the endings and only took 30, but I confess to skipping voice lines (I cannot understand Japanese anyhow).",
            "I watched the anime when it originally came out but I only finished the VN a couple years ago. I was also surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I went back to watching some of the scenes from the anime and I just couldn't get used to pacing. It felt like they were flying through the story. I'm not someone who likes reading, especially if the story is slow, but I think that's what makes it so satisfying when shit hits the fan. I really loved that about Steins;Gate and Robotics;Notes. I still prefer some of the more dynamic scenes in anime though, like the famous [episode 9 Akihabara](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_RgOfaPPD4). That's a classic.\n\nFor Robotics;Notes I might prefer the anime, but honestly I can't remember much. The VN pacing was just way too slow, and some action scenes were so much more impactful in the anime, I highly recommend giving them a watch. There was one particularly brutal scene that was really well done in the anime, you'll know what I'm talking about when you get there."

Which gamepads stuck with you through all your digital conquests that you can call \"old reliable\" even with labels wearing off and deadzones losing their range?  What are the pros and cons of using that gamepad and do you occasionally need to switch it out cause of certain game limitations?\n\nMy top dog is the Wii Classic Controller.  Evidently, I can't stop talking about this damn controller that was a side project for Nintendo during the Wii Era.  The Dpad and buttons are just...perfect.  So, for platformers and retro gameplay, it fits the bill perfectly.  The issues, however, are pretty obvious.  The biggest one is NO L3 or R3 analog push.  It doesn't mean I can't play many games; in fact I can play the majority of them.  However, certain retro-inspired games make use of them forcing me to switch out.  I also don't use it for heavy analog stick use.\n\nXbox360 gamepad comes next.  It has the worst dpad ever and nowadays gets beaten out by modern competition.  However, I rely on it cause of its..reliability with xbox input which the majority of games support.  I don't need any additional gamepad software because I know Windows will make it work.  The triggers are still comfortable, analog deadzones are toast but functional, and the buttons are perfectly boring.\n\nNewer controllers in your arsenal are fine too if they've gotten you through enough games to prove its worth!  \n",

I prefer snappier dpads over mushy, 8 directions, concave to rest your thumb and the incline on each direction..  only problem is the bumpers are going out slowly.  never gotten stick drift, nor have the rubber on the stick worn down significantly and i've used it for a few years now.\n\nbefore that i used the 8bitdo sn30 pro, its  nice for the snes form factor but wasn't as durable. i prefer offset sticks overall but inline sticks can be useful for certain games.",
