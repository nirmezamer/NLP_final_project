If there is one thing wrong with it, like its a little too short or the sleeves are kind of weird, I won't buy it because I know I will find an excuse not to wear it.

And I like that they\u2019re name brand clothes that I\u2019m already used to. Some that come to mind are Calvin Klein, Dolce and Gabanna (sometimes), etc. \n\nAll my coworkers compliment my work outfits, and when they ask me where I got my outfits from, I tell them Costco. \n\nCostco also currently has really nice linen pants, shirts and shorts, as well as packs of moisture wicking shirts (for those shirts, the brand is 32 Degrees). And they\u2019re SERIOUSLY saving me this summer by keeping me dry and surprisingly comfortable in this terrible heat. I especially like the linen pants because they keep me from being bit by mosquitoes. \n\nThrifting in my area is hit or miss, both in quality/brand and in price. But I also live in NY so that\u2019s just what it is, depending on your area. I\u2019d rather pay $10-$16 for a new shirt than wasting my time looking through racks full of Shein knockoffs and coming up empty handed. \n\nAlso if you buy clothes at Costco and then the price goes down (I think within the month that you purchased it) you can get refunded the price difference either in store credit or cash at the customer service desk.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to pay for a Costco membership, I\u2019ve heard you can just use their gift card to enter and purchase items with.",
