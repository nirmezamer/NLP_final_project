Some of them are open. I went to the furthest one and dived in to another side. \n\nMan, the weird feeling of seeing this huge structure under water. It goes down so deep you can see it's foundation. I've dived as deep as I could and used up about 75% of my air. I was taking damage and almost died by the time I got back to surface. \n\nNever expected Cyberpunk of all games to trigger that feeling. Especially when exploring some area that wasn't meant to be a zone of interest.",
