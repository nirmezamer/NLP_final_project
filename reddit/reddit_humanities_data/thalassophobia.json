This one time, I was on a cruise to Mozambique, and my partner wanted to go out for a smoke..it was daytime, as he was smoking I look at him, and I say to him, I just saw a shark, a big one, eating violently on something..he turns to me, and says, every time you get close to water you imagine seeing crocs, or sharks..the guy next to us says he saw it too\u2026so now you can understand why I\u2019m shaking for this guy.",

            "Wow thanks for the anecdote! I feel u, and am currently binging his vids on tik tok\u2026 do u think it\u2019s bravery or mental issues that pushed him to do this absolutely incredible yet insane feat?"
