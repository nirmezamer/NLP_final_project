I recently completed it on Steam and I started a new game to get the Speedster achievement, but I accidentally overrode the original file.\n\nI checked Steam Cloud and there was no save file to download. I'm pretty sad about it, but I guess it's not the biggest deal in the world. I'll play KH1 eventually again.",

Is there something I have to enter for launch options?\n\nEdit: I seem to have installed it correctly. I can press F2 to open up the luabackend console in game and it says the mods are installed, but they don't work at all.",

The room where the waves of heartless spawn is not doable for me and i keep getting wiped. My last savepoint was before Chernabog and i have to do it all over now (that save point has no gummiship access. Is there any way to leave and lvl up or is my save bricked? Because i also have no way to Grind there since all spawns are in that room that gets me wiped.\n\nI also start right back in the room at the start of the fight whenever i wipe. Seeing walkthroughs i See them heavily outleveling me and they deal so much more damage than i do. Those demon-heartless take 4 to 5 full aircombos and they 3 hit me. Just getting oberwhelmed and i am scared I wont ever be able to beat it \n\nParty LvL is 51",

Ringing the bell in the traverse town hotel. Putting out and igniting the fire in neverland. These things, that the devs didn't need to add but did. It's so charming. For the numbered titles, 2 in honesty my least favorite. I go back and forth between liking 1 or 3 more, I think at the moment I'm 1>3>2. Ask me next month, I might be 3>1>2, I dunno.",
