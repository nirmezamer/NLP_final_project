            "Hello! I'm planning to get KH3 from Steam, and... according to internet, there are mods which helps fix the game or something? If so, is there anything you guys reccomend? Or are the rumors false and KH3 is fine as it is?\n\nThank you very much!",
            "Was Sora's movement always this stiff? I'm replaying KHFM on Steam and it seems like he has this blocky turning around movement, like he only has 8 possible directions and I'm using a D-Pad to move him\u2014but I'm using an analog stick.",
            "Has anyone else noticed that KH:FM crashes a lot on steam? I've had the game for 3 days and it crashes probably once a day if not more. Super annoying when I'm trying to complete stuff and have to backtrack a save :(",
            "Does anyone know if the kingdom hearts for ps4(every game possible) digital save is compatile with the disk save?  \nI heard that sometimes they're different so if you play it digitally with the PS+ and then you want to use that save to play your physical disc it doesn't match.  \nCan I do that with kingdom hearts games?",
            "I heard a few people say that when pre-ordering KH on Steam, you get a special keyboard. Looking at the game page, it says you just need to purchase it? Can somebody clarify where I'd go to pre order it?",
            "When Kingdom Hearts releases on Steam, will the current mods available on the Epic Game Store version of the games be transfered over to the Steam version? Like the 2D illustrated HUD for the characters in KH3?",
            "Is there a need for the critical plus ability if you have the ultima weapon in KH1? Doesn\u2019t it always land critical strikes?",
            "Anyone know when/if we\u2019ll start seeing reviews for the steam collections? I\u2019m curious about steam deck performance. I\u2019m guessing it will basically match the EGS performance, but \u00af\\(\u30c4)/\u00af"

I recently completed it on Steam and I started a new game to get the Speedster achievement, but I accidentally overrode the original file.\n\nI checked Steam Cloud and there was no save file to download. I'm pretty sad about it, but I guess it's not the biggest deal in the world. I'll play KH1 eventually again.",
            "With luabackend now updated for Steam, how does one get it working? I have all the files in their proper folders and edited the toml file, but it doesn't seem to play my mods. Is there something I have to enter for launch options?\n\nEdit: I seem to have installed it correctly. I can press F2 to open up the luabackend console in game and it says the mods are installed, but they don't work at all.",

Not saving anything from the last save forcing me to redo the whole Hades Cup up to that point only for the game to crash again. Just seeing if anyone else had this happen or if it's known.",

            "is it possible for me to play all the KH games in steam in japanese but english subs?",
            "For those who have played the PC version and are familiar with emulation, which would be the better experience? I have PCSX2 set up, and given the Steam release I'm considering whether to buy the discs and emulate the classics or buy the PC version.",
            "Are there any multiplayer mods where I can play through the story with someone else online?",
            "Playing KH 2, should I bother with Ultima Weapon? Compared to KH 1.5, it seems way easier to get (with the exception of getting every synthesis material for that one Orichalcum +,) but I also am hearing rumors that Decisive Pumpkin is better. Can someone throw their 2 cents in on this topic?"

Not counting scala because the basegame Version sucked.",
