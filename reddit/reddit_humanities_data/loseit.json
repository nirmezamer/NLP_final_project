        "content": "My girlfriend has been dieting for a few months, but she isn\u2019t really losing weight. She comes to me for advice because I\u2019ve lost over a hundred pounds previously, but I don\u2019t know much about women\u2019s health considering I am a man. I calculated my girlfriends BMR (25 Y/O, 5\u2019 7\u201d, 167Lbs) and it says ~1800 calories for little to no exercise. She swears up and down that she\u2019s counting calories and \u201cdefinitely eating less than 1800 calories\u201d. She\u2019s eating around 1500 calories a day according to her, she\u2019s not going to the gym currently, but she does walk around a lot. She gets a small fast food meal (1 order of McDonald\u2019s medium fries for example) from time to time (maybe once a week or less). I understand that her going to the gym would speed up the process and obviously help, but even when she used to go (she just stopped like a month ago because she started to get super busy with work), she was still only gaining weight. Assuming everything she said is true, shouldn\u2019t she be losing weight? She\u2019s currently blaming it on her barely eating before starting to diet properly (she would eat about 1200 calories a day), and says her metabolism is messed up and affecting her weight loss, which I am not sure if that is possible? Any advice/help would be appreciated. Thanks!\n\nEdit: There is also a chance that she is unknowingly not counting properly, so if the science isn't \"sciencing\" please let us know straight up!",

            "That BMR is waaay too high, it should be around 1535. She needs to use a food scale,no guessing, and perhaps she keeps forgetting about the calories she drinks, or the cooking oil, etc. I'd mealprep for a few days with her, just so she can get an accurate picture of what 1500 kcal really looks like.",
            "Her BMR might be lower than you\u2019ve calculated. I recently got metabolic testing free through work and was stunned that my BMR is 1300kcal, right at the bottom of what\u2019s normal for a woman of my height and weight (5\u20199 and 82kg). I\u2019ve adjusted my CICO calcs accordingly and it\u2019s beginning to come down but it\u2019s slooooow work. Patience is key, this is the long game!",
            "She could be tracking wrong, a lot of people think they\u2019re eating an exact amount of calories but they\u2019re not properly logging little things like butter or oil. Otherwise if she is tracking accurately/ weighing her food etc. she should look into bloodwork! It could be thyroid, or a condition like PCOS if she has other symptoms. I will also say it doesn\u2019t sound like she is overweight and generally speaking weight comes off a little easier when you have a lot more to lose.",
            "Hormonal issues can play a much bigger role for women than men and we typically lose at a much slower rate. it would honestly be better for her to do resistance training and focus on body recomposition at this point then the lbs on the scale.",
            "Everything everyone is saying here is true. And quite frankly, it could very well be bad counting. Especially when the deficit is slim. The only thing I would add, if it were me, and I was close to normal, I would go to 1200. This isn't some drawn out mission impossile journey some of us have had to endure. This is close to just a cut, and you can do 1200 for 12 weeks, then maintenance, and see where you are.",
            "I have been working out 4-5 days a week 30-60 min each day. I try to count my calories as well. I drink and sometimes eat not so great on the weekends but during the week try to stay under 1800. I have only lost 6 lbs in 2.5 months. It\u2019s a grind. If she\u2019s truly staying under cals and not lost anything she should have some bloodwork done. I know it has been harder for me as I have gotten older. If she is drinking a few days a week that is a lot of extra cals that I didn\u2019t want to admit to at first.",
