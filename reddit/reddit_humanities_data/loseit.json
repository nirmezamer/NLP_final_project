            "Hi! I (F, 140 lbs) have been trying to lose weight for the last few months but only started taking it more seriously this past month. My goal weight is 130 lbs, but I haven't made any progress towards it and feel very frustrated and stuck. I track my calories and try and remain in a deficit of 1500 calories and I also try and walk at least 30-60 minutes per day. I also don't eat necessarily unhealthily, like my diet is pretty well-balanced, I just crave sweets a lot more than I used to and I try to fit them into my deficit. Is there something I'm doing wrong? Or is there something I can do to make more progress?",
            "Can someone help me with converting weight? So I've gone from 126 lb to 125lb. According to Google, 126 is 9 stone, and 125 lb is 8 stone 9 lb. But there's 14 lb in a stone. I feel like Im being really dumb but surely 125 should be 8 stone 13? I'm really bad at maths so sorry if the answer is obvious",
            "Um is it normal to get sick when u go on a diet? Cuz I\u2019ve been eating pretty much different types of salads. And got sick after that like flu like symptoms and shit. Compared to like my old diet which was pretty much just carbs and sugar\ud83e\uddcd\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

            "Calories in versus out\n\nHey, a general question from a person trying to be in a caloric deficite. If I consume 1800 kcal and my total burnt (Apple Watch tracker) that day is 2100 kcal I will lose weight. If the next day I workout and my total burnt goes up to 2500 kcal, can I eat 2200 kcal and still lose the same amount of weight? Should I long term just eat 1800 kcal regardless of the extra calories burnt that day??? Thanks, I\u2019m just so confused",
            "Calorie burnt trackers are notoriously inaccurate, up to 50%. If you plan on being in a low-ish deficit like 300kcal, I would not eat back any of the extra kcal except for exceptionally high kcal burning days, like a long hike for exemple. I'd just treat it as a help for a little faster weight loss otherwise.",
            "Responding to my own comment: I asked ChatGPT and it told me I should in fact eat more to stay in the same 300 kcal deficite. (Do we agree with ChatGPT?)",
            "Last night I was in a ~600-700lkcal deficite because of working out and strictly eating the limit and I went to bed hungry and had trouble falling asleep.. is that just something to deal with?",
            "No",
            "It depends on how long you've been tracking kcal intake and been at a deficit. If it's still new to you it could only have been that you're not used to eating less yet. It could also have been that you've been eating the right amount but using the wrong foods. 1700 kcal of potato will be way more filling than 1700 kcal of pizza for exemple. It's hard to judge with only one occurence. If you were really hungry, i'd advise you to get something filling but low kcal, like an apple, some cucumber or broccoli. It really helps with feeling full."

I\u2019ve been wanting to lose weight for years but it took me until 2 months ago to buy a scale, download a calorie tracker and to actually buckle down and do it. \n\nFor me, I think it was my first year of medical school. We\u2019re always told that obesity is bad for your health by our doctors and public health campaigns, but for me, it took a whole year of being exposed to complications of obesity to actually make the choice to lose for myself. It\u2019s not what I wanted for my life. \n\nBeing exposed to so much information about obesity also made me notice the effects on myself even more. I was getting winded faster, I could barely walk 20 minutes without getting out of breath and stopping. I was always tired and my mood fluctuated wildly. I think after that, I stopped lying to myself and actually started losing properly. ",

The weight is NOT the reason for the knee pain - I have hyperextentia (extra stretchy) which can cause a lot of problems. For me I have acute scoliosis, flat-feet, and a bunch of other issues, including tendonitis in my knees. But, even if the weight isn't causing the pain, it certainly isn't helping! I am confident I can get my knee pain to a manageable level if I get down to a healthy weight.",

            "My reason was my mom. She is also overweight and diabetic. She had a knee replacement surgery a few years ago and had a LOT of complications due to her weight and health issues, eventually causing her bone to get infected. They took out the knee replacement, put in a spacer until the infection cleared, then attempted it again. The same thing happened. So they took it out again and told her that they would not repeat the surgery a second time. They gave her the option to keep the spacer in her knee and essentially no longer have a knee and need a walker or wheelchair to get around, or to amputate the leg.\n\nMeanwhile, I\u2019m over here with two perfectly good legs that work just fine, and I was wasting it. I didn\u2019t want to go through what my mon went through, so I decided it was time to get my life together. I\u2019m down 100 pounds since then.",

I couldn\u2019t keep up with my dog anymore, hiking was painful. I like reading medical books so I have some head knowledge on obesity and what it does. I gained 40 lbs last year, possibly more, January came and I decided I had enough pain and mood swings and started losing.",

This was only 10kg more than I am now but at 5\u20191 tall it made a massive difference. I\u2019m now 5kg away from my goal weigh",
            "I'm a paramedic who sees the end result of medical issues related to being overweight. And not just the direct health issues, but also the practical issues of being unable to get you out of the house when you're having an emergency because you don't fit on the ambulance equipment. Combined with watching my family have health issues that I'm now at greater risk for, I decided I wanted to try and do everything I can to minimize those risks moving forward.",
            "Originally it was because I wanted to be look like the characters I loved (I was 17, this was in the 90s). Now, it's because I want to live long enough to see all my kids into adulthood and watch them become the people they're going to be. Less chance of dying early if I return to my pre-pregnancy weight. I was also just super uncomfortable obese. I couldn't wait to shrug the weight off and get running again. All my joint issues have basically gone even though I'm not back to my original weight yet.",
            "Well I\u2019ve done it a few times now, usually due to shame and vanity.
