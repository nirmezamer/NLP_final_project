Originally I thought she was 20 but through circumstances I won\u2019t get into I found out she was 19. Also found out that her ex was living with her for a while when we first got together but she swears they weren\u2019t doing anything. He\u2019s just recently moved out about a month ago. We\u2019ve been having sex for a while but recently my balls have gotten super itchy and I know it\u2019s hot where I live but this is unbearable because I can\u2019t stop pawing at myself I feel like a dog. She asked me if I gave her chlamydia and I told her no which is true because when I went to get tested both times after she asked me the results were negative while hers was positive. She told me that her results were probably false but I told her those tests are 99% accurate. She\u2019s says she hasn\u2019t had sex with anyone else but it\u2019s an std so I\u2019m confused. I want to believe her but I just feel like I\u2019m being naive. Any thoughts on what to do?",
