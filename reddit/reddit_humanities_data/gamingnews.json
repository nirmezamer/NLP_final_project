            "I mean that makes sense. This is going to be the world\u2019s first AAAAA game, so they\u2019ll need to ensure that as few people as possible work on it.",
            "I'll take \"Illogical reasons to fire employees\" for $500",
            "Company worth 2.5billion can't possibly afford the wages of 33 staff members if they want to deliver ambitious project...which unambitiously is a remake of a fairly simple (but much loved) game, which is significantly easier to make than a new game from scratch.\n\nUnisoft are a bit of a joke. At least it will turn out better than Skull And Bones.",
            "Ubisoft has lost 80% of their total stock value since 2018. They're struggling.",
            "I'd love to struggle and still be worth 2.5billion",
            "I'm more poking fun at how ridiculous their PR statement is. \"We MUST fire 33 people because of how ambitious this game is\"",
            "2.5B is not a lot of money when they have 45+ studios and 21k employees.",
            "Hahah, bastards right.\n\nI've gotten better at not falling for them but sometimes to verify you actually have to click in.",
            "I posted this on another thread.\n\nI know a guy that was impacted. The whole situation is a mess. They were fired without notice but are at least being given severance. \n\nMake no mistake, this is entirely due to management being unable to deliver a demo to corporate that the suits like. It's absolute bs that management can't get their shit straight and the developers are the ones who are suffering.",
            "That's just not how business or anything works.\nYou don't have 33 staff members that you deem are not required and just keep them in the job because you're worth \"2.5 billion\" or whatever number it is.\n\nProjects get put into scope, projects get cancelled, you reshuffle and put the company in the best position you can, that's what always going to happen.\n\nThe most people who care can hope for is the company has a good redundancy package. That's something we can influence with law makers."

I got my ass clapped for the first 2-3 hours of the game because it has been like 2 years since i played the normal game, but once i got back into the groove i found it to be about as hard as late game elden ring, which makes sense. there are some bullshit bosses, but those were there in the normal game as well.",
