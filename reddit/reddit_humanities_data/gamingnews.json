I got my ass clapped for the first 2-3 hours of the game because it has been like 2 years since i played the normal game, but once i got back into the groove i found it to be about as hard as late game elden ring, which makes sense. there are some bullshit bosses, but those were there in the normal game as well.",

            "Interesting, I was wondering if this is due to it being regions where xCloud doesnt operate but Geforce Now does but xCloud is in Japan. I was wondering if it only applies to games that support play anywhere because it would be running the pc version but in this case Street Fighter 6 is one of these and that isnt a play anywhere title. Street Fighter 6 is also not even on gamepass which makes this more interesting.\u00a0",

            "I don\u2019t know how you\u2019d even make this. Most of the souls games don\u2019t really have a traditional linear narrative, the \u201cstory\u201d you experience in game is killing all the characters after most of the story has played out. The setting is engaging because you\u2019re discovering the history of the land in real time and piecing the story together yourself.",

            "Best leave it then",
            "Some games\u2019 appeal rely so heavily on the fact that they are *games* that a movie seems pointless imo. The cryptic story that you put together yourself by exploring/reading item descriptions, the interactions with other players, and the emotional highs of struggling and then overcoming a challenge through your own perseverance, is so important to the *feeling* of the Soulsborne games. I don\u2019t really see how a movie of Elden Ring would meaningfully build upon the experience we already have. \n\nI\u2019m not inherently against video game adaptations, but I think adaptations risk losing what makes a good game so impactful, because games are interactive and movies aren\u2019t. TLOU worked because that was effectively a movie already (not saying that as a diss, but it *is* incredibly linear and cutscene-heavy so adapting it didn\u2019t change that much of the experience). But Soulsborne games are player-driven *gaming* experiences at their core. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d enjoy a movie as much unless they got some really notable/artsy talent involved (e.g. Guillermo del Toro). And if Miyazaki *isn\u2019t* heavily involved\u2026 yeah, I definitely don\u2019t want it.",
