            "I just found out I got into UCLA for MIMG!!! So excited!!  \nI was wondering if anyone has any advice or anything to say about MIMG - I really like all 3 topics, especially immunology and molecular genetics, and I intend to either go for a MD or PhD in the future (will figure that out over my first two ish years!)   \n\n\nI also have really severe dietary restrictions and that is definitely going to be something that defines where I decide to go. How is UCLA with accommodating for people with dietary restrictions??  \n\n\nThanks in advance :))",
            "hello! i recently got accepted into both ucla and uci as an art major and i'm having trouble deciding which school to attend. here are some pros and cons:\n\nUCLA \npros:\n\u2022 one of the best art programs in the country\n\u2022 easier to make connections and friends\n\u2022 reputable film department (minoring in film would be a definite choice for me at ucla)\n\u2022 i feel like i would have a better job of finding a job after graduating because of connections and being located in the LA area\n\u2022 more fun area? i heard there's a lot of events and freebies \n\ncons:\n\u2022 far from home, i would have to dorm and i'm not sure how expensive or complicated housing is\n\u2022 number one in dining but i saw a video of people waiting an hour for food :(\n\u2022 people with superiority complexes scare me\n\u2022 i heard it's kind of unsafe\n\nUCI \npros:\n\u2022 close to home, i would commute\n\u2022 i would be going with my two current closest friends. i understand i can make new friends at ucla, but i feel like it will be more fun in the long run to stick with these two.\n\u2022 save A LOT of money\n\u2022 i got a chancellor's scholarship for $6k for two years (ultimately $12k total) \n\ncons:\n\u2022 i heard it's socially dead so it might be harder to make connections and find a job after graduation\n\u2022 while uci has a good art program, it's not as good as ucla's\n\nadditional info: i'm the only child in my family and i tend to be super introverted around people i don't know, therefore i feel like i would struggle a lot to with getting adjusted to dorming with others. i might feel lonely for awhile at ucla because it takes awhile for me to get close to people. i also feel like i would be giving up a huge opportunity if i don't attend ucla since acceptance rates are dropping every year. i was planning on maybe getting my bachelors at UCl and then my MFA at UCLA but acceptance rates will still be super slim.\n\ni'm also planning to double major with something else (i'm not sure yet) and my current path might change along the way. so even if i do choose to go to uci i might decide to not go to UCLA for my MFA, but maybe for another type of graduates program.\n\nboth of these schools were my dream schools, but UCLA was more of my DREAM school because of the atmosphere. i haven't visited either campuses yet, so any comments are welcome!\n\nthank you, all help is appreciated!",

            "Hello! I recently got admitted into the UCLA DMA program and was wondering what are people's thoughts on the program.\n\nThe DMA website describes the program ad not focusing on professional development, but rather experimentation across a range of different media. I have mainly done traditional art and digital illustration, and do not see myself making the kind of work shown in DMA exhibitions. As someone who wants to solely focus on either animation or illustration and possibly graphic design, does this program seem like a good fit for me?  I am personally gravitating more towards career-orientated programs like SJSU Illustration/Animation, but at the same time would much rather go to UCLA for the campus and location (I've lived in the bay for my whole life).",

            "Hello!\n\nWe are currently recruiting young adults aged 18-30 to take part in our no-cost sleep coaching study. The purpose of this study is to test whether specialized sleep coaching sessions that focus on the science of habit formation can help people who have difficulty getting to sleep at night, difficulty waking up or getting out of bed in the morning, and feel sleepy during the day. We are hoping that this research study will result in a sleep treatment that will help many people who have these types of sleep problems.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThis study is really exciting because we\u2019re offering free sleep coaching with therapists who have specialized training in sleep therapy at UC Berkeley. This is a unique opportunity to get access to no-cost sleep coaching for those struggling with their sleep. Eligible individuals will receive compensation for completing each part of the study (four 60-90 minute Zoom interviews, 7 days of wearing a sleep watch, and 7 days of completing online surveys). Additional information provided upon phone screening. The study is entirely remote.\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in learning more, please contact us by email at [sleepteamucb@gmail.com](mailto:sleepteamucb@gmail.com), or via phone at (510) 473-6490\u202c.

I\u2019m still working in academia toward my PhD and it\u2019s been an ongoing conversation how academics need to find alternative storage solutions now that Google Drive can no longer sustain research operations. \n\nApparently the new plan is pooled storage of 100 TB - I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any adjustment based on institutional size / an option to buy more than that since UCLA is so large. But 100 TB is nothing. I rotated in a lab that could go through 10 TB in a couple months. \n\nIt\u2019s just not sustainable unfortunately to keep alumni on especially for some marginal amount of additional space, given Google\u2019s shift to a different pricing model.
