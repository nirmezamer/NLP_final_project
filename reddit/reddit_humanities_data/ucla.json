            "Hello! I recently got admitted into the UCLA DMA program and was wondering what are people's thoughts on the program.\n\nThe DMA website describes the program ad not focusing on professional development, but rather experimentation across a range of different media. I have mainly done traditional art and digital illustration, and do not see myself making the kind of work shown in DMA exhibitions. As someone who wants to solely focus on either animation or illustration and possibly graphic design, does this program seem like a good fit for me?  I am personally gravitating more towards career-orientated programs like SJSU Illustration/Animation, but at the same time would much rather go to UCLA for the campus and location (I've lived in the bay for my whole life).",

I just want to know your guys' opinions on which school is more suitable for a person like me who is seeking to be an aerospace major.

Would you have a better chance interning at NASA if you were to go to Princeton or UCLA? Overall, which school would you guys recommend is more fitting?",

            "Hello! I am currently waitlisted for Engineering, but UCLA is absolutely, hands down my #1 choice. I was torn between majoring in Econ and Engineering - would it be possible at this point to switch to Econ and would that potentially increase my chances of getting off the wait list?
