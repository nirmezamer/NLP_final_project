        "content": "Hi. \n\nImportant bit of information; I am autistic. I have my own apartment and pay my own bills but it really affects how I see and feel the world around me. \n\nPosting from my alt as I\u2019m worried this person may find this post if I post from my channel account. I recently became affiliate and had a viewer come in my stream and subscribe, we got to chatting a bit and they joined my discord. Everything was kosher, they seemed fine, a little off but mostly just sad (like really really REALLY sad, hotline sad) so nothing that was really throwing off red flags, people have tough times. Next stream he gifts a bunch of subs, cool. The next stream he tips me $100, even better, life is expensive right now. \n\nThe next morning I woke up to really sexually explicit messages and pictures. I told him I was not interested and to please not do that again. I didn\u2019t want to be rude, but I believe I was firm enough that he understood.\n\nA few days later I was at my friend\u2019s house for the weekend and not able to respond to messages as quickly as I would at home. I got a message from a weird account on discord, I\u2019m not sure what it was but I had the feeling that it was him so I called him out on it (made up some bullsh*t story about tracking his IP) and he admitted that it was him, and also admitted to having over 100 fake twitch accounts so \u201cif I ever blocked him he\u2019d still find a way to contact me\u201d. \n\nMy thought process since has been: I\u2019d rather keep him unblocked because at least I know this account is his (my anxiety has since gone through the roof wondering if every person who comes into chat or joins my discord is him, to the point I\u2019ve missed my last two streams and am on the verge of missing a third as it\u2019s almost 6 AM and I haven\u2019t slept because of this). The straw that broke the camels back for me were the messages I woke up to this morning where he wanted to unalive himself and then an hour later started the sexually explicit messages and pictures that he had previously stopped like I had asked. I have not responded and the messages have only gotten more intense because of it. He also says he has a private discord server where he collects small streamer\u2019s nudes. So I guess my question is, can twitch IP b*n him or should I just end this dream of mine now before it ever really got a chance to start? I\u2019m heartbroken and disgusted all at the same time. \n\nTLDR; first financial supporter is a weirdo with a bunch of fake twitch accounts to harass me with. Can twitch get rid of them permanently if I send all evidence? ",

            "Great response. Keep banning, ignoring, and don't react to any of it.",
            "Being in the public eye on the Internet is always gonna bring out the loons. I haven't been a streamer for long but I HAVE been a prominent community manager in a field outside gaming and dealt with absolute lunatics for over a decade.\n\nIt's awful and disappointing and we shouldn't have to deal with it, but the sad reality is we do, so it's best to work on changing your mindset.\n\nDon't let this put you off. This dude is a mole in an otherwise perfectly find yard, so get to playing whack-a-mole. Ban him. When he pops up again, ban him again. Don't entertain it, don't think about it, just do it. Give him NOTHING. I've been a moderator for a friend that had one of these dudes, we had to ban him I'd say well over 50 times before he finally gave up. \n\nKeep going. Keep banning, keep reporting, and switch your anger and fear to just pity, because that's all he deserves.. pity. What a sad little man.\n\nIf he harms himself it was never your problem to begin with, you are NOT the reason. You're the fixation and that's a him problem. You've made your position clear.\n\nThat said, ban.. dismiss.. but remain vigilant. If he EVER escalates to personal contact (by that I mean doxxing, revealing he knows important personal info) don't hesitate to take that to the police and of course, report to twitch. Report as many times as you need to.\n\nBut fingers crossed once he stops getting any sort of reaction beyond instant ban from you, he'll go away. \n\nIt's not your fault. It's not your responsibility. Enjoy your streams.",
            "honestly, as a woman this is why I just dont entertain anyone who gives me weird vibes. I dont care if people think Im overly rude or cold when I tell someone to fuck off or ban them from my stream, because any one of them could end up being as sick as this person bothering you.\n\nIdeally, you shouldnt have to change how you interact with people cause people should be *normal* and not creeps, but if you dont want to deal with this stuff in the future, dont be scared to just immediately ban/block on first instinct. Especially if they come in extremely sad like you said, honestly thats just bad vibes all over, it immediately makes me think theyre here only to garner sympathy and attention.\n\nAs for this guy, I would report all of the information that hes given you to discord and twitch. Give them ALL the information, all screenshots you have with all of the threats, especially the info about his secret discord servers with (probably) stolen nudes. I would not hold back on this guy.\n\nAnd lastly, you are never responsible for someone elses reactions and actions, they will try to guilt you into thinking so, but they are the only ones responsible for their pathetic behaviour, not you.",
            "Ohgosh this is awful, I'm sorry you have to go through all this. As someone who has been streaming for more than two years now, cases like this are sadly fairly common. There are simply people out there who have nothing better to do but harass others. \n\nThis is easier said than done but the best you can do now is take further preventive measures if you haven't already. A good step forward would be turning on the \"Require Followers to be e-mail or phone verified\" feature. iirc you can only make a few twitch accounts under the same phone or email. This will render them from further harassing you by making multiple accounts. \n\nTry and turn off your donations for now as well, by the looks of it he won't hesitate to make chargebacks and I've seen streamers who got their PayPals get nuked over this. \n\nAnother one, you actually already put forward is sending a report directly to Twitch. Though from what I've heard they do take a while to respond and considering the gravity of the situation, they might actually take a bit more time to thoroughly investigate the issue. \n\nIf you have friends that might be free whenever you stream you can give them the Moderator role, they can take charge over your chat while you stream so you don't have to worry about him harassing you. They can do simple tasks as delete unwanted messages or outright ban accounts that might be tied to him.\n\nAnd lastly, ignore his messages, regardless of what they might be. All he wants is to get your attention and get a rouse out of you. Whatever he says may it be unaliving himself or anything else along those lines, he actually wont push through with it. These are their tactics to manipulate you into sending a response. Block his discord account and lock down your account. Turn off message and friend requests, and if you have a server make sure it's private, no link invites, and no one else can make inv links aside from you.\n\nThe best we can hope for is Twitch takes action soon or he moves on. Hopefully it'll be the former. For now try and compile every exchange you to have had and send it to Twitch. \n\nMore power to you OP. Don't give up!"
