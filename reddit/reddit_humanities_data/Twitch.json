        "content": "I'm new to streaming. Usually only have 1-2 viewers. Almost every chatter that comes to my stream is asking what ideas I have for my channel/offering their ideas to \"help\" my channel grow. They respond to what I say in stream, so it doesn't seem to be bots. I don't entertain their offers. They usually ask to take the conversation to discord. Are they all scammers? Does anyone know what these chatters are actually trying to offer? How do I prevent this from happening in the future? I don't have any bots set up to moderate chat as of now, and I don't necessarily want to remove them as they give my channel follows and engagement, which I have none of at the moment. Any advice is welcome and appreciated.",

            "They're either bots or people actively soliciting. I get both and its super annoying. I have \"No Soliciting\" in my chat rules, so if they agree to those terms then do it anyway, it's a ban. That shit ruins twitch",
            "These bots prey on low viewcount streamers. They'll come in, start asking a couple of things and then they'll try to make you feel inadequate by saying your stream overlay needs work or something.\n\nIgnore, ban and move on. All these so called \"artists\" who solicit through chat are guaranteed to be using the same free emblem generator site.\n\nIf you really feel like your overlay needs something, either design one if you are capable to do so, or look on streamelements. They have a whole gallery of free to use overlays that often come complete with several scenes (starting soon, gameplay, just chatting, break and ending).\n\nThese can also be personalized.",
            "I honestly immediately ban them now. If they bring up how my channel can grow, it's a ban.\n\n![gif](giphy|f8lDluiWJ7yQTtdS3L)",
            "I'd treat them as potential scammers. Ultimately, acknowledge, and move on. If they keep pressuring, then that's a red flag that can earn then a mute. Offering unsolicited advice is an \"eeehhhhh\" area, unless you have specifically asked for it.\n\nThe internet is a fickle place.",
            "Ban them, just get used to it,  keep the ban hammer at the ready",
            "This happened my first few weeks of streaming too. I just learned to ignore them or point out I realize they\u2019re scammers. Ive been streaming for over a month now and  it doesnt really happen anymore.",
            "New channels get targeted by these scam bots. Boot them",
            "I've seen some small streamers get suckered in by these people. They'll start chatting regularly to gain favour and then they'll hit 'em with the \"Oh btw if you ever need artwork or emotes I can do them for you if you like :)\" Immediate block.",
            "lol just yesterday I had someone come in, follow me, try to talk me up, and then immediately offer their services. I just say \u201cif you read my rules which you should have accepted before chatting, you would see there is no self promotion allowed\u201d. They just unfollowed and left lol.\n\nIt happens frequently with small streamers I think. I just don\u2019t entertain them once I see that self advertising message. they can fuck right off, and if they don\u2019t leave themselves and are persistent it\u2019s a ban. If they don\u2019t follow me for *me* and my content, I don\u2019t want them.",
            "They may not be bot but they are scams. They are usually selling stolen art or poorly crafted art. And thats IF you get anything. Most of the time they take youe money and delete their account. \n\nMy advice is to set up your auto mod within twitch, set up a few other bots like sery_bot ans nightbot, add their common phrases to your block list so they never appear in your chat and set up chat rules."
