You need the paid version if you want to use some features, but you said you want a simple launcher, its good.\nAnd it has a bit different design if you like it.\n\nLawnchair is a cool open source launcher, it has most of the features you need.\nBut I don't think it's good as Nova.\n\nTry all 3, but Nova would be the best for most people.",
