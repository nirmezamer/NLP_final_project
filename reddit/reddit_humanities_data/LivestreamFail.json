Twitched likely blundered and illegally terminated the contract in an abortive attempt seperate them from the Dr. Maybe they thought it was only a matter of time till it got out or the victim came forward. However, based on the info we know, it's unlikely the contract had a morality clause wide enough for this (especially if the victim decided to not come forward). This is probably why the Dr. was so confident in his case\n2. It would have then been in both Dr and Twitch best interests to settle. Twitch gets to put it to bed - gets to limit damages to the contact most likely, and the Dr. gets this under NDA. Till now. trial could backfire for both and air lots of dirty laundry.\n\nIf I guess the reason this whole shit became so quiet is the victim decided to not come forward.",

            "# look: for several hours now I have been told from credible sources the reason DrDisrespect has been banned. however due to the importance and sensitivity around the subject I have refrained from going on it. i don't feel comfortable with it currently",

            "Maybe Slasher just literally heard the same thing from the same person? Still means we are in the same exact, proof-less position. Slasher needs to clarify what he is cryptically talking about, it's straight up clickbait otherwise. The fact that he followed up to this tweet with a call to action for leads makes me think he doesn't know shit, his source just got leaked, and he didn't release because it's flimsy as fuck and would mostly just make him look bad.",

            "So to set the record straight, he's referring to his court case against twitch for 'wrongfully banning him and ruining his brand', where the case was settled and it appears it was settled out of court and it appears that twitch paid out his full contract (really makes you think why Twitch would settle with him when he was supposedly illiciting minors and they had evidence... they wouldn't settle if they actually had this evidence because it justifies the ban).\n\nIn terms of wrongdoing, it could mean anything related to the case such as Twitch banning him for some statement he made (we know how consistent/inconsistent twitch bans are and their rationale...)\n\nHis response does not mention anything about child grooming, illiciting a child or twitch con -- he's responding to his lawsuit against twitch.\n\nPeople love to jump to conclusions for click bait and reactions and impressions, but if there was any evidence of these dms or whispers that occurred on twitch, you best believe twitch would conveniently leak them to make him look bad (as it's clear they don't like him). \n\nKeep in mind, twitch's entire backend leaked, but not evidence of Doc illiciting minors, I'll believe it when I see these dms that this EX-twitch employee is trying to refer to.",
            "so he just didn't say anything and let him continue with it?",
            "If this guy thinks he's going to come out looking good if this is true he's beyond delusional. No one's going to give  him props for knowing about someone going after underaged girls and keeping quiet about it.",
            "This is literally all the same \"he said, she said\" shit from before. Everyone acting like these rumors weren't out there originally. Bunch of half assed journalists now coming for internet clout going \"That's what I heard to\". We all heard that shit. \n\nSlasher just coming out with more cryptic bullshit as if he was proven right. If he is right then that means he knew about Doc doing this and he kept silent on it for years. If this is true he ought to be ashamed of himself."

He assumes Macaiyla has it worse\n\n- Feels bad for Dantes & Laura since it all aired publicly, hopes they'll get over it eventually but can't imagine what they're going through right now.",
