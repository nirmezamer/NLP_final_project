            "Not that anyone asked for my opinion, but here it is: I'm religious (Catholic). I think abortion is horrific. And I am staunchly pro-choice, because denying women the moral agency to make their own choices is MORE horrific. Declaring dominion over women's bodies is MORE horrific. Thinking you're entitled to impose \"consequences\" on women for having sex is MORE horiffic. Putting people in prison for having/performing/aiding and abetting abortions is MORE horiffic. Forcing girls and women to carry pregnancies conceived through rape is MORE horiffic. Denying women life-saving abortions and miscarriage care is MORE horiffic. Imposing your religious beliefs on other people, to whom God gave free will to follow Him or not, is MORE horiffic. \n\nIf your vision of an \"ideal\" society requires any of the above, don't you DARE position yourself as a moral authority. And don't you DARE claim to have God or humanity at heart. Other people matter besides \"the unborn.\"",
