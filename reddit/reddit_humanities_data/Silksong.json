Again...\n\nDudes the insanity is funny and all but I can't even lie to you man the sheer dissapointment in getting no news in ANY showcases this year, 0 communication from Team Cherry and their very vague hints this year at a release (or not) is starting to make this stuff feel really unfunny and just straight up disappointing... It's not even about not having Silksong at this point, it's just about TC being the worst communicating team I have EVER seen (although I haven't seen many haha), and the disrespect being shown to the community is seriously disappointing. You don't even rage at TC anymore, you just look at your screen in disappointment and sadness...\n\nAnyways. Disappointing. I said that a lot.",
