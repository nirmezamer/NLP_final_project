I liked the diversity of opinions and and the accepting of others views. \n\nI won't miss most of Reddit, but this sub was valuable, though I don't need to keep returning. I'm going to take everything I've learned here and go forth into the world. There's vegetables to grow, sweaters to knit, preserves to make, local events to participate in, trees to drowse under, books to read, libraries to scour, food to forage. I hope my internet addiction will become like a bad dream that haunted a lot of my life, but we'll see. \n\nBetween this sub (and the videos of the youtuber Atomic Shrimp (who, though not a simple living youtuber, made most  simple living YouTubers look like over-produced, hollow artifice)  I've learned a lot. Though I haven't had an account in a while, I've learned how to like to be myself, to find the magic in the small town I live in, and the natural world around me. I always liked that an strange idea wasn't automatically shot down here as stupid by narrow-minded redditors trapped inside their own small lives. We may be small, but we don't lack the courage to be otherwise. \n\nPeace :)",

Generally when I see people doing this it's people who are comfortable with not working (pensioners) and who already have their social group closed down, it's a lot more tricky than it should be. You're an inspiration, I'm going to leave my smartphone in the office this weekend because of you",
            "Ahhh I just love this for you! I work in a technical role online so I wont be ditching the internet anytime soon. But In the last couple months Ive gotten a small home library from my library book sale, moved life planning to physical planners, reading, journaling, painting, or just laying outside in the sun which is my plan for today work from home. I feel like Im at a point where Ive learned a lot from subs and the internet that I dont feel the need to learn more unless needed. Im getting my second masters and I think Im just over information overload. Im ready to just live."

Embrace these moments of independence, and youll find that they can be incredibly fulfilling.",

You might convert a few or you might make them disinvite you from future trips (which I am guessing you may not mind so much?).
