I liked the diversity of opinions and and the accepting of others views. \n\nI won't miss most of Reddit, but this sub was valuable, though I don't need to keep returning. I'm going to take everything I've learned here and go forth into the world. There's vegetables to grow, sweaters to knit, preserves to make, local events to participate in, trees to drowse under, books to read, libraries to scour, food to forage. I hope my internet addiction will become like a bad dream that haunted a lot of my life, but we'll see. \n\nBetween this sub (and the videos of the youtuber Atomic Shrimp (who, though not a simple living youtuber, made most  simple living YouTubers look like over-produced, hollow artifice)  I've learned a lot. Though I haven't had an account in a while, I've learned how to like to be myself, to find the magic in the small town I live in, and the natural world around me. I always liked that an strange idea wasn't automatically shot down here as stupid by narrow-minded redditors trapped inside their own small lives. We may be small, but we don't lack the courage to be otherwise. \n\nPeace :)",

Cell/mobile phones I didn\u2019t get my first one a Motorola brick until 99, TV we got satellite mid 90s but even then there were only like 30 English channels. \n\nFast forward to now I\u2019m addicted to the internet, my attention span is in tatters due to things like TikTok and short content videos I can\u2019t even watch a movie without lifting my phone and doom scrolling, and even finding a movie on Netflix or Prime with so much choice is a job in itself, I could spend hours looking for something to watch, and smart watches, social media constant attention grabbers Grrrr.  \n\nBack then I took joy out of the simple things, reading, or just going for a walk or laying listening to music.  What\u2019s everyone thoughts on this? Could going back in time to how things used to be lead to a happier life?

            "Also a teen in the 90s. It actually was better in a lot of ways, so it's not just rose tinted glasses. Of course there have been great advances in medicine and technology since then, but at an individual and community level, yeah, mental health/body image issues related to fake information on the internet didn't exist and you had to connect on a direct level because you couldn't hide behind a screen/anonymous name.\u00a0\n\n\nIn my job, I study cognitive and physiological impact of technology and it's very interesting how things like alert pings on our phones and notification badges on apps release cortisol (stress hormone) and dopamine. This could happen dozens and dozens of times a day. It's not normal and our bodies are not wired to handle those constant chemical changes. You can't go back in time, but you can reduce your phone/technology use and simply spend more time reconnecting with reality. Find the activities and connections that actually fulfill you. Think about what you loved to do as a teen that you could get back into or find an adult version of.",

Some books I recommend:\n\n\\*The Anxious Generation by Jonathan Haidt  \n\\*Dopamine Nation by Anna Lembke  \n\\*Stop Scrolling by Tony Wrighton  \n\\*Stolen Focus by Johann Hari\n\nSo Reddit is my current Achilles heel, but that aside, I try some simple strategies:\n\nI read, on a Kindle (so yes it's an electronic device, but all it has are books in black and white).   \n  \nI carry around a little puzzle book, so if I feel twitchy, I do a puzzle. I like Sudoku, Killer Sudoku, Hidato, and KenKen.  \n  \nI reduced contrast on my phone, so it's less interesting to look at. I don't replace it until it dies, and as it ages it gets a little less alluring.  \n  \nI spent a month detox from Facebook and Instagram. When I returned, my urge to scroll was gone. I select \"following\" or \"favorites\" to view the newest posts and then log out. If I find myself watching an ad, I close it. \n\nI think back to what I used to do . . . every night after work I would sit on the porch with a glass of wine and listen to Edith Piaf. So I do that now, without my phone. (Of course, the other night I missed a text from my daughter, but she could have just come out on the porch, haha.)\n\nI force myself to sit and look around. Like I said, if I absolutely need a distraction, I do a puzzle in my book. It feels way more calming than playing a game on my phone.\n\nI had jury duty recently (no phones allowed) and everyone was jittery. I swear someone mentioned wanting their phone every 5 minutes.

Drive 45 minutes to try some tiny little restaurant someone we knew had just heard about. Take long walks through the icy cold air conditioning at the local target. Buy a $3 discount bin DVD and watch the directors commentary track. Play CDs for each other from our massive disc binders that had been sitting untouched since high school.\u00a0",

Back when it had to be a CD to listen to music I would choose one at the beginning of my walk/journey press play and wouldn't tend to touch it till the end of the CD (Especially if it was a mix one id burned myself!) Now with Spotify often I'll listen to half a song and move on. It also tends to be a mix of artists rather than listening to just the one artist. Back in the day it would probably be more the artist id fancy listening and choosing their album. I suppose it's just because I can? Anyone else find this?"
