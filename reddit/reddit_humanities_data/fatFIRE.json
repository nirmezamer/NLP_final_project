            "Hey everyone, I\u2019m in my mid 20s and own a healthcare services business doing 7 figures in revenue with 25% a profit margin. \n\nI\u2019m at the age where most of my friends are buying homes, getting married, etc. While I can afford it (I\u2019ve made between 2-300k a year the last two years, on track to make about 400k this year), I\u2019m having a hard time deciding between allocating capital for a primary residence (likely a home under 700k) or reinvesting in the business.\n\nI think I have a good shot at growing my business to 8 figures in revenue over the next 3-5 years, although it will require me to take a slight pay cut and invest in building an administrative team that can sustain that growth/help me get there. \n\nI\u2019m currently sitting on about 300k in cash, mostly allocated in a HYSA that I\u2019ve set aside for this. However, I constantly feel that I\u2019m putting life events on hold to grow the business. I\u2019m currently renting a nice apartment that is spacious and it\u2019s good enough for me and my GF but part of me has a concern of being priced out of the area I grew up in (Miami). \n\nShould I continue with my strategy of using the cash to grow my business or buy a house and potentially build a bit slower? Is there a solution where I can have my cake and eat it too here?",
            "Greetings! Looking to get some feedback on my family\u2019s trajectory: We are 28M and 27F still relatively early in our tech careers.

Current expenses shake out to 150k annually in a VHCOL part of the US. Saving and investing strategy is to max out 401(k)\u2019s, IRA\u2019s, HSA\u2019s, and selling all RSUs upon vesting to buy S&P500 ETFs or Total Market ETFs.\n\nWe do well for ourselves this early in our careers (even by r/chubbyFIRE standards), but lurking around on this sub, I can\u2019t say we\u2019re quite on fatFIRE trajectory just yet.\n\nAnyone else start in a similar situation to us and ended up on a fat trajectory?

We didn't have anything nice or special growing up, so we wake up beaming with joy every day without the weight of hunger, homelessness, or non-gainful wage work hanging over us. We have been able to provide the lifestyle we dreamed of for our kids so far and are securing their futures so they'll likely never have to worry and work will be optional for them. \n\nOur oldest isn't impressed by anything. And although we talk through the relationship between making money and getting to do and have nice things, and how special and wonderful our things and vacations are, I'm baffled by how mundane it all is to her. I want to give her everything, but the more I give her the less fun it is. \n\nOn one hand part of our strategy is to set high standards for my kids' living conditions so they don't accept less. On the other, we've known incredibly wealthy families with kids who expressed delight at receiving anything, even a candy. \n\nI take it as a cautionary tale when I meet young adults who bash their fathers for working too much or hunger strike because they were given a used, not new, land rover for their sweet 16 (yes firsthand experience on this one). One of my main goals in parenting is to raise my kids to be productive and cognizant that their great blessings aren't \"no strings attached\" but rather there to seed their great potential. I'm seeing a gap that needs bridging and I'm not sure that volunteering in the soup kitchen is the answer, but I can tell I need to do something. \n\nI'd appreciate any pointers from other parents whose teens and young adults came out appreciative of the lifestyle they were afforded. I think we have plenty of time to get through to ours, they're by no means spoiled, we are still in the early stages. ",

            "When our kids were young, anytime they wanted to spend their money (allowance, savings etc), we insisted they had to put $1 into a savings account for every $1 they wanted to spend.  Get them into the mindset / habit that you have to live below your currently available resources and put some towards the future.\n\nWe have also made it clear (as they\u2019ve gotten older) that we are doing quite well (which has been very obvious anyway) but that they remain dirt poor.  Yes, we have told them that if there\u2019s an event well outside their control (like having a child with special needs, or a pogrom) that our resources will be there to help.  And they understand their education will be provided.  But that whatever lifestyle they want to have, they will need to earn for themselves.\n\nThey\u2019d be very happy to get a used Land Rover upon graduating college, I\u2019m confident.",
            "How old is your oldest? Asking in order to get a picture of the damage. The age matters. \n\n>the more I give her the less fun it is\n\nStop giving her things, and start insisting on experiences. I know one extremely wealthy family (multiple homes in VHCOL areas, they hang with household name actors) who do not give bought gifts at Christmas--all gifts must be handmade. That sort of thing is what you're missing. In a way you've likely put yourself in a subordinate position to your child where you try to please her with *things* (while at the same time, all children want *time* with their parents).\n\nI think it may also help you to perhaps speak with a therapist to clarify your thoughts about money - in your post, you say you want work \"to be optional\" for your kids. In your comments, you say \"big goals and bigger work ethics, and I want my success to help them go farther\". These are profoundly mixed messages which seem to be setting the kid up for failure either way it shakes out.",
            "Unfortunately if your lifestyle is exorbitant your work is cut out for you and you need to be very active in their education and growing their attitude towards money. They will grow up expecting a certain lifestyle because that is what they've known. Smart kids will eventually understand the $$ amount that was spent on their first class flight for vacationing, and get resentful when you deny them autonomy over the money that is spent on them. Why is a $10k flight ok but a $2k gaming PC not? Why can't they fly coach and then pocket the rest of the money, if it's being spent on them anyway?\n\nIf you are denying them a $2k gaming PC but willing to spend much more than that on a trip etc. you need to have an actual reason why and explain it to them when they ask, even if they don't like your answer. \"It's too expensive\" or dodging the question with answers like \"maybe for your birthday\" are not going to cut it. Give them an opportunity to understand, even if they definitely won't understand the first few times around.\n\nUltimately when trying to instill thankfulness, I think tying rewards to milestones or efforts in chores, manners, school (to an extent, effort matters here not necessarily results), being a good friend, being truthful, being respectful, etc. goes a long way.",
            "It\u2019s extremely age appropriate for a five-year-old to accept everything as their due. Things you can do: go around the dinner table and share \u201cone thing funny and one thing nice\u201d that happened to each of you that day. Also, if you get her excited about projects you and she do together to make/give things to other people (start with parents, grandparents, siblings, teachers, etc), this attitude of generosity can easily help foster gratitude, as they are opposite sides of the same coin. But at her age, it will be you who drums up the feelings of generosity through the making and giving of gifts. Also, work on modeling gratitude to her: thank you spouse in a heartfelt way when they give you things. Notice admiringly (and out loud) when people do things that are kind for one another. Cultivate your own gratitude when someone helps you, and tell your daughter about it if she wasn\u2019t there when it happened. Being lectured on how you should feel gratitude doesn\u2019t foster it.  Actively practicing it and appreciating it wherever you see it will help cultivate it in her as well. Have fun!",
            "We\u2019ve gotten along pretty good explaining the concept of \u201cparents money\u201d and \u201ckids money\u201d and the fact that other than education nothing else is guaranteed.",
            "We try and instill three things in our kiddos: Grace, Grit and Gratitude. \n\nWe aren't perfect, but finding things that feed those three core philosophies I believe has led to a couple of good kids (at least we here that from other parents and teachers, along with what we witness). Kids are older H.S. and older college.\n\nOn the gratitude front. A thank you is non-negotiable - it is expected. It could be if someone opens the door for them. Could be a friend offers to pick them up and drop them off. It could be we unexpectedly Zelle them $ for lunch (they normally buy with money they've earned) when they are out with friends. If it doesn't happen, we either talk about it through the lens of grace (ie we don't berate them) and/or don't do anything unexpected for them for months (ie they buy everything that's not a necessity). \n\nOur youngest noticed. One day while having dinner she said she we've not taken her out for ice cream recently and she missed that. We told her that months ago she didn't thank us for buying her lunch (unexpectedly) so we made the decision to not go for ice cream. She was shocked. We talked through that being grateful is exhibited in the small simple things and saying thank you is a part of that. Things quickly improved. \n\nLastly, since they were old enough to do it, we've volunteered quarterly at local charities where they see the difference between our home/life and those that are really struggling and need assistance. It's led to a lot of wonderful conversations - including money and how we save some, give some and live on the rest. \n\nFWIW...   beyond covering the true necessities, most of what we give them are experiences. We're not big 'stuff' people. If they want 'stuff' they get to buy it with their own $.",
            "Big kudos to you for your intentional approach to fatfire childrearing! Your instinct to be mindful about it, seeking insight and advice early on, will make all the difference to your children. I've seen what a curse growing up in HNW/UHNW families can be for children. Affluence does not naturally create healthy, happy, successful adults. Parents have to be very conscious in how they handle their wealth in relation to their kids.\n\nWhile I don't think there is one right way, much of the advice others have offered here is good. I'd add a few more ideas I've seen work very well.\n\n1. Spend lots of time with your children, at every age. That is the biggest luxury you can give them, and is the most lasting and fruitful gift.\n2. Work on your own sense of self. It is hard to say \"No\" when you can't say \"We can't afford it.\" Because of this many wealthy parents don't say no. You have to say no for kids to feel secure and develop well, so find ways to have the willpower to do it with ease.\n3. Make sure your family is of service, starting now. Serving others is humility and gratitude in action, and helps kids grow beyond their natural self-centeredness. As your children get older, allow them to choose their service to others. It does not need to be the same for each of you, but it does need to be mandatory.\n4. Paid work outside the family business should also be mandatory when they are old enough to legally work. Children should also do chores, and contribute to the well-being of the household. It's not beneficial for kids to have everything done for them by hired help and/or parents.\n5. The money should not be a mystery. You and your husband can decide how you want to dole it out or not, however you desire, but the outlines of that should not be a mystery to your kids. When the children get to their early teens, talk to them about the family money and how it affects them and keep talking for the rest of your lives. They need to understand it and they need to know what to expect, now and in the future. There are fee-based advisors with experience in the specific best practices around second generation wealth planning, including how to communicate with the kids about it.\n\nRemember, your children are having a very, very different experience of growing up than yours. How you parent will require a very different approach too, including your expectations. Your children have their own path, and it most likely won't look like yours. They'll have to chart their own way, but with your loving and intentional support, it's clear they are lucky, and that has nothing to do with your net worth.",
            "I grew up not Fat, but definitely upper middle class, never needing for anything, cars always < 10 years old, big house, private high school, new car (a Civic) as a teenager, etc. (small city, so not high COL).  Gratitude was not a strength of mine.\n\nAnd then I went to college, and my parents gave me almost nothing (tuition was an earned scholarship; they paid for basic room + board only, no extra $, then would only cover cheap rent when i lived on my own).  I got a job, I lived in the cheapest places I could, etc.  I learned gratitude and the value of a dollar real quick.  I was also at a State school, and did a few hundred hours of volunteer work.  Saw lots of different ways life can turn out, and lots of different life situations people can come from.",
            "Your kid is five.  It\u2019s nuts that you\u2019re working on this now vs teaching basic manners.  It\u2019s nuts that you think you can even work in this with a five year old.  But I\u2019ll also note your post is very money focused, how \u201cspecial\u201d your things and vacations are, so you\u2019re probably modeling a worldview of a certain type and it\u2019s not one that grateful for the little things or things that may be special but not cost money - at least that is the vibe I\u2019m getting from your post.   Also, send your kid to public school vs private if you really want to teach this value.  Then again I\u2019m almost, not quite fat probably because I\u2019m having a hard time caring about another few million so feel free to ignore me."

            "TL;DR. We did event-driven direct gifting until our children were in their 40s.   At that point we gifted via trusts that gave them, as trustees of their own trusts, as much power and control as was compatible with IRS rules.\n\nWe did a variety of direct gifts in response to life stages.   College.  First houses.   Wrote mortgage for 2nd houses when they moved.   It was different amounts and different timing for my two children as they passed through various life stages at different times.\n\nDirect gifting offered the most flexibility, and could have led to control, but then they would not really be gifts.   We tried to assist and guide, but not interfere.\n\nWhen my children were in their 40s, mature established adults that had already made their place in the world, had good spouses, and had children of their own I realized I had full faith in them and was no longer concerned with potential negative consequences of large gifts.\n\nSo in 2021 we gifted the remaining principal of the intra-family mortgages and also gifted $21M to irrevocable generation skipping trusts.   Since we had full faith in them, we made them trustees of trusts for them and for their children.   The trusts do provide some asset protection from creditors and divorce, but their powers as trustees is a broad as possible while keeping the trust principal out of their estates.   So basically limited to HEMS ( a rather broad discretionary standard although considered an ascertainable standard by IRS).   Distributions and actions beyond HEMS can only be done by our children appointing an independent co-trustee \u2014- an independent person IRS standards, but hired and fired by my children.\n\nEdit to add:  when our children were young our living/revocable trust called for trust that would distribute principal outright at ages 21, 26 and 31.  10%., 30%, 60%, or earlier if the trustee (my brother) saw fit.    Estate taxes were not a significant issue when we first do a revocable trust.",
            "If you and your spouse each create $14M SLATs for each other, I think that's pretty low risk.  You still control all the money; the kids probably don't need to know about it.  And you can be as restrictive as you want in the SLAT rules.\n\nThat said, I'd take the other side of the story.  My wife and I really could have used an extra few million in our late 20's when we were deciding how many kids to have, what city we could afford to live in.  In our mid-40's we've now made $20M+ and inheriting another $20M won't change anything, whereas getting the money earlier would have made enormous impact... you cant unwind that clock and decide 10 years later you could have afforded a bigger family...",
            "Some options are:\n\n1. Outright gift. Will it mess them up? Do you just want to control what they spend money on? Won\u2019t it suck if they \u201cstruggle\u201d until they\u2019re 50 to then get 10s of millions? But then you say you\u2019d pay for house (so some level of control). Will they blow it? Not saying any of these are right / wrong, just things to think about\n\n2. Gift through an irrevocable trust. Allows you to take advantage of the exemption today while controlling what they can use it on or until a certain age. This seems like the best option and weird if advisors aren\u2019t suggesting this\n\n3. Other types of trusts. I\u2019m not an expert but you don\u2019t lose all optionality once you hit the exemption amount. For example you can use rolling grats to give your kids all gains on your investments without it counting as a gift",
            "Most people don\u2019t just give their kids almost 30M. \n\nIt\u2019s typically passed to an irrevocable trust, with a third party trustee, with specifics about accessing the money in the trust. Wording typically covers marriage, education, a percentage or dollar amount per year the beneficiary can take, as well as provisions regarding drug use or gambling addictions etc. There is also typically an age range when the beneficiary has greater access to the funds, or maybe it simply passes to the beneficiaries living trust. \n\nBut simply giving someone $28M doesn\u2019t normally happen. And if it did, it\u2019s likely that the beneficiary is already of age and responsible, or it means the grantor did absolutely no planning and died before they had anything but a will or simple living trust in place that distributed free and clear to bene\u2019s.",
            "I'm probably not going to have that much, but I'd start with necessities that aren't necessarily liquid, e.g. ensure all of college/grad school is covered, setup 529's to cover 100% of grandkids college, possibly buy a house in full, bring them all on family vacations, etc... \n\nMy thought process is my kids are going to need to work, and learn to work to build their own wealth, but I can eliminate things that slowed my savings and investing path. Imagine how much more the average family can save if they don't have to worry about a mortgage, or saving for college for kids? Maybe even give the annual max limit just to transfer some money.\n\nThe rest can go into some kind of trust, or maybe gifted to them after you are comfortable they can handle it.",
            "I think there's no 100% guaranteed way to give any kid 28MM, or anything over ~5MM, and not affect them in some way. There's always the risk they get into drugs, alcohol, gambling, etc even if you give them 100k. At ~5MM you're at the point if they want to live a middle to upper middle class life they never need to work but 28MM is a rich life of never working.\n\nIf you give all the money upfront they can decide to never work and party their whole lives\n\nIf you give the money as $x/year or through a trust with stipulations until X age then they can party their whole life waiting for money to drop in their accounts. Even if you make this amount small enough they just have to get a job to coast and there's no stress to do better because of the trust's backstop and ultimately a huge cash infusion at X age.\n\nIf you give them nothing but paid for schooling, a free house, and funded business ventures you've already taken out 90% of the struggle from their lives. Then they could be going through the motions until inheritance or they could actually go to work for their own career but hanging over their head the whole time is \"does this matter if I'm going to inherit 10MM+?\"\n\nAny way you decide to go except for giving all your money to charity your kids can be bums until they get your money. Even if they don't get money even knowing they're set to inherit 10MM+ enters into every decision of their lives\n\nIf you do some weird scheme to avoid these possible negative scenarios your kids could resent you controlling their lives, even with the best intentions.\n\nIt's a tough question with no one-size-fits-all answer. \n\nPersonally, I think I'd help out using my discretion while I'm alive and then they get whatever inheritance fully when I die, or I could change my mind down the road and give them a pre-inheritance while I'm alive. At 28MM each, even with estate taxes your kids will be fine. Everyone's always scheming to lower taxes when sometimes the amounts are so big it literally doesn't matter.",

Maybe, but the jet probably comes with a pilot, the minivan doesn't, and it wasn't the $1300 making the minivan go 90mph on a back road.\n\nI have a lot of friends and family whose lives were ruined by drugs and alcohol, and they were all middle class or broke for the entire slide to the gutter. Some would have been saved by the money. Some still could be saved by the money. I know people's lives get ruined sometimes but that's not the money, that's just being 20.",
            "I think it's fine.\n\nMy parents would sometimes take me to a bank. They would have me open an account (with them acting as my watchamacallit), and then they would take all the info/paperwork. So I didn't even know the account number, the balance, etc. I didn't consider it to be \"my money.\"\n\nOther times, they would take me to the bank and have me wire $50K to my grandmother.\n\nAs for how this affects people, it depends on the child.\n\nSome people like to work; other's don't.\n\nI have a 20-year-old friend who has 8-figures in his name. He still has a low-paying summer job.",

Same house, same car.  Went from housekeeping once a week to a more comprehensive \u201chousehold staff\u201d three full days a week.  Still drive the Honda odyssey family van.  Fully landscaping and pool service weekly\u2026 but had that at 1.6m.  Wifey Instacarts groceries, and speciality stuff is picked up by staff. \n\nWill be adding 3k a month more in private school fees soon.\n\nOnly real difference is\u2026 now I take the whole family on vacations twice a year.  Parents, sibs, nieces\u2026. About 17 of us now, lol. I have zero issue flying us all business to a staffed villa somewhere, or a hcol city. It\u2019s more difficult to just get everyone together!  Whole trip may run 150 to 250k.  Other than that, really no difference. \n\nI spend more on lawyers and insurance than before, but most of that runs through the company. \n\nBottom line\u2026 not much!",

So among us there will be righteously good business owners who are throwing off $5M profit per year - God Bless Them.\n\nFor me, it was a tough challenge, because I treated it as a windfall and didn't assume I'd make $5M/year for very long.",
            "Since I stopped working the $5m+ years are behind me. 2023 I made about $2.2m and honestly, I just don\u2019t spend it. I was so aggressive about getting my spending under control back when I was younger making $30k-150k per year or so and the habits just kind of stuck. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m frugal but my post tax spending is really only about $350k/year. \n\nI think the biggest reason is I\u2019m planning to have kids and I don\u2019t really want to reduce my lifestyle when that happens. My current situation allows me to handle the extra expenses when I do have kids without making any sacrifices.",
            "Not quite at 5M but have substantial income and figured I would share my viewpoint and strategy that is working for us.  \n\nSo we save a tremendous percentage of our annual income after taxes.  We are 100% FI at this point but the income we are making is just too high to give up today.  We spend to (or very close to) our SWR.  So for your case if you are able to save 350k/Month for example and are FI already you can increase your monthly spend by 14k/month + the increase from asset appreciation depending on your base.  Now every month or every quarter you can find something new you want to increase your lifestyle with.  \n\nYour numbers are just very big so your lifestyle increase once FI go up much faster than someone saving 10% of your amount.  \n\nYou want that Spotify or Pandora premium but have been too cheap to splurge?  Save that 350k next month and guess what, you can afford that forever along with another 13950 or whatever every month.  \n\nWe just move our SWR every few months and increase that lifestyle creep accordingly.  If you are not FI yet then save and invest it until you get there. \n\nIf you truly are saving a few million plus a year the numbers get big very fast as you can see.  But it also gives you a bit of time to grow comfortable with that increased burn rate and it\u2019s comforting knowing that you can more or less afford that increase forever.  And if you get tired of the pandora subscription you can shift around spend as you see fit as long as it is below that SWR to other things you find more value in.",
            "I saw rapid income growth after COVID but last year was flat at 3 but this year should already be 3 next month so hopefully 5+ this yr. \n\nWe've tried not to change too much since a lot of our friends are at a HHI of 0.5-1(I know plenty of people at 5+ but spouse and kid need to also want to spend time with them which doesn't happen) so our spend is below 0.5/yr still. \n\nThe main thing is taking taxes more seriously especially estate taxes and planning. We also pay for family travel in J/F (especially if they come to visit us) but at 5M it doesn't put a dent. \n\nWe prefer to be asset lite (1 nice primary home and 2 vehicles) since assets tend to suck up time which we are trying to preserve time. Others I know at this level have gotten into upgrading/buying more real estate (it costs a lot between taxes, mortgages, maintenance, insurance etc if you buy a primary home for $10M, investing (you can easily spend a lot on illiquid investments that hopefully earn a positive return) and charity.",

            "For me not much changed because of a mindset of retiring early. I do have lifestyle creep but I keep it at a level I know I can maintain in retirement so I don\u2019t have to cut back when I pull the trigger. My life would be a lot different if I was not planning to RE. Instead it just accelerates my path to it.\n\nMy coworkers have houses in the 10m+ range, fractional private jet ownerships, etc. I would probably be in the same boat if I thought of my $2.5m post tax as spendable salary. Instead I make sure to keep my spending at less than 3.5% of my RE goal number.",

            "I think it entirely depends on your age, your source of income, and what you want to do. For me, once I was in my 40s, life became more about meaning, having purpose and giving back. How do I enjoy life, while being useful, and not end up miserable with a bunch of stuff. Sadly, most people end up miserable with a bunch of stuff.\u00a0\n\n\nOne trap\u00a0 above a certain income is that you will inevitably gain complexity; try to simplify whenever possible. I'm talking complex tax strategies, multiple lawyers, advisors; most of which are leeches. Simplify, simplify whenever you can. Obviously do the appropriate planning, but the getting into complex private investing, multiple deals at a time etc can go south really fast.\u00a0\n\n\nI find giving back, being challenged and controlling my time rigorously is important to me and my happiness.",

        "content": "I'm 47M, my wife is 44 yrs, have 2 high schoolers who will head to college in 2 and 4 yrs. Live in VHCOL area, we both are in the tech industry. I come from a very modest background, immigrant moved to US for higher studies and did the usual after studies found a job, then became permanent resident and finally a citizen. We are very prudent with our spending.\n\nEarlier this year I took a break from my job, company was going thru restructuring since I was higher up the ladder and was aware of the pending layoffs, I put my name and got a decent enough severance. I was really burnt out and was thinking about a break for some time. I'm on a break currently, my wife though she was cool with it when we were debating my exit is now anxious of the unemployed me. I think I'm in a more than decent situation financially, but wanted the experts in this group to chime in please.\n\nNow the financial details:  \nNet worth: \\~$9M, the following is the breakdown.\n\n* Retirement (401k, IRA): \\~$2M, invested in US Large Cap, Tech, Healthcare funds/ETFs, \\~$200k of which is ROTH\n* Taxable: $4.5M, invested again mostly in Large Cap, Tech and our company stock, which I will be diversifying thru this year since I left.\n* Cash/Cash equivalent: $500k, good chunk of it in T Bills\n* Kids college savings: $600k, that we diligently funded via 529s for both our kids, which we continue to fund (and is part of the expenses below). (We wish to fund our kids education fully).\n* Real Estate: (Primary home and rentals), \\~$3M worth, with \\~$1.3M mortgage remaining. (mortgage payments are the biggest part of the expense below)\n\nExpenses: averaged $250k/yr the past 5 yrs (I have been diligently tracking all expenses to the penny the last few years). Expenses breakdown:\n\n* Homes (mortgages, taxes etc): $100k (mostly evenly split between primary and rentals)\n* Everyday (groceries, shopping, restaurants etc): $30k\n* Taxes: $40k (though it will come down if my income reduces)\n* Health/Medical: $5k\n* Insurance: $6k\n* Utilities: $10k\n* Kids activities: $30k\n* Private school fees: $30k \n\nIncome: Mine is $0 now, (but was \\~$500k/yr gross plus variable bonus), wife grosses about $250k/yr, she is still working.\n\nRental income: \\~$60k (we have rentals in MCOL area)\n\nI'm on a break currently and do wish to take my time if I need to go back to work, do not want to hurry.\n\nI think we have enough saved that we both can afford a break and focus on things that we like. My wife though is anxious, mostly feeling the pressure due to the perceived stigma of unemployed husband, coming from her and my side of the family and friends (it is unheard of a Male < 60 yrs staying at home in our circle!).\n\nI could easily get a job (Have enough contacts, I have a niche expertise in Product management), but not that I may be satisfied with. I do want to explore other areas and take my time before getting back in, or may be never and move to volunteering for my community. Wife would want to continue to work till another 5 yrs or so.\n\nWould love to hear what the community thinks.",

            "Some advice, a little ahead in age, kids and NW than you but similar. \n\n1. Ignore what others think about your employment, just say you are consulting or focusing on real estate deals\n\n2. $500k is too much in cash equivalent, over 2 years of emergency fund, put some to work. \n\n3. This will be controversial. Keep the 529 and pay for college using cash. 529 can grow tax deferred and read somewhere it being a good tool for estate planning\n\n4. Lets kids attend 4 years of college, but if they have enough AP credits that give college credit then take minimal classes in final year, but don\u2019t finish sooner. Let them take loan for the 3rd year, teaches valuable lesson on finances, debt and realization that tuition is not a number on a screen. \n\n5. Travel while you are healthy.",
            "So - couple things I would point out - you have $6.5MM of investments that qualify for the SWR, and some unknown split of Primary residence and Rental properties in your NW. \n\nI\u2019d say you\u2019re pretty close but not quite there on FatFire - at a 4% withdrawal rate you get $250,000 on $6.25MM - but if your annual spend is $250,000 - then really you need like $350,000 to cover taxes and variability in spending and market fluctuations. So even if you include the $60,000 rental income - that\u2019s ~$40,000 away - so you need maybe another $1-2MM to maintain spend and have safety stock for you and your wife to FatFire together (which is the goal, Fatfiring while your spouse works is kinda boring)\n\nAt least that\u2019s what I would do, I\u2019d probably also wait till I paid off the primary",
            "I\u2019m in same boat as you. Just got laid off after acquisition and made so much I don\u2019t need to work again and every job a recruiter has contacted me about sounds so awful compared to my leisurely morning walks, long gym sessions, and making a nice dinner every night. Wife still wants to work which is cool with me. And we haven\u2019t admitted that I\u2019m retired but I think we both know I am - none of our family/friends are FIRE so it\u2019s a completely foreign concept to them that we would stop working in our 40s before our kids are through college.  So we just don\u2019t really talk about it with people and I just act like I\u2019m coasting in my WFH job.\n\nSince your wife is still working I do think you should consider a side hustle until you\u2019ve paid off your mortgage, unless you are at a super low interest rate?

The family piece with feeling anxious about not fitting a stereotype may be more of an issue than the numbers. Maybe you guys could get a little therapy together to explore ways to lessen this anxiety.\n\ncontext - I'm in a similar position to you, in age, almost identical home numbers. VHCOL, lower NW at 5m, but perhaps 30% less ongoing expenses. We're also looking out thinking.. maybe it's time to just ... take a break...
