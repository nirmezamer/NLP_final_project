You are probably saving some $120k a year currently if you are spending $150k on $500k of earned income.    That is going to drive up the $1.5m quickly.

There is a lot to be negotiated in the LOI (exclusivity, up front, salary, earn out calculations, etc), it's time to call in the experts. I interviewed a few firms who supposedly specialize in this type of work but they were CPA firms and their in house attorney seemed to be a generalist not focused on M&A which for the largest transaction of my life, I don't want a pediatrician doing my brain surgery, so I ran away from those. I will be working with a new CPA to get my QB in order for due diligence and creating/structuring my other companies/assets in a tax efficient manner, meeting on Monday to begin that process. Hoping my restated financials don't tweak the terms of the deal negatively but I have a feeling with an actual SDE statement, it should increase valuation in best case scenario. \n\nBig name East Coast law firm quoted $170k-$280k for M&A services. I like the attorney I interviewed, just not sure about spending that much and if the deal falls through. I am going to reach out to firms that have already transacted with the PE firm to get quotes and also other smaller firms who work just in M&A that have the expertise to work with the big boys the PE firm brings to the table. \n\nHas anyone here went through an exit and loved an attorney that you could recommend? \n\nI'm also all ears for any other advice you may have. My plan post sale (and eventual earn out) is to live the fatFIRE lifestyle. I'm 40 yo, two kids, wife is an in house atty in healthcare. ",

        "content": "Hey parents to fat lifestyle kids, \n\nWe're 2 kids in and looking for tips on instilling thankfulness. We didn't have anything nice or special growing up, so we wake up beaming with joy every day without the weight of hunger, homelessness, or non-gainful wage work hanging over us. We have been able to provide the lifestyle we dreamed of for our kids so far and are securing their futures so they'll likely never have to worry and work will be optional for them. \n\nOur oldest isn't impressed by anything. And although we talk through the relationship between making money and getting to do and have nice things, and how special and wonderful our things and vacations are, I'm baffled by how mundane it all is to her. I want to give her everything, but the more I give her the less fun it is. \n\nOn one hand part of our strategy is to set high standards for my kids' living conditions so they don't accept less. On the other, we've known incredibly wealthy families with kids who expressed delight at receiving anything, even a candy. \n\nI take it as a cautionary tale when I meet young adults who bash their fathers for working too much or hunger strike because they were given a used, not new, land rover for their sweet 16 (yes firsthand experience on this one). One of my main goals in parenting is to raise my kids to be productive and cognizant that their great blessings aren't \"no strings attached\" but rather there to seed their great potential. I'm seeing a gap that needs bridging and I'm not sure that volunteering in the soup kitchen is the answer, but I can tell I need to do something. \n\nI'd appreciate any pointers from other parents whose teens and young adults came out appreciative of the lifestyle they were afforded. I think we have plenty of time to get through to ours, they're by no means spoiled, we are still in the early stages. ",

            "Help them through college, dont give them a whiff of inheritance or any meaningful help until theyre in their 30s. Having to get by on your own in your 20s is eye opening for a lot of folks who grew up with a silver spoon",
            "Its extremely age appropriate for a five-year-old to accept everything as their due. Things you can do: go around the dinner table and share one thing funny and one thing nice that happened to each of you that day. Also, if you get her excited about projects you and she do together to make/give things to other people (start with parents, grandparents, siblings, teachers, etc), this attitude of generosity can easily help foster gratitude, as they are opposite sides of the same coin. But at her age, it will be you who drums up the feelings of generosity through the making and giving of gifts. Also, work on modeling gratitude to her: thank you spouse in a heartfelt way when they give you things. Notice admiringly (and out loud) when people do things that are kind for one another. Cultivate your own gratitude when someone helps you, and tell your daughter about it if she wasnt there when it happened. Being lectured on how you should feel gratitude doesnt foster it.  Actively practicing it and appreciating it wherever you see it will help cultivate it in her as well. Have fun!",

Gratitude was not a strength of mine.\n\nAnd then I went to college, and my parents gave me almost nothing (tuition was an earned scholarship; they paid for basic room + board only, no extra $, then would only cover cheap rent when i lived on my own).  I got a job, I lived in the cheapest places I could, etc.  I learned gratitude and the value of a dollar real quick.  I was also at a State school, and did a few hundred hours of volunteer work.  Saw lots of different ways life can turn out, and lots of different life situations people can come from.",
            "Your kid is five.  Its nuts that youre working on this now vs teaching basic manners.  Its nuts that you think you can even work in this with a five year old.  But Ill also note your post is very money focused, how special your things and vacations are, so youre probably modeling a worldview of a certain type and its not one that grateful for the little things or things that may be special but not cost money - at least that is the vibe Im getting from your post.   Also, send your kid to public school vs private if you really want to teach this value.  Then again Im almost, not quite fat probably because Im having a hard time caring about another few million so feel free to ignore me.",
            "I can so understand and empathize with your problem, not because I am hugely wealthy but in the last 3-4 years we have been living pretty comfortably especially as it pertains to taking really nice vacations. My background is a bit different, my husband died back in 2020 after a major illness- that was a rough year because he was the primary earner though I was also working. My kids (at that time 7 and 13) saw me struggle- both with their dads illness and loss and financially. But after things turned around, I made some good investments and changed to a much higher paying job -bottom line- we are pretty decently comfortable. Losing my husband changed my attitude to money - it is important to have enough but it is more important to have memories with each other. Thus we travel a lot, so much that both the kids friends frequently comment that we must be rich to do so. My older one finds it easier to understand the difference but not my younger one and I constantly struggle to convey that my priorities are different. I might object to an expensive restaurant or a expensive toy but I dont object to an expensive vacation! It is such a fine line to walk - you will get there, the fact that you realize that you need to teach them is step 1. Best of luck to you.",

I dont understand that, unless youre talking about basic needs. But it sounds like youre saying your kids should always expect to ride business class.",
            "We grew up smack dab middle class so when things started working out well we didnt change our spending habits. Our kids always had their needs met but going to private schools and universities surrounded by wealth they always had unmet wants. We encouraged them to work for them, and somehow just the right amount of motivation kicked in. \nAs young adults now we feel blessed to see them on a self made trajectory surpassing us by leaps and bounds. Meanwhile saving early helped compounding of our assets beyond our wildest dreams.",
            "I wrote a long thing about raising kids to not know their parents net worth and then deleted it bc I think you have a much simpler problem.\n\nIf you want your kid to express delight whenever he or she gets candy, simply give them less candy. It's really that simple. It may take time, but it will work. This principle works for pretty much everything."

And you can be as restrictive as you want in the SLAT rules.\n\nThat said, I'd take the other side of the story.  My wife and I really could have used an extra few million in our late 20's when we were deciding how many kids to have, what city we could afford to live in.  In our mid-40's we've now made $20M+ and inheriting another $20M won't change anything, whereas getting the money earlier would have made enormous impact... you cant unwind that clock and decide 10 years later you could have afforded a bigger family...",

End of the day, not sure if there is a right answer one way or another, but that large a sum of money at that young an age could put them a significant dissadvantage for life goals.

Honestly at that high of a number I wouldn't put a lot of strings on it, I would organize it as monthly distributions and let them treat it as their primary income. A good 1% annually for 5-10 years, ramping up to 2% for the next 5-10, then 3% until you determine they're at the age for full access."
