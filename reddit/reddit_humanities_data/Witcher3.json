Click me!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12H5lZC6vLFj0JToLSD2ZE7EcMN6MrmltL9SM_G6EUNU/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThe formatting is probably best viewed on a computer, but can still be accessed on your phone. Because it is in view only, in order to use the check boxes, you need to create a copy by going to \u2018file\u2019 and then selecting \u2018make a copy\u2019. Once you have your own copy, you can check mark the boxes when you complete something and it will show you the percentage that you've completed for each section of the game.\n\nIf this is your first time playing the Witcher 3, I highly recommend going into it without this guide since you are supposed to stumble upon quests naturally. If you are like me and like to 100% the game, then this guide is for you!\n\nI posted this guide last December, right before the Next Gen Edition was released. Throughout this year, I've been playing through the game, following my guide, and correcting or adding things as I went. I've also read every comment from last year's post and I thank everyone for the kind words and for those that were able to help me with any changes that they found.\n\nI've included many links to other websites, especially for quest guides, interactive maps, character builds, videos etc. on each of the Google Sheets. Anywhere that the text is underlined will have a link to a website or video.\n\nThe first Google Sheet provides every main quest, side quest, contract, treasure hunt, Gwent/Heroes' Pursuits, Scavenger Hunts, Chance Encounters, and Extra Details You May Have Missed (based on videos from xLetalis!). At the top of the first sheet, you can find interactive maps for each area, and different builds for your character. At the bottom, you will see all the different tabs/Google Sheets.\n\nThe second Google Sheet is the optimal ORDER for all quests, and I've added a column that has the extra missed details from the first sheet to match up with the respective quest. It is all colour coded based on the type of quest it is. The legend is found at the top (red for main quest, orange for side quest, etc.)\n\nThe other Google Sheets are for patch notes I've made throughout the year, Gwent cards, Scavenger Hunts, Alchemy, a Trophy List, and Challenge Runs.\n\nThank you again to xLetalis for all his hard work creating his amazing \u2018things you may have missed\u2019 videos and for giving me permission to post this. I highly recommend checking out his content! Thanks to all the other redditors that have been sending me messages over the year and helping to improve my guide!\n\nIf you find anything that should be changed, or you have something to add, please let me know! :)\n\nThanks!",

            "Impressive indeed ! Out of curiosity how did you define the order of quests ? For example in White Orchards you define some side quests to be done before the Griffon, why ? I usually beat the lain quests, then the side quests, then the \u00ab\u00a0?\u00a0\u00bb.",
            "Can confirm - used this for my 100% run and I've gotten every quest done w/ no failures. On B&W now - super useful to not miss anything, especially with the extra details!",

            "I'm looking forward to reading through on PC, especially the challenge runs segment. It must've taken a ton of work and time to compile all this and make it so orderly and well-presented - thank you for your effort",
            "TYSM! Decided just today to finally play the next-gen update and wanted n updated guide to follow along with. Perfect timing, this is amazing!",
            "You say 100% the game but did that include collecting all the gwent cards? it wouldn't be so bad if the cards didn't reset with NG+, that sucked arse from my point of view. Would I be right in thinking it needs a dedicated playthrough or maybe next level Jedi-like patience?",

I did not play the first 2 games so I watched some summary videos. \n\nI loved it. \n\nSomething ends, something begins. ",
