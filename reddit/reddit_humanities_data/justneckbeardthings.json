            "Except lolis often look like a child, have a child like voice, and BEHAVE like a child, despite being \"500 years old.\" Yet they claim it isn't pedo shit...",
            "they realize there\u2019s more defining features of lollis that resemble children other than a flat chest right?",
            "Looking petite and young does not make someone a pedo for liking you. If you act like an actual child (with the mentality of one) then yeah it's creepy as fuck. A lot of the anime lolies that are technically legal still ACT LIKE CHILDREN! that's disgusting.",
            "I find that the weebs who compare lolis to real life short women, do not actually are about real bodyshaming ( notice  how they will never say shit when fat  women get bodyshamed. Don't get me started on their racism issues.).  They just want to defend their precious lolis",
            "I have doubts that those \"petite, flat cheated women\" are legit but even assuming they are, they're all pretty young. I think the oldest person to comment was 22 with someone who looked concerningly old to onlookers IE not a teenager or younger adult. \n\nSome small women talk about how often creeps mistake them for children and then lose interest when they find out they're adults, not all obviously but some. I have even heard the term \"legal lolis\" for girls and women who look underage but aren't. As to the Japanese actresses they often reference, they and their producers know what they're doing. The age of consent in Japan was 14 for a long time and their society is extremely sexist. \n\nThe fetishization of teen girls is hugely apparent and groping, harassing and stalking middle and high school girls is common. \n\nSo why can't they see that their actresses looking like kids is the point, not that it's representative of Japanese women in general but caters to the sick sexualisation of girlhood.\n\nI'm sure some unfortunate woman is married to a man who gets a lot of concerned looks because she looks so young but guess what? As soon as she opens her mouth and sounds like an adult, people will back off. At worst, she may need to flash ID. Most people don't usually care enough to intervene though.",

They are short, but still have a proportions of a grownup person.[I mean, here\u2019s an example.](https://youtu.be/QIYN6NSKxOw?si=SJAPZy_Slmz4JktA)\n\nIf character has overly large head and eyes they will read as a child.",
