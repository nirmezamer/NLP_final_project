            "Looking petite and young does not make someone a pedo for liking you. If you act like an actual child (with the mentality of one) then yeah it's creepy as fuck. A lot of the anime lolies that are technically legal still ACT LIKE CHILDREN! that's disgusting.",
            "I find that the weebs who compare lolis to real life short women, do not actually are about real bodyshaming ( notice  how they will never say shit when fat  women get bodyshamed. Don't get me started on their racism issues.).  They just want to defend their precious lolis",
