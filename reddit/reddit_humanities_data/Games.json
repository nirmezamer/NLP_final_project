            "I'm playing through the Ace Attorney trilogy, and I'm on the last game. I'm really enjoying it except I have to admit I'm getting annoyed by the constant reuse of characters. It makes the world very small if all cases involve the same handful of dumbasses",
            "Last three games I finished were: FFVII Rebirth, Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth, and Animal Well. It's really weird to spend months and months finishing two enormous games, and then my next game is over in like 10 hours. That's that, onto the next thing.\n\n(I know there's a ton of post-game and post-post-game stuff but I think I've seen everything I need to.)",
            "I like the influx of creature collecting games we've been getting as of late. I just wish most of them werent roguelikes. Hard to care about actually collecting the creatures when they will be gone in a 10 minute run. Especially when the game includes shinies (or whatever their equivalent is). It just seems like creature collecting and roguelikes are something very counterintuitive",
            "Have you got any examples of games you like? I like collecting things.",
            "We really were out here getting excited for Starfield previews. \u00a0I watched them, and got so hyped for years. \u00a0I mean, Bethesda does not miss - right? \u00a0I even told my wife about how great this game was going to be. \u00a0I entertained myself with Outer Worlds while I waited, but I knew the real deal was coming. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWell, it\u2019s been out for a long time now. \u00a0And I still haven\u2019t played it. \u00a0Everything I read about it makes me want to play it less. \u00a0",

I specifically prefer linear games where you just go from point A to point B; for me, \"hallways\" is a good thing when discussing platformers. I prefer the challenge to come from the platforming, not interested in exploration, nonlinear design, or games that are highly based on powerups/combat (so not interested in games like Psychonauts or A Hat In Time).\n\nExamples of what I'm looking for (some obscure indies so check these out if you're interested): Demon Turf: Neon Splash, Frogun, Spark the Electric Jester series.",

Eora is a wonderfully developed world and I\u2019m so excited to get to experience it from a new perspective.\n\nPlus it truly sounds like they\u2019re responding to the criticism from The Outer Worlds.

            "The producer Noriaki Okamura is a KCEJ / KojiPro veteran that worked with Kojima on the Beatmania console versions, Guitar Freaks console version, Metal Gear, Policenauts, Tokimeki Memorial Drama Series Vol. 1-3 and Zone of the Enders. He also directed and write Zone of the Enders 1 and was the director of Tokimeki Memorial Drama Series: Vol.1 and 2. So he and Kojima likely had a good relationship and worked together from the early 1990s till the release of MGSV in september 2015. He also said that many of the original MGS3 staff is still at konami and involved in MGS Delta Snake Eater like for example creative producer Yuji Korekado who worked on Policenauts, MGS 1/2/3/4/PW/V, MGRR and directed Metal Gear Online in MGS4.",

            "I don't think it would be a terrible thing if Kojima had a consulting role with a MGS spinoff or remake project.\n\nMainline MGS is over and Kojima will never make a full on MGS game again. Nor would Konami ever invest in him like that ever again.",
            "Well, Kojima is not on bad terms with Konami developers. It is only a feud with the executives of Konami.",
            "Kojima has been posting a lot of MGS stuff on his socials lately. Hopefully this means a smoothing out of things. I do not want Kojima back to MGS fully but him giving any form of blessing or suggestions would be great.",
            "Negative benefit to him doing so when he's now in a position to own his work and get mega funding to make it. The last few entries he worked on really felt like bowties to the franchise after going back in time from MGS4's finale.",
            "This cut the rest of the phrases, saying that it's not very realistic and everyone has moved on, and he would like metal gear to be able to continues with the new team.",
            "Yeah, and it would have been a dream to let the creator of Suikoden come back.  And the good Castlevania teams to come back.  And the creator of Goemon to come back.  And the head of DDR to come back.  What's the common denominator in all these cases?  Oh right, Konami management forced them out and then blacklisted them...  It's like Disney stabbing all their creatives in the back, ruining their careers, then wondering why they won't return to make more content for them.",
            "Kojima is working on a new action stealth game. Going by his recent output, he clearly has different sensibilities now as a writer and designer. I think it's for the best that he starts with a new IP since, for the sake of both his creative freedom and preserving MGS' integrity (for better or worse).",
            "Honestly, would Kojima even want that? Does anyone else for that matter? Seems like a step back at this point. I get that Death Stranding isn't everyone's cup of tea, but it's very evident that there's new ideas brewing in that skull of his. I say let the man cook with some new ingredients."
