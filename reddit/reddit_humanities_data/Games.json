            "**final fantasy VII rebirth**. have put in some 20-30 hours into this since last i wrote one or two weeks ago, now reaching 60h total. this game started at a 7/10 the intro hours and have just grown and grown and grown on me, reaching one of my all time favorites. graphics were incredible from the start, cutscenes still blow me away. combat is a personal all-time favorite and still manages to grow. but what suprises me is the journey and characters - I can't remember the last time i was *this* invested in their fates and i'm uncertain how it will end.\n\nto try and boil down my current gameplay experience using analogies is this. take your favorite wild mix of fictional characters. jack sparrow, spider-man, kill bill protagonist and batman. now throw them into a bunch of varied adventures where you get to spend time with and get to know each and every one of them deeper. all the adventures have the same flair as everything, everywhere, all at once - as in that anything can pop up and it zooms from scary to humor to hitting the feels with *wild* props and it *works* because whoever made this knows that ridiculous settings doesn't stand in the way of earnest storytelling one bit - it just adds to it. oh and all of this is happening while you are marching towards a larger-than-life opponent that is being built up like thanos in infinity war.\n\nwith elden ring, i had to take a break for 2 weeks at ~40 hours. here I can't stop playing just as much as i don't want it to end. fucking love this game to bits",
            "**Assassin's Creed Odyssey**\n\nAssassin's Creed Odyssey is a game that does full justice to its name. You play as an assassin and hoo boy, is it certainly an odyssey.\n\nThe first part of that phrase might already have people rearing up. A common complaint of this game is that's not really an Assassin's Creed game. There's too much level-based combat and not enough sneaky killing. I can honestly say I have no clue whatsoever what these people are talking about. One of the most fun parts of my time with Odyssey was arriving at a fort because of a quest, and completely cleaning it out without getting spotted, to the point that I started trolling the remaining soldiers once there were only about five left with shooting arrows at them not to kill, but just to lead them to investigate so I could move around them and shoot arrows at them from another side. I will admit there are some enemies who can take getting backstabbed when they do not seem like it (especially cultists suffer from this), but in general I was never really disappointed at my inability to stealthily kill my enemies, be it with my spear or an arrow to the kn-head.\n\nCombat outside of stealth is a bit of a mixed bag. It certainly looks flashy and cool, but the actual mechanics just resolve into button-mashing and occasionally pressing the counter or dodge button to avoid taking damage, with most of the abilities just having you deal...more damage, rather than really adding a new dimension to the combat. There are some like that, like Shield Breaker which gets rid of enemy shields or the Spartan Kick, which can get enemies away from you (or off a cliff), but they're limited in quantity. The ability tree in general is one of the weaker points of Assassin's Creed Odyssey. Each of the 'classes' (Warrior, Assassin, Hunter) has their own skill tree, but you don't have that many slots in your quickmenu and a lot of the skills just aren't that interesting. It also takes a while for the game to give you anything else to spend your Ability Points on, so you're quickly left with level ups not particularly mattering.\n\nSo if level ups matter little, what other reason is there to fight? Loot maybe? Odyssey certainly provides an outrageous amount of loot but again very little of it actually worthwile. You'll know what treasure chests or enemies hold loot that is worth your attention, but what to do with the rest? You can sell it, but money only really matters if you want to upgrade your ship to the later levels as that gets expensive rather quickly. You don't need to buy equipment because you get it all for free. You can upgrade or engrave your equipment to give it special abilities, but those are generally cheap enough that you'll get by on quest rewards. You can disassemble them for crafting supplies which you'll certainly need for your ship or to make arrows. But generally, you'll be left with a lot of inventory management.\n\nThere are plenty of other gameplay elements to consider. One is the mercenary system; be a bad enough Alexios or Kassandra and soldiers will put a bounty on you, which will be pursued by mercenaries (misthios in the Ancient Greek world) who are capable warriors who can easily give you a run for your money. Aside from a few story beats, there's nothing really stopping you from just paying off your bounty however as the mercenaries as well will mostly be more trouble than they're worth. Beating mercenaries gives you a loot and lets you rise through the mercenary ranks, which gives a few benefits like discounts, the most interesting of these being cheaper ship crafting. There's also conquering battles. Each section of the Greek world is ruled by a certain leader who serves a faction (Greek or Spartan, as Odyssey takes place during the Peloponnesian War). Hassle these leaders enough by killing soldiers, burning crops, looting money and killing the leaders and you can unlock an all-out war where you can support either the defending or attacking side. These are all pretty much a chore, as you're just locked into battling a bunch of enemies on a timer which makes it more baffling that you have it do it several times in the main quest. And then there's ship battles. Once you have your ship, you are free to attack whoever you want; Spartans, Athenians, merchants, pirates. Pirates will always attack you if they see you. The ship battles are cool visually and there's definitely a sense of tension as you're never as in control as you are when it's just you in melee combat, but there's also a sense of basically spamming the attack button and then bracing yourself when the enemy goes in for an attack. There's a little more tactics as it's more viable and easy to isolate a ship (as pirates sail in packs) but it's not a huge strategic process.\n\nSo, why go through all this? Well, your main character (Kassandra or Alexios, your choice) goes through it because they are a misthios. After a few succesful missions on the base island of Kephallonia, they are recruited by a wealthy Athenian who wants them to kill a Spartan general on Megaris. You quickly find out this Spartan general is actually your father who threw you off a cliff when you were just a child. After proving yourself to the Spartans by doing several missions, you get to confront him. You deal with him and he tells you to find your mother, who also survived. But first you must head to Phokis to deal with the Athenian. After doing some missions where you confront the Oracle of Delphi, you find out an evil cult is manipulating the Ancient Greek world, and this cult has also raised and corrupted your sibling to fight for them. They head to Athens for more information, where they must first prove themselves to Perikles, the leader of Athens, by doing several missions. More information can be gained from speaking to a pirate queen, but she wants something in return for giving you this information, like money or help with several missions. I'm sure the pattern is quite visible at this point, and anyone who has already played the game knows I could go on for every single main story mission in this game. It is common that people want something in return if they give or do something for you, but Odyssey drives it to outrageous new heights. It would be one thing if these could be resolved in one mission, but there are always multiple things that must be accomplished before you are allowed to make progress.\n\nSo why do it as a player? Well, Assassin's Creed Odyssey is a great adventure. As much as I slagged off the combat, there is a certain satisfying element to it, whether you finally land the kill on an enemy in out-and-out combat or as you finally take down the last enemy in a camp or fort where nobody had any idea you were ever even there. It's fun to meet characters like Sokrates, and Greece is absolutely jaw-droppingly gorgeous. Athens is one of those cities where it is near impossible to not just stare mouth agape at the statues and building that fill the city-state. There are some NPCs that are just delightful to interact with, like Kyra, Daphnae, Phoibe, Marcos, Alkibiades, Barnabas,... And there are story elements that really hit home too. The reunion with the player's mother is a beautiful scene, where a lot of attention was put into little details, little emotions, little movements by the characters that really drive home a feeling of immersion.\n\nThe flaws do revolve around there just being too much of this game. Opening the world map for the first time will overwhelm you. Growing up with jRPGS, I was raised with the idea of always going the wrong path first before heading down progress. But what is the wrong path or the progress path here? Will the game lead me to all these different islands (it does, for the vast majority of them at least)? And then there's all the aforementioned gameplay elements, that certainly add flavour to the game but also feel incomplete, ideas that sprung up in a developer's mind but never got the time to really be refined into systems and proper parts of the game.\n\nShould you play Assassin's Creed Odyssey? Yes. Even just getting into Athens will provide a solid, exciting experience. In the worst case scenario, Odyssey can teach you a lesson: how to say no. It is really about deciding not to engage with certain elements of the game. Not taking on every quest; the game has a dialogue system. Kassandra or Alexios can perfectly be played to not do certain things for certain people (my Kassandra never did any of the alpha animal locations or Daughters of Artemis). It helps with the immersion, which can hit at any point. Near the end of the game, I was making my way over to a quest objective (on foot, as I dislike mounts in 95 % of games that have them), when I heard one of the passive NPC musicians playing my favourite sea shanty (The Lost Shield). I stopped, and listened.\nThe song was cut short when a soldier on horseback got confused with his pathing and ran into her, after which she composed herself but began another song. It's about running to another quest objective and stopping yourself because you realize, panning the camera to the right, that there is an exquisite view of whatever island you are currently on, and you just have to take a moment to take it all in...to imagine how people lived on this land, and what their hopes and dreams and fear were.\n\nAnd then realizing you only have half an hour of gametime left and you should probably finish that quest so you got something done. Live and learn.",
            "Just rolled credits on **Cyberpunk 2077** after about 75 hours. Did all possible side content + Phantom Liberty. \n\nIt\u2019s really one of the best games I\u2019ve ever played. I never bought it at release but with all the updates and the expansion, today in 2024 it\u2019s an incredible experience. The story and characters are so well done, and the world of Night City is the most compelling and immersive I\u2019ve come across since Skyrim. The gameplay is fun as hell. I went with a pretty generic Assault rifle build, but all the cyberware and upgrades, where I just slow down time, dash between targets with a katana as a supplementary, and melt people in 2-3 shots is just a blast. \n\nIt\u2019s top tier from a technical standpoint as well: The visuals on my PS5/OLED combo are jaw dropping. Voice acting and music are all fantastic. \n\nThe ending is a bit of a downer but it felt appropriate for the bleak, hopeless world CDPR presented. \n\nI have serious gaming hangover now and have no idea what\u2019s gonna scratch this itch.\n\nNext up on PS5 is **Baldurs Gate 3**. I\u2019ve never played this kind of game before so I\u2019m a little nervous but it seems to be beginner friendly from what I read\n\nOn Steam Deck I\u2019m about to start **Yakuza 0**. First experience with that series as well.",
            "I just want to say that I can't believe I've been sleeping on dwarf fortress for so long. This game is exactly what I've always\u00a0 wanted to play. Of course, the steam version's qol improvements helped me massively.\u00a0",
            "**Elden Ring**\n\nStarted a month ago with a fresh character in preparation of the DLC. Finally finished the game after failing to do so with my first character (mage) back from release. I am all set up with 100 of each smithing stone, 80 of each somber smithing stone. \n\nAfter that I went back to my first character and brought him up to speed. Finished Mohg to have access to the DLC, also finished the game while fully embracing jolly coop. will take him to lvl160 probably to have a night comet build with a good side of faith ready. Depending on how my week goes I might just start NG+ with him to get the magic scorpion charm. Apparently I finished Ranni's questline before Seluvis'. \n\nOverall I am pretty hyped for the DLC. Can't wait to dive in.",
            "**Elden Ring**\n\nSo I started my new guy about a month ago with the intent of doing more stuff \"in order\", hitting as many quests as I could, and being all ready for the DLC by release. I have successfully kept up with pretty much every questline I wanted to, but I am NOT close to being ready for the DLC. I didn't realize just how much stuff there is in this game if you treat questlines like they're part of the critical path! It's not just \"go here and talk to this guy\". You're completing large optional areas and killing a bunch of bosses. Fia and Ranni's quests are really tightly woven and touch on a ton of other NPC quests. I just did Sellen's and I had no idea it touched so many other NPCs in the game. Hitting all these feels like it turns Elden Ring's \"mysterious and lore based\" story into an overt and narrative one about different forces competing since the days of Merika to claim the Elden Throne and the future for themselves. And eventually you have to pick one to support from the throne.\n\nI decided to try building around the Executioner's Greatsword, and hitting stuff with the giga drill breaker feels *good*. I've added in enough faith for dragon miracles and I'm having a grand ol time smacking stuff around with these big-ass moves.\n\nHowever as far as game progress, I'm only at Mt. Gelmir. I've got to pick up the pace to be ready to play this DLC even vaguely close to release date.",
            "I got Immortals of Aveum via PS+ and I\u2019ve been playing that. It\u2019s decent but definitely not something I would have paid full price for. I\u2019m almost done with the main story but I\u2019m not interested enough to go back and get 100%\n\nAfter I\u2019m done I\u2019m going to start playing Elden Ring again so I can remember how everything works before Shadow of the Erdtree comes out on Friday.",
            "**Pumpkin Jack + Costume Quest**\n\nWas listening to the soundtrack of FF9 and Devils Ambition played. It really made me feel a Halloween vibe so I went to go play these. Man. We need more Halloween themed games.",
            "I've wrapped up **Ghostwire: Tokyo** and it was...good, pretty good in few moments. I think main issue with a game is it has a very small window where it all \"clicks\". At the start combat is a problem. Very repetitive and just boring, with lack of cool powers and variety of enemies. So it's, in short, a slog. You smack and smack same attack on same enemies until the dawn of time. Later on when game does pick it up, you unlock new powers and more enemies appear, problem lies within story. It's...boring. Somehow it doesn't even feel like an actual main story. Game has very, very few main quests that are very forgettable. and to extend the playtime it forces you to engage with open world activities like clearing out the map out of fog to reach another mission. Akito is an okay character, KK was not that bad but I still didn't feel their dynamic. They just..worked together and bam, at one point they are buddies. I however can admit ending is surprisingly emotional and that took me off guard in a good way. Best part of the game is open world, when you just say \"eh these main missions boring, time to explore\". Navigating empty streets and rooftops, getting more knowledge and just interracting with different creatues, enemies, learning about folklore, legends and all that in Japan setting that not often gets mentioned, it was really fun. Most of the side quests was also pretty solid! So yeah ultimately when game clicks, when you explore the streets, engage with enemies in different ways, it's damn good. But that window is very tight. Nonetheless I can recommend the game! \n\nAs for my Wasteland DC adventures in **Fallout 3**, level 25, now starting to wonder if I can legit 100 all skills, as I already got...Small Guns, Speech, Medicine, Lockpick, Repair, Science and Barter on 100, with Energy Guns on 90. Rocking so many weapons I have no idea what to use. Unique Combat Shotty here, Unique Plasma Rifle there, still having a blast but no enemies are a danger anymore. Cleared out...I would say 70% of the map. Whole southwest is done, DC has only few chunks left that I have to reach by Metro stations, now I'm at Republic of Dave, along the way I wrapped up Nuka Cola quest, Tempenny Tower quest, the one with Superheroes, and slaves. So now I get a key from Dave to finish Heads quest, afterwards move towards Vault 92 to get Agatha's Quest done.",
            "**Megaman IV** (Gameboy NSO)\n\n\nNot really a ton to say about these games. I like when Megaman games allow you to explore the stages using Robot Master weapons, so Napalm Man's stage was really cool. This game feels real easy until suddenly in Wily's Castle, it isn't, so I didn't quite finish it this week.\n\n\n\n**Mario & Rabbids: Kingdom Battle** (Switch)\n\n\nI love this XCOM-lite, and have been meaning to try and finish it for years. I feel each world is going on just a tad too long, but thanks to the glut of coins you get for doing a good job, I've been unlocking new weapons at a good clip.\n\n\nAll of the weapon effects feel quite basic but effective, and unlike regular XCOM I don't feel particularly robbed when an effect doesn't proc, or a shot misses, what with probabilities being 100, 50, or 0%. The main draw here is how fluid it all feels to control, and the movement is incredible. It's been unendingly rewarding to slide tackle a small chain of rabbids, and set up a team mate to help boost jump me onto an enemy's head that's on higher ground, setting up a powered-up high ground shot, seeing the bounce effect proc and that triggering another team mate to reflex shot as the enemy flies past them. This might be my favourite Ubisoft game since AC Brotherhood.\n\n\n\n**Final Fantasy XI** (PC)\n\n\nStill playing this but have been slower this week - it feels like even the early game has a fair bit of grind, and I got to a point where I picked up a main quest I now can't progress past without starting a party or completing a quest that opens up another route into the area that would otherwise require a party of real players.\n\n\nHowever in order to unlock that side quest, I need to raise my fame in my city to the highest rank (that actually unlocks anything), to do which I need to do side quests in another city that is not advertised without the wiki, and those side quests look like they're all real life time gated...? I know I could literally just look for 2 other players to help me out for like, 5 minutes, which I'm starting to lean toward. An insanely obtuse game, but I'm still enjoying the story enough, or more to the point intrigued about the story to come, to carry on.\n\n\n\nI've unlocked another couple of jobs - Ranger and Paladin so far. I've levelled Ranger a little and enjoyed it, but just whilst trying to beat my way past through the main story I went back to BLM/RDM as my main/support combo. Will try to unlock some more and mess around with them, but I'm really just waiting for Blue Mage to become available. I don't expect to play a lot of this next week due to doing a lot of travelling."

We have a lot of experience with educational games and advergames but now we want to start to develop our community of entertainment games.\n\nWe have some experience with the consoles because one of our clients for Advergames wanted a really cool game, called\u00a0[Wardogs: Red's Return](https://mitogames.com.br/wardogsredsreturn), which was initially designed for mobiles but grew to be a full PC/Console game at the end, ported and published by Qubyte (this will probably come back for the questions too hehe since this initial design had an impact on our possibilities for the original game and later for Willy's..).\n\nThat led us to an unexpected opportunity, as we were working on a DLC for the game Wardogs, we were invited to make a simpler version of the game for the Willy's Wonderland franchise. Of course, there were a lot of limits and constraints that I will discuss during the AMA, but it was a good opportunity for us to be a bit more known since we are just starting in the entertainment area and also a possible occasion to pay tribute to a movie we all had a lot of fun watching.\n\nI hope the fans of the movie, understanding the conditions we had to make the game will appreciate it a bit, and who knows in the future we can make a bigger, original game with all the characters in there too? \\^\\^\n\nI work mainly with clients and team management, but I am changing more into a PR role now that we are migrating to the entertainment realm, so I am learning how to do it and Reddit is an amazing tool to help smaller studios like ours.

Not every game needs romance but I\u2019m more interested in RPG stories that include it personally. \n\nAs someone with a partner I do everything with in real life it helps me feel immersed to have a world where my character can find a semblance of that as well. It also builds on the story for me, heightening the sense of drama and danger. Commander Shepard sacrificing himself to save humanity is triumphant. Him doing it and sacrificing his love of Tali turns the triumph bittersweet. Even if the romance is basic it still is something that I can - for lack of a better term - headcanon my story around to make the big moments feel more personal. \n\nI know that\u2019s not for everyone, but it\u2019s definitely going to put this lower on my list.",
            "Rip... I really like the pillars universe. But more and more i see of avowed im losing interest. \n\nFirst person only(nvm does have third person now!), iffy looking combat, removal of class system, and no romance... \nJust makes me feel like this is gonna be another outer worlds. Interesting idea, but mediocre. \n\nPeople keep banking 100% on obsidians ability for quest design and story telling, but Outer Worlds left me with little faith. Companions were dull, and the plot felt half baked. \n\nNot everyone might be into romances, but they can add so much to the development of a character and the forming of relationships for the world and player within that world.\n\nGuess we shall see",
            "Video game romances are shallow by nature. It always feels super hollow because you can\u2019t really encapsulate that emotion very well through player choice. It ends up being a character acting exactly the same with added fluff dialogue about how they love you. The best video game romances are just like the best romances in any other mediums: a product of good writing. Mostly they seem like an afterthought so I won\u2019t mourn this.\n\nI will go against the grain and say all they had to say was \u201cOuter Worlds but fantasy\u201d because I loved that game and I seem to be the outlier here on that\n\nEdit: should also add it\u2019s often hard to have compelling chemistry when one of the people is a text box, then you\u2019re really relying on the writing.",
            "Oof almost immediately if outer worlds is a good comparison im not hopeful. If skyrim was the depth of a puddle and the scope of an ocean then outer worlds was just a puddle. I really hope it's a bad comparison.",
            "I'm going to go against the grain of this thread and say that no romance is just another hit against this game in a long list of \"This isn't going to be included,\" \"don't expect this,\" etc. \n\nI already think the Pillars universe is bland and boring, and moving it to first person isn't going to get me excited.",
            "I am absolutely in favor of this. I could write a treatise on how much I resent romance in modern gaming. I'll try and trim it down to the primary talking points, happy to discuss in detail with anyone though.\n\n1. I don't like that romance is treated like the reward for talking to/befriending a companion. I spoke to the companion because I liked their character, not because I was wanting Wyll to essentially beg me to fuck them.\n2. I don't like that so many characters in RPGs these days are essentially waiting around for my character to express an interest in them before they'll melt in my hand. I could create a neon green shrek with purple hair that is extremely rude to them and everyone in existence, but if I hit the generally correct dialogue options, anyone and everyone will fall in love with me.\n3. Most importantly, I don't like that the strong emphasis on variety means that each romance is quite dead end. I don't really engage with Stardew Valley romance for this reason. BG3 handled this better than most, but I still think it could have been better.\n\nIf a game wanted to have an interesting romance option with chemistry and strong writing, I would much rather play through that than essentially repeating Kuzco being like, \"no, hate your hair, no, no. Is this the best you could do?\""

We can't comment on the **deals made by our partners with other platform holders**, but we remain focused on making Xbox the best platform for gamers, and great games are at the center of that.\"\n\nAre they insinuating that this is due to a deal made by another platform holder?",
            "If there was an exclusivity deal, we\u2019d know about it. Sony would be screaming about it during every marketing event. There clearly isn\u2019t.",
            "Didn\u2019t the devs literally say there was no deal with Sony.  It was just a matter of prioritization.   I don\u2019t think anyone would lie about it.  Especially with how much attention exclusively deals got by regulators.  Ryan Mccarfy at IGN ran a story about this but pulled it when the dev directly denied it.\n\nSony has not even shown this game at their state of play streams.  Sony isn\u2019t shy when it makes a deal with a game.  They are the only console maker that puts exclusivity periods in their trailers  \n\nIt\u2019s no secret Xbox ports take extra work this gen.   Combined with simple market realities of where Xbox is right now it\u2019s easy to see how a dev with no pre existing deals on place would leave them until last.\n\n\nNot sure why Xbox would lie like this.   It makes a developer partners job harder and makes Xbox look desperate.\n\nThen again could just be Jez causing drama.  Wouldnt be the first time.",
            "Seems like another situation where the weaker Series Box is forcing a delay. \n\nAnd Microsoft's PR is trying to spin it as PlayStations fault.",
            "Has Jez provided proof of specifically what questions he asked that prompted the response? Without that this just seems like the guy successfully baited Microsoft into a response that would be spicy without exact context and people are eating it up. Jez reporting is like 2000-2010 celebrity gossip bloggers spinning anything they can to cause uproar until the teen idol would go a bit crazy by the time they were like 25",
            "I stand by the information that PlayStation DID NOT pay for timed exclusivity on Black Myth Wukong.  If they did, they would be bragging about it like with Stellar Blade, FF16, FF7 rebirth, Ghostwire Tokyo, Deathloop, and I could continue. PS likes to show off when they pay for things.  IF this article said \u201cblack Myth Wukong is coming to our platforms later due to a deal made with other platforms\u201d then that would be a much different scenario.",
            "It has to be due to the S and we simply cannot trust Microsoft at their word for this. If there was an exclusivity deal for Sony then they would shout it from the fucking mountain top. It may also have to be because outside of NA the ecosystem of Xbox is already 6 feet deep and a port isn\u2019t seen as a priority monetarily to them. The S sells, no doubt, but they dug their grave when they decided to do two separate consoles instead of a digital only X for $100 off MSRP.",
            "[removed]",
            "If I had to guess its a xbox X and S issue. We know other devs have had issues with it. MS demands that you do the same things on their older hardware as their new hardware.",

            "Did they ever use it for anything beyond that 1 concept game? NVIDIA and Ubisoft are building that package which will probably be cool then quickly get overused. Neil druckman said he\u2019d like to use it at naughty dog but generally I think LLMs have a very small role to play in the next 2-3 years in games. Maybe 5 years out from them being useful and 10-15 from them really taking over gaming and nano models being  integrated into the game directly",
            "The \"fear mongering\" was less about the potential of genAI and more about the damage companies would do to themselves and, more importantly to their workers in trying to chase that trend.",
            "It seems to be settling into the role it always should have been in; an assistant instead of a replacement. \n\nIn my workplace we use it exclusively for handling menial programming tasks and image correction (instead of image creation). And it works really well in this position, even if it still fucks up constantly in this limited capacity.",
            "so it's just like how every big player tried to integrate NFTs and blockchain into their games for like half a year saying it's the future of gaming, and then everyone completely stopped talking about it once it turned out crap?",
            ">I think they just realized that gen AI isn't nearly as good as all the hype and fearmongers would make you believe it is.\n\nYet. But just look at how much LLMs have grown in the past 2 years alone in terms of ability. 2 years ago the best AI could do was write a strangely worded story or generate a blob that vaguely resembles the prompt. Today you can generate an entire song from a prompt and generate realistic video. It's led to a tech boom the likes of which have never been seen in a long time. Nvidia is literally the most valuable company on earth right now, beyond even Apple and Microsoft, because of how much investment is going into developing AI tech.\n\nWith AAA development costs being what they are, it's absolutely going to play a major role in game dev to save costs. If I was a voice actor I'd be really scared for my job security right now as that'll probably be the first job to get hit, given how expensive voice acting is these days.",
