            "According to top Numismatist/Author Frederick J. Barts book on Paper Money Errors he gives a R-4 for a Minor Cutting Error, R-5 for a Medium Cutting Error and R-6/7 for a Major Cutting Error. The Rarity Scale goes from R-1 to R-9 with R-9 being the rarest of Errors.\n\nIf you would like to send photos to his website for his evaluation here is the website : [Homepage | Executive Currency](https://www.executivecurrency.com/)\n\nIf you do this let us know the results in a follow up post.\n\nYour notes location is I5 on a 50 subject sheet. Check it out here : [Imgur: The magic of the Internet](https://imgur.com/a/BEDTGwa) \n\nPost this in r/uspapermoney and r/Bankstraphunting so that they can see this too.",

            "That\u2019s a butterfly error. Price depends on the buyer!\nETA: prices in general for any errors are subjective to the perception of the value one places on it, to be willing to pay, before someone can appropriately appraise it. It\u2019s crisp but not preserved with a grade. If there\u2019s an issue finding middle ground between buyer and seller the green sheet can guide them in the right direction but if you can\u2019t find someone really excited about it, in a niche market such as this, was the value really there or is it a neat (but priceless) conversation piece.\n\nSorry I didn\u2019t elaborate on that further earlier..",
            "Super awesome and definitely worth a premium. Errors on modern notes are supposed to be really rare since they are visually checked by computers these days. I would get expert advice to determine value.",
