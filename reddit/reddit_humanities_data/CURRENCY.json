            "Super awesome and definitely worth a premium. Errors on modern notes are supposed to be really rare since they are visually checked by computers these days. I would get expert advice to determine value.",
            "YES!!!!! Its acceptable to fold that in the sleeve.",

            "This is a fantastic miscut.  Ive never seen one like this irl, or heard of one like this in modern currency",
            "Yes that is a valuable fold over error. It should be authenticated and graded.",
            "Ive been preparing for a market I never even knew about. Now, how much longer do I sit on my misprints is what makes it a gamble",

            "They're already printed in denominations like 20, 50, no need to print over anything. It just takes a salesclerk who isn't looking at the bills and noticing the bright pink and white.",
            "These and other prop money were going around Seattle area pretty heavily about 5-6 years ago. I actually found a 50$ with those characters on it, a washed 1$ that had one side as a 100$ and the other side a faded 1$, and 100$ bill on cheap paper but very good looking other than for motion picture use only written on the face, all on the ground around Tacoma in About a years time. Upon researching I found the motion picture money for sale on Amazon, the 1$/100 was a super bill made by counterfeiters, and the Chinese characters 50$ was found only on random police department statements/evidence on their websites/pages and they were trying to gather information on them still at that time."
