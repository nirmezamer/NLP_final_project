            "Been looking at purchasing a Bambu for a while. Finally decided to pull the trigger yesterday. Went into the website last night and saw the sale. Had my cart built and checked out as soon as the promo prices went live. I'm very excited.",
            "In for an A1 mini, will be perfect for when my P1S is busy",

            "Remember Bambulabs has a big event later this month where they will likely roll out the next line of printers and the sale will be going for a full month. \n\nDon't jump on these \"deals\" just yet, wait until after the event/announcement as the sale will still be going and then decide.  No one wants to buy a last gen printer days before the next gen releases!",
            "Bought the P1S combo! Good bye Ender 3 Neo. Anyone add recommendations for someone new to Bambu?",
            "I really wanted the ams to go 250. so it will be 300 (hub + ams)\n\nFor 350 I'm not sure I'll take the bait really :(",
            "Even though I have survived -and could survive - without the AMS for my P1S, I just pulled the trigger since it's the first time it's ever been on sale.   My printer is 2 floors below my office, so I'm just trying to save some time not having to run up and down the stairs.  I'll be putting it next to the printer, as I don't have enough clearance to put it on top.",
            "Also worth noting microcenter has the sale prices aswell"

            "I told someone I used to have to watch my other printers to make sure they put down a good first layer, and to periodically check on them to make sure the prints aren't bad.\n\nNow I watch my P1S and A1 Mini because its amazing how easy the first layer goes down and how much faster they are.",
            "I built my first 3D printer over 12 years ago.  From the first time it printed something I always found it fascinating to watch.  It took a lot of interaction to successfully print things, and the first layer was always dicey.\n\nBut it's like watching a campfire, somehow.  It's just mesmerizing.  My new X1C prints so reliably it doesn't need much monitoring, but I love the onboard camera and watching it with my cell phone!  What amazing technology today.",

I find myself just sitting in front of my printer and forgetting all the tasks I need to do until a random sound in my house reminds me of the outside world lol."
