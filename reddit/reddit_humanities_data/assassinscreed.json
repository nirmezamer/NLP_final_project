            "Looks infinitely better as Naoe",
            "that grapple climb was slick af",
            "Naoes gameplay > Yasukes gameplay so far",
            "Definitely looks like there is some sort of armour system present, with attacks taking off armour to leave enemies vulnerable.  Interesting.",
            "From the trailer yesterday they seemed to have improved the animations significantly. Way more smooth and sleek. Hopefully we see more parkour in this showcase.",
            "Oyeah, definitely gonna play as Naoe 90% of the time.",
            "I can pet a Shibe. All worries settled, game of the year",
            "I like that they got the point across of Yasuke being huge. He stands taller than most of the other NPCs he walked by, and his attacks are - by definition - heavier than Naoe's (sp).",
            "REALLY liked she didn't pull the dead guy through the paper door.\nIt was very realistic - Ghost of Tsushima was going for a Kurosawa vibe so it worked for it, but not this.",
            "Naoe (sp?) 's transversal is really well animated, but I wonder if Yasuke can do the same stuff?"

            "Stealth as naoe looks like its gonna be incredible not struck on combat but the stealth movement looks great",
            "Look at all the people looking at Yasuke",
            "I gotta say, I really love the stealth gameplay for Naoe, they definitely got inspiration from Splinter Cell. I didn't really care for the Yasuke gameplay, feels the same as the other RPG titles.",
            "the combat is looking a bit slow and floaty, but i absolutely love how the armor gets broken in real time during the combat. over all it is still a huge improvement over the previous games. the stealth however looks very engaging and well done. the game world is very beautiful as well.",
            "Voice acting has something weird on it? It's off putting",
            "Yasukes combat looks meh,but naoe looks great",
            "I personally think it looked great. I'll play it for 100+ hours like I did with the others.",
            "Anyone else notice the nods to Tenchu?\n\nThe little boy named Rikimaru and the breathing through the reed under water.",
            "My only wish for a current gen AC was decent facial animations and more natural conversations with quest-givers, yet they are still as stiff as ever"

        "content": "Food for retrospective thought, but Instead of releasing two games in the same release window and undercutting both, they should've in a way merged both game concepts. \n\nRogue had a unique story idea (even though the execution was half assed since the game is a side project) and a rehashed setting.\nUnity has a fantastic setting that people still go back to but has a lame ass story about a stepsister simp. \n\nHave the Revolutionary Paris setting, but what if we played as an Assassin who defected to the Templars while seeing the horrors of the French revolution, (we even play a Templar in the beginning) and maybe this version of Arno even goes on to establish the Black Cross or something. That would've been cool and novel. ",

            "Sorry but I do this with every post\n\n*ROGUE",
            "i like this idea\n\nwould you keep arnos adopted father being assassinated by other templars, assassins, or use the accidentally caused a natural disaster as a motivation for this one?",
            "Honestly I dig this idea, as much as I love the concept of Shay I think turning Arno into that would've been cool, and instead of converting him in a cheapish way like they did with Rogue they make it meaningful with some deep storytelling and rich character development.",
            "considering how poorly the brotherhood is depicted in the game, I think it would ultimately benefit the game, yes",
            "I like what we got, but Rogue should definitely have gotten more development attention.\nNew York was under used, and there were some odd level designs(the Finnigans house looked like it was ripped straight out of a PS1 game).",
            "I have a dream: a videogame where Arno hunts for Shay.",
            "He wouldn't have an adopted father, I just find that plot point convoluted to let Elise in, since he already has one unavenged father. I would make it so that he is born into the Assassin Order, like Altair, and defects because of the horrors he sees or things he disagrees with but others in his circle doesn't, not unlike Shay (even though Shay wasn't born into the order)",
            "Yes, Rogue can't seem to decide whether the Templars have a point or not. Assassins run Templar like camps but Shay can also kill civilians. A lot of it doesn't make sense. Assassins are anarchists (in the classical sense) who take laws into their own hands and kill people that they politically disagree with, regardless of whether it breaks down the social order or not and justify it with \"MuH fReEdOM'. There are many ways to make them seem like the bad guys that doesn't have them turning into Wallmart Templars",
            "Hindsight and all, but there was a number of factors that would make that possibility hard to happen.  \n  \nThe cross-gen debate: Money was still on the table for the last generation in 2014 and Ubi (alongside others) was hungry for it. At the very least, one might have convinced them to release Rogue in 2014 and Unity in 2015 (which also would delay Syndicate 2016, etc).\n\nEither that, or decide from the start that Unity would be a cross-gen game, which would really impact the project (for better or worse). Their yearly ambition only stopped after Unity's launch and Syndicate's dissapoining sales in the aftermath.\n\n  \n----\n\n\n\nThe Soft Reboot: From top to bottom, Unity was being made with the intention to be a fresh start. The creative director at one point even wanted it to be called \"Assassin's Creed\". The compromise was dropping the V from it.\n\nAdding to the above, Unity's original pitch involved 4 protagonists in 4 time periods (as you imagine, the Helix Rifts were the survivors of this ambitious plan). So... a Templar might have fitted that first concept, but not what they settled on.\n\n\n\n----\n\n  \nThe Rogue aspect: Shay being an Assassin traitor was a matter of necessity, development-wise Considering the project's limitation, Sofia would not have time to flesh out a pure Templar gameplay (the examples mentioned were no parkour and manipulation of crowds).\n\nWith that in mind, if Unity somehow had Rogue's concept, its extra time and position as a mainline entry could have changed the above.\n\n\\[...\\]\n\nSome of the information provided above was mainly taken from the 15th Anniversary Making-Of book.",
            "Yeah I hate that idea.\n\nUnity is about the love and passion of a nation. \n\nEverything about it is about love, the city the people the relationships.\n\nIt loses that without a tragic loss.\n\nId of rathered Elise be more involved and let it become a true Romeo and Juliet scenerio where Arno abandons the creed and they are hunted by Templar and Assassin alike and mask the war amongst the revolution."

            "Remember the stealth system in Black Flag in which you had to tail a ship, and you had to try to stay hidden behind it as it turned? That is always tense for me, especially if the mission constraint says for you not to get detected. It'd be nice if they could improve that in some way.",
            "Its so wild how that is the end product of years of development when they had Black Flag to build off of and somehow were supposed to be confident they can do better?\n\nI think sometimes people point to the different studios too much to dismiss overall executive incompetence. They dont have different boards and theres only one Yves, all the bad decisions come from most of the same people regardless of which studio is doing whatever game in question",
            ">simply upgrade the og game instead of \"reinventing\" it.\n\n*Lists a number of features that lean closer to a reinvention of the original.*\n\nJokes aside, remakes certainly have a scale with two extremes at each side: from faithful to re-imagination. Without precedence, we can only guess where Black Flag and the others will fall.\n\nConsidering Singapores work done in S&B, an expansion of ship combat and customization seems safe to expect. The big question marks from me tends to be the rest of the game. Will the animation-based combat return? What about the replay feature and optional objetives? Will they change the many tailing missions? Etc...\n\nThere is enough work there to reproduce the original before thinking on additions."
