            "Looks infinitely better as Naoe",
            "that grapple climb was slick af",
            "Naoe\u2019s gameplay > Yasuke\u2019s gameplay so far",
            "Definitely looks like there is some sort of armour system present, with attacks taking off armour to leave enemies vulnerable.  Interesting.",
            "From the trailer yesterday they seemed to have improved the animations significantly. Way more smooth and sleek. Hopefully we see more parkour in this showcase.",
            "Oyeah, definitely gonna play as Naoe 90% of the time.",
            "I like Yasuke's design. There's a gentle giant vibe unlike many of the other protagonists.\n\nThe combat looks tighter than other games in the series. \n\nLove the lighting and environmental storytelling (the fight spilling a bucket of oranges, ect.)\n\nThe light off the lamellar armor is great.",
            "I can pet a Shibe. All worries settled, game of the year",
            "I like that they got the point across of Yasuke being huge. He stands taller than most of the other NPCs he walked by, and his attacks are - by definition - heavier than Naoe's (sp).",
            "REALLY liked she didn't pull the dead guy through the paper door.\nIt was very realistic - Ghost of Tsushima was going for a Kurosawa vibe so it worked for it, but not this."

            "Prone crawl, kusarigama assassinations and combat, putting out lamps, knockouts are back, ceiling grapples, and the breathing pipe under the water.\n\nVery niceeeeeeeeeeeeee.",
            "Stealth as naoe looks like it\u2019s gonna be incredible not struck on combat but the stealth movement looks great",
            "Look at all the people looking at Yasuke",
            "Not gonna lie looks great and an improvement on Valhalla. Facial animations in dialogue scene seem to be an improvement over Odyssey and Valhalla. Also I\u2019m not too worried about the voice acting for now since most of the dialogue in this AC gameplay walkthroughs aren\u2019t that good (Bayek wasn\u2019t impressive in the Origins walkthrough either).\n\nEdit: also I really think Ubisoft should start considering 4k livestream or something with a higher bit rate because the stream TANKED when Shadows showed up.\n\nEdit: also also weird how they didn\u2019t showcase gear or loot",
            "I gotta say, I really love the stealth gameplay for Naoe, they definitely got inspiration from Splinter Cell. I didn't really care for the Yasuke gameplay, feels the same as the other RPG titles.",
            "the combat is looking a bit slow and floaty, but i absolutely love how the armor gets broken in real time during the combat. over all it is still a huge improvement over the previous games. the stealth however looks very engaging and well done. the game world is very beautiful as well.",
            "Yasuke blasting the armor off of dudes with the Kanabo was sick.\n\nThe Kusarigama is gonna be so fun.\n\nNon-lethal takedowns, hell yeah. Going fully prone, wild. Using the actual shadows for stealth, about time.\n\nVery cool showcase.",
            "Voice acting has something weird on it? It's off putting",
            "Yasukes combat looks meh,but naoe looks great",
            "I personally think it looked great. I'll play it for 100+ hours like I did with the others."

        "content": "so now that it\u2019s been officially confirmed by ubisoft ceo that there are multiple assassins creed remakes in the works, i wanted to discuss some leaks on twitter from fumoleaksmk1. a lot of the big ac and generally big gaming accounts seem to trust the guy because he\u2019s one of those \u201ci\u2019m a guy who knows a guy\u201d\ud83d\ude02 anyhow, he claims that an insider confirmed there will be remakes for AC1, AC2, as well as AC4. he said that it wasn\u2019t a hard no for an AC3 remake, but it\u2019s just not in the works. what are everyone\u2019s thoughts? to me, it\u2019s clear that ac1 deserves a remake the most. ac2 does too. but black flag? really? that game holds up so well. it deserves a remaster, but a remake seems overkill. i worry that ubisoft is gonna ruin what\u2019s already so good, but i suppose that could be said for ac1 and 2 as well. i hope ubisoft takes care with our beloved games\ud83d\ude14but exciting news, nonetheless! EDIT:  for those confused, a REMASTER is an improvement in the visuals of a game without interfering with its other aspects. a *REMAKE* is a redesign of a game while retaining its key characters, and story elements. the latter is what\u2019s been confirmed by the ubisoft ceo, and an inside source confirms black flag and most likely ac1 and 2 will receive the remake.",

            "AC1 Remake: Yes! That game definitely needs an update\n\nAC2 Remake: Totally but it has to be the complete Ezio saga, not just AC2\n\nAC4: Could be a great opportunity to fix the moder day sections\n\nIf they are remaking Black Flag I would love it if they made a Rogue remake so they can expand the story a bit more and make the game feel like you're playing as a Templar more instead of just an assassin",
            "Doesn\u2019t make much sense from a gameplay / plot perspective. Because as far as arch goes, it\u2019s:\n\n1 all the way to revelations\n\n3 all the way to 4\n\nBut for a commercial stand point, this is the best decision. \n\n1 needs a remake, and this can also bring in new players.\n\n2 has the most successful protagonist, it\u2019s easy money.\n\n4 is the most acclaimed, even outside the AC Fandom.",
            "IDK if i'm being too hopeful but MAYBE, just MAYBE, the production of AC Mirage with the whole Middle Eastern Setting was something tought to \"pave the way\" for an AC1 remake. We know that ubisoft likes to re-use sprites and models, so they already have some models for \"arab buildings\" with current-gen graphics ready to use.",
            "The 4 remake was leaked last year, and is being done in part to make use of the assets built for Skull and Bones which was a financial disaster. I would expect Bordeaux to be developing the AC1 remake, and would hope that Montreal would be given the AC2 remake for after Hexe, but I think a smaller studio doing it is more likely.",
            "As far as a potential AC1 remake goes, I seriously hope they'll include Bloodlines in it. It was an incredible title for the PSP and I think the story in it deserves more attention.  \nAlta\u00efr's Chronicles on the other hand is kind of at odds with the plot of AC1, because Alta\u00efr already fights Templars on both sides of the Crusade in it, but then is surprised when that same thing happens again in AC1, so it would need some serious changes to be included. I wouldn't miss it too much, but maybe they can consider it for DLC. \n \nFor AC2, I think they definitely should redo the whole Ezio trilogy at once instead of just the one game, with Revelations being a Season Pass offering perhaps. Being able to go back to Florence or Venice with mechanics introduced in Brotherhood would be fantastic.\n\nAC4 could do with some improved Modern Day, though I think they still need John Standish in it somehow. Very curious to see how they'll handle the MD in general, seeing how intertwined it was with the historical sections, in particular for the Ezio trilogy.\n\nMy biggest concern however is the parkour. We need that depth of mechanics back!",
            "Hopefully to God it\u2019s actual remakes built from the ground up RE2/3/4 style and not misusing the world remake when they mean remaster",
            "Black Flag kind of makes sense if they can rework Kenway's Fleet to be a fixed part of the game and not reliant on whether servers feel like working. The amount of posts I see here saying Kenway's Fleet isn't working is... well, not all the time, but often enough that it needs to be fixed.\n\nAC II and Brotherhood would be good purely for reinserting the lost DLC like Auditore's Tomb.\n\nAC III already had a release with various \"improvements.\" Why do another one?",
            "I'm very conflicted about what I want in a remake of AC1\n\nPart of me wants the gameplay to be preserved and almost identical, with just more story and variety in preparation quests. Part of me wants all the tools Mirage introduced and Shadows will.\n\nEither way, I hope the original is included when purchasing the remake, AC1 is already overlooked compared to the rest of the series, I'd hate for it to be overshadowed by its own remake",
            "Combining 2 and brotherhood into one game and releasing revelations as a paid expansion would be a decent idea to cover that arc well",
            "AC1 needs a remake desperately. The original game can't even be played on current/last gen consoles, not to mention that it has aged horribly. There is also the 20th anniversary coming up in 2027 so a remake release in that year (or at the very least an announcement) would be a no brainer."

        "content": "I've just completed all of Origins and Odyssey for the first time and have started Valhalla.\n\nI got a decent way into it when it launched but fell off a little after that one big story arc opens up (you know the one).\n\nIm about 7 hours and it's definitely feeling like a slow start. I've made my first alliance and am about to level my settlement to 3. \n\nI wanna know, from those who found enjoyment from this title, what do you think the game did right? Please get granular, without dropping major major spoilers.\n\nHow does the overarching narrative play out in regards to fulfilling the viking fantasy and our connection to Eivor as a character? How does the Hidden Ones and Order member hunting pay off? Did you like where they took the Isu storylines in terms of what's presented either in modern day or through simulations? How is the DLC? (I atleast know about the crossover content and am excited for that to come) Compare these to how well Origins and Odyssey did these things. Did you find them to advance the overall narrative in a compelling way? Did you feel excited for what comes next? What's the best order to complete in terms of the major base game arcs into DLC? Does ragnarok even connect?\n\nMost reviews ive found barely touch on story, mostly just fueling the negative narratives that were the fad at the time or just focus too much on the mechanics of the game, so interested to see the global sentiment of all these things.\n\nAnd please go somewhere else if you're just gonna comment something like \"not my AC\" or whatever.\n\nEDIT: Wow, was not expecting this much engagement. Thank you all who gave their perspectives and level headed takes. I'm now settlement level 4 and finishing up east anglia but did Luden before. Got 4 codex pages too cause yal got me hyped on the assassins lore. Combats already feeling much better now that i got a sword and some abilities and finally a predator bow. Very excited to see how the story unfolds, especially the modern stuff. Holding off on going to the seers hut for a bit, cause that took the window out of my sails doing it way too early on on my first attempt.",

            "I think the combat was a big improvement over the health sponge pit of odyssey. Your attacks have weight and the different weapons all feel pretty good. \n\nIts very pretty. \n\nThere's a return to social stealth in the distrust zones or whatever they're called. \n\nEivor is a good character, with depth and personal struggles. \n\nThe side stories aren't perfect, but I do find that there being fewer of them makes them more interesting.",
            "Man I have to really think about that. Graphically it is a gorgeous game, and I love the OST. Also male Eivor has a soothing voice.",
            "The relationship between Nords and Saxons. It wasn't as black and white as it seemed, as in purely confrontational.\n\nSome interesting developments in the modern day.\n\nAnd Basim.\n\nEdit: Valhalla made some very good connections between a lot of ACs, we had easter eggs for Dead Kings, AC3, Odyssey, the Roman Bureaus. Even tho it's not an assassin game, it's very much set in the AC universe. It's a decent spinoff.",
            "The environments and atmosphere in this game are fantastic.",
            "The combat was excellent. Ravensthorpe was also really nice.",
            "I started playing it again recently and I'm having a lot more fun second time round. They definitely tried to pack a LOT in so there's a shit load to be doing, but it feels disjointed and confusing at times, but Eivor is a great character and it's enjoyable working toward building your settlement. The choices you make feel like they have weight in the story (even if they are only for a short time), which I didn't really get that feeling in the other games.",
            "I feel that Valhalla is a good 'Viking game' but a poor 'Assassin game'. I enjoyed doing everything viking related, including building up relations, raiding and improving my settlement. I also enjoyed playing around with the different sets of gear.\n\nBut I felt detached from everything Assassin related. Anything related to the hidden ones felt just like a side quest.\n\nMost of the time, stealth felt unnecessary or out of character with Eivor.\n\nAlso, my personal opinion is that a lot of the mythical/magical content felt out of place.",
            "music.\n\nmale eivor voice.\n\neivor's inner dialogues.\n\noutcome of main plotline.",
            "It greatly expanded the Isu lore and had the best modern day since 3. It told a compelling story, thought it was burried under a lot of filler and had fun game play",
            "In my opinion, the combat is the best it's been under the current team. The weapon categories all feel distinct, and the skill system is as varied as Odyssey's without making Eivor feel like a Dark Ages superhero. Gear, in general, has been simplified. Instead of constantly finding new weapons and armor to break down, you find unique items to upgrade as you wish. Combined with the skill...starfield(?)...you can tailor your playstyle for much of the game.\n\nThat said, play long enough and you'll unlock practically everything.\n\nThe architecture is all over the place, littered with Christian spires that didn't exist for almost another 500 years. It doesn't look how it historically should, and that's a downside. The last two were closer to their real-world counterparts, at least as far as historians are concerned, and this is a stark departure. I would have preferred a later period, but that wouldn't play as well with the Norse idea they had in mind. Ultimately, I begrudgingly accept their stylistic choices. It just isn't Assassin's Creed without tall stuff from which to Eagle Dive into hay.\n\nLastly is the storytelling itself. Just like how Odyssey emulated Greek epic poems (Homer's Odyssey, in particular), Valhalla takes a cue from the Sagas. Each region is largely self-contained and has more of a \"Well, *that* just happened\" vibe. Which is fine; that's what Saga means. There are buildups with payoffs, and this is still a deeply personal story about family and betrayal.\n\nI was not disappointed, but YMMV."
