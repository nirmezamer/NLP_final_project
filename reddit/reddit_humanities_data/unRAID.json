As u/Solverz said: [semantic versioning ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-semantic-versioning/)structures updates as Major.Minor.Patch.\n\n  \nMajor updates are for breaking changes. Minor updates are for new features/changes that are backwards compatible. And patches are for fixes and stuff that is also backwards compatible with that major version.\n\n  \nSo appropriately this is a *patch* update which should have the lowest \"risk\" of breaking anything out of the version types. Annoying that I just upgraded from 6.12.8 the other day, yeah, because I would have otherwise skipped a rollback but I appreciate the prompt fixes.",

Or, if you want to dive deeper, setting up shares on a headless Linux distro (Debian, Ubuntu, etc), setting up Proxmox, etc.",

            "RJ45 is good for 30m with cat5e/cat6 as long as you have a decent cable. \nHowever. It's best to buy a network card with SFP+ as you can change the connection type as you please. Plenty of second hand network cards available",
            "Honestly, you\u2019re using spinning drives. Unless you\u2019re pulling to/from the nvme drive at max capacity that 10g isn\u2019t going to help you any. But to keep things simpler, heat way down, I went with the qnap Qhora 322 router as an all-in-one and kept it rj45.  I\u2019d definitely jump for more than 1g but going for 10g, at least in my case, doesn\u2019t serve any purpose when I\u2019m WAY limited by IO of the drives.",

            "Oh, if you have it built in then you're fine. \nI was only recommending SFP+ if you needed to buy an add in card. \nJust use what you have unless you need to do over 30m cable run off course, then you will need fibre."

            "Yes those parts are all fine. I'd suggest reading some Unraid guides or the many videos for installing fresh, esp from SpaceInvaderOne channel, just to get an idea.\n\nUnraid uses the largest drive as parity - the thing is any extra space on it will go to waste.\n\ne.g. if you want to use your current drives you must use the 16TB one as parity but then 8TB of it goes to waste. If you happen to buy another 16TB drive (maybe a refurb one on sale) then you can use that as a data drive, have it fully protected as well. \n\nMake sure your motherboard and case have enough SATA ports and slots to fit all the drives you need.",
