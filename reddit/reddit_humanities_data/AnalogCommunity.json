        "content": "We decided to do this again but push it back so a single year could be done. zzpza did the work of acquiring the data to be used. Malamodon did all the analysis work, therefore all data is subject to their biases. They have done a lot work on the previous ones, and the comparison between each year's graphs show no massive swings that would indicate a sudden change in biases, so should be considered accurate enough for this project.\n\n---\n**Method**\n\nAll the posts to /r/Analog for the time period (January 2022 to December 2022) were imported into a database. Deleted and removed posts were excluded. 1300 random posts were selected using the SQL rand() feature and saved to a tab in a Google spreadsheet. A second export from the database was then done, ordered by post score; the top 1300 were saved to a different tab in the same spreadsheet. 1300 was used as further manual sorting obviously removes more posts so you'd come up short with only 1000 in the starting set. Any excess entries left over after the final data set was done were discarded.\n\nEverything after this was then manually processed. Types of posts removed: any remaining deleted/removed posts, all non-photo posts including videos, and gallery/album posts. Any posts in Random that were present in Top were removed from Random.\n\nThat done, we had a useable data set for Top 1000 and Random 1000. [This document is available to anyone to view or copy to their own google drive and do their own analysis.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nW6t8cG4D1IiVn1uS2BrjxE8EU1oYEL2YGRhFYPSLao/edit#gid=591709958)\n\nThe categories were kept the same as previous years for consistency. This isn't comprehensive but we felt the ones chosen accounted for the major genres of photography, anything that did not fit neatly into one or two of these categories was categorised as 'Other'. Each photo was then manually assessed and categorised. This process is obviously subjective and imperfect, but we believe we have stuck to our definitions. We hit an issue of not being able to always neatly slot a photo into just one category so we allowed for a secondary category to be flagged when it was felt a post was split in subject equally or in the 60/40, 70/30 range. Anything marked 'Other' or with a secondary flag was reassessed after the initial categorisation pass.\n\nAdditional attributes were also catalogued: -\n\n* Black and white or colour film  \n* Film used  \n* Camera used  \n* Is the post NSFW  \n* Multi exposure (2 or more exposures on the same frame)  \n* Film rebate present (having the film borders around the image)  \n\nThe 'Film Used' column was consolidated for certain stocks, so Portra 160, 400, 800, NC, VC, etc. is all just Portra, same thing for Superia, Cinestill, Lomo CN, etc. Only the top 10 was chosen in the charts due to the large number, even with the consolidation. There was demand for a breakdown of Portra stocks since it accounts for such a large portion, so that was done.\n\n---\n**Results**\n\nWhat is data without charts. So here they are:\n\n* [Photo Subject - Top vs. Random](https://i.imgur.com/V7AzET8.png)\n* [Top 10 Films Used - Top 1000 Pie Chart](https://i.imgur.com/sejm1TZ.png)  \n* [Top 10 Films Used - Random 1000 Pie Chart](https://i.imgur.com/esgf0jE.png)  \n* [Colour or Black & White - Top vs. Random](https://i.imgur.com/dgbOQs0.png)\n* [Breakdown of Kodak Portra - Top vs. Random](https://i.imgur.com/MTNBNUb.png)\n* [Breakdown of film formats used](https://i.imgur.com/f0khSdP.png)\n* [Breakdown of camera manufacturers](https://i.imgur.com/NUq1aEa.png)\n* [Camera models with 10 or more posts](https://i.imgur.com/srkNQ23.png)\n\n* [Album Version](https://imgur.com/a/uHvhFN2)\n\n**Comparisons**\n\nSince there is now three sets of data, some charts comparing the three years were also done.  \n\n* [Here's an album of those charts.](https://imgur.com/a/kO1sZZH)\n\n---\n**Opinions**\n\nThe results aren't massively different from the previous year, so previous opinions still hold up.\n\n* The disparity remains between male and female subjects in the top versus random. Landscape edges ahead as the most popular category, with animals/nature rocketing up from last year to second.\n\n* NSFW has seen an increase in Top from 1-2% to 7%. It should be noted that 5 users account for about 40% of those posts.\n\n* Kodak Gold and Cinestill films increase in popularity, with a decline in Superia. Black and White films getting a bit more popular in Top as well; maybe more people are shooting B&W now due to the rising costs of colour film.\n\n* A small tussle between medium format and 35mm goes back to 2020 levels. Could be the same reason as with colour film, medium format is more expensive per shot, and cameras for it continue to increase in price.\n\n* In Top, Pentax sees a 7% decrease, Hasselblad a marginal decline, Nikon seeing a nearly 5% increase in popularity.\n\n---\nThink we suck at this?

            "Can you analyze how many repetitive questions like why is my expired film dark green? and why does half my picture look black and what is shutter capping? are on r/analogcommunity ?\n\nGreat info overall though.",
            "This is great. I might download and do some additional stuff with it (I'm learning a new coding language and will need some data to play with).\n\nI've poked around the data a little. I don't know the size of the total database, but unless it's in the hundreds of thousands it's (statistically) surprising that none of the \"random\" posts show up in \"top\". Did you drop posts from \"random\" if they were \"top\"?",
            "interesting analysis, thank you for sharing!",
            "Are there also stats for the subreddit such as growth/decline of submissions and users year-on-year?",
            "Thanks - so it's \"characteristics of top posts\" vs \"characteristics of non-top posts\", which is a perfectly valid way to look at the questions you're interested in.\n\nDo you know roughly the total number of posts each year? Even better would be an estimate of the total number that would make it through the various filters. Like I said, I might use this data as I'm learning a new programming language and statistical packages, and there are some fancier analyses I might try that would incorporate those numbers. (If you don't know them I can just use a rough estimate like 1k/week.)",
            "Thanks - I've been working with R for a long time and am now learning Python. I'm starting with the kind of stuff I've used R for (data analysis, so NumPy, pandas, sci-kit learn, etc), but am curious to try different stuff like scraping data and working w/APIs",
            "~~No posts were dropped if they were already in the other dataset.~~ We get over 1000 new posts a week, so the chance of a post being in both is slim.\n\n  \nEdit: My mistake, in my defence, it was a while ago and I wasn't involved with the data analysis, only the capture and exporting of the meta data.",
            "I did the data filtering and analysis.\n\nI did explicitly choose to exclude having entries from Top in Random. I can't remember the exact reason, most likely i wanted to just keep them exclusive, even if it makes it not perfectly random. The filtering process itself introduces bias against albums, videos, gifs, images without film and camera information, and those whose post's images were no longer available to view/dead links. That last one becomes a bigger problem as time goes on, as the links in the spreadsheet die out for various reasons.\n\nYou have to remember the initial idea behind the first analysis, was to just see if the perceptions of the subreddit from both moderators and users had any basis. We mostly just wanted to know if there was any strong patterns between what was upvoted the most, and compare to a mostly random sample of what was less popular, or not at all.\n\nWe released the spreadsheets with the data used, so people couldn't accuse us of trying to push a narrative or lying, we felt that level of transparency was required for the charts/graphs to have any validity in the eyes of the subreddit.\n\nIf you got any more questions let me know, even if i do tend to ramble.",
            "I asked the head moderator zzpza (who has a bot grab the initial data) for 1300 entries of each, to account for albums, videos, dead links, question posts, etc. that have to be filtered out, and that was enough to leave me with at least 1000 of each.\n\nAny over the 1000 mark i just hid the rows until i was 100% sure the dataset was solid, as even between getting the entries, initial filtering pass, and viewing, some post will get deleted. To combat this i would also download all the photos locally, so they were fixed in place for my visual analysis. Some people will not like me doing that, but i felt it was necessary, and i drew the line at sharing that set of images publicly, for what i consider obvious reasons of copyright and user preferences.\n\nI can't remember the exact numbers, as i didn't think to note them, but the amount filtered was always more in random, since more random posts have dead links, or were question posts, have missing info, etc. than in Top. Top posts were more likely to remain as people often tend to delete posts with no traction, and question posts get less votes too. Vague recollection from like 14 months ago, probably 8-10% were filtered in Top and closer to 20% in random, but take those with a grain salt.\n\nI can't help with the bigger numbers, i asked zzpza to reply to you with the yearly rough numbers if they can get them.",
