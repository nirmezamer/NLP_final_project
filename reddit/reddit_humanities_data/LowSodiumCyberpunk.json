In the first time I played I found it a bit confusing but I tried it again and I got the feeling to beat the game but yeah, its fun. \n\nThe structure of the game is similar to Cyberpunk. You can see and feel it was made by the same devs.",
            "Totally should.\u00a0\n\nIt has a lot of the same strengths, stuff like lovable side characters, really sells the feeling of being a wandering problem solver.

            "Never finished playing Witcher 3 myself but I can definitely say it has a similar structure and you can tell it was made by the same studio. Like Cyberpunk, The Witcher 3 is very dialogue heavy. Gameplay wise, vastly different experiences. Cyberpunk\u2019s combat can be very high octane and you can kill any enemy with any weapon, whereas Witcher 3\u2019s combat requires you to have a bit more of a methodical approach when dealing with the various types of enemies. Give it a shot. There\u2019s a reason why The Witcher series is CDPR\u2019s golden goose.",

            "I've started Witcher 3 multiple times and not gotten far. Very different combat system, and the setting and narrative don't really do much for me. And this is coming from someone who enjoys fantasy; there's just nothing that ever really clicked for me. \n\nThis isn't me saying you shouldn't try it, just that I don't think liking Cyberpunk is itself a good predictor of whether you'd like Witcher 3."
