We will remove videos of any kind unless they are verified by reputable outlets. This also affects videos published by Ukrainian and Russian government sources.\n\n- **Absolutely no justification of this invasion**.\n\n- In addition to our rules, **we ask you to add a NSFW/NSFL tag if you're going to link to graphic footage** or anything can be considered upsetting, including combat footage or dead people.\n\n### Submission rules\n\nThese are rules for submissions to r/europe front-page.\n\t\n- No status reports about the war unless they have major implications (e.g. \"City X still holding\" would not be allowed, \"Russia takes major city\" would be allowed. \"Major attack on Kherson repelled\" would also be allowed.)\n\n- **All dot ru domains have been banned by Reddit as of 30 May**. They are hardspammed, so not even mods can approve comments and submissions linking to Russian site domains.\n  - Some Russian sites that ends with `.com` are also hardspammed, like TASS and Interfax, and mods can't re-approve them.\n    - The Internet Archive and similar archive websites are also blacklisted here, by us or Reddit.\n- We've been adding substack domains in our u/AutoModerator script, but we aren't banning all of them.

            "Putin and peace proposals are in the news again, so I think it is worth repeating:\n\n* Any peace deal that leaves Ukraine without NATO membership or an equivalent strong binding military alliance against Russia (with the lack of NATO or such alliance often labeled misleadingly as \"Ukrainian neutrality\") is not a peace deal but only a temporary ceasefire, which Russia will break the moment they think they have a good opportunity. Without an alliance, there is nothing to enforce Russia following the treaty. Same goes for any peace deal that seeks to disarm Ukraine. And in fact Russian proposals have generally demanded both neutrality and disarmament.\n\n* Russian proposals generally are not serious, as evidenced by them making demands such as above. Such unserious proposals have only the purpose of attempting to buy Russia time to reorganise for new offensives, or to feed grotesquely false propaganda along the lines of \"Russia wants peace, but Ukraine doesn't want it / NATO won't let Ukraine do it\".\n\n* Russia has repeatedly broken treaties and agreements and as a consequence has very little credibility and is not to be trusted. Russian propaganda will constantly point towards supposed vague verbal promises about NATO expansion made to Gorbachev, which never entered any formal written treaty, while it has constantly broken everything from the Helsinki Accords, to the Russia-NATO Founding act, to the Budapest memorandum, to the Minks agreements, all of which are actual formal treaties.\n\n* The sole responsibility for this war is on Russia, Russia is the one who invaded and started the war and continues it, and it is entirely within Russia's options to immediately make peace: Russia can end the war at any time simply by withdrawing from Ukrainian territory. \n\nThe correct answer to any Russian \"peace proposals\" is and remains this: Or Russia could just go home.",
            "https://www.ft.com/content/e63d6bb3-4381-4731-9724-d059e4eabf60\n\n*The writer, co-winner of the 2022 Nobel Prize for Peace, heads the Center for Civil Liberties in Kyiv and is on the board of the Institute for War & Peace Reporting*\n\nMy friend, a writer, texted last night from his trench to say a gentle goodbye. His unit is expecting an attack any time, but they do not have the heavy artillery they need to repel the assault.\n\nI am thousands of miles away from Ukraine, on a six-city lecture tour across the US, addressing public meetings and briefing members of Congress. But the war stays with us Ukrainians wherever we may travel. Rest is impossible when, back home, the delay in delivering crucial arms is costing the lives of our friends, our relatives, our countrymen.\n\nThe $60bn US package has been stalled for months by what, for Americans, is domestic politics; for us Ukrainians, it is a matter of life and death. In my meetings here, I am frequently asked: since Ukraine cannot expect to defeat Russia on the battlefield, shouldn\u2019t it accept a land deal? Won\u2019t more arms just mean more death?\n\nIndeed, Ukraine has seen far too much death \u2014 I know, because my colleagues and I see it daily. For the past decade, my organisation has documented war crimes by Russian forces occupying my country. Since the full invasion in February 2022, the scale of crimes has escalated exponentially. With a network of Ukrainian groups, we have documented killings, rape and torture \u2014 beatings, peeling off fingernails, genital electric shock. One woman I interviewed had her eye extracted by a spoon. To date, we have documented 68,000 crimes.\n\nYet this is only the tip of the iceberg, because such crimes are central to both the method and the purpose of the invasion. The Russian position, as the president has made repeatedly clear, is that Ukrainian language and culture, that Ukraine and Ukrainians, do not exist.\n\nA premature deal would be wrong \u2014 not least because we tried it already, and it failed. In 2014, Russia seized Crimea and part of the Donbas. Ukraine was not able to respond effectively, and the international response was muted. A ceasefire was then agreed. All Russia did was use the next eight years to prepare forward bases for the next attack. Moscow will only do the same again.\n\nAn early deal would also be immoral. You do not make peace by disarming the invaded country. This would be occupation and we know what that would mean.\n\nIn a de-occupied area of the Kharkiv region, after the Ukraine army pushed Russian forces back, the degraded body of beloved Ukrainian children\u2019s writer Volodymyr Vakulenko was discovered in an unmarked mass grave in the Izyum woods. After extensive investigation, the Russian soldiers responsible for this crime have recently been identified.\n\nWhy kill a children\u2019s writer? Russia kills Ukrainian civilians because it can. After decades of brutal warfare \u2014 in Chechnya, in Syria and beyond \u2014 it has never been held accountable.\n\nRussia is now increasing its assaults on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure, and we expect a major attack this summer. Our capital city, my home, could again be under direct threat.\n\nIn the meantime, destabilisation activities are under way against Moldova and other neighbouring countries. Moscow is the centre but Russia\u2019s imperial vision has no defined borders. This nightmare \u2014 this endless cataloguing of human pain \u2014 will only continue.\n\nThe solution is to defeat Russia and this authoritarian ideology. A stand must be made, and Ukrainians are bravely making it. War is horrible. But Ukrainians know what Russia brings, and the clear majority of the population \u2014 more than 70 per cent \u2014 support continuing the fight \u201cas long as it takes\u201d.\n\nWe respect American politics. We know every country has its own priorities and financial issues. We are grateful for the generous support we have received so far from the US, Europe and other countries around the world, both from governments and ordinary citizens. But now we need more help, and we need it soon. Ukraine wants peace more than anyone. But we cannot fight evil with empty hands. Strengthen Ukraine, let us pursue the war as far as we can \u2014 our vision is to the internationally recognised 1991 borders \u2014 and then we can discuss peace. Our friends in Russian human rights groups tell us the same: the best way to help Russian democracy is to defeat Russian militarism in Ukraine.\n\nThis is not a war for land. It is a war for survival. Not just of the Ukrainian people but of the basic values of human rights, of democracy, of liberty. The majority of American people know this and support more aid for Ukraine. The majority of members of Congress agree. Meanwhile, I continue to get text messages from the front every night. Will the US send fresh arms before it is too late?",
            "The Kremlin is conducting a concerted air and information operation to destroy Kharkiv City, convince Ukrainians to flee, and internally displace millions of Ukrainians ahead of a possible future Russian offensive operation against the city or elsewhere in Ukraine.\n\nKremlin mouthpieces are seizing on concerns about a future Russian offensive operation against Kharkiv City to conduct a likely coordinated information operation in an effort to create outsized panic among Ukrainians. ISW assesses that the likelihood of a successful Russian ground offensive against Kharkiv is very low if Ukraine receives renewed US military aid rapidly. https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-april-22-2024"

As moderators, we read the same arguments in favor of each side repeatedly since the war broke out again in the region.\n\nWe know that the Palestine Question is one of the most heated discussions on the Internet, and also one that influences the political lives of many, both inside Israel or Palestine, and outside of it. However, we've seen that users rarely maintain civility, and moderators are not able to properly maintain civil discourse compared to other topics.\n\nThat said:\n\n* Until said otherwise, **any** post related to Israel, Palestine, and the war in the region will be **removed**. Insistence on posting such content will be met with warnings and bans if necessary.\n\n* News of extraordinary importance not only to Europe - **which must be related** - but to the whole world can still be shared. Our criteria will be how many websites, from news agency (AP, Reuters) to international newspapers (Euronews, NYT, France24, and others), share **original reporting** on it.

Well, except some Israeli politician visiting Europe, or EU publishing some statement about Israel\n\nThat said, I understand the general idea of the moratorium. There are enough news subs where the topic can be discussed, like rWorldnews and rNews. This topic doesn't need to flood every sub",

Each day there are comments attacking people based purely on their nationality. Be they Irish, Hungarian, Russian, Romanian Turkish etc. All of it is disgusting and has no place on this subreddit. No one chooses their nationality or where they are born and no one should be attacked for their nationality or the religious belief they were raised with. \n\nThere should be a \"Zero Tolerance\" policy to all hate speech but because that hasn't been enforced its spilled over to a point its out of control.\n\nIf you took a Zero Tolerance policy to hate speech no matter who its aimed at than r/Europe wouldn't be in the mess it is now.  By not applying the anti-hate speech rule uniformly you compromise your principles showing that this sub is not against hate speech, your just against it when it suits and thus the rule is loosely applied with a heavy amount of bias involved. \n\n\nYou either apply a rule uniformly or not at all as otherwise we are hypocrites with no principles to speak of on this subreddit.",

You need to remember he had 13 years' imprisonment under articles of  \"theft\", \"robbery\", \"fraud\" and \"involving a minor in the commission of a crime. Then he worked for Putin organizing mercenaries in Africa. So while being a Putin loyalist he was a complete outsider to the ruling circle, and they sure wouldn't want to let him in. Especially if they are already satisfied with Putin's system, there is zero reason to let in an outsider bandit and a mercenary.\n\nSecond, he never had any political program for his coup attempt. It wasn't \"I'll be the new president\", it was \"I'll march towards Moscow to let Putin know my dissatisfaction with undersupplying Wagner\". And the reason Wagner started getting undersupplied is the same as always - they were getting too powerful and too influential.\n\nThe whole of Putin's rule has been \"divide and conquer\" - making sure that different government departments compete against each other without having any of them dominant. Regular military vs Wagner was one of those things. And as you can see, when Wagner was done and only the regular military was left, what did Putin do? That's right, he removed the minister of defense Shoigu (despite him being one of Putin's closest allies), and cleansed all Shoigu's people from the MoD. Same principle again - no one can be allowed to get too powerful.\n\nSo essentially Prigozhin was marching on Moscow alone, without any political support, or a political program that could attract more supporters - and not being a politician himself. He was relying on the Z-circles, but those were also getting repressed by Putin to stop them from growing too powerful. Even if he took the Kremlin or the White House, I don't think he would be able to do anything.",

It's written by a longtime Russia academic and a Russian Journalist\n\nAlso has a great audiobook version\n\nHonestly Prigozhin's journey is super fascinating in a purely narrative sense. The man's clearly talented in a very entrepreneurial type of way. \n\nHe went from child of intellectuals to criminal to prisoner to running an illegal industry in a prison to shitty car dealer to hotdog seller to supermarket investor to restanteur to professional internet trollmaster to unwilling leader of a fake mercenary leader to enthusiastic leader of a real mercenary group to rebel\n\nAt the same time, in addition to the personal characteristics of Prigozhin, his journey is kind of emblamatic of the \"upper rung but not inner circle\" class of Russians. The people with actual power are free to use him as much as they want, and punish him pretty much however they want. But no matter how hard he worked he could never join that upper rung. And quite a lot of his actions ended up being borne out of frustration and anger towards those people"
