If the game is over, report their Steam Community profile.\n* If you notice certain trends or have other feedback, you can email the developers using the email address above.\n* To report a specific cheat, follow [these steps](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7849-Radz-6869#report) to notify the VAC development team.\n\n# The guidelines\n\nWhile we encourage discussion about these topics, as a reminder, the following are _not_ allowed.

            "I bookmark the links to cheaters accounts. After 2 years of doing this and having 50+ bookmarked links, not a single one has been banned yet lol. I played 2 games today and in one of them the other team was playing weird but after watching the demo I couldn't say for sure they were cheating, until I checked their top fraggers account on a match tracking website and he had 76 kills in the previous game he played. 1100 hours time played on his account btw.\n\nOther games with 90ms ping feel wayy smoother than this game with 45ms ping. Subtick just simply sucks. The cheap fucks couldn't afford 128 tick servers huh?\n\nI have several clips in which I'm completely stationary and my crosshair is in the middle of their head or in the middle of their torso when I have the AWP, and after I die it says 0 damage dealt. This games is far from finished, It's not even beta, it's in its alpha stage.\n\nAlso it's kinda funny it's supposedly built from scratch in a new engine but many of the infamous CSGO problems are still in it.\n\nIt's sad that I played this game since I was a child and I still love this game, but I have to uninstall, it's just not a good game.\n\nAnyway, just needed to vent after playing games to have some fun at the end of the day, but I get this.",
            "I'm not sure if its caused by trust update but I got ragecheaters in 5 games in a row. Seems like valve has no clue what they are doing. 29 kills with 100% hs, where is overwatch/vac live ?",
            "This game sucks ass",
            "I'm about to fucking sell all my shit and dip for good bc WTF is this bullshit bro. Since launch I've had just an occasional VAC issue where for some reason and very randomly it would tell me VAC can't verify. Well now today after literally 2 deathmatches and halfway into a 3rd it kicks me saying for the first time that something is interfering with VAC when I have made absolutely zero changes to my PC. Now I just get insta booted from games with zero message.",
            "game unplayable still, if you find matches every lobby have minimum 1 or 2 completly new accounts ofc cheaters with wh how possible 6k hours accounts playing with 200-400 this game suck..., and after last update everybody have stutters problem and mic sound robotic randomly xd 1,5 years still unplayable give us csgo... how long must waiting to playable this shit game and sub-tick is the worst shit, tickrate 128 in csgo was much better",
            "I'm 20k elo in EU Premier and after playing roughly 50 games in the last month, about 40% of my games have a cheater. That's almost every 2nd game. \n\nSometimes when I'm not sure I watch demos to verify (some are hiding a wallhack), the rest is confirmed by insane Leetify stats (aim 97-100) and very low time to damage. Today I played 3 Premier games between 6 and 8 PM, all 3 had blatant cheaters shooting through walls, smokes and flashes, rapid fire etc. If anyone doesn't believe I can provide stats, demos and any kind of proof you would like to see or hear.\n\nAlso this week I saw my first VAC Live, I play in a 3 stack and our 2 randoms were cheaters + one of the enemy guys was also cheating. We were winning like 11:2 and after losing many games and lots of elo to cheaters I was like OK I'll take the free W and move on. Well VAC live happened, game was 12:2 and the only thing I received was XP for a case drop. So I lose elo to cheaters and then when I finally have some cheaters on my side and I can win elo the match gets cancelled. When it gets cancelled I don't understand why the demo is not released. Also VAC Live doesn't give them an immediate VAC ban which is just confusing. Why not? The AI is sure enough to cancel the match but not sure enough to give them a VAC ban?\n\nAnother thing is there are no elo refunds after people get VAC banned. Why not? Cheaters got banned, give me back my elo. \n\nMM ranks are still broken if you can't reach Global. Being Gold Nova means you're meeting many cheaters anyway as it's probably above average in terms of MM rank.\n\nPremier is infested with cheaters once you reach top 1% which is roughly 20k elo.\n\nValve please fix.",
            "It feels like Valve is doing almost nothing to combat the cheaters. Im trying to get my account ranked and theres so many spinners at low elo (\\~5k) that its insane. I cant imagine being a new player and getting qued into this and even bothering with wanting to continue. I guess they care more about case profits and everything else other then trying to make this game good. I can see why valorant is winning over my region (NA). Like who tf would want to play this nonsense when now people are glorifying cheaters along with them streaming themselves ruining premier games. Why should I have to rely on terrible 3rd party platforms like faceit? I swear this game used to be so good and Ive never seen this many blatant cheaters in CSGO then I did in this unfinished terrible alpha game... Truly sad my favorite game is now just destroyed. I have almost zero faith that VAC will ever compete with the likes of vanguard or anything else. My list of blatant spinners that I kept track of have yet to be banned after a month+. Feels like my reports dont do anything at all. What happened to the decade of overwatch data from csgo?",
            "The fact that they gotta \"hide\" these posts in a sub shows you how much they care about the problem. First they combine the reviews of two different games, then they bash and remove comments anybody saying anything about cheaters. You know how easy it is to write a simple script to detect a f-ing bhop? Or better yet when they are not even aiming towards players yet all the tracers go to their heads? Community servers have had this for years on CSGO. Keep gaslighting for valve you soulless bastards.",
            "Can someone explain to me how on earth it is possible to shoot the guns at 1000x fire rate and vac being unable to detect /  unwilling to ban it? seems like the simplest thing. I wonder if valve engineers can even solve fizzbuzz",
            "Anyone know a fix for the mic issues that came out of last update?\n\nMyself and a buddy just randomly sound like static/robot after the update, only affects CS2, and I also run into randoms with the exact same issue.\n\nIts annoying as shit"

            "And they have changed head coach four times since 2020. Soon five times with the rumour of zews leaving the team as well.",
            "just typicall NA behaviour, just wait for like 100 thieves to come crawling back if the PW major stickers are gonna go crazy",
            "The thing that is weird with liquid is they had a almost trophy winning roster and just chose to tear it all apart, Yekindar was playing fantastic, elige was playing ok, nitro was calling well (ik he choose to leave), naf was great in his roles and osee was missing shots but they chose to kick elige and go eu for some reason? with mid eu players as well and yekindar igling like what is that? I think yekindar was a great signing at the time as well, there was a time on liquid when he was the best entry fragger in the world.",
            "I'd argue on behalf of Rainwaker and Patsi. Two insane individuals, but both right at the far ends of the early round/late round spectrum. \n\nA massively passive player that hides mid rounds then has an incredible clutch, on a team with naf.\n\nAnd a massively aggressive player who does his best work making plays and throwing himself into the dangerzone ... on a team with yekindar.\n\nBad management, but not bad players.",
            "The management has been poor ever since covid\n\nI still can't believe they let twistzz go. Naf twistzz and elige is the best, most talented trio that NA ever have\n\nThey should have play together til they became absolutely washed \n\nThe fact they could win trophies and make so many final run and losing to only the greatest cs roster all of time without ever having a t1 awper is so impressive",
            "A lot of this is said in retrospect though. Yekinder and cadian at least are good pickups on paper. Many of these other players are great in their own right too.",
            "You do also have to consider that Liquid has consistently attempted to recruit top players, but that it is just hard and comes down to more than money usually. Karrigan wanted to go to FaZe because he knew the org and what they could offer in terms of management and support IIRC. When ropz went to FaZe from Mouz, Liquid was also interested and afaik even offered him more money, but since he wanted to play with Karrigan there wasn't really anything Liquid could offer to sway him. Same with mONESY, whom they offered a better salary than G2 did allegedly. I sometime struggle to see what players Liquid should have picked up who would realistically go there at the time.",
            "Grim made sense at the time, appeared to be the biggest NA talent at the time. Same stats in NA as Malbs, of course less proven against tier 1, but he did destroy Furia and MIBR with the old Sk core.\n\nFallen was an ettempt to replace Nitro as the awp igl iirc, did not work out as he ended up conflicting with Stewie.\n\nOsee- Best NA awper at the time. Made sense to sign him if the org wanted to remain mainly american. Was also smashing NA teams.\n\nShow- No clue what they were thinking. Probably lost out on main targets and he was cheap?\n\nRainwaker- cheap moneyball signing Daps wanted when they went EU. Did not work out, but not a massive loss since he was dirt cheap\n\nYekindar- Good signing initially at least. After Covid Liquid did not perform well and when they added Yekindar they became title contenders almost instantly. Trended downwards after joining though and his igl stint was a disaster. Ended up in conflict with Elige role wise who was in a slump before joining Complexity.\n\nPatsi- another moneyball signing when Liquid tried to go EU and did not perform. Had reasons to partially believe he could perform at tier 1 level since he had done so previously for Spirit, but did not pick form back up for Liquid. Probably didn't cost a lot.\n\ncadiaN- on paper he should of been an amazing signing, and Liquid under him have not been that bad. Team cohesion is terrible though, and he has not been able to implement his Heroic system in Liquid while his individual form since cs2 released has not been great.\n\nSkullz- Probably the worst on the list. Massive buyout for a player who is both unproven and also clashes with Liquids most valuable player in NAF. They are insanely lucky if they manage to regain half of what they initially paid for him.\n\nTwistzz- Good signing, of course he was always expected to perform and has a history with NAF as well.",
            "Judging by the Cadian situation, I don't think the GM makes roster moves. I think the players make the calls on the team, and the GM helps facilitate that. It's not like traditional sports where the GM is making all the roster calls",
            "They need to do an internal investigation into who's deciding this. An S tier org like liquid shouldn't have made this many bad changes\n\nI will admit, Fallen, Grim and cadian all made sense and Yekindar did work out initially"
