        "content": "Since Shadow of the Erdtree is one of the biggest releases of the year and people are going to have a lot to say about it, we\u2019ve decided to create this mega-thread as a discussion hub for you all. Please try to keep the talk about it confined to here, whether it be speculation or spoilers (gameplay talk is fine, but tag spoilers on major bosses, lore reveals, things not in the trailer, etc.). Once it\u2019s fully released, we\u2019ll be keeping an eye out for untagged spoilers, so be sure to tag them properly since we\u2019ll be handing out temporary bans based on severity otherwise.\n\nOther than that, have fun, and pour one out for Glaive Master Hodir!\n\nEDIT: Some users suggested that I add in the group passwords for CSB fans to use when playing online, so please enter the following passwords if you\u2019re interested:\n\n- Koopy\n\n- EVILLAK",

            "Hey everyone, hope you had a good week. I've only been playing **Shadow of the Erdtree**, which is great! I have one last open world chunk to explore and then I think I just have some bosses left to fight, maybe another legacy dungeon if they introduce another. I do think a couple of the bosses so far have been a bit too much, but most of the fights are fine.  \n  \nMy only other gripe with it is that a bunch of cool stuff is now locked behind Mohg, which is endgame on a normal playthrough. Although I did load up a character I made a year ago just to see how fast you can rush Mohg, and you can do it you really want to. I got the Reduvia for boss killing, ran around to collect somber stones to upgrade it, rushed the Ranni questline for Tiche, and then Killed Mohg. I'll probably just buy the dlc on PC and give myself the dlc items I wanna use in future playthroughs though.",
            "I moved into a new apartment over the weekend. I've got internet set up, so at this point I'm mostly just getting used to everything (although, I'll need to update the address on my license at some point). It's a bit lonely living by myself, but beyond that I'm holding up pretty well. To be honest, I'm mainly glad it's over and done with at this point. Having to prepare everything for my move-in date was getting to be pretty stressful.\n\nIn the meantime, I've been playing through Shadow of the Erdtree. I've killed a few bosses and made some decent headway, but I've still got a lot left to do. Currently I'm using the light greatsword I found, and I've been having a blast with the moveset. Highly recommend it to anyone getting tired of the normal greatswords.",

Yeah, we've gotten our bigger budget titles every now and again like Zelda or Fire Emblem or Pikmin, but there's also been a lot of smaller budget titles that help fill the gaps between, like a new Nintendo Musou or a remake/HD port of an older title or some other side project like Princess Peach Showtime.\n\nSure they might not always leave a huge impact, but when I look at their official sales summaries and see how many titles still sell at least 1 million copies or more, it's difficult to argue the results.",
