            "Thursday, the 20th was my dad's birthday! And Sunday the 23rd will be mine. As usual I don't exactly look forward to the vague passage of time, but I can't really deny it's approach all the same. I am wondering if I should get something really dumb and expensive, though. Like, I saw an airsoft lever-action rifle that you put the BB into a cartridge and it'll cycle through and spit them out like a real thing. I don't need it, but... C'mon.\n\nReally, our family's not been much of birthday celebratin' people beyond getting a nice dinner. So instead of a present, I'd love it more if you checked out my novel [The Demon in Shadow.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FmMdrhiW56K291gS1V3EdQ8Oe5SIVM0dgbtbpbCTTRs/edit?usp=sharing) you can even use this [PDF link and read it on the go.](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/fw8brtve5pdezq9vl8lmp/TheDemonInShadowBWInserts.pdf?rlkey=qpz48504fh6u7jweomm1modez&e=1&st=7c5shz6h&dl=0) I did that last week when I was travelling for work! And really other than some bad syntax and formatting mistakes I don't hate it. This story is about humans and demons, the latter who are relatively recent additions to the world of Milesain. Human Max and Demon Ayun cross paths and find themselves linked together in a larger journey that will confront their pasts and possibly topple a larger threat to demonkind. There's amazing artwork tucked away in certain spots of the chapters as well as in the back for character profiles and other shenanigans. Actually, speaking of shenanigans [I made my own dumb little four-panel comic](https://i.imgur.com/5ZnY9vW.png) with Ayun, Max and his sister Monika. The joke probably lands better when you read the book. Please!\n\nAnd if you can't get enough of those two or the world, then consider this preview of the sequel, [The Demons of Blood & Bone.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12EY1Olrc8eOw8y6eCTxvuYpb-w1L-ckcDhRkQEZaYSk/edit?usp=sharing) While Max and Ayun continue growing closer, they face a new group of demons that are linked to a mysteriously wicked weapon. It's also got some art, right now just characters, in the back.\n\nI'm glad that I had this guy already shot before I took a trip because I've been barely alive all week thanks to post-trade show mess. It's the [Gyan Revive!](https://imgur.com/a/Y1xkY6n) An interesting kit because despite it being from 2016, was just a few kits shy of dual language. Not that it matters greatly, because this kit transcends language. It's a good suit. Though I'll say maybe it's the rounded shoulders or the coloring, but this feels like a buff suit. I just kept wanting to pose it in Armstrong-esque poses. Gachimuchi aside, there's not much going on though to be fair there wasn't much going on for the Gyan. It's got a saber, it's got a shield that shoots stuff. Not even a gun or a way to cheese a Zaku's rifle in there. They did add a hand with a special wrist to make more stabby motions. Could've used that on the Rune Gods. I still think it's great, and I think it was a tidy 20 bucks or something at my local shop. And it's always good to have more Zeon kits.\n\nHajime No Ippo is on Netflix. I've read it, but I've never actually watched the series proper. And it starts out strong. The animation is really good, although I can see the shortcuts like watching Miyata duck and weave four times or so. There's also an English dub and... It's not too bad. Steve Staley is Ippo (for you Gundam nerds, Banagher from Unicorn and Shiro of 08th) and he does good work at being meek and serious. Everybody else is just fine, nothing standout but also nothing truly vile. They don't give you English CC so the subtitles are translated and the major deviation seems to be tied to lip lock. And maybe it feels like they're trying to tone it down? They swear some in the subtitles but I'm not heard as much as a damn in English. Maybe it was an attempt to get it to air for something like Toonami. Which probably is immediately countered by the dick jokes.",
            "Hot week, busy week, weird internal vibes week. One of those weeks. The east coast's been lighting up and everyone is miserable about it except me, who thrives in the heat to such a degree that I didn't notice my AC malfunctioning during a particularly high spike. I've done a lot this week in terms of actionable things -- making great progress on my novel, for instance -- but not a lot in terms of variety, so this one's gonna be a short one.\n\nFirst off, [I finished streaming](https://www.twitch.tv/kkterthelt) **Crow Country** (and you can see the whole stream series [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRPzT1i2o8S4BKj8EPvDKNO9q_G3C-uQi))! Fucking *immaculate* little game. If not for *Signalis* being maybe my favorite game of all time, this would be my favorite survival horror game in years -- and I would say it even does a few things better than *Signalis*, like raw scare factor. It's a compact experience that does exactly what it needs to do, and tells a story that kept me guessing the entire way and paid off like a lightning strike to my brain by the end. >!I had vague inklings in my brain that the Pool might be a portal to somewhere, but the misdirections about the Roots and the gold scam were so effective that I never even scratched at the core truth. It's such a refreshing twist for a horror game, and such a horrifying series of actions from Edward Crow, no matter how contrite he is about it all in the present. And even though I figured out Mara's identity very early, I was still gobsmacked by the health meter reveal and everything that came with it, which they managed to spin into a genuinely emotional and bittersweet hook for the ending even with how nihilistic the big answers were.!<\n\n9/10 game with a 10/10 finish. Some of the puzzles sucked (that mushroom room is truly baffling), but when that's the worst I can level at your game, you knocked it out of the park. Will be keeping an eye on these devs with great interest.\n\nSecond, and the vast majority of the week: my **Elden Ring** prep! I have so many ongoing and new games that I desperately want to get back on, but I couldn't *not* mainline this to clear the impact zone. In the space of the week, I've gotten all the way from Liurnia to the Mountaintops of the Giants, and have gotten a nice reminder of how amazing this game is in the process. I'm torn between leveling up Eleonora's Poleblade to +10 again or continuing with one of my newfound favorites, the Nox Flowing Hammer, which I'm barely specced at all to make great use of but which is so damn fun to smack things around with that I don't care. Once I get through most of Mountaintops and grab the last Bell-Bearings I'm planning on having, I should be good to go for SOTE.\n\nAnd lastly, u/CookieSlut, u/The_Draigg, and I finally finished **Mobile Suit Gundam 00 S2**. Overall, I'd say the first season was a better story, but I enjoyed myself a lot more consistently through this one, even if I was mostly annoyed by the main villain. 00 as a whole struggled to keep my attention consistently the way the UC Gundams did, but the parts that worked were great, and I'm sufficiently hooked for the movie. >!As with the first season, we ended with what looked like a giant cast massacre, only for most of the main characters to be alive with little explanation. At least Tiera's stuck, and I don't have to be annoyed about my favorite character being shot by my least favorite villain because they're a moon computer now. Graham *should* have died last season, because Mr. Bushido was a complete narrative dead end, and he didn't even have the guts to kill himself right so I'll probably be dealing with him in the movie too. And, uh... ALIENS MENTIONED. LET'S GO ALIENS.!<",
            "Somehow managed to get sick again. Could be wildly inaccurate, but it is really starting to feel that June is just a terrible month for me. Hell, I even have the anniversary of my dad's passing coming in a few days.\n\nThat aside, it was interesting seeing the [wide variety of jobs that people on this sub have]1(https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/s/EVUMYYfll8). As for me, apparently, higher education is notorious for taking a while. And that is without it being summertime. \n\nI guess me getting an interview so quickly may have been a supreme stroke of luck, or they tried to push to get at least a few interviews through before people took vacations. What I do know is that the HR department seemed to be a skeleton crew since two of my calls went to voicemail since nobody was around, and another call had the person try to rush me off. \n\nI do customer service, so I had the impression that the person was either swamped or did not have access to anything for one reason or another. Still, they did finally take the listing down from LinkedIn and the site (not that LinkedIn had many applicants in the first place), and my application is still pending. Still praying I get it since I feel I have a decent chance, and I think there are multiple openings.",
            "[Last Week's Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/s/xlySonSoN1)\n\nWeek 16 of hospital. Not much to report in terms of recovery on that front; incremental increases with no major changes. On the other hand, rather excited by a number of reveals from the Nintendo Direct. Also my brother and I started planning for our mother's birthday next month.",
            "[Current Mood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGfyzSM0XSs)\n\nEven on the Northwest coast we're still getting a brief blast of that summer heatwave and *hoo boy* am I feeling it. That and seasonal allergies actually ended with me having to leave work early during one shift due to the heat+pollen combo overwhelming my meds. Guess its back to the masks again *juuuuuuuust* to be safe. At least its payday this week.\n\n**Exalted Essence** made its grand return with what was mainly a very Social session. We ended up escorting our dipshit Dynast kinda-sorta friend back to his wife and then things sorta... *socially escalated* during a sit-down with the two. As it turns out, our God-Blooded/Exigent PC's >!father was also the wife's father, making the two half-siblings and making the PC *way* more involved in Dynastic bullshit than anybody realized!!<, which also sent the wife into Limit Break due to connecting the dots that >!her father probably had been trying to keep her close so she wouldn't accidentally run into her bastard half-sibling!<. Also to cap off the session the Necromancer PC and my PC sent a message to our Lunar friend essentially going \"Hey we got some intel on your Solar friend, *for the love of god do not find us, we will come to you*\" because theres a lot of implication that Solar we (and the >!Infernal!<) are looking for may or may not >!be the Dynast couple's kid!< on top of all the other shit stack on top of that particular task. Shits getting *interesting*.\n\nFinished Season 3 of **Star Trek: Deep Space Nine**! *Holy shit* the back half of this season. After \"Life Support\" I'm all in on the \"*FUCK KAI WINN*\" camp, the B-plot of \"Heart Of Stone\" hit like a fucking truck when >!Nog explained why he wants to join Starfleet!<, the \"Improbable Cause\"/\"The Die Is Cast\" two-parter was basically \"Hey remember The Battle Of Wolf 359? Wanna >!see that happen to the two big antagonist organizations in the show this time?!<\" and *boy oh boy* that Season Finale. \"The Adversary\" was just peak \"oh yeah this is why the Changelings are so fucking dangerous\" wrapped up in a perfect The Thing homage package. Can't wait to continue to see where this all goes.\n\nFinished **LISA The Pointless** with a friend over this week. Not as thorough as I wanted it to be (Didn't get all of Lester's bounties), but for an unmodded non-SOTWS/Infinity Unfolds run, I still think I did pretty good at showing it off. Managed to get the >!high bond \"Joel actually tires shooting the bullet\"!< ending bit at least so I'm satisfied with that. Next up on the docket is **LISA The Hopeful!**. Not sure if I'll do >!all 4 character routes!< for that one, but I'll figure it out once I reach S P O R T S.\n\nSo..... against my better judgement I redownloaded **Borderlands 2**. I have no idea what gripped me to return to Greaseman Randy's Shooty Pit beyond a \"hey there was weird graphics stuff tied to the PC version. Lets see how that looks on the new rig\" and then whoops, I've spent most of the week playing it. Still not really sure how to feel about the franchise nowadays with all the retroactive debate and general.... well, [*gestures at the tire fire that is Gearbox and [Randy Pitchford's reputation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHesnoobl_I) nowadays*]. The game itself is still decently fun and I'll admit theres still some jokes in there I still laugh at. Just a shame that the franchise has been offhand tainted by the assholes within the studio that made it.\n\nMade some more **Assassins Creed 3** progress, by which I mean the >!awkward Father-Son bonding time between Haytham and Connor has come to it's entertaining end!<. Short but definitely an interesting section of the game since >!Connor and Haytham constantly are arguing amongst each other about their organization's philosophies!<. 3 more Sequences (give or take the last few Homestead missions) to go! I'm almost home free!\n\nNew Patch for **Honkai Star Rail** hit and just *really* rubbing it in that I'm not pulling for >!Firefly/Sam!< thanks to last patch's... *horseshoe* luck when it came to the ticket stockpile. I can wait for her rerun in the mean time. Speaking of mean and time (ha), priority right now is Relic/Trace grinding for >!Harmony Trailblazer!< since they just gave us that one free and I've heard they are *super* broken with certain characters like my resident Yee Haw boy (whos also starting to hit viablity once I've leveled his relics a tiny bit more). *I wanna make the numbers funnier*.",
            "**Boops Life:**  Got drunk for the first time and apparently that made me really fun to be around.  Now I've started taking edibles or drinking quite a bit whenever I'm at social gatherings, which probably isn't the healthiest relationship to have.  Maybe I'm just overthinking things, summer tends to bum me out a lot.\n\nAround a month ago, I took up running, but because I hate running when it's warm and because my sister has a +1 membership, I started going to a gym.  I've been going at least 3 times a week, and man, I hate it every time.  I thought I'd feel good eventually about it because people like to tout exercise as a fix all, but it's probably not for me in that sense.\n\nMan, that Direct was pretty good, huh?  Mario and Luigi, MvC, a new Mario Party that'll hopefully be good, Dragon Quest, etc.  Lots of things to be excited for.\n\n**Movies:**  Project Almanac.  I'm a sucker for time travel movies, so I checked this out even though I've heard middling thigs, but yeah, it wasn't very good.  It takes like 40 minutes for any time travel stuff to happen, and while some of it is fun, like going back to win the lottery or acing a quiz, most of it is spent at a concert.  Stuff happens at the end that feels like it was there just to add tension, even if it didn't make much sense.\n\nThe Venture Bros. Movie.  I've been putting this off for a while because it's the last Venture Bros content we'll get and that bums me out, but I finally decided to watch it.  While I thought it was enjoyable, it does very much feel like a season that was edited down to a movie.  There's a lot of things that I wanted to know more about, like the dude that was arching Jonas, but I get they likely didn't have the time they wanted for all of it.  There were characters I wanted to see more of, but again, limited time.\n\n**Games:**  Hi-Fi Rush.  What can I say, it's great and it bums me out we won't get a sequel.  If I had one complaint, it would be the lack of a lock on.  There were quite a few times I ended up grappling an enemy I didn't want to, but it wasn't a huge problem.  I also may have developed a small crush on Korsica.",
            "Well the only big event in my life atm if you can call it that is I won employee of the month at my restaurant job. Apparently all our leadership chefs collectively voted for me cuz these past few weeks have been pretty rough with a lot of changes to the menu and people quitting or getting fired and an entirely new staff that needs training. So between me working a double shift at one point and coming in on my days off and training/supporting new staff pretty much every sous chef ended up getting direct support from me at some point so they all nominated me this month. Our head chef even informed me I'm on her list of getting a raise so that's a plus too.\n\nOther than that I've been watching the latest season of demon slayer. Pretty fun overall. Lots of slow character moments and mainly comedy bits. Mushoku tensei traumatizing you with a very cruel >!episode releasing exactly on Father's day with some traumatic father related content in it!< Like it's been a long time since I've seen an anime episode that legit left me feeling so saddened inside. One of those just turn the TV off and stare at a wall and reflect silently over what just happened moments. Oh and mysterious disappearances is also ok. A little underwhelming if we're being honest tho. I kinda thought the mystery elements would be a bigger focus like anime Scooby Doo investigating mysteries and haunted locations and what not. It's more arc structured so like 2 or 3 episodes revolve around a single supernatural entity. Not bad necessarily but it just makes me wish the show was a little more focused so we could explore more supernatural occurrences.\n\nNothing really new game wise aside from trying to make time with a friend to co op resident evil 5 since she's never played it. She has a huge crush on Chris after playing her first RE game in village so I suggested 5 since it's co op and she can play as him again lol",
            "Well work was fucking tiring today and the month is almost out and still no anti depressants hahaha fuck\u2026 on a bit of a brighter note probably gonna play shadow of the erdtree this weekend so there\u2019s that I guess",
            "This week has been a weird one. I feel like I\u2019ve missed a day. Might be the ramune I\u2019ve been drinking causing this but I dunno. Anyhow!\n\n**Video Games:**\n\nAs such, it has been a weird week for games. I\u2019ve done some **Warframe** and **Monster Hunter: Rise**. I also tried out **Slug Gear**, **Into the Emberlands**, **Angeline Era** and **Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree**.\n\nSo. Warframe has dropped Jade Shadows. A whole quest around the favourite Dread giving Stalker. And uh. >!Guess who is now a father. Yeah. Stalker. It\u2019s a pretty good quest because it\u2019s such a weird one. The idea that Sorren (His actual name) would have a love is neat, but the fact that she is also a Warframe is just interesting. Because it means that he needs the help of the Tenno. Plus the fact the later end of it is just played with Sorren cradling his child is somewhat hilarious. Kicking ass with the Hate whilst keeping his kid safe in the other. And yes. Canonical pregnant warframe. de pls.!<\n\nSo. Whilst I\u2019ve barely done much of Rise, just a single hunt where Fluff, Dizzy and I killed five monsters in rather insane fashion. The major thing is that Fluff has experienced her first interaction with a very special monster. [Khezu](https://i.imgur.com/9ZHuy9I.gif). And lets say that her reactions to it were brilliant. Not helped by [myself](https://i.imgur.com/l5YvH2u.png) going just a little [mad](https://i.imgur.com/KmMJXZX.png) because of it.\n\nIt\u2019s not often that I find a demo just fine. Then the side thing of the dev just showing off stuff being the thing that makes me go \u201cYeah, I\u2019m wishlisting this.\u201d But god damn. I seriously recommend going to play Slug Gear. It\u2019s a pretty basic metroidvania but the combo room? That\u2019s where it showcases its hand.\n\nSo. Into the Emberlands is pretty weird. Because it\u2019s a game about effectively strategising movement and the like. With some minor resource management. But with a cute edge and with rebuilding a town in an almost post-apocalyptic place. It\u2019s weird but neat. I can\u2019t really explain it well but I just find it fun and enjoyable.\n\nAnd if you\u2019ve seen Iron Pineapple\u2019s recent Souls-Like video, you\u2019ve most likely seen this. Which is how I got recommended this and wanted to try it. And is it good? I mean yeah. It\u2019s pretty interesting but a little frustrating on Steam Deck. Mainly because of my sight but one of the main issues, is just readability of some of the stuff.\n\nSo. Shadow of the Erdtree is looking fantastic but uh. So far my time with it has been a weirdly mixed. Some of it my own fault but also just some weird stuff been happening. >!I got stuck on a boss that was in a higher level zone that was effectively accessible in the first zone, has a grab that basically heals them to full using your own health. Plus the damage you deal is like insanely low.!< Plus I also suffered my first blue screen in ages! How? Rolling into some boxes.\n\n**Other Stuff:**\n\nI don\u2019t often read physical manga, mainly as a lot of the stuff I own is stuff I read digitally then purchase after. But when I was out getting my piercings, I managed to get Goodbye, Eri. And well. It\u2019s brilliant. If you haven\u2019t read it, it\u2019s a great read. Trying to really explain it in any sort of my style would spoil a bunch of it. >!But an entire story about recording life and death is interesting and Eri herself is an interesting character. And just... A pinch of fantasy.!<\n\nAnd yeah, I\u2019m now up to 11 piercings now. [Spiderbites](https://i.imgur.com/lXGWGRC.jpg) are currently suffering a bit of swelling but that\u2019s kinda expected.\n\nI\u2019m also suffering a weird thing. Where the fuck do people get casual clothing these days. So, I\u2019ve got like 5 dresses I normally use that are in a more goth/witch sense. But I\u2019m thinking I need more actual like. Casual goth/witch stuff. But I legitimately have no idea where to get them because my usual sites don\u2019t really have the best selection for anything on that nature.\n\nMusic this week is from Shinra-Bansho, [Bye Bye, Rain](https://youtu.be/T5gN7zVSOgY?si=5aSHscTMwmkSdgSM).",
            "Hello! \n\nI finished Live A Live! \nThat was a legendary experience. \n\nI\u2019m also post covid snd back at work, but I still have sinus issues. \n\nAnd that\u2019s it really. Have a nice week!"
