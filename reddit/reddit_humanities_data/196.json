If the ECI succeeds the ban on conversion therapy will be directly proposed to the European Commission. This doesn't mean it's guaranteed to be enacted but it sure raises the chances!\n\nIf you're a citizen of the EU and above the age of 16 please consider signing!",

You all should see the other amazing bots from there like mixtape, hot wings, project liftoff, depth charge, Power of Friendship, and that one children hospital robot. I love this league, way better than battlebots imo. \n\nMost of the builders in battlebots are in NHRL too, and tons of people test their designs in the lower weight classes before going to the heavy weight classes in the televised ones, you\u2019ll see small original versions of robots like Huge and Sawblaze down here driven by the same team.
