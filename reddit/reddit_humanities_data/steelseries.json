            "Apex Pro: Update after firmware 4.15.7 / gg 63.0 lighting goes black / off, live preview doesn't work. I've tried rebooting, keyboard factory reset, reinstall GG software. Just borked, can't get any lighting configuration to stick. (while application is running) and even lighting turns off sometimes if app is not running (exited from tray). Was working perfect before update :(",
            "Firmware 4.15.7 messed up the lighting effects of the Apex Pro keyboard. Video demonstration here:  \nhttps://x.com/C0DEDEAD/status/1797040643396477038?t=yGP88j3eFEXGsB4n6sgoFA&s=19",

Making it so that GG \\*doesn't\\* start up with my PC appears to fix the problem. But starting GG causes the lights to turn off again.\n\nEdit: GG version 63.0, Apex Pro Firmware 4.15.7",
            "Last night, it said there was a critical update, so I updated it. After that, the keyboard turned off and didn't turn on anymore. It's plugged into my PC and is completely unresponsive. Apex pro",
            "Rocket league not working with SteelSeries Sonar since last update (yesterday) it only happens with this game. In the GAME channel on Sonar, the Rocket League source seems to \"flicker\" in and out. Here are fixes I've tried:\n\n- Turning pc off and back on\n\n- reinstalling rocket league\n\n- reinstalling steelseries gg\n\n- switching rocket league output from \"speakers\" to \"headphones\"   \n- checked all audio drivers\n\nI can hear the game fine when I disable SteelSeries Sonar. The software works fine with all other games, including games through Epic Games launcher.",
            "Chatmix still not synchronized with hardware wheel. Love it when I cant hear game coz software slider stuck all the way at chat.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rtrjzx7mrb4d1.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb31aa608e2681df767d05e99657fd7a0ec88de0",
            "Fix the GG app each update it becomes more and more broken, hire some proper support. I'm thinking the app being this shit is because of the people working on ir being not competent enough.",
            "Arctic 7+'s Issues when using sonar (using latest version of GG)\n\n  \nIts sort of hard to explain, but essentially sonar is making my audio glitch in a weird way. Audio feels like its \"bouncing around\". Volume will go up or down, switch from the left ear to the right and generally just bounce all over the place. Disabling sonar fixes the issue. Then it will fix itself for maybe a minute, then return to weirdness. Started maybe around 8 months ago.\n\n  \nRight now im going to try a factory reset on my pc. Hope it fixes it",
            "I was about to report a problem about Sonar changing all of its inputs and outputs to use my audio interface, rather than my Arctis Pro Wireless devices, upon waking from sleep. But then I remembered the device priority lists, and had a look there. Sure enough, the Arctic devices were all at the bottom of the list.\n\nThis started happening following my last reboot for Windows Update, and I think I also had a Steelseries update pending too.\n\nSo I've hopefully been able to fix it myself, but I figured I'd still put it here to help others who may be having the same problem, but to also bring it to Steelseries' attention, in case there's something they can do to prevent this from happening in the future."

            "Another update - another reinstall of GG software due to Sonar not switching devices based on the order that is set in the Backup Device Switch settings.\n\nI have the headphones on, but Sonar still picks up the speakers that I have on (which are the second device in the list after the headphones).\n\nProblem is - the reinstall is not helping anymore and the problem that was gone after the last reinstall is not going away. You would think that after all the complaints from users on reddit on how Sonar device switch is not working something would be done. \n\nHad a ticket with support, provided all the logs and evidence of the issues, and was told that it would be fixed in the next couple of releases. That was about 5-8 releases ago though..\n\nMaybe someone knows another workaround to get Sonar to work properly and pick up devices properly?\n\n  \nThank you"

I just got these today and I spent quite sometime messing around with the settings and such to make the audio sound relatively decent but somehow, my 80$ razer blackshark just sounds SO much better. This headset barely picks up game audio, plays spotify decently, but watching videos/twitch streams it just sounds atrocious. I'm at a lost to what to do, how to make it sound okay, if I missed any settings? Because something this much $ shouldn't be outperformed by an 80$ headset.",

I was very underwhelmed at the out of the box sound but as soon as I tuned it to my liking in sonar it became the nicest sounding headset I\u2019ve ever owned. Everyone prefers different sounds. I like bass heavy. I looked up a guide online and have a tune for music and a tune for gaming. Great headset."
