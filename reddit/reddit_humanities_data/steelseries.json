            "Apex Pro: Update after firmware 4.15.7 / gg 63.0 lighting goes black / off, live preview doesn't work. I've tried rebooting, keyboard factory reset, reinstall GG software. Just borked, can't get any lighting configuration to stick. (while application is running) and even lighting turns off sometimes if app is not running (exited from tray). Was working perfect before update :(",
            "Apex Pro: I'm also experiencing the issue of all lighting turning off following the GG/firmware updates. Not sure which one caused it, as I updated both together. Making it so that GG \\*doesn't\\* start up with my PC appears to fix the problem. But starting GG causes the lights to turn off again.\n\nEdit: GG version 63.0, Apex Pro Firmware 4.15.7",
            "Last night, it said there was a critical update, so I updated it. After that, the keyboard turned off and didn't turn on anymore. It's plugged into my PC and is completely unresponsive. Apex pro",
            "Is there a way to revert my apex pro to a previous firmware version because the latest one is causing issues with keystrokes not being registered and there's also a noticeable lag on key illumination after being pressed.",
            "I pretty often, when low battery, charge my headphone (artis 7 wireless) while using it and it always work until today.   \nToday I started not seeing at all the \"Artis 7 chat\" and \"Artis 7 game\" in the windows audio output dropdown bar or in the device manager. any idea why?",
            "Having problems with key illumination with the latest firmware on my Apex Pro keyboard. Pressing keys like Caps Lock or Num Lock result in a delay between pressing the key and the light under the key changing. Can record a video if needed.",
            "I have a PC, Switch, and PS5 all in different parts of the house-with the Arctis Nova Pro Wireless do I have to connect the base station to both the Switch and PS5 for these headphones to work with them, or can I utilize the bluetooth function in the headset to connect to my consoles while keeping the base station connected to my PC?",
            "Is there a way to change the color of the meta-binding keys while holding the steelseries / metalayer button? I use a static red-ish color and the orange meta layer color is really hard to spot.",
            "Steelseries stops recording Destiny 2 after a few seconds now with new update.",
            "Just ran a Windows update and now the Steel Series GG isn't detecting my Sonar headset. Tried restarting, reinstalling the interface - no dice. The computer itself detects it and is showing activity but it's not giving me any sound."

THE REALLY BAD - My 2 month old 7X headphones failed.   Started an RMA and over a month and innumerable messages later my RMA was approved - but not really!   Went to the website to provide my serial number it was not accepted.   Sent a screenshot to CS.  A week goes by and more requests.   This was just another runaround.   The RMA was closed. THE MORAL OF THIS STORY IS TO NEVER PURCHASE A STEELSERIES PRODUCT. ",

            "The sound is a bit better, the drivers (speakers) are not the same. \n\nBut if you're not actually planning on having multiple devices connected to the dock and using the features then the price is not worth it. \n\nThe wired version sounds better fyi."
