        "content": "I barely even remember last night. All I know is I was sad (just broke up with my boyfriend of 3 years who I'm still in love with), and I was very drunk. I had just spent the better part of 20 min sobbing at the bar we were at, and was very out of sorts. I don't even remember why I was taking a cab back all alone, but somehow I ended up in one, and the cab driver was all up in my face telling me how pretty I was, that he wanted to take me on a date etc. I guess I was so drunk I entertained this behavior, and even flirted back. He was old enough to be my dad, and absolutely gross. But for some reason I let him take me into the bushes and f\\*ck me. He wanted to walk me home, but I remember not wanting him to know where I live and insisting on going on my own. He said he was worried for me, but if you can't trust me to make it home on my own how could you trust me to consent to sex? Somehow I made it alright. I woke up this morning and at first thought it had all been a bad dream. I haven't slept with very many people in my life at all, and am still very heartbroken, so hooking up with someone was not my plan at all. But then I saw he requested to follow me on instagram, and reality came crashing down. I feel grosser than I've ever felt, this is probably the worst thing I've ever done and I could not be more disgusted with myself right now. All I want to do is cry. \n\n",

            "Seconding everything on STD and PEP, thats incredibly important. I would also recommend a pregnancy test (by a physician) if your cycle is disrupted, although it might be from stress anyways, they would be able to tell. If youre ovulating and are concerned about the possibility, Plan B ASAP. Most importantly though, please take care of yourself, take the time you need to process everything and spend time with loved ones soon, if youve thought of it, isolating yourself isnt what you need. If youre able to, speaking with a mental health professional about this to process would only help. I know youre gonna get through this ",

Ofc, get std tested like the others were saying for your own safety, but please try not to be so hard on yourself!! Its gross on HIM for hooking up with you while you were clearly under the influence and he was sober. Youre in a very new, vulnerable time in your life, where its easy to act on emotion. Time heals all. Some advice, take it or leave it, but maybe try to cut back on the alcohol for a little while, even though thats probably the last thing you want to do while going through a breakup, but the alcohol will make you feel worse about the situation, and probably yourself. Its called a depressant for a reason. You got this girl, stay strong",

        "content": " Throughout my entire life as most men have, I have been burdened by the struggles of pornography. As a straight male,  some of you would be astonished at the disturbing things I have watched out of boredom. I would spend a vast proportion of my indulging in various types of porn and then mindlessly scrolling through TikTok, repeating this cycle countless times from the moment I woke up until I went to sleep. \n\n My introduction to pornography happened in second or third grade when I glanced over the seat on the bus and saw some kids in my grade watching a website called redtube. Curiosity led me to sit next to them, one event that would butterfly me into the worst decision of my life, even though I had no idea what I was watching.But despite that, I was drawn to it, but it didn't become an addiction right away. However, I was aware of its presence, and watched it occasionally if I was alone throughout my elementary days, and as I entered puberty and experienced the natural urges of adolescence, I knew where to look. \n\n In health class, they warned us about addictions to smoking and drugs, as well as how to stay sexually safe physically. Unfortunately, my ignorance of how to stay sexually safe mentally took a toll on me as I progressed through the grades. I found myself becoming more and more attached to pornography. It was during my tenth-grade year that I realized it had become a problem that needed to be fixed. However, I couldn\u2019t take the necessary steps to stop this harming habit. I couldn't keep my hands off myself, and the cycle continued relentlessly.  And it wouldn\u2019t stop there even if when I managed to abstain from watching porn for a few days, I would try to replace it by downloading various apps in search of alternative forms of entertainment. But I was just replacing smoking with drinking, my lack of discipline when it came to my sexual desires always led me back to pornography. \n\nNow, I am exhausted, very exhausted. I despise myself to the core and can barely tolerate my own presence. Therefore I should quit what I\u2019m doing right? I should be determined to quit, but nope, pleasure over Purity. Although there\u2019s another way,  and this time it will be different. Until now, I have never shared my complete past with anyone. No one truly knows me, and I don't even know the real me. It's a very terrifying realization. But merely declaring that I will quit because I am sad has proven shitty in the past. Willpower alone has also failed me. So, what can I try that will miraculously work? Seeking professional treatment has always been out of the question because I would probably wanna die. So there it is I\u2019m afraid to let anyone know the truth about me. However, something has dawned on me. I don't actually hate myself because I don't know who I am. I have been layering and layering all this filth and trash upon myself, but it's not truly me. It may sound dumb, but I believe it might actually work. I have never felt this clean before. The reason I have been disgusted with myself is because of all the things I have done and seen. Any person would be repulsed and feel pity for me.\n\n I didn't have a normal upbringing, constantly surrounded by how should I say\u2026specific\u2026 content from the moment I was born. My family despised me because my male life giver was a drug dealer. When my mother and the male life giver broke up, I was almost kidnapped by him at the age of three. As a result, I was confined indoors and became an \"iPad kid.\" Let me tell you, when you take a child who is completely isolated from the outside world, unable to enjoy the wonders of nature, and provide them with a device capable of accessing almost anything, it's no surprise that a nine-year-old could become engulfed in a virtual world far beyond their years. And believe me, there is so much more to my story. Countless specific events led to my mother's strictness into not allowing me to leave the house or have contact with others. My family dynamic is incredibly messed up. But now, I am determined to give my true self a chance to live. Things are going to change. If you got any tips or advice I\u2019m all ears on my new journey.",
