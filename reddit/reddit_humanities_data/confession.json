A few years ago, I started a new job and when meeting my coworkers I was speaking with a faux Spanish accent. I don\u2019t have any idea why I did it, maybe nervousness. Anyway, I\u2019ve been doing it ever since I got hired, and now it\u2019s almost effortless to speak with an accent. That isn\u2019t the part I regret though\u2026 lately, as I\u2019m meeting new people and feel more comfortable talking to people, I get asked almost daily where I\u2019m from. I\u2019ve noticed people seem really confused if I tell them I\u2019m from the area and usually say \u201coh, but you sound like you are from South America or somewhere.\u201d So, as of recently I just tell people I\u2019m from Argentina, since that\u2019s easy enough for them to buy and not pester me about it. I feel like such a scumbag for lying but I feel I\u2019m in too deep to stop now. ",

She would also give me attitudes when I would take PTO which was like 2 days every other month and she even told me one time that if I didn\u2019t wanna work then McDonald\u2019s was hiring down the street. Was weird because I was literally outperforming the rest of the team and they would take more PTO than I would. \n\nGot sick of her mess and decided to be petty and didn\u2019t even give her the courtesy of 2 week notice. She didn\u2019t deserve that. Instead, I smiled at her and handed her a 2 day notice at the end of the day on a Tuesday which stated, \u201cThank you for the opportunity to work here. My last day will be Thursday\u201d to which she said, \u201cAlright, I see how it is\u201d. Fridays were our most busiest days of the week so I purposefully decided to quit a day before then so I could teach her a lesson so she could feel the pressure of my absence and learn from her mistakes. Had a job lined up after that so I didn\u2019t really care. \n\nAt the end of the day on Thursday, she didn\u2019t even say goodbye. She was like \u201cGo clock out now\u201d and I said \u201cOh okay\u201d with a slight grin on my face and those were the last words we ever spoke to each other lmao. Was laughing up a mf storm on the walk back to my car because I knew she would get slammed with a crap ton of work the next day and I wouldn\u2019t be there to pick up the slack.
