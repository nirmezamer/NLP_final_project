We've historically hit you with a  strike (\ud83d\udd34) and if you received three, you were permabanned (check out the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoSentenceHorror/wiki/rules/#wiki_red_dot_warnings.3A)).\n\nHowever, if you've submitted one of these stories in the recent past, you may have noticed that your account was permabanned from TwoSentenceHorror without going through the strike process. While we've made this current one-and-done rule known within each of our monthly announcements for forever, we felt it was only fair to have a separate post to lay out the approach.\n\n# If you intentionally submit a poor quality story (we're looking at you \"meat worm\" and \"killer guy\" crews), you will be permabanned with no warning.\n\nIf and when these posts chill out, the mod team will reconsider this rule. Until then, please continue to report these intentional poor quality stories, read the sub rules, and submit awesome, horrifying tales to maintain the quality of the sub!",

        "content": "Happy June!\n\nBefore we get into this month\u2019s prompt, here's a few announcements for your pleasure and enjoyment:\n\nANNOUNCEMENTS\n\n* Big thank you to those who helped flag rule breaking posts this month! We're still seeing troll posts and appreciate everyone's help keeping an eye out for posts that don't fit the sub.\n* We are continuing to remove most posts about gratuitous sexual violence as per Rule 7: Overused Tropes.\n* We're also removing stories that use spoiler tags, spoiler marks, or irrelevant NSFW tags, as these constitute formatting gimmicks, again as per Rule 7.\n* Obvious\ud83d\udca9-posters will be permabanned! Read more\u00a0[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoSentenceHorror/comments/17e39nq/please_read_shtposts_permabans_and_literally_1984/).\n* Lastly, be familiar with our Three Strikes and you're out rule-- trolling or sexualizing minors will typically get you a strike. If you earn a \ud83d\udd34, it will take 60 days of chill to clean it up. Read more\u00a0[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoSentenceHorror/wiki/rules/#wiki_red_dot_warnings.3A).\n\n# JUNE 2024 Contest Prompt\n\nFor those in the Northern Hemisphere June holds the Summer Solstice, where the night is at its shortest. Dusk is pushed back and the dawn comes early-- all that daylight seems to invite every manner of celebration.\n\nWeddings, reunions, and parties in general all see an uptick this time of year and of course: those who've completed their study programs celebrate their graduation.\n\nAnd there's our theme and our prompt for this month's contest:\n\n*graduation*\n\nYou must use the word or its reasonable variations/ derivations (ex: graduates, grads, graduated, etc). While the theme refers to graduation in the academic sense, we'll also accept definitions relating to metrics (graduated income tax, graduated cylinders, etc). \n\n\n\n**However: to meet the prompt you must use \"graduated\" or it's derivations. Unfortunately, words that aren't derived from \"graduation\" don't fit this month's theme. So a story using** ***gradually, graded, gradient, degrade, Stalingrad,*** **etc won't be included in the final ranking.**\n\nWhile you're of course more than welcome to use these (or other g-r-a-d words) as broader two sentence horrors, please do not tag them as contest entries.\n\nThis theme is less flexible than last month's, so we anticipate a more difficult challenge and wish everyone the best of luck!\n\nPS: Congrats and job well done to anyone graduating this month :)\n\nOf course, entries will always be weighed against sub rules!\n\n**Properly formatted June 2024 examples:**\n\n\\[JUN24\\] I chose this month's prompt to brag about my upcoming graduation from murder school! By the end of this month I'll have a bachelors degree in killing!\n\n\\[jun24\\] This is the first sentence. Please don't let that distract you from the fact that this month I'm graduating from murder school!\n\n**Improperly formatted examples**:\n\n\\[june2024\\] The 'e' in June and the '20' in 2024 make this a doubly incorrect tag. I'm afraid this shameful error will cast a negative light on my graduation from murder school.\n\n\\[JUN24\\] This time the tag is right. But I forgot to include the prompt because I'm so overtired from all the hours I put into the lab practical in Killing 101.\n\n**June 2024 Contest Rules**\n\n* Submissions that are improperly formatted, do not fit the theme, or break any of the existing sub rules will be disqualified and removed.\n* The top 10 highest-voted stories will be the winners!\n* Winners can only place in the top 10 once. The highest of the entries will be their winner.\n* Only net new stories will be allowed (no repurposing old stories you've previously submitted).\n* Max three stories per day as a general rule, and all three can be used towards the contest.\n* Winners will be decided by total community upvotes. In the unlikely event of a tie for the top spots, moderators will vote for a tiebreaker.\n\n**WINNERS WILL RECEIVE:**\n\n1st, 2nd, and 3rd Places: You receive a custom personal flair of your choosing to show off to the TSH community! (If you're a repeat winner, you can modify your flair.... but that's it.) And a cool fancy flair on your winning stories.\n\n7 honorable mentions: you'll get visibility and bragging rights! Story links will be featured on next month\u2019s announcement.\n\nContest ends on June 30, 2024 @ 11:59pm (GMT)\n\nAny questions should be made below in the comments, within our\u00a0[discord](https://discord.gg/FZ5dVfxsD6), or a note on\u00a0[modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/TwoSentenceHorror).\n\nLots of great stories this month,\u00a0**congrats to May's winners in the comments below**!",

            "This was neither 2 sentences \nNor horrifying",
            "I have a question. What's a \"relevant\" nsfw tag and do we need to use it, compulsorily? If this whole sub is nsfw (and if it isn't it should be), then using an nsfw tag on any post here is redundant, right? \ud83e\udd14",
            "I have a quick question about the prompt. Does it have to be a derivative of \"graduation\" or could I use the word gradually?",
            ":) \n\n  \nwell earned, good work!",
            "Hey boss you deserve it. Your story was awesome",
            ":)",
            "Hey Ghost, that's a great question. \n\nTo be utterly transparent I've always thought NSFW tags on a text based sub were kind of silly. If we think of nsfw tags as denoting graphic visuals, then they shouldn't apply here ever. If we think of nsfw tags as denoting themes you shouldn't talk about at work, then you're right: all the stories here ought to be tagged which makes the use redundant. \n\nThe way I see it the only sensible use for nsfw tags on this sub specifically would probably be to flag stories that deal with sexual themes. While we don't require use of nsfw tags in such cases, the mod team was deliberate about still allowing their use. When the mod team discussed these tags we agreed that we should still allow them as they constitute a built in reddit user safety feature, which we don't want to interfere with. \n\nBut there's lots of room for interpretation as to what counts as relevant use, so perhaps the other mods might add better insights. \n\nAnyway, we try our best to weigh stories that use those tags in good faith. If a story seems to use the tags as a formatting gimmick to catch reader's eyes, then it will likely be removed. \n\n(also worth noting, we generally remove most stories dealing with sexual assault as overused tropes, so a large number of stories that might make relevant use of NSFW tags may still be removed regardless).",
            "Thanks for asking!\n\nUnfortunately, words that aren't derived from \"graduation\" don't fit this month's theme. So a story using \"gradually\" won't be included in the final rankings. Same goes for other words that considerably shift from the original prompt (graded, gradient, degrade, Stalingrad, etc). \n\nWhile you're of course more than welcome to use these (or other g-r-a-d words) as broader two sentence horrors, please do not tag them as contest entries. \n\n  \nI'll update our announcement to clarify this."
