            "We've stolen another player off Kings Lynn, prompting a further twitter meltdown from their chairman. \n\nStarting to have slight concerns about the profile of our squad, our transfer strategy has pretty much entirely been taking a punt on players who've played well in lower leagues and/or played for our gaffer at Kings Lynn. I can see what the thinking is, especially given the success we had with Stokes, but my worry would be if you sign all your players from leagues below then you end up with a squad that's lower league quality across the board if none of them step up.\n\nRowe, Harries and O'Keefe have all left and while none of them were particularly good they made up like 90% of the experience in our squad between them so we could do with getting someone with some nous in. Given the money we made on Stokes and the cup last year we should have the cash to bring in one older player on a higher wage but our board have been notoriously stingy recently.\n\nCurrently also waiting on whether Glover and Tetek sign new deals. Both would be big losses if they don't because Glover was at times our best player last season and Tetek for the handful of games he was fit for was by far our best midfielder.",
            "Could anyone from Norway tell me what's wrong with Aalesund?\n\nThey've been doing just fine in the top tier for as long as I can remember... After the relegation they are doing terrible in second tier now as well. I see they just fired the manager. Their squad doesn't look that bad either for this level. Is it just an unlucky start and managerial issues? Or do they have financial problems?",
            "I don\u2019t get the Olise transfer. Bayern and have 3 players now that want the ball at their feet. They need outlets. Should have signed someone like Neto instead.",
            "How do you get a flair?",
            "PT Liga Indonesia is a joke",
            "France - NL really made it clear to me that something needs to change. It's a travesty that games of this caliber can be this atrociously boring and bad just because they both are fine with 0-0.",
            "I think it\u2019s in the sidebar, or you can mail the moderator",
            "really an exaggeration. The Netherlands could've won with the offside goal, France could've won with Griezmann's chances - and they're missing Mbapp\u00e9, and they've only scored 1 (OG) in two games anyways. I've seen worse games too.",
            "You will always have these type of games with a group stage. If it was the last game and they were tied then they would probably go for it but as the 2nd game both tied with 3pts and Austria winning, not losing is more important than winning for both teams.",
            "16 shots, two gigantic occasions that should have never been missed...\n\nDo not mistake our abysmal finishing for a lack of drive to win the game. We absolutely played for the 3 pts but didn't rise up to the occasion."
