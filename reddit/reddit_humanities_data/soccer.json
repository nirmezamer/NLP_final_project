Discussion must be of ***your local team*** \\- whether they were you local growing up, or are your local now\n2. Discussion of PL teams is allowed ***only if you are attending the match that weekend*** \\- and hence focused on the match day experience\n3. ***Keep a high bar.*** This is not the DDT. If you want to troll, bait, or shit-talk like it's Football Twitter, use the DDT. Or even better - use Twitter.",

But I saw some pictures from Georgia where they put giant tvs on their national stadium.\n\nI thought that was super clever, and obviously not the first time it has been done, but for us, okay they didn't expect this Euro to be this historic, but we (in Bucharest) have like 2 actual places that are overcrowded and small with a TV, excluding pubs of course."
