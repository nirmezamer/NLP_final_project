        "content": "**Should I buy TLoU pt1?**\n\nYes. It's one of the most awarded and critically acclaimed games of all time. Yes, it's still good.\n\n**Which version should I buy?**\n\nThere is the ps3 original, then the Ps4 remaster which comes with the (incredible) DLC and somewhat better graphics, and then the Ps5/PC remake which also comes with the DLC and vastly updated graphics. You should buy the newest one you can afford, but you shouldn't worry if you can't get that one, because there's not all *that* much difference. It doesn't matter if you get it on Playstation or PC. It should be noted that the Ps5/PC Remake doesn't include Factions, the multiplayer mode, so the remastered may be a better bet if you'd really like to play it.\n\n**Has the PC version been fixed?**\n\nYeah. \n\n**Should I buy TLoU pt2?**\n\nYes. It's one of the most awarded and critically acclaimed games of all time. Yes, it's still good.\n\n**But I heard some people say it was bad?**\n\nThere was a great internet shitstorm near the time of release. I won't get into the reasons why, but to sum it up: the game is a massive critical and commercial success, and the scores are very high in websites that only let those who purchased the game rate it. In websites that let anyone rate it (including those who haven't played), its scores are much lower, suggesting that much (though not all) of the hate comes from those who never played it. Nevertheless, there is a chance you may not like it - here is a quote from the lead writer:\n\n>\"Some of [the fans of the original game] are not going to like this game, and not like where it goes, and not like what it says or the fate of characters that they love,\" Druckmann said. \"I'd rather have people passionately hate it than just be like, 'Yeah, it was OK.'\"\n\nYou will have to decide for yourself. If you are unsure, look up the dozens of posts asking the same question; don't make yet another post asking it again. Naturally, most opinions here will be positive, but hopefully people can explain why. Be warned that in doing this you may stumble upon spoilers; we don't allow them in untagged posts, but sometimes they slip through.\n\n**Is pt2 still worth it if I had the big reveals spoiled?**\n\nYes. The real meaty, emotionally intense parts are rarely mentioned in those spoilers; instead, people just talk about the same 2-3 moments nonstop. In any case, it\u2019s a really fun game and you should experience it for yourself, as that\u2019s very different from hearing about it; it\u2019s not a game in which the story impact comes just from shock value, but rather from subtler stuff.\n\n**Okay. Which version of pt2 should I buy?**\n\nThere is the original pt2 version, which runs on both Ps4 and Ps5, and then the Remaster coming out for ps5 which will have slightly improved graphics, faster loading times, and also some new features and game modes, such as Speedrun Mode and No Return, a \"roguelike survival mode\" which lets you play with other characters, some extra \u201cLost Levels\u201d that weren\u2019t included in the base game, and other miscellaneous stuff like guitar free play. In any case, the base story is unchanged between them, so once again you shouldn't worry if you can't afford the newest one. If you already have the Ps4 version, [you can upgrade to the Ps5 version for 10 USD](https://www.naughtydog.com/blog/the_last_of_us_part_ii_remastered_announcement). This option will be available once the game releases.\n\n**Should I play the games if I've already watched the show?**\n\nYes. The games differ from the show in some key ways, and the performances from the original cast are incredible.\n\nWe'll be removing future posts asking these same questions for the near future. Hope you understand. If you see any posts like this, feel free to drop a link to this one in the comments and report the post.",

        "content": "Unfortunately, the TLOU2 remaster seems to have introduced quite a few bugs that were not present in the original release. This is fine, since some things are always missed, but I thought I'd make a thread for people to post any of the bugs they've run into in game to hopefully increase the chances that Naughty Dog will learn of these issues and patch them. So far, I have experienced or seen people mention the following:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* In No Return mode, some characters are unable to change their weapon skins for some reason. If you try to select any of the different weapon skins, the game will make the \"locked\" noise and you'll be stuck on whatever skin you had equipped at the time of the glitch occurring. I've personally seen this with Jesse, Yara, and Mel so far, but it may happen with other characters too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Enemy dialogue that would play at the start of and during Abby's brewery encounter on day 3 no longer triggers. The WLF soldiers would call out Abby for betraying them and talk about Owen doing the same briefly, but now none of the enemy dialogue throughout this encounter triggers at all. (I'm also wondering if there's any other missing/broken dialogue).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Ellie's \"Boston\" skin from promotional material seems to be missing from the game entirely. It's unable to be seen or selected in any of the menus. While it's possible this was cut prior to release, it would be very strange since the skin looked finished and was very recently seen in the marketing prior to release. Additionally, Abby's Santa Barbra skin does not use the correct backpack model despite the menu indicating that it should. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Skins seem to not be applying for multiple users correctly in story mode.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The main menu won't change back to the original boat in the water look after starting a new game.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I've not experienced this myself, but No Return seems to cause major frame drops for many players. Personally, I'm really curious what's causing this as it only seems to affect some people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Some users report being unable to escape from grapples despite mashing the square button as prompted by the game.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you know of any other bugs, please feel free to list them here! I'm not sure if Naughty Dog often responds to support requests, but you could still try filling out one [here](https://feedback.naughtydog.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Most of these bugs aren't game breaking, but hopefully Naughty Dog still learns of them and takes the time to fix them as some of these are pretty unfortunate. ",

Sounds like I was really lucky in that regard.\n\nEdit: ND just responded to me and said they are aware and looking into the following bugs: not receiving points after completing a story run, menu not resetting to boat after starting a new non-new game + story, and WLF not speaking during the late game brewery encounter.",

Well, actually, maybe if it's only animals that are closely related to humans like chimpanzees/bonobos/etc. lol\n\nAnyway, I mainly just want new types of Infected that are created based off the environment they grew in like how Shamblers are created because of exposure to high amounts of water instead of the typical dry environments",
            "Nope. Leave the animals alone.",
