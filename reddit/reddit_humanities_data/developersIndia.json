        "content": "We are revising posts themes that are allowed in the forum under [rule no 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/about/rules). Moving forward the following types of posts & comments will no longer be allowed.\n\n1. **App screenshots**\n   - Screenshots that show something weird/incorrect/wrong. E.g., notification screenshots because you get bugged-out notifications.\n   - This includes adding screenshots of your conversations with someone etc.\n   - Asking why a \"web portal\" is not working, developersIndia is not tech support, please email support of products you are using, no need to post that here.\n2. **\u201cNews\u201d posts without source**\n    -  News without valid source links is not allowed.\n    -  Screenshots don't count as a valid source.\n    -  Screenshots of Tweets (Posts from X) are not valid news sources unless they are from the creator of a package/app/tool/company etc.\n    -  Source links shoudl not be behind a paywall.\n3. **Screenshots of Job Posts from LinkedIn/Job-portals**\n    - We are well aware of how companies don't know how to post jobs on LinkedIn, pay peanuts, or mention YoE incorrectly. There is no need to share that here. It's a lost battle.\n    - No need to post screenshots of _how many applicants_ are there for a job, we are aware times are tough, and there's no need to share that sentiment again & again.\n4. **Diversity hiring-related discussions**\n    - Very young members in the industry seem to complain about this because why not hire \"based on skills\"?\n    - Unfortunately, the reality is that women are still underrepresented in tech, and discussions around this are counterproductive. However, we encourage discussions around initiatives or solutions to balance the scale.\n    - Any rants regarding this will be removed.\n5. **Discussions around tech influencers/creators**\n    - There's no need to share your hate towards one specific creator, some of them run a business, and some share their learnings because they care about the ecosystem. Stop following people whose opinions/advice you don't like.\n    - Avoid sharing e-lafdas within the creator community as long as they don't affect the outside ecosystem. (e.g. the express.js drama was allowed because it affected the maintainers of the expressjs project)\n    - \"Course Reviews\" are however allowed, feel free to post (or request) a review of a course you bought from an independent tech creator.\n6. **Posts about cheating in interviews or Faking work experience.**\n    - Any conversations/posts supporting any of these topics will be removed.\n    - If you are in trouble for cheating/faking anything, that's on you.\n7. **Unncessary mention of gender or age**\n    - This was already put in action 5 months ago. Please [read our full announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/1ahsa8l/posts_containing_unnecessary_mention_of_gender/) on this.\n\n---\n\nSince this rule is generic, its definition will change with time, keep an eye on announcements to see what other types of posts may come under this. **Always visit the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/about/rules) thoroughly before posting anything**.\n\n_Subreddit Volunteer Team_",

He also mentioned that he likes my efforts and I've been outstanding!\n\nI gave a thought about ignoring or not ignoring it, and then ended up saying that I would ignore this incident and asked for the guidelines to not come across such incidents in future.

My monthly in hand salary is 18400. This year since January I have not received any payment the company is saying that the client is delaying the payment and blaming us. The last amount which I received was 7000 INR for the month of April(they said they will give 50% payment) after that I didn\u2019t receive anything. Most of us are working from home since March as they are not able to pay the rent. The company laid off some employees on February and said that the situation will return to normal after March and new projects are in pipeline. But so far no new projects have been allocated and seniors from both android and ios teams have left the company. I have attended some interviews but most of them low balled me. The max package they gave me was 4LPA for Pune location. I got an offer from a Bengaluru based company for 5LPA in Malleshwaram area. I need to move from Chennai to Bengaluru did I low ball myself for 5LPA? Should I take the offer or   wait for better offers within Chennai. In my current company there is no sign of releasing salary and we have submitted the project to client and client said OK but no payment till now. ",

I started from scratch, not knowing the syntax of any programming language. This opportunity allowed my employer to teach me everything. He began assigning tasks, and I learned as needed.

If he wants to stay in IT start building projects not TODO applications but something more commercial. Get good or go home. Getting into too much of tutorials and DSAs related things will only overwhelm him further and cause mental health issues. Tell him to take small steps."
