        "content": "Hi r/developersIndia,\n\nI'm Sathyajith Bhat, but most call me Sathya (or SathyaBhat).\n\nI currently work as a Staff Software Engineer at The Trade Desk in Sydney, Australia. I was born and completed my education from the small city of Mangalore, Karnataka. I started tinkering with computers back in 1997 when my dad purchased my first computer featuring a blazing-fast Pentium 100 MHz Processor, a whopping 16MB of RAM and a 1GB hard disk.\n\nAs with most folks, I completed my grudation as an Electronics Engineer (because it had more \"scope\") and got my first job at 3i Infotech Ltd, a former subsidiary of ICICI Bank via off-campus interview (because my overall GPA low enough that I couldn't sit in placements). In my first job, I worked as a release engineer, preparing release/patch notes (back then CI/CD etc weren't a thing). I picked up a knack for finding out the root cause of problems and weird bugs, a challenge that I enjoyed very much leading to my eventual transition to DevOps with StyleTag back in 2015 and then to SRE at Adobe in 2017. Over my 17 years of experience, I've worked in a variety of roles from development, manual testing, client liaison, and of late SRE.\n\nIn my free time, I used to spend a lot of time working with different communities, organizing events and meetups such as AWS Community Day, CDK Day, and Barcamp Bangalore. I was one of the early private beta user of Stack Overflow, and eventually became a Community Moderator at [Super User](https://superuser.com). For my contributions to the AWS Community, I'm recognized as an [AWS Container Hero](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/heroes/sathyajith-bhat/).\n\nI'm also an author, having written two editions of Practical Docker with Python and a co-author of The CDK Book. In my free time, I play a lot of games (usually ARPGs) and have some [minor sideprojects](https://github.com/sathyabhat). I used to blog quite a bit but has reduced a lot but you can follow my blogs:\n\n* Tech blog at https://sathyasays.com\n* Personal blog at https://sathyabh.at\n\nFor a detailed  write up of my career you can read this you can read this interview transcript on SRE Stories - https://www.srestories.dev/p/sre-story-with-sathya-bhat.\n\nHere's [my post on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sathyabhat_devops-sre-cloud-activity-7209924423817076737-bw-6?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) to verify my handle.\n\n\ud83d\udcac Ask me about AWS, Cloud Computing, Containers, DevOps, Technical Writing or anything else - I will try my best to answer.\n\n----\n\nOk I'm going to take a break for the day as it's getting late and dinner time. Thanks for having me, and if there's some questions I haven't answered, I will reply tomorrow. You can reach me on Twitter, LinkedIn, Discord or email - I will try my best to answer. Contact details are at https://sathyabh.at/about/\n\nThank you everyone!\n\n",

        "content": "So I had a really bad interview experience... it was a walk-in interview and other candidates were there too. They were coming out in like 10 minutes and said they got asked easy stuff about their core skills and tech stack or whatever was on their resume. So I thought, 'Cool, this will be easy.'\n\nBut when it was my turn, there were two guys, and one asked for my resume. I accidentally handed him two because I panicked, and he said, 'Did I ask for two?' It was so rude, and from then on he seemed annoyed. I could tell from his face that I was in trouble.\n\nThis guy asked me WAY TOO MUCH in detail... too many niche topics. I'd say out of 30 questions I knew like 22. Then he made me solve three LeetCode medium questions on paper. I solved them because I knew those as I had already solved them before. But then he told me to write a whole machine learning code from preprocessing, to make a model and plot a graph - really deep stuff, ALL ON PAPER. I messed up there because he only gave me like 5-10 minutes for something that would've taken at least 20 or more.\n\nHe asked so much that I was like, 'Is this Google?' It didn't feel like an entry-level interview. While I was writing code, these guys were saying stuff to each other like, 'He doesn't know what he's doing' and 'It's wrong.' I admit I'm new to machine learning and I messed up a few syntaxes because Python is not great, and it was hard to focus on writing code when they were constantly criticizing. I don't know why they were only upset with me.\n\nAfter 40 minutes, they told me to wait for the HR round. In the HR round, the HR person was just talking and asking others questions, but in mine, the annoyed guy came and teamed up with HR to lecture me about small stuff that doesn't even matter.\n\nThis was my first ever tech interview and I'm really discouraged. They also asked a lot of stuff like 'How is this your first interview? Your college doesn't have placements?' I'm from a tier 3 college and you know how bad the market is. The only companies that came to my college were some digital marketing and no tech-related ones, so I never got a chance to interview before. Off-campus, it's really hard to stand out from the crowd.\n\nWhatever it was, it showed me I need to work on myself a lot, but I'm kind of sad because this company was my top priority and I messed up. It will be hard to get an opportunity like this because as a fresher it's hard to even get shortlisted. But at least now I know how much I fumble under stress and panic and have to work on that a lot",

Tech interviews are such a scam. All that seems to matter is whether you practiced for the questions that appeared in the interview.\n\nAny non standard question I used to ask generally lead to awkward loops for the candidates and a waste of my time.

I was just wondering what are my options in the future moving forward. I know future is quite unpredictable but still I just want to know what are the possibilities so I don't end up wandering after maybe 1.5 - 2 yrs. I am in a doubt that should I continue grinding myself in the software field or look for other options maybe 2yrs down the line. Had given 15+ interviews more than 25 technical rounds majority of the interviews went decent and I was rejected in the hr round 6-7 times. Also once a really good offer was revoked (not Atlassian). First I thought I wasn't good enough or I had some serious flaws but being honest I am not someone arrogant or mean a person and I try my best to be in a professional behavior whenever I give any interview. Just seems like the job market in this industry is so fucking unpredictable and unstable not sure about what should I do as I am the only earning member in my family, though my family is self sufficient and as of now I don't have a financial burden but sooner or later I have to look after my parents. If you guys have any advice then please comment it will help me make a sound decision. \n\nEdit: Sorry guys it's a tier 2 college however that's not important as it's in the past.
