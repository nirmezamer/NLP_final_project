            "I feel bad for breaking bad fans that never saw the finale and dont know the true ending",
            "In the end, the show has two very distinct halves. The half with Chuck and the half without. Both equally entertaining and instrumental to the character of Saul. \n\nSo pleased with how great the show turned out.",
            "I think I'm still in denial...",
            "Were done when I say were done",
            "When I first heard that they were making a spin-off about Saul, I thought it was a really dumb idea. And then they made THIS",
            "The BB universe is the best thing that ever happened to TV. And now it is gone.",
            "Rewatching Breaking Bad is even more depressing now, knowing Saul is a facade for Jimmys pain",
            "Well what do we do now?",
            "*Mike Voice*\n\nHere's what you're gonna do: Tomorrow morning when you wake up, you call your boss and say you're not coming in. Say you have a migraine, say you have a stomach flu, say whatever you want, but you're taking a sick day. Then I want you to log into whatever streaming service you like, find Better Call Saul, and start at Season 1, Episode 1. Then you're gonna watch. You're not gonna look at your phone, you're not gonna leave it playing while you talk to your roommate, you're not gonna look away for one second. What aren't you going to do. Say it. Good. Every scene, every episode, every season, you watch. If you need to eat, you pause. If you need to use the bathroom, you pause. Doesn't matter if you've seen it before, doesn't matter if you think it's too slow. You don't fast forward, you don't skip, you don't watch at 1.5x speed. You watch the whole damn thing, beginning to end. Then, and only then, you rest. Got it? Tell me you understand.",
            "The black and white is especially poignant at the end because it's practically a homage to Kim and Jimmy's favorite activity to do together. Watch old movies."

            "When you remember that the Emmys are the same bunch of clowns who gave Most Outstanding Drama to Season 8 of Game of Thrones (at the direct expense of Better Call Saul that year, no less), then it all makes sense. They are not serious people.",
            "I take solace in knowing that The Wire never won any Emmys either. Sometimes there are just shows that beat you to the punch. I still think BCS deserved more recognition and some awards.",
            "This is great news for the shows legacy in a weird way, especially if they keep the record forever. If I was a kid in like 2075 curious about prestige TV from this era Id definitely be curious about a show with a record number of nominations and no wins.",
            "Its crazy that it was never even NOMINATED for cinematography.",
            "So when you're sitting at your shitty Emmy awards ceremony for three hours straight, and you're sipping tepid champagne at the boring party thereafters - you think of MEEEE !! You twisted awards fuck !",
            "I think the season split hurt their chances of winning an emmy rather than helping them",
            "Screw it. Great f-ing show. Deeper dive into a peripheral character strikes gold and everyone involved should be proud, including the audience that *got it.*\n\nFor all others? Meh...",
            "Its a shame but I think maybe this can be understood by the fact that BCS never achieved the same pop-cultural legend status as BrBa. Most people I know who loved BrBa either didnt bother with BCS or tapped out after a few episodes or so. Emmys tend to award the biggest most buzz-worthy shows, the most fashionable shows that have everyone talking, whether Succession or Game of Thrones or Sopranos. BCS just never really got to that level for a mass audience in the way those shows did. Theres other factors at play but I think thats a big part of it. And also that the show doesnt have much glitz and glam to it, its just tells its story and does it well. Breaking Bad Ike Sopranos before it was an epic commercial and artistic success but BCS, like The Americans, The Leftovers, and Mr. Robot, sort of leans more towards great, critically beloved shows that never really achieved crossover success. Such shows, for whatever reason, just simply didnt connect with the kind of large audience that you apparently need to win Emmys.\n\nStill, Jesus Christ, youd have thought they couldve given them a cinematography award or something, no? Zero for 53 or whatever almost does feel spiteful.",
            "It's Better to never win an Emmy and have everyone say you should have, than to win and have people say you didn't deserve it. The show's legacy of greatness will be fine.",

He's done worse. That auction! Are you telling me that a watch just happens to disappear like that? No! He orchestrated it! Jimmy! He defaced a Vacheron Constantin! And I saved him! And I shouldn't have. I took him into my own collection! What was I thinking? He'll never change. He'll never change! Ever since he was 9, always the same! Couldn't keep his hands off the display cases! But not our Jimmy! Couldn't be precious Jimmy! Stealing them blind! And he gets to be a watch dealer!? What a sick joke! I should've stopped him when I had the chance! And you  you have to stop him! You-",

            "Solid point. Presumably, the henchmen are officially employed in a profession where death by gunshot is easy to explain. The other two characters dying by gunshot would raise too many questions, so they disappear the bodies.\n\nFrom a filmmaking point of view, it looks better to only have the named characters in the burial scene.",
            "Thats actually a good point that I never thought about. Its possible they buried them in twos so as to not have to make the holes too big nor for thte bodies to be stacked too high to cause problems for construction.",
            "I mean, every time this comes up I ask the same question - who got Kims fridge? It was working perfectly fine. They just used it to hide the removal of a body. The fridge isnt in the pit either.\n\nWho kept Kims fridge???!?",
            "Gus is a laloward shipper",
            "The other people that died were employed by Gus, my guess is that the families got the bodies back and Gus covered it up somehow, or maybe paid them to keep them quiet.",
            "Idk maybe they thought that if any of those two guys were found, it would bring too much exposure to the involved parties. They couldve cut up the bodyguards and stuffed them into the fridge then dropping it off in the middle of the desert, if found itd probably get discarded as a narco crime. ",
            "Maybe since they were Mikes guys he wanted to make sure they didnt just go missing and their families could actually know what happened (even if it was a fake reason) and have a funeral. Remember how he felt about the stranger who helped the truck he robbed? He also made a point to talk to Nachos dad and tell him what happened, so maybe he was in charge of doing something similar for his guys.",
            "Those men had wives and children.  Gus couldn't make them disappear, so he had to create a story to explain how they were killed by gunfire.  Mike used Jimmy and Kim's playbook and framed one of them as an alcoholic who shot his coworkers then killed himself. Obviously.",
