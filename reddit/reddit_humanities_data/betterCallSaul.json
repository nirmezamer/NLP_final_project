            "This spin off, while simultaneously being prequel, interquel and sequel of Breaking Bad, not only fleshed out already good characters, but also elevated the already astonishing story of the Breaking Bad universe. \n\nUnforgettable story, characters and relationships. Bravo Vince, bravo Peter, and bravo to all of the actors and producers. I hope each of you has a wonderful rest of career and life.",

No doubt it\u2019s the MVP in our heart.",
            "When you remember that the Emmys are the same bunch of clowns who gave Most Outstanding Drama to Season 8 of Game of Thrones (at the direct expense of Better Call Saul that year, no less), then it all makes sense. They are not serious people.",
            "Just looked at the wiki page. How Michael McKean didn't get even nominated for supporting actor is wild. Jonathan Banks is nominated several times but I don't think that role lends itself to winning, less dramatic, more subdued.",
            "I\ufe0f take solace in knowing that The Wire never won any Emmys either. Sometimes there are just shows that beat you to the punch. I\ufe0f still think BCS deserved more recognition and some awards.",
            "AMC made it vanish from streaming for 11 months immediately after S6 ended. They vanished the first half of it after the second half began, even for their subscribers. It should never have been split in half in the first place.\n\nMight be the worst distribution deal in modern TV history.",
            "Jimmy. Jimmy, I'm just gonna say it. You're not winning an Emmy\n\nWhat are you talking about? You said this universe was award winning\n\nYes. We like Breaking Bad. We don't like, um... Uh... Breaking Bad is all we like\n\nYou gotta be... You're serious? I walk in here with one of the best written shows of the decade on a damn platinum platter. A show that I carried, that I made happen. And you don't want me? Why in Christ not? Well, I know that you hate me, Hollywood. You better believe the feeling goes both ways. But I'm willing to set that aside to work with you on this. Why can't you do the same for me? What is it that you can't let go of? Huh? What slight did I make to your fine, upstanding character that you can't forgive?",
            "This is great news for the show\u2019s legacy in a weird way, especially if they keep the record forever. If I was a kid in like 2075 curious about prestige TV from this era I\u2019d definitely be curious about a show with a record number of nominations and no wins.",
            "Its crazy that it was never even NOMINATED for cinematography.",
            "So when you're sitting at your shitty Emmy awards ceremony for three hours straight, and you're sipping tepid champagne at the boring party thereafters - you think of MEEEE !! You twisted awards fuck !"

The other two characters dying by gunshot would raise too many questions, so they disappear the bodies.\n\nFrom a filmmaking point of view, it looks better to only have the named characters in the burial scene.",
            "That\u2019s actually a good point that I never thought about. It\u2019s possible they buried them in twos so as to not have to make the holes too big nor for thte bodies to be stacked too high to cause problems for construction.",
            "I mean, every time this comes up I ask the same question - who got Kim\u2019s fridge? It was working perfectly fine. They just used it to hide the removal of a body. The fridge isn\u2019t in the pit either.\n\nWho kept Kim\u2019s fridge???!?",

            "Idk maybe they thought that if any of those two guys were found, it would bring too much exposure to the involved parties. They could\u2019ve cut up the bodyguards and stuffed them into the fridge then dropping it off in the middle of the desert, if found it\u2019d probably get discarded as a narco crime. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

Remember how he felt about the stranger who helped the truck he robbed? He also made a point to talk to Nacho\u2019s dad and tell him what happened, so maybe he was in charge of doing something similar for his guys."
