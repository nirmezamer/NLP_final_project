Filling the market at an unhealthy rate. \n\nPure silver spots will always maintain their value, while drop spots will die. Its  been like this forever. The devs suck.",

            "No, it's cause 2b/hr in zones is going away and becoming 1.2-1.4b why do dehkia when gyfins makes the same money. It's the problem we once had before of zones being populated by 700+ gs in 500-600gs zones cause why do anything that can do dmg to me when I can one tap mobs for the SAME silver/hr. Dehkia Thornwood is utterly pointless for money now with omins at 80m. High gear people will over populate mid game again and either cause drama with grinding over others or you'll be forced to the marni realm. Right now only debos are going to provide that higher silver gain, for now. If they tank in price it may end up not worth cronning from base."
