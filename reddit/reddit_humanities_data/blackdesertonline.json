            "I posted this as a text post but it was removed by automod so I guess I have to ask here.\n\nI and a friend of mine have decided to give BDO a try, and as was suggested by several guides (and common sense), we made seasonal characters. Now, for a new player the game is quite confusing and overwhelming, at first anyway. And since we're not playing together every day, and it's not the only game we play anyway, I wanted to do what I've done in several MMOs in the past, and make a second character alongside to play alone and at my own pace, to help learn the game better, to try out a different class and to fill the time in between us playing together.\n\nHowever, the button to make a seasonal character is greyed out, and after a little bit of googling, I've learned that while you can make several seasonal characters, you apparently can't do so at the same time. So, it seems like my options right now are:\n\n* Delete the current character and make a new one, which I obviously don't want to do.\n* Continue playing the character I have and abandon my friend, which I also don't want to do.\n* Don't play the game alone at all, and wait to see if and when we continue together, which I didn't want to do but to my surprise seems to be what the game wants at this point.\n* Make a non-seasonal character, which every guide under the sun warns new players not to do.\n\nAm I understanding this correctly, that making multiple characters as a new player is heavily discouraged? Or is making a non-seasonal character not that big a deal? How big a difference does being on a seasonal character make? What does the game actually want me to do at this point, and what would be your suggestion?\n\nAnd as a side question, how do items and currencies work when graduating a character to non-seasonal? Do I lose access to everything in my storage, does it move with me, or are the storages shared to begin with? Is the central market shared or separate? And what about seasonal-only items, do those simply disappear?\n\nSorry for the slew of questions, but that's probably the usual new player experience. \ud83d\ude05",

        "content": "[https://www.naeu.playblackdesert.com/en-US/Forum/ForumTopic/Detail?\\_topicNo=57200&\\_page=1](https://www.naeu.playblackdesert.com/en-US/Forum/ForumTopic/Detail?_topicNo=57200&_page=1)\n\n  \nI just posted this topic in the feedback forum, please share and vote if you agree! \n\n\n\n# Problem:\n\nMany players consider a Perfect Fairy\\* a goal to achieve, but the current system makes this unnecessarily difficult.\n\nEspecially for players who are unable or unwilling to buy Theia's Orbs from the Pearl Shop.\n\n\n\nThe current system follows a simple method:\n\n1. (Optional) Obtain a T3 fairy and sprout her to T4\n\n2. Feed the fairy blue gear until the next level and hope for the right skill\n\n3. If you get the wrong skill, reset the fairy and try again\n\n\n\nThe difficulty with this method is that you may end up getting lucky at the start and get two key skills at level V but get unlucky with the third skill.\n\nNow you are left with a\u00a0**hard**\u00a0choice: Settle for two key skills\u00a0**or**\u00a0reset the fairy and risk not getting those key skills again (leading you to reset again and again until you succeed).\n\n\n\nWhile it is true that all you need is silver to try again, it requires that you either save up a large amount of silver to try enough times to succeed\u00a0**or**\u00a0you take a step back in the progression while you save up more silver to try again.\n\n\n\n\\* Miraculous Cheer V, Feathery Steps V, Continous Care V, Fairy's Tear IV and Morning Light (one of the last two may be swapped for Tingeling Breath V for a life skiller)\n\n\n\n# Proposed solution:\n\nThis problem is similar to how we enhance our gear (an attempt might fail and put you back). Unlike that system, we have\u00a0**no**\u00a0safe guards.\n\nFor gear enhancing we have options, such as using Cron Stones or upgrading a second copy from the gear we're using.\n\n\n\nI propose that a system be implemented where players can\u00a0store\u00a0***a single***\u00a0fairy in the \"Unstable Crevice**\"**\u00a0at the Kamasylve Temple node for a\u00a0**large**\u00a0silver fee.\n\n\n\nThis would mean that players could\u00a0**store**\u00a0their current T4 fairy and try again on a new fairy.\n\nIf that fairy doesn't obtain the right skills, they can release her and then take out their\u00a0**stored**\u00a0fairy to keep playing until they are able to try again.\n\n  \n",

            "IT would be huge, but doubt we will get it because theia orbs would get less usefull. Currently I have quite good T3 fairy (3 out of 4 skills I want). Do I risk upgrading it to T4 and getting worse skills? Ofc not. So Im stuck with T3 untill I swipe for theia orbs (they seem to not give them for free anymore) which I prolly wont ever do.\n\nYou cant even reset ur bad T4 fairy and retry for free. You also need Pearl Shop item for that which is just ridiculus.",
            "Imo the quickest way to fix this issue is to let it cost one orb to change a skill regardless of levels. Unlike now where it increases by one orb every time a new skill is learned. This would require minimum effort and time for PA to implement and make it a whole lot easier for players.",
            "How about we just make an system where it can be achieved in a decent manner without having to buy it. Let whales speed up the process with buying it, just make a time gated way to do it for free. (Ideally no P2W at all but that\u2019s for my dreams)",
            "the problem still is that a t3 doesnt have the option to unlock the highest skill level or the skill continuous care. the last one is more endgame to manage elixir rota, III is even enough. but not having 2s potion use is unplayable for classes with bad/long cd heals.",
