            "I would recommend start with AC (not ACC) you can get it as cheap as 1 or 2$ from steam and has endless cars and tracks mods (a lot of them are free) that you can have loads of fun with and can learn simracing and online competition before jumping into iRacing.",
            "I do not recommend iRacing, this simulator ruined other sims/racing games. Once you hooked up into iRacing your are done, any other sims and racing games will be boring for you.",
            "iRacing is good if you want competitive racing. BUT nothing wrong getting AC for 2 bucks in the sale right now for the days where you don't feel like competing and want to drive different stuff.",
            "Yes, iRacing is amazing. I bought a bunch of other sims before I bought iRacing, and now I never use them.",
            "You will probably end up on iRacing if you get hooked on sim racing so might as well start with it",
            "For your first dip into the sim racing world I'd recommend everything but Iracing. I don't really count GT7 as a dip into sim racing. Before you invest a fortune in this game better make sure that you're really into sim racing.\nGrab yourself something cheap like ACC, Ams2, AC, Le Man's ultimate. If you enjoy it you can still \"upgrade\" to Iracing",
            "If the premise is you are still using a controller because you are on a budget, I dont see WHY u should start with iracing. Download a sim that isnt this expensive, figure out if u like it, if you do save some money for a rig with wheels and pedals, and THEN consider payin for a sim service like iRacing. Thats what I'd do.",
            "I don't see why not. I tried different sims over the years and still had to adjust quite a bit yo iRacing, so I'd just start there anyways.\n\nJust don't expect to be fast right away and enjoy the process.",
            "Got my rig before my PC. Started on AC and Dirt 2.0 for a bit, as soon as the PC showed up I went iRacing and have never looked back.",
            "No reason not to start with iRacing, at the very least it forces you down a rookie path in cars which teach you the fundamentals of racing before you progress to higher power cars.\n\nDon't ignore other sims though, for example AC is on sale at the moment and offers (through mods) just about anything and anywhere you could want to drive."
