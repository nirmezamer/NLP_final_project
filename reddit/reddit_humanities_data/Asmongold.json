            "Funny thing is, Biden actually kicked ass in the VP debates in 2012, and helped Obama get re-elected. Now, I see him helping Trump get re-elected.",
            "Uni party members who works together VS actual opponents.",
            "Because they were on the same side.",
            "I don't think we'll have a normal presidental election again after 2016. I think the country has become too radical and moderates are fading fast.\n\nRepublicans are increasingly caving to Christian Nationalist who wont be satisfied till we're an autocracy. And Democrats who aren't towing the socialist line and demonizing everything their voters want are getting their boots over a fire.",
            "Freedom of choice and democracy / illusion of choice by letting you pick the best (/s) out of duopoly...\n\nUSA sunk so rapidly and so deep and only thing we get from your election is the best production hollywood ever created. Marketing and pr is running your country folks and they are doing a piss poor job at its best..",

            "Fucking hell man looking at Biden's brain dead expression staring off into the void had me audibly laugh. We need better candidates man",
            "Man , i'm not american but why they keep pushing Biden to another 4 year , he clearly to old for the role.",
            "You can't tell me these are the two best candidates to run a country.  Politics is a farce, and the minute we all wake up and realize we are all being played against each other the farce is over.  \n\nAs long as they keep up distracted with identity Politics, and the like we won't ever wake up.",

Just like last time, they're going about things as if they don't have to try in order to win. \n\nIf Trump wins again, it's the left's fault, honestly. They laid down and let him do it. AGAIN. And they're going to have the audacity to weep and moan about it when it was their own fault.",

            "Minors don't belong on social media, and they especially don't belong on reddit. For example, reddit has like 20 different choking porn subreddits a kid could find trivially. I'm sure there's porn on this website that I have never imagined in my wildest dreams.\n\nKids should have their own social media without adults or direct messaging on it.",

            "I think there is one main reason why kids shouldn't even be on the internet and that's porn. It's available to anyone at any time. For this reason, internet should be 18+.",
