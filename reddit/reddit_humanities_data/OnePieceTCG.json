            "I'm thinking of buying some starter decka that would be a good base for competitive play later on or have some useful cards. Other than animal kingdom starter, what are some other recommendations?",
            "Thinking of building a constructed deck but alas not sure what to go for. I generally in other card games ive played favored playing the control archetype or at least midrange/control and was wondering sort of if you had any advice on a contrl list for something to start off with?  Thanks in advance :)",
            "I am extremely new to all this what does it mean If a card is op 01 or 2 or whatever and same goes with st 011 what do all these numbers mean",
            "Im in Canada and ordering cards online seems to be a grab bag of legit and resealed messes, any tips for someone starting out? I did read the FAQ and it is still a bit confusing to me",
            "Question about OP07-109 Luffy, if its trashed by its main effect and you have less than 2 life but there is no target for the K.O. do you get to draw a card for the rest of the effect?",
            "If two 3c Kyroses would be ko'ed at the same time by a Fire Fist, would resting Rebecca leader (no Coliseum in play) save only 1 or both of them?",
            "Can anyone explain why people seem to be dropping 8 drop Kid in the OP08 meta for the Bonney deck?",
            "ST13 has 3 great leaders that can teach you about combo or aggro decks, the Uta deck is pretty good out of the box to learn how to play control, would strongly recommend getting 2 of those to double up on the rares.",
            "This is the card number and it indicates from which set that card came from. So OP01-001 comes from the first set of the game, ST11 is a card from the Uta starter deck, etc. \n\nAnd the number is unique, so even if they reprint the card with a different art or they put it in a different set, it will always be the same number and you can only put 4 of the same card number in your deck, unless it is limited or banned of course.",
            "It says up to 1, means u can pick 0 target, then follow up with the draw."

            "how often do you use leader ability in a game? do you only use it when you can leader ability out a kalgara vanilla then play out a noland to heal?",
            "I play very aggressive, I use it as soon as I can (turn 3 going first, turn 2 sometimes going second if I have the 4 cost wiper and something else to follow). Against the top meta decks you just need as much field as possible (rp law always bottom decking and Lucci KOing 1-2 every turn). Against other decks, going low life isn't that bad because they will be focused on attacking your characters anyways. Depending on the opponents field and removal options, I sometimes even play 5 cost wiper after 6 cost Kalgara instead of healing.\n\nThere has been times where I let myself go to 0 life so that I can use leader ability for free and then heal after. As long as you don't die and have a no land in hand, keeping characters alive is the most important",
