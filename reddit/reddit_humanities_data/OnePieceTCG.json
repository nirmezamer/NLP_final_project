            "Thinking of building a constructed deck but alas not sure what to go for. I generally in other card games ive played favored playing the control archetype or at least midrange/control and was wondering sort of if you had any advice on a contrl list for something to start off with?  Thanks in advance :)",

            "If two 3c Kyroses would be ko'ed at the same time by a Fire Fist, would resting Rebecca leader (no Coliseum in play) save only 1 or both of them?",
            "I have a question about OP07 Basil Hawkins.\n\nFrom my understanding, if all your opponent\u2019s characters are rested, his ability preventing him from leaving the field can\u2019t be activated.\n\nHowever, does this also apply to removal that comes with a character like 4c Lucci or 4c Ryuma?",
            "ST13 has 3 great leaders that can teach you about combo or aggro decks, the Uta deck is pretty good out of the box to learn how to play control, would strongly recommend getting 2 of those to double up on the rares.",
            "Hi, \n\nYou could do Enel for a midrange or invest into some yellow bombs for a tier 1 control deck.  \nMoria/Lucci would be the next best but with a different style of control.\n\nBasically, yellow is about life control while black is about character removal.\n\nRP Law would also be a very good option but expensive and if you have a budget of less than 100 you can always go for Nami."
