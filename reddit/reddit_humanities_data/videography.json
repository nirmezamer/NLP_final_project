        "content": "# So\u2026 what y\u2019all shooting on?\n\nThe purpose of this post is to create a public repository of what cameras videographers are using to do their work.\n\nThis is to help newbies and pros alike figure out what their first or next camera should be, and to help cut down on repetitive questions on the subreddit.\n\nThis is a very experimental system. \u2018Mega threads\u2019 on this topic have not been very effective in the past as they end up being a thread full of questions and no answers. We\u2019re trying to flip the idea on its head and have a thread full of answers instead!\n\n## Guidelines for posting\n\n* All top level comments in this post must be discussing a camera you\u2019re using (or have used) - any other comments will be removed\n    * you can make multiple comments for different cameras if you like\n    * if someone has already recommended your camera, we would prefer if you added your information as a reply to that person rather than a new comment\n* You are welcome to show off your videos, website, showreels, case studies, reviews, and anything else that demonstrates the camera in use\n    * please be clear which parts are shot using the camera you\u2019re discussing\n* Include the price you paid for the camera if possible\n    * please be specific about the currency used\n* Tell us what kind of content you\u2019re shooting\n* feel free to list lenses and any other equipment you\u2019re using\n* **No affiliate links in comments!**\n    * if you have them on a website you link to, that\u2019s fine *as long as the page clearly discloses they are affiliate links*\n\n**This post will be renewed every quarter** and archives of previous discussions will be made available.\n\nComments in this post are in \u2018contest mode\u2019 so the order they are displayed is randomized.\n\n### Huge thank you to anyone who contributes - you\u2019re helping the greater community!\n\n---\n\n# I\u2019m Looking for a Camera\n\nWe allow [posts to the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/videography/submit) with camera buying advice, but ask that before doing so that you...\n\n## Have a look through the comments of this post\n\nThe purpose of this post is for /r/videography members to share what cameras they're currently shooting on, share examples of their work, and give you a way to talk directly to an actual user of the equipment.\n\nWe have a very diverse membership on the subreddit covering many niches, so over time we're hoping you'll be able to find recommendations and discussion that helps you make an informed decision.\n\n## Search the subreddit!\n\n/r/videography has over a decade of information, though Reddit doesn\u2019t make searching easy.\n\nA useful trick that typically gets better results than Reddit\u2019s own search bar is to add the following to a Google search:\n\n    site:reddit.com/r/videography\n\n## Try the Discord\n\nWe have a very active Discord:\n\nhttps://discord.com/invite/d65kgBn\n\nYou\u2019ll usually get a quicker answer asking there than here!\n\n## /r/videography Camera Buying Guide\n\nThis is a placeholder!\n\nThe mods are currently working on a guide for camera selection with some general recommendations at various budget ranges.\n\nThis post will be updated once that guide is ready - ~~it might take a few weeks~~ longer than expected, will try to get *something* up for the Q2 post.\n\n## Still can\u2019t find what you\u2019re looking for?\n\n###Fill out the following form and **[post it to the subreddit by clicking this link.](https://www.reddit.com/r/videography/submit)**\n\n**Important!**\n\n* Please [post your question to the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/videography/submit) - not as a comment to this post.\n* If you\u2019re posting from desktop Reddit, please enable \u2018Markdown Mode\u2019 when posting\n* Select the \u2018Camera Recommendation\u2019 post flair\n* **Only** edit the text in {braces} - you can remove the braces!\n* Do not remove or change any other text in the template - if you don\u2019t have an answer for a question, leave it blank but don\u2019t edit the question text.\n\n*Your post will be removed if you do not follow the above instructions.*\n\n    #Camera Recommendation Form\n    \n    ##Budget\n    {Add your budget here.}\n    {Please specify your local currency!}\n    \n    ##What are you using it for?\n    {describe your use case for your camera.}\n    {tip: link to some content or videos}\n    {that are similar to what you want}\n    {to create.}\n    \n    ##How long do you need to record for?\n    {Recoding time is a limiting factor}\n    {for many cameras!}\n    \n    ##What equipment do you already have?\n    {Knowing what you\u2019re used to}\n    {will help you get better advice.}\n    {Sometimes a new camera isn\u2019t}\n    {the best way to improve your}\n    {results, and your money would}\n    {be better invested elsewhere}\n    \n    ##What software do you edit in?\n    {pro cameras often require pro}\n    {software to work with their footage.}\n    \n    ---\n    \n    {please add any other notes}\n    {or comments that you think}\n    {are relevant here.}\n\n\n\n###**[Reddit Mobile users click this link to get the template](https://pastes.io/xzka1hpnlk)**\n\n^(Thanks Reddit for making it almost impossible to copy text in the official app...)",

            "I\u2019ll preface saying I know nothing about video recording. I am looking at a GoPro, but before I jump in I want to make sure it will fit my use case. I want to record my family\u2019s camping and 4wheeling trips, specifically because we are finally taking my 8 year old up. She has seen the outdoor boys and she is psyched about going and having memories to look back on. \n\nWill that be enough for car rides, setting up camp, cooking and hanging out at the fire at night? I don\u2019t need it to be pro quality, just better than a shaky shot taken from my iPhone.",
            "Looking for a rec for shooting High school basketball/track for my nephew. Currently using my iPhone 14pro. I have been looking at the fx30. I have the a7III, but want 60fps for the sports. Wondering if I am better off sticking with the phone, or if the fx30 is worth the jump in price. The zoom ability is garbage on the phone so I tend to stick with 1x and crop it when editing, its ok and works, but it would be nice to be able to zoom in more (would need new lens) The battery life on my phone pushes it close when he has back to back basketball games, I can make it, but it would be nice to not worry about battery life as much, sometimes he plays 2 back to back 40 minute games, I usually record each half (20 mins) at 4k60. Open to any other suggestions, just kind of curious.",
            "I was gifted a Canon XA-10 that I am using primarily, just getting started in shooting and editing. I mostly do home-video sorts of things with my kids, and recently started working on some various promo videos for my local Fire Department.\n\nI always wanted to like editing, and also forced myself to use iMovie because it is free and plenty of people seem to do fine with it. I am not one of those people. I recently switched to DaVinci Resolve (free), and now I actually find joy in the editing process.",
            "Canon C70.    The more I use it, the more I love it.   I use with a Tilta cage and sennheiser wireless mics.  I love that I can adapt 4 professional wireless mics at once if needed.    Some hate the 35mm form factor although I love that aspect.   It works great with EF and RF lens's.    I sometimes use the EF system which gives an extra stop, which works great in low light.   I love how crisp and clean the blacks look.    Internal Raw and Clog 2.    I'm putting on blinders on new camera's and will just keep using this camera... at least for another 5 years or so.   Every time I load the footage into premiere I'm impressed at how comparable it is to the 35MM film I used to shoot back in the day.",

            "Hi, I have been doing photography for 6 years and recently wanted to learn videography too. I have a Canon 90D and had shot some videos on it but it doesn\u2019t have log, so I\u2019ll keep it as my photography camera. I\u2019m looking for a camera to shoot video, not bulky, budget and has log so I can learn colour grading. I wish to document my travels and my life this year in a cinematic video form. I heard that Sony has some good video cameras. Is there any good cameras from Sony or other brand that I can learn video with?",
