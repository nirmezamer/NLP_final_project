        "content": "Hi!\u00a0 been researching but getting a bit desparate for a simple approach... Shooting a live speaker event for a client, and may do the edit too. (event is, sigh, tomorrow,.... in 15 hours)\n\n**ME:** Usually a Canon shooter but circumstances have me on an A7iii for my B&C cams. Long time RAW photography editor, but newer to video coloring.. I have graded some cLog, and feel confident enough with it. but really only getting my feet wet with color profiles recently.... buut I've never had to match Sony + Canon, and freaking out a bit about how to prepare...\n\n**What\u00a0 will give the best foundation in camera for a direct approach to color grade\u00a0 these two very different cameras to match?** without a bunch of fussing around randomly.....dare I ask for fast too?\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n-- Should I Shoot S-Log2 and C-Log2 ? will those give me the simplest foundation for matching in post? \u00a0\n\n-- If HLG2 is the answer... why can't I find that on my Canon? its only HLG available. Should I use HLG on the Sony too then? My impression is that the HLG is better on toning down the Sony, but does the same to the Canon, so they still dont get close enough for comfort.\n\n-- Or, can I shoot the R5c on Canon 709, and the Sonys on S-Log and then only\u00a0 try to match the Sonys to the Canon, not both to each other\n\n**TRIED:**  \n- Exploring comparisons available in the Profiles of each camera...results: a bit overwhelmed.  \n- trying to make HLG3 look like Canon with custom settings. [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybs9R-eqNv8)\u00a0 ... results: tests at home were garbage. not remotely similar, sony way too red.  \n- HLG2 with saturation down to -7... to make the HLG less bold. [link](https://youtu.be/iUPsnO9GuRM?si=LP3194fBIrKHV1_D&t=79).... results: still not comparable enough for comfort.\n\n**OTHER INFO-** \u00a0 The room has mixed lighting but lots of natural light, except that it will be nearing sunset by the second hour, maybe raining... there are some stage lights (PAR cans i think) on the speaker, and general overhead warm lights scattered through audience. So I may be battling\u00a0 mixed light sources to begin with.\u00a0\n\n**TOOLS:**  \nPremiere usually, but i do want to learn Resolve. (not sure this is the project for it tho)\n\n**Yah, I know**: get best possible exposure, use color card, match white balance\n\nIf you read this far you are a GEM, and thank you regardless for any sage advice.",

            "you can never perfectly match it , but i would recommend you shoot both in log and grade in post while manually comparing both grades next to each other.\n\na reminder that 8bit slog WILL break quick , so slog2 is the better option.\n\nshooting hlg or any other profiles that isnt log/raw will be harder to fix ( especially on the a7iii)"

Would\u2019ve added more close-up drama face expression shots to match the tension, too many mid shots stringed together gets dull fast.

Here is the 45mm 1.5x Anamorphic lens @ T2.4, for anyone who is curious about how these lenses look in a field test. These lenses are so fun to shoot with.
