            "I\u2019m working on a fingering weight raglan t-shirt and, after blocking, my row gauge is way off (20% too many rows/cm). I\u2019m about 1/3rd of the way to the division for sleeves (from the top) and I have done the math so that I can space out my increases and hit the right stitch count at that point but I\u2019m worried the shape will be funky because I will essentially have increased too much too early and then slowed down on the increase rate. Time to just start over?",

Or is it all connected and I\u2019m just being dumb",

            "I'm a dumbass and bought the wrong yarn for the [shawl](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/ruxton) I want to make. I meant to buy Cascade 220 *superwash* sport but messed up and bought the regular 220, which is 100 percent wool.\n\nI started the shawl anyway because why not. However, I have to say I'm... less than pleased with the texture of the fabric so far. Kind of scratchy, not very drapey. I've also never knitted with 100 percent wool before, so I don't know what to expect post-blocking. So I'm just wondering: Is making this shawl with this yarn a terrible idea? Will blocking improve the texture and drape at all?",
            "Heya, I'm quite new to knitting (past year) and I was wondering about how much you can do it knitting that can be done in crotchet. The main reason I'm asking is because looking for patterns for specific things the majority of them are for crotchet and I'm struggling to find some knitting ones for similar projects. Any insight is greatly appreciated :D",

            "What are the slickest wood needles out there?\n\nI'm about to go on an international trip, transiting through Istanbul. Everything I can find online says my metal needles will be confiscated if I try to carry them on board, so I'm going to buy a single pair of wooden needles OR Addi click tips (preference for the tips, but I'm open).\n\nI vastly prefer sharp metal needles. Sharp because I like the easier time I have working the yarn, and metal because I am a fairly tight knitter and slick needles help make things go faster. Clover/Takumi bamboo knitting needles might as well be velcro for me.\n\nSuggestions are welcome!",

I have been knitting for a while but consider myself beginner and would prefer flat knit patterns \n\n  \nObviously an easy answer would be beanies or scarves, but I guess I'm looking for scarf or beanie patterns that might be considered \"trendy\" right now. I've also considered knitted bandanas or vests/cardigans. Curious if anyone else has other ideas :)",
            "I feel like this question is asked a ton here, but what would you guys suggest as a good beginner garment pattern that really rounds out basics (ie in the round, assembly, etc) using fingering or sport weight yarn? I'd probably rate myself as a beginner knitter and first time garment maker if it helps!  \n  \n(I am advanced/intermediate in crochet, though, so not a stranger to fiber crafts.

            "Hello my lovely knitting geniuses. Any suggestions for men\u2019s sweater patterns with some shaping? My husband has very wide shoulders and chest but a very narrow waist and boxy sweaters don\u2019t flatter him as much. \n\nI prefer top down raglans but could be convinced to learn anything new!"

I\u2019m really excited to share that I\u2019ve just published my 25th pattern in [my Ravelry shop](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/indispensable-shawl). To celebrate, I put all my shawl patterns on sale for $2.50 thru Friday 6/28/24 at midnight - and then 25% off thru June 30th. (You won\u2019t need a coupon code for this - but the sale is good for shawl patterns only)\n\nThis is the Indispensable Shawl  & it is the perfect first garment for a new knitter - or a great relaxing project for a seasoned knitter. If you can cast on, knit, purl, kfb and bind off - you have all the skills you need to knit the Indispensable Shawl.\n\nThe Indispensable Shawl requires 200 g of fingering weight yarn.  The pattern has really easy cast-on and bind off methods (no fussy tab cast on!) And, I included  helpful charts so you keep track of your stitch counts along the way.\n\nThanks for looking!",
