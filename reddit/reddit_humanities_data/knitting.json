            "I\u2019m working on a fingering weight raglan t-shirt and, after blocking, my row gauge is way off (20% too many rows/cm). I\u2019m about 1/3rd of the way to the division for sleeves (from the top) and I have done the math so that I can space out my increases and hit the right stitch count at that point but I\u2019m worried the shape will be funky because I will essentially have increased too much too early and then slowed down on the increase rate. Time to just start over?",
            "Hello! I recall seeing someone in this sub mentioning a technique for preventing acrylic knits from getting misshapen/stretching out, but can't remember what it was called to look it up :( Anyone know?",
            "Heya, I'm quite new to knitting (past year) and I was wondering about how much you can do it knitting that can be done in crotchet. The main reason I'm asking is because looking for patterns for specific things the majority of them are for crotchet and I'm struggling to find some knitting ones for similar projects. Any insight is greatly appreciated :D",

            "I feel like this question is asked a ton here, but what would you guys suggest as a good beginner garment pattern that really rounds out basics (ie in the round, assembly, etc) using fingering or sport weight yarn? I'd probably rate myself as a beginner knitter and first time garment maker if it helps!  \n  \n(I am advanced/intermediate in crochet, though, so not a stranger to fiber crafts. Just looking to break out of making complicated, long haul afghans)",
            "Hello my lovely knitting geniuses. Any suggestions for men\u2019s sweater patterns with some shaping? My husband has very wide shoulders and chest but a very narrow waist and boxy sweaters don\u2019t flatter him as much. \n\nI prefer top down raglans but could be convinced to learn anything new!",
            "What do you think the easiest way to knit a sweater sleeve is? Magic loop, DPNs, buy a really small circular?",
            "Hey y\u2019all!! I am working on my first ever \u201creal\u201d knit project, the Best Vest by James N. Watts. I was able to get gauge, but I just chose the wrong size and now I\u2019m worried that it\u2019s gonna end up too small. It\u2019s knit in the round\u2014 is there a way for me to easily add more stitches? I\u2019m a couple inches into the ribbing, which doesn\u2019t sound like much but it\u2019s been almost a week of work. I would really hate to frog it if there\u2019s any other way for me to make it any wider. I\u2019m using cotton yarn so idk how much blocking will help.",
            "A lot of raglan patterns have you start with increases every other round, then slow the rate of increase for the lower part of the shaping.\n\nTo keep the raglan \"seam\" line look consistent, switch to every 3rd or 4th round and stick with it, as opposed to doing every 3rd round, then every 4th round, then back to every 3rd round, etc.",

            "So after making a sweater for myself I decided to do more... But for the kids. The base I used for both is the Flax sweater by Tin Can Knits.\u00a0\n\n\nFor the purple unicorn sweater I did the cast on for the after thought collar and then when I got to that... Just picked up the stitches and knitted flat for a boxy hood. I used this guide for reference: https://www.customyarn.com/how-to-add-a-hood-to-your-sweater\u00a0\n\n\nThe horn/ears/etc are crochet but the whole thing is definitely inspired by a popular character that my 5 y/o is currently obsessed with \ud83d\ude05\n\n\nhttps://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/flax-dk",
