            "Madrimov is dangerous. Only issue I see is his using his athleticism & head movement to evade jabs while he presses the inside. Crawford will time him.\nOtherwise hes successful with both stances, we may see Crawford vs Boots (hopefully) next. I dont know why Team Bud picked this opponent otherwise.",
            "Good day for DC area boxers last night. 7-1 at the DC show.\n\nAlso, mods, if you're not gonna start a thread for a card, then don't let Botmod delete threads for being low-content.",

            "If I remember correctly he started out fighting at a younger age than was legal in order to get food money.  He's a beast that was born into it not for fame or fortune but simply to live tomorrow.",
            "Man Ill never forget the outstretched hands of that guy from ringside, it made for such a dramatic image. You just dont see Pacman get knocked out, and especially *like that.*",
            "As an mma fan 8 titles at different weights is staggering",
            "This was 9/11 for Filipinos.",
            "JMM was a great counterpuncher. A smart technician with a nice boxing IQ. Add Memo Heredia into the mix and a great fighter in his late 30s all of a sudden gets super jacked, has improved punch resistance ans power.... Then after the fight retires and rides off into the sunset.",
            "Mayweather's version would be 5 seconds of him saying, \"Money, money, money.\"",
            "Such an incredible montage. Anyone know who the original editor is?",
            "Pac was starting to come on too before that happened.\n\nWhat a fighter regardless of how it all played out.  Never be another like him.  His footwork and output was just showtime.",
            "If you believe in superstition or the supernatural, like Pacquiao and most Filipinos, this was simply inevitable. Before this KO, he just lost to Bradley. Before that, he had an underwhelming performance against JMM 3, while also having marital problems with Jinkee at the same time. All his vices, gambling and womanizing, all collided in one. This fight was the first fight when he changed his religion. This was also the first fight he didn't bring his rosary anymore, or doing the sign of the cross as it is not a tradition in his new religion.\n\nThis fight was simply the wake-up call to Manny from you-know-who. His way of life changed after this, which somehow also affects his boxing career going forward.",
            "Watching Mama Pac shouting hexes while clutching her rosary at Marquez before the knockout was hilarious though."

            "Premature stoppage. Guy just scored a double leg takedown and was about to turn the tide",
            "Quintana had too much fight in him for his own good. If he took a knee the first time his legs buckled, that's likely not a stoppage. But nope, he caught himself and took heavy shots to wind up with the first KD. He never fully recovered and got battered to the finish."

            "You gotta love how every time someone asks him how he would fight someone, he is consistent in saying he would make it boring. And he always delivers on those words too.  What a true champ.",
            "I dont think he could take on a Prime, bleached hair, fire flame shorts Manny...just sayin",
            "Keep the fight boring\n\nIf theres something to appreciate Shakur for, its his honesty. He knows the exact type of fighter he is, even if his style is insufferable",
            "He woulda ran as usual",
            "Floyd is able to do that because his size and reach were a massive advantage as well as pac being slower and more gun shy after the knockout. This plus Floyds incredible reflexes and mind makes it a tough fight for pac. Does he really think that strategy would work against manny when you dont have a reach advantage, dont have knockout power, and facing one of the greatest fighters of all time at his prime?  I think people underestimate just how good manny was lol you cant just box and make it boring. Manny was an excellent boxer as well.",
            "So many fighters tried this against manny and got fucking pounded into mud, does he think hes the first person to strategize like this? This mf forgot manny is wholesome and humble as can be but he was a ferocious vicious motherfucking punching machine from 1000 angles and no kind of sticking and moving gonna protect you from that",
            "PSA someone posted this video a few months before the De Los Santos fight, and 95% of the comments agreed Shakur would give Pacman heaps of trouble ",
            "Thats why we only re watch manny and the mexicans",
            "Manny don't fight on a Thursday bruh.",
            "I wouldve loved if he just out and out said yeah motherfucker wouldve clocked my ass, I wouldve done and checked, guys a legend and wouldve ran my ass out no doubt."
