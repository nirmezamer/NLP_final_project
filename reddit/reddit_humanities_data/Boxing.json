            "I propose we just stop talking about PPV numbers altogether. It's not a thing anymore and nobody is successfully selling an $80 tv event. It doesn't matter if they match up king kong vs godzilla l, it's not doing shit. I guess if you want to say somebody selling 200k sucks but someone doing 400k is great, you can make that argument but it's all peanuts in hindsight.\n\nRyan vs tank was an interesting outlier where one of the 2 is a massive social media personality and the other is a p4p fighter but those kind of match-ups are few and far to be had and it's simply too easy to steal a PPV.\n\nThey powers that be better figure some shit out in the next 5 years, a different model, a different PPV price point. A streaming platform that offers multiple sports including PPV for a reasonable price, otherwise they're going to struggle. This goes for UFC as well because sooner or later their fighter pay will have to catch up to the market and their abysmal PPV number will no longer work for them either.",

            "I can't tell if Roach just doesn't have power or what. He has a 37.5% KO rate and while he seems to have hurt a lower comp fighter, MccRory was still able to fight for a bit after getting dropped three times early in the fight",
            "I\u2019m all for good sportsmanship and being graceful in defeat, but I\u2019ve never quite seen anyone as happy to lose as Kambosos \n\nHe\u2019s the polar opposite of a sore loser to the point that it\u2019s very weird and almost pathetic \n\nAfter all 3 losses dude says the same old shit and clearly just cashing out, which I guess is fair enough"

He spent time living on the streets, but eventually found his way onto the Philippine national amateur boxing team. Within two years he went pro.\u00a0",

            "This was 9/11 for Filipinos.",
            "He woke up smiling.",
            "I wanted Marquez to beat pac so bad. I wanted him to KO him so bad to shut all the Deng pinoys up.\n\nThen it happened. I felt so bad seeing all the broken hearts and watching his wife freak out live on TV.\n\nAt that moment I realized I wished the worst against one of boxing greatest fighters.\n\nI was so set on Mexican ONLY fighters, that I took mannys rise and reign for granted.",

            "Floyd is able to do that because his size and reach were a massive advantage as well as pac being slower and more gun shy after the knockout. This plus Floyd\u2019s incredible reflexes and mind makes it a tough fight for pac. Does he really think that strategy would work against manny when you don\u2019t have a reach advantage, don\u2019t have knockout power, and facing one of the greatest fighters of all time at his prime?  I think people underestimate just how good manny was lol you can\u2019t just \u201cbox\u201d and make it boring. Manny was an excellent boxer as well.",

This mf forgot manny is wholesome and humble as can be but he was a ferocious vicious motherfucking punching machine from 1000 angles and no kind of sticking and moving gonna protect you from that",

            "Obviously the guy from the sport with the less rigid ruleset is always going to be the favorite, but I think it's clear from this video why the boxer did so well: he closed the distance and was super aggressive. At distance you're eating leg kicks. Close the distance into punching range and throw enough combos so your experience dodging punches beats there's. Also, need to learn some clinch escapes. But overall, it's all about how he closed the distance and forced the other kid to punch with him.",
