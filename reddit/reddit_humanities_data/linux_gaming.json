            "Is there an explanation why some game runs better on linux? I tried Alan Wake 2 on windows, encounter frequent texture popping switching between mind place, map, real world. Viewing notes or opening supply cache, I have to wait for the textures to properly load for few seconds. Sometimes, the textures simply won't load properly.\n\nBut on Linux, I didn't encounter this problem. The game load time also faster. The character dialogues during cutscene/loading screen is in sync perfectly - on windows the dialogues somehow was out of sync. Running on Fedora 40, RX7600.",
            "How do I combine the offline installer game files on gog to make the exe file game in linux? what tools will I need? I have wine, lutris, and nvidia proprietary drivers properly installed on fedora gnome.",
            "whats the difference between official/gnome/KDE versions of nobara? what do those even mean?",
            "how does EAC and all that realy work on linux. I get that its using a native EAC client but that deosnt work as good as the real one ofc, because it doesnt reach kernel level if im correct. So if i say im hwid banned on Fortnite by an example i would get kicked out of the game but if i install linux and go play there will i still get kicked by the same error as on windows? or can i play as usual again?",

            "With Nvidia 555 adding explicit sync, does this mean gamescope-session is more of a viable thing on Nvidia now? I remember a lot of distros implying you can't use it unless you have AMD.",
            "I have a problem with Steam: the library/store pages work fine, but if I ever try to open the friends list Steam throws a tantrum and freezes up and eventually crashes, however only the \"interface\" bit of steam crashes, it loads back up in a new window right away. What could be the cause?",
            "I installed Proton GE, but I cannot find where I extract its contents to on steam. What folder do I need to find to make it a proton version?\n\nThank you in advance.",
            "I'm a little confused on the difference between moving my steam games and installing them over again. Does wine/proton create its own config files when I play a game that's already installed? I know most files get stored in documents or appdata on windows, so what does Linux do? Should I just move the games I have installed on Windows into a games directory on Linux, or is it better to just straight up reinstall?\n\nKinda the same goes for software. Generally speaking, is it better to reinstall, or can I just point Wine to the application and let it go from there?"

I wanna be able to just play whatever game in my steam library.  \n2- I heard having an Nvidia GPU isn't great for Linux. Is that better now? I have a 3050, and I'm curious whether people have figured out the drivers for the card already if Nvidia hasn't cooperated yet.",

Comes out of the box with the beta drivers and all the required patches for performance and stability.

I finally switched to using linux fulltime and completely ditched windows about a week ago and im happy asf.",

I want to experience Wayland (and maybe also KDE, because I wanna tryout the wallpaper engine plugin). I heard Fedora was good, but I wanna hear your recommendations.\n\nNote: I have the GSX 1200 soundcard, I managed to get it running on Pulseaudio on mint, but had troubles with pipewire on Bazzite.",
