My post-grad plans involved me living in Korea for about 14 months and completing an independent research study. I received a fellowship from my college in order to do so. However, I am confused on which Visa is best for me to apply to and how to revoke Korean citizenship if needed. At the time when I was born here in the U.S, my parents were both Korean citizens and they did not get their green cards until I was 4 years old. It is important to note that my parents are separated and are no contact, so while I am able to provide my mom's green card and Korean passport to the embassy, I do not have any of my dad's documents. I currently have a U.S. passport and have not been to Korea in more than 10 years. What visa should I apply for, and is it possible for me to apply without providing my dad's documents to revoke any Korean citizenship I may unknowingly have?",
