Both wars are for someone else's claim.",
            "I just started playing CK3 this week. I think I'm too stupid for this game. I've watched tutorial videos, and I've played through the in game tutorial. I don't understand how to play this game but I want to. I've tried restarting two campains and I didn't get very far in either where it felt like there was nothing for me to do. All my counsel seats filled. No one to declare war with. Already scheming to win favor of the bishop who apparently hates me. But then I run out of money and it feels like there's nothing for me to do. \n\nI think I need to watch some playthrough videos and see what all the options do and when I'm supposed to choose them. This game got a 10/10 and I really want to experience what it has to offer.",
            "What's a good way to participate in a Great Holy War. I have only recently gotten into the 1066 start, but I've stayed focused on the northern vikings and Spain. What's a good start or ally to get pulled into a Great Holy War for the \"For The Faith!\" achievement?",
            "Any advice for playing in the area of Poland? More specifically I'm wanting to play as Prussia/Vidilist and make Lithuania because it's one of the first places I played in CK3 and just really struggled with because of the constant Norse raiders.",

            "When you press a claim for a title, you (or your claiment) gets the main title, if they are unlanded they will be given one county within the claim, and they inherit the vassals of the previous owner that are within the de jure borders of the title. I'm guessing what happened with Bohemia is the old king had vassals that owned land both within the kingdom of Bohemia, but also within the HRE in general. When you won the war, by inheriting those vassals, you also got some land outside of Bohemia. For the duchy of Angria, the previous owner either had no vassals, or their vassals had no land outside of the duchy. The larger a title gets, the worse the AI gets at managing which vassals belong to which ruler, and it gets harder to manage yourself, as your vassals with nice borders go off conquering internally and externally on their own."

            "Oooh baby, the imperial men-at-arms system is looking spicy, not to mention the administrative part!",
            "WOW this dev diary is loaded. Forget landless gameplay, pump this vassal gameplay right into my veins. One thing I appreciate a lot about crusader kings is how well it simulates an entire world, and it's been always a shame that vassals basically almost do nothing expect fabricate claims and join factions. These new features remind me a lot of the noble clans in Feudal Japan who spread their influence everywhere and control the empire from behind the scenes. I feel like now that'll be much more possible in crusader kings so I'm really looking forward to it. Conceptually, I think they really did a great job on this and improved on the merchant family gameplay from ck2. I've been pretty pessimistic about ck3 as a whole recently but if this new update radically transforms the vassal gameplay, it would really make that whole bundle worth buying for.",
            "Not gonna lie, I don't know enough about the organisation of the Byzantine Empire to know if this is an accurate depiction of its machinations or not. But all of the things that I read about administrative government are basically the stuff that I wanted playable republics to be.\n\nSo despite my initial reservations regarding the DLC (sorry but I'm still not interested in playing as the BE) I'm pretty hyped now.

I think it will be more fun to play as a vassal than an emperor with this set-up. \n\nI wonder if you can set up a feudal realm within an administrative realm. Historically, this sort of (re)patrimonialization was a huge problem for empires that manage to rise past feudalism. Can a governor conquer new territory outside his theme and make it a hereditary fief? Probably not, but it would be cool.\n\nI have to say that I'm surprised by the people who object to the extra game rules. It literally costs you nothing and they start off by default. What are these people complaining about?",

            "R5: Magnus Haroldson is the son of the 1066 start date's King of England, Harold II.\n\nAfter the defeat at Hastings, in which Harold II was killed, Magnus and his brothers found refuge in Ireland. However, they were unable to regain the throne of England lost by their father. In 1069 Magnus travelled to Denmark to enlist the help of the king there against the Norman conquerors of England. In his travels he also visited the southern coast of the Baltic Sea. The Polish Duke Boleslaw the Bold did not take part in the expedition, but allowed the Polish nobles of Pomerania to do so. The Danish king agreed to help the brothers. A Danish fleet and its allies set sail for England. According to the chronicler Orderic Vitalis (generally reliable), the Danes and English allies included Poles, Frisians, Saxons and Polabians/Veletians.\n\nAfter an unsuccessful expedition, Magnus again found himself in Poland. In 1074, his sister Gytha of Wessex married the Ruthenian prince Vladimir Monomakh. The only source mentioning him at that time is the 'Polish Chronicle' by Gall Anonymus. The Venetian monk mentions Magnus under the year 1093. He mentions him as Count of Wroc\u0142aw, who by virtue of his function was subordinate only to the palatine and the prince.\n\nAnd indeed, in 1093 there was a revolt in Silesia. Magnus, now being the Count of Wroc\u0142aw, subordinated himself to Zbigniew, Duke of Masovia. Around this time, he became associated with the powerful family of the Awdans (themselves of Scandinavian descent, but that's for another thread), who in 1093 supported Zbigniew against Sieciech, his heir presumptive vying for the throne. In 1097, the Awdans switched sides, and allied themselves with his younger brother Boles\u0142aw Krzywousty. There are basically zero sources on the role played by Magnus during this civil war. It is presumed he was trying to stay off-the-radar and not gain the ill will of any side in the conflict.\n\nAfter the conflict, Boles\u0142aw Krzywousty granted Magnus the title of *\u017cupan* of Mazovia (essentially a person who co-ruled the Duchy with him). From then on, he resided in the Czersk castle. His tasks included protecting Mazovia from invasions by the pagan Pomeranians. Magnus also supported Bishop Simon of Plock. He co-financed the construction of a Romanesque temple at Czersk Castle. Magnus died sometime after 1109. (the exact date is not known).\n\nIn 1966, archaeologists discovered a medieval grave near the Romanesque temple at Czersk. They found an iron-covered coffin inside which was the skeleton of a man with a sword and spear. At his feet were two bronze bowls and a wooden bucket, which was a theme also found in Scandinavian customs at the time. The positioning of the body was indicative of a knight (he died wearing a golden ring on his left hand, and complete dentition was preserved in the skull) The age of the buried person was determined to be 55-60 years, height 1.80 m. There is a very high probability that this is the grave of Magnus Haroldson.\n\nThere is in fact also a village named Magnuszew near Czersk, where he died. It is said he is the namesake (and founder) of this village, as it was first mentioned during his reign, and the fact that Y-DNA haplogroup I1 subclades I1-ASP and I1-T2 (both of which are originally found in England and Denmark) have a much higher frequency in families who live in/near the village compared to the rest of Poland.\n\nTwentieth century historians also believed that he was father of one W\u0142ost, who himself was the father of Piotr W\u0142ostowic, voivode of Duke Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth (nephew of Boles\u0142aw II) and progenitor of the \u0141ab\u0119d\u017a clan.",

The \u0141ab\u0119d\u017a clan's coat of arms features a swan, and the word itself means swan in Polish. Magnus' mother's (and ergo, Piotr's paternal great-grandmother's) name, *Ealdg\u0233\u00f0 Swann hnesce*, meant \"Edyth the Gentle Swan\". Coincidence? Probably."
