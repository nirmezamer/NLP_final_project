            "Does anybody use the Steam Workshop mod for more dynasty legacies? The one that has Witchcraft as a legacy. If so then do I have to be a Witch for the legacy to show up?",
            "Hi, why the CK3 allow me add someone to the court easily via cheat but didn't allow me to directly commission an artifact from the inspired person (as 'commission artifact' from the court option sucks at finding the legendary artificiers)?",
            "was playing CK2 ytd. As a duke in my king liege's realm i gobbled up all his count+ vassals leaving it just him and his baron tier vassals plus me and my vassals. Since i didnt have a claim on his kingdom i started a \"overthrow king\" faction with the understanding that it will pass the crown to the \"most liked vassal\" \n\nhowever when i won it says the king will abdicate in favor of one of his mayor vassals and when i enforced demands nothing happened and the mayor didnt become king, the king just kept his crown and nothing happened. What the hell??",

            "Do I understand correctly that all baronies in which a port can be built are considered coastal and such baronies benefit from buffs from the Polders tradition? I'm a little unsure whether the river banks of a barony make it coastal for this tradition, my domain is mostly in Mesopotamia.",
            "I conquered the county of Pisa, which only had a city and a church holding. Wanting to keep the county, I built a castle and figured that I could give the city to a new vassal. Well, it gave not only the city, but also the county and even the newly built castle to the new vassal. What should I have done to change the county into a feudal one and keep it?",
            "Idk how commission artifact (the button) works, as I almost never use it; I imagine it has to do with that courtier having an inspiration. What I've found works is if you have the Royal Court dlc, you can use the search function to look for people that have an inspiration, and if you get them to your court, you can fund their inspiration in your throne room that way. You can't choose what they will make, but you can at least search for people with an inspiration that is more likely to produce a legendary artifact.",
            "Don't know the exact answer, but I would guess it got messed up when it would pass to a Mayor, which would turn the Kingdom into a Republic since the Mayor's capital holding would be a city. The game probably didn't like changing a feudal kingdom into a Republic, and couldn't handle it in this instance so nothing happened.",
            "yeah i think that is the cause too. i think it would be no problem becoming a republic if the mayor was at least a count level in the first place \n\nman it sucks that the crown didnt pass to literally the only count+ vassal remaining (me) or at least pass to the most liked vassal as determined by the faction leader who did the fighting"

            "Depends on a number of factors. I just got into the game a few days ago but I played CK2 a lot a few years back and am already familiar with the basic mechanics of the franchise. Im planning on buying a few of the mechanic heavy DLCs because I see myself playing for a long while. If youre just getting used to CK or paradox in general, then I recommend playing the base game and seeing how you like it first. Theres plenty of content that will get you a long way.\n\nAlso, some DLCs are region/culture focused like Iberia, Vikings, and Persia. Its obviously not worth buying them if you have no interest in playing those cultures. Same goes for the cosmetic DLCs.",
            "There are a lot of useless (depends) stuff in the complete collection. Stuff like cosmetics etc\n\nIt's best to buy the base game + the important dlcs lile tours & tournaments, the northern lords etc"

It starts tribal, undeveloped and surrounded by a mix of big strong neighbours and smaller realms.\n\nI love the big but not massive amount of counties, the unique decision to form the capital of then kievan rus for a 100 year +1 dev growth. It is so satisfying to develop from a low dev tribal to one of the best cities in the map.\nI also love the geographical position-on the edge of many kingdoms and empires which is perfect for carving out my own custom territory (a favourite of mine). It is situated on the river dniprpo so if you have overseas raiding you can easily hit Byzantium and Rome. Also it has a nice special building, a variety of terrains nearby and an awesome colour scheme and coat of arms.\n\n\n\nKiev / K\u00f6nugar\u00f0r is best.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's the most fun duchy you have played in or what keeps pulling you back and why?",
