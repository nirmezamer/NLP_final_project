Spill the beans!\n4. **Keep It Real**: We'll do our best, but we're not magic. Some stuff might need a pro's eye or extra sleuthing.\n5. **Say Thanks!**: Appreciation goes a long way.

Apart from my wedding rings, I\u2019ve never owned nice jewelry like Tiffany\u2019s, so my first question is if it\u2019s authentic. I THINK it\u2019s the real deal and I will say, the quality of it is world\u2019s above anything I\u2019ve encountered. It has minor wear away on the inner jump ring clasp. What I paid and what I\u2019ve seen online concerns me some and it has a varied value, the highest being in the thousands. It says AD 750 on the 18\u201d chain and pendant is engraved. It includes what appears to be a new dust bag, necklace box and outer Tiffany\u2019s box. I can get it authenticated somewhere, but live rurally. I don\u2019t know where to start with that or if it\u2019s got resale value on any market. I mainly sell NWT beauty products on Mercari and Poshmark and have started on EBay. Definitely outside my base to know what I\u2019ve got. Appreciate any direction people can give!",

            "Honestly, my enthusiasm to sell my pre-loved items on Poshmark stalled a couple of months ago. I knew I wanted to get off the selling wagon. First, since my closet is full of items I purchased for myself, I emotionally disconnected from all of the pieces I could and marked the balance \u201cNot For Sale.\u201d Then, I thoughtfully marked down each piece to what I felt was a \u201cmore than fair\u201d discounted price and saw some limited sales. I shared each piece in my closet about every other day and saw a pretty good uptick in \u201cLikes.\u201d After selling about half of the discounted pieces over the course of a couple of weeks, I marked the rest 50% off. Within 8 hours, I sold all but 3 pieces. I pocketed $1,000, put the remaining pieces in a community yard sale and sold them for my original \u201cmore than fair\u201d price. My PM closet is now closed and I have a good sense of relief from the burden of selling. It was a fun hobby for this clothing enthusiast for a few years and I still really enjoy hunting for my next find. Clearly, buying and selling on Poshmark has changed over the years. I have always searched for the unique pieces not everybody else is wearing and PM is a great spot for that. I have learned so much about different designers and brands, which brands have adopted conscientious manufacturing principles and which brands don\u2019t align with my own values. All in all, the experience on PM has been a mostly satisfactory one, but surely not without its share of the negative parts of buying and selling on a virtual social media platform. The owner of PM has no motivation to improve what is a 100% user created content engine. Unless and until Naver (South Korean business conglomerate and owner of PM) sees a drastic decrease in users, we can expect it to continue to devolve.",
            "The lowballs!!!! Oh boy. People be getting blocked. Yesterday a lady loaded 14 items into her bundle totalling $615 and offered $125. Everything in her bundle was cowboy stuff which is selling well right now (Rodeo season where I am). I countered at 299 which was hurting my heart but I was like, okay well I\u2019ll give her a great deal. She came back at $200 and was like this is a really good offer. Good for who? Not good for me when I already sold 3 of the items in her bundle for $100. She is currently loading up her bundle again with all my new cowboy listings. Next lowball offer from her is gonna get a bitch blocked.",
            "It\u2019s been especially bad lately. I\u2019m really generous with offers but not when they\u2019re 75% off the asking price \ud83d\ude44 I also recently accepted less than I should have on a bag and the buyer opened a case.

Good luck!",
            "Poshmark has taken a lot of cues from Whatnot with live selling and it\u2019s hurting sellers and diminishing the value of items. Whatnot is a place to tune into new buyers and score deals to resell. Sales are final and it can be kind of a crap shoot, but the plus is that hopefully you can score enough deals to cancel out the duds. With poshmark, a seller forks over 20%, has to deal with returns, and is now pressured to do live shows risking a huge loss bc the live concept is still new to a lot of buyers so shows are small and a seller could get paid .80 cents for a high end item bc they have 2 savvy viewers. Yes, whatnot has a lux category, but the authenticity threshold is low so when you see \u201cnew LV wallets\u201d going for $83, it\u2019s possible they came from canal street and the seller still made bank. They are two totally different worlds, yet posh hopes to put the burden of profit on sellers by making them supposedly competitive with a platform that started selling common trading cards for $1 average.\nIf you disagree, I\u2019ve seen huge sellers on other platforms, even \u201ccelebrity sellers\u201d like hardcorepawn do a single Whatnot show, then nope out of it, likely bc they lost their shirts the first time. Live shows realistically are for low value items that are hard to move otherwise. I\u2019ve sold 14k earrings for $2, a Kate Spade long leather like new wallet for a whooping $2 on a live show! Never again unless I have 100 viewers. If Posh wants to change the identity that made it a trustworthy platform for buyers and profitable to sellers, then it\u2019s making itself irrelevant.",
            "I'm so glad you had such success in shutting things down! I agree so much with everything you've said Poshmark and the community and the relationship I've built with sustainability in fashion have all been remarkable for me and I'm grateful for the experience. In my almost a decade of being on the platform I really have only had 2-3 bad experiences, but yeah it's time to close this chapter",
