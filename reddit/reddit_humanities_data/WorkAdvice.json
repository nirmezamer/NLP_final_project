        "content": "I'm 21F, and just got hired for a student job that I really wanted at the hospital (I'm in a healthcare degree right now). I currently work another job that is only 1 shift a week (fridays). I interviewed, and was accepted at this new job which was listed as \"casual relief\" in terms of hours on the listing. At the interview, I asked them what this meant; they said it was basically that I'm not guaranteed hours and that it isn't salaried, but that I could get full time hours for the summer if I wanted to, and that they are flexible. I did not tell her about my availability at the interview, I figured that if I got the job I could then figure it out with them. My official contract that I signed is listed as \"part time\". Because of this, I assumed I could keep my other job that is one day a week. \n\nI was officially cleared to work this past Wednesday with a start date for next week, and was told that my manager will contact me regarding hours and schedule. I did not hear from her yesterday, so I drafted an email to tell her about my availability, which is that I have a doctors appointment in 2 weeks, that I will be away for one week at the end of July/beginning of August, and that I am not available Fridays. Before I sent it, I then received an email from her this morning which gave me a full time schedule, M-F 8 hours a day, for every remaining day of the summer. It was not \"here's a proposed schedule\", it was \"I have your schedule done, here it is and here is what you are doing every day\". \n\n  \nI replied back by saying basically \"thanks for sending me this, can I make some adjustments? I'm not free fridays, I have a doctors appointment this day, I am away this week and these are the only days I will need off for the summer\" (obviously much more professinional in my email)\n\nI've only had the one job in my very short adult life so far; is this normal for schedules to be made like this? Should I have told them right away in the interview that I needed certain days off, and that I would not be free these certain days? Does it sound like I misunderstood something about my hours? \n\nI wanted this job really badly, and it's really hard to get (not very many hospitals near me, much less that are hiring). Did I somehow mess up already and do I look like a bad, or unreliable employee from an employers end? Or am I overthinking? Any advice on what to do moving forwards is appreciated. thanks guys. \n\n\n\n",

            "Just have a conversation with them. \u201cI was told this was part time, flexible hours, more if I wanted them, etc.\u201d People are generally pretty understanding.",
            "Plus who ever hired you doesn't do scheduling..",
            "It's not the end of the world i think you stand a good chancw of sorting this but the not being available on Fridays in a role where you're expected to be flexible is something you should be bringing up with them earlier than you have this time.\n\nIt might stop you getting the job but equally if it's such an issue then you aren't going to get past probation anyway.",
            "Get that first experience and knowledge. Then decide where you want to go and how to get there.",
            "1. Availability should be discussed once it\u2019s confirmed you are hired\n2. If you want the job really bad for whatever reasons (e.g. it\u2019s necessary to have something like this on your resume to go on the career path you want), you will need to compromise and that may include quitting your Friday job if needed.\n\nI will tell you a story. I know someone after graduation from college, wanted to get into this management trainee role. It\u2019s one of the best in the industry at the time and is being seen as a \u201cdream job\u201d for a fresh grad. This person I know did two rounds of interviews locally. He made through them (many people applied couldn\u2019t even get through these). The final round of interview is in the US and it takes two days, and the interviewer said they do these interviews year-round. My friend told them he wouldn\u2019t be able to go to the interview closest to the date because he has obligations at this part-time job he was working at the time, and asked if he could join the next round of interview in US. The employer smiled and told him, sure we will contact you when the next round is open.\n\nWell guess what, no one ever contacted him for \u201cnext round\u201d.\n\n\nI don\u2019t see your problem in communicating the availability. As I said above it\u2019s probably best to communicate that right away after your job is confirmed. Your timing is off a bit but not a huge deal. However I feel like you didn\u2019t get your priority straight. If you really want this job \u201cso bad\u201d, why you linger so much on the Friday job?\nAs for the other unavailability I also don\u2019t know how flexible you are. Personally if I want a job \u201creal bad\u201d I definitely will communicate my availability, but include a caveat like \u201cPlease let me know if this works. If it doesn\u2019t please let me know and I can probably work something out\u201d.\n\nI will also just point out, to my knowledge, most hospitals jobs are hired internally, meaning they never even made it for public to see. By getting your foot in the door, you suddenly are now able to apply for many jobs that you would never even see at the outsider. Again, you need to get your priority straight.",
            "Once you accepted the job you should have stated that you do have some things coming up you have previously scheduled and asked the best way to communicate them to the person making the schedule. \n\nAs others have stated, if you really want this job why would you keep the other?\n\nedit to add, once you had gotten the info above on how to communicate your previously scheduled stuff, you would want to send that to the person asap and add but am willing to try and reschedule if needed.",
            "When you communicated your availability, what did they reply? The one day off and week off I would think would be ok, but I would definitely re-think how important this other Friday job is to you. Do you really want to miss out on 4 days of work to keep it?",
            "I would have mentioned the availability in the interview yes.",
            "Sounds like they advertised it as PRN but then hired you into part-time role and are giving you full time hours which is all kinds of screwy on SO many levels.\n\nYou said your contract states part-time; does it define what part time means?  We have 2 categories for part-time at my hospital: less than 16 hours each week and 16-34 hours per week.  Full-time is 35 hours and above.  With set shifts and regular expectation that these hours remain static *(not talking about rotating shifts - those are considered static in that X number of shifts each week for Y number of hours)* whereas PRNs can work 2-3 shifts a month or, as with students in summer, sign up for any/all available hours.  PRNs are also not benefits eligible.\n\nMost of our student employees typically work PRN because you only sign up for shifts when you have availability and this makes scheduling around classes and new term schedules so much easier.  \n\nI don't think you inherently messed anything up although in the future be frank if you have specific day(s) you cannot work.   I'd revisit your contract or offer letter and really read through what it says.",
