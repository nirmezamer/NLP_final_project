Assuming this is one of your first jobs, youll gain confidence through experience and time. The best part is you get to learn while on somebodys dime. Your boss is there to help teach you instead of expecting you to do everythign right. Maybe he or she isnt the best boss, and thats something youll need to establish boundaries on. Keep grinding and working on your craft, itll boost your confidence",

My only concern at this point is my previous work history in regards to attendance. I have had very poor attendance in some of my job positions. This new job has me filling out a form and they ask questions such as \u201chave you ever been fired from a job, have you ever resigned from a job to avoid being terminated, and have you ever faced disciplinary action from your job for any reason? \u201c\n\nThe answer to all of these questions is yes, and it has to do particularly with 2-3 jobs that I\u2019ve had and they were most recent on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9, unfortunately. \nI was fired from one job in 2019, I faced disciplinary action at two other jobs, and one of those jobs allowed me to resign before being terminated, and the other quit for other reasons. \n\nI have to explain my answers on a separate sheet of paper, which is nice because I am very articulate and it gives me the opportunity to shed light on the situation however, I am obviously very concerned that my previous history will automatically disqualify me, as attendance is a big deal.  \n\nI understand the immense irresponsibility and carelessness I had previously may shoot me in the foot at this particular juncture so please spare me any shit talk- I already know, and I\u2019m very disappointed in myself. I already made it past the interview process, and now I will have to do this very thorough investigation and I am wondering if you guys think it is better to simply withdraw my application or to plead my case when I\u2019m filling out this form. If I don\u2019t get this position now, it\u2019s still definitely something I hope to be able to reapply to and get in the future, though I don\u2019t want to put that out in the world because I do want this opportunity now. \n\nI believe I also have the opportunity to speak with the detective assigned to my case but I am nervous about being rejected from such a great opportunity like this. I plan to be 100% honest when submitting this form. I\u2019m just curious if you think there is any possible chance that they would still give me a shot? Is it worth begging essentially in my answers to these questions? Any advice will be greatly appreciated. \n\n",

Even if youre able to explain it away, a 9-1-1 dispatch position likely requires consistent attendance and being dependable. \n\nHaving been employed in HR by a county that had a 9-1-1 center, they have to pour A LOT of training into new hires. As in, absence is detrimental to training and once trained, your absence can cause delay in answering emergency calls. \n\nEmergencies happen. Unplanned absences happen. People need time off work.
