            "Odesza would need to be in its own tier. Regardless how you feel about their music, having a fully choreographed show with a drum line and other live instruments is a whole another standard compared to solo DJs on a deck",
            "I've seen way too many to tier list, but worst is probably Slushii. Track selection was just not for me, mixing was subpar, and it was in a cramped club full of bros. Favorite has been ODESZA, with Seven Lions, Marauda, Zeds Dead, Griz, and Fred Again b2b Skrillex as runners up.\n\nJust for fun if we include non electronic...Lil Yachty is the worst set I've ever been to, by a mile. It was at a multi-genre festival and I had nothing better to do for about an hour so I wandered over to his stage. Opened with a bunch of his high energy rap tracks which was all well and good, and then randomly switched to psychedelic rock 10% of the way through the set. Bad rock aside, the tone shift was so jarring it killed the vibe completely and half of the crowd (which was exactly what you would expect from a Lil Yachty set) just flat out left. I myself left after he started squabbling with his DJ about some shit, idk. Never again.",
