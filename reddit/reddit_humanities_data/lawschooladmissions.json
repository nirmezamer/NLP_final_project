        "content": "For some time now, the mod team has noticed an uptake in what we are calling grandstanding submissions: someone is technically posting an admissions result, but they are doing so as an excuse to soapbox about a politically-charged topic. The resulting threads tend to be extremely acrimonious, unproductive as an admissions discussion, and time-consuming to moderate. We are therefore implementing a new rule: no grandstanding.\n\nThis thread is being stickied in order to provide some guidance as to why this rule is being implemented, and to give some real-world examples of how the mod team will handle various scenarios.\n\n**Example 1: Grandstanding for a personal cause**\n\nThese threads usually arise when someone has a bone to pick with a particular individual at a school, usually a dean or a well-known professor who has taken some stance that the poster disagrees with. A recent example of these kinds of posts involved the actions arising from a certain dean's garden graduation party within the past month. You are allowed to disagree with Dean X, but if the purpose of the post is really more about talking about that person's actions than it is about the applicant's decision and outcomes, we will pull the thread. This would not be a potential basis for a ban.\n\n**Example 2: Grandstanding for a political cause**\n\nThese threads usually involve URM, affirmative action, DEI, and other racially-charged topics, as well as accomodations. You are allowed to have views on these topics, but if the post is really an excuse for giving a hot take on one of those issues, it will be pulled. Be advised, this could also be a basis for a ban, if it runs sufficiently afoul of our URM policy.\n\n**Example 3: Grandstanding for a geopolitical cause**\n\nThese threads usually involve issues like Ukraine, or Israel/Palestine, or China/Taiwan. They tend to mirror the same issues as the political causes, and carry the same risk of a ban. \n\nTo be clear: *we are not saying discussion on these topics is entirely forbidden*. We are *asking* you to please exercise discretion when making posts.\n\nThank you.",

It's become tiresome opening up this subreddit and having multiple threads about people talking about Columbia for example and spewing whatever garbage they have. Let's just throw it all out and go back to discussing our stats or employment outcomes. \n\nI know I commented a lot in the other thread but only because I feel like I need to stand up for all the hate that's been spewed. There's been multiple insane anti-semites in that thread and I think it should just be stamped out. Redirect them to other subreddits where that talk is encouraged.",
            "Political discussions beling on a POLITICS thread, not an ADMISSIONS thread. IMO. That said, there's little doubt the upheavals and conflagrations over Israel and Hamas at Yale and Columbia could adversely affect their expected  yield of RD accepted students at both schools. So, its likely those working wait lists at Columbia and Yale are salivating right now, hoping an unintended benefit of the turmoil embroiling both campuses will engender additional spots opening up from their waitlists.",
            "I think it\u2019s incredibly dismissive to view this as some political issue or foreign policy that the universities are somehow absolved from. The Columbia protests were so that the university will divest funding to an ongoing genocide. These universities are directly involving themselves using money they are receiving from us as students, they are not just some bystander party.

If you are considering school X, and school X is making the news for issues related to something that impacts you personally, it is fair to discuss it. To broadly ban all political discussion is to unduly silence an irreducible percentage of our community. \n\nA hard ban is also counter to the principles of the law as a self-regulating profession. We are providing a rule, that we expect community members to understand and to reasonably comply with, much the way a bar expects practitioners to self-regulate on ethical issues.",

I see many posts criticizing schools for being overly conservative and people using that as a basis for their decisions, and now just because the issue pertains to how schools respond to Palestine/Israel it should be stamped out? \n\nJust don\u2019t open the post, or click out of it if you don\u2019t want to engage with it.",

GMU though has a deliberate bent.\n\nHis comments re: GMU are of course exaggerated, but consider. GMU's reputation in DC isn't commensurate with it's current rank and its placement into firms (positions many are looking for here) is particularly negligible (7%). 4 students total getting into good firms last year.

            "Currently in the DMV now - top schools are UVA, GT, GW, then GMU/American/Howard/CUA. DC proper and northern VA are super expensive, but you can find a room in a townhouse in Arlington for much cheaper than Foggy Bottom or NoMa/Cap Hill.",
            "Mason is not just conservative in the classroom. The school\u2019s leadership seems focused on protecting its high-profile conservatives at the expense of students. Read the recent WSJ expos\u00e9 on how the school protected a bigwig antitrust professor (Joshua Wright) who preyed on female students for over a decade, with the school seemingly turning a blind eye because the professor was well-connected in conservative circles and very successful in fundraising. This sort of conservative influence on the school\u2014outside of academics in the classroom, but instead at the level of administration\u2014is what really affected Mason\u2019s reputation over the last decade. \n\nMason used to be a well-regarded regional school. Now, it is best known for its partisan turn. That will benefit you if your target outcomes align with the conservative legal/political project, but otherwise it will mean that some people look askance at your education.",
            "As a local to the region, the \"lay prestige\" ranking would be GULC - GW - GMU/American/Howard. GULC is the highest-ranked school in the area and offers students the best placement for big law and federal clerkships, but graduating GW debt-free and in the top 1/3rd of the class would set someone up for great career outcomes too. Howard is also known for placing a lot of its graduates into Big Law. \n\nGMU may not necessarily be a \"bad\" option, but you'll be competing for employment with others who have attended more highly regarded schools. The conservative reputation of GMU may also play a part in its reputation. For what its worth,  I had a brief conversation with a conservative judge from Southern VA a couple months back and he said he likes to hire clerks from GMU.",
            "If GMU is the school you got into, and you maxed out your LSAT, go with it. The only issue with GMU is that you likely will have to be at least in the top third to be competitive enough to even get a chance of a clerkship. But the school definitely has Conservative ties, so you could get a clerkship easier from there than any other non t14 law school, not being in the top 10% of the class."
