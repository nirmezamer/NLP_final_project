If you believe your post was filtered and is still not approved after 24 hours, feel free to send a message to the mods. Thank you!\n\n**Retakes**\n\nRetakes are a no brainer in these circumstances:\n\n* You scored at the low end of your PT average\n* Your scores were still increasing in the weeks up to test day\n* You had less than perfect on logic games\n\nIf none of these are true for you, and you're clearly stalled, then make this clear. Most people posting have retake potential.\n\nEven 2-3 points can make a large difference in admissions/scholarships. That's why so many people here post \"retake!\" to a lot of situations.\n\n**Canada?** Most people here are US. So most advice doesn't apply. Feel free to ask questions, though, there are some Canadians. Big differences:\n\n* Almost no scholarships. \n* Most schools are pretty good.\n* Go where you want to practice\n* GPA is significantly more important. Do all you can to raise it.\n* For god's sake don't go abroad. That's Canada's TTT.",

            "Question: In reality how hard or difficult is the LSAT? \nI've been lurking in this sub for a while and getting a 170 seems way harder than a lot of comments are making it out to be. A 170 puts you in about the top 97.1% of those taken the test. Is the test just absolutely grueling or is part of this high percentage those that weren't serious about law school or didn't study? I want to become a lawyer and try to remain optimistic but sometimes these stats for not even T-14 but T-30 make many of these schools unrealistic. Someone has to get 160's right?",

            "1. It depends where you start. If you start high 150s, a 170 isn't so hard. If you start at 135, takes a lot more work and may be impossible.\n2. That said, a good chunk of the bottom half percentiles likely took the test without prep or without much. LSAC has some data on this frequency of study methods. \n3. The sub is not a representative sample. First, people who come to a place to talk about a thing will be better than average. Second, only those who feel confident tend to post. So it's kinda like instagram: you see only those doing well\n\nThe percentiles don't lie. 151 is average.",

        "content": "For some time now, the mod team has noticed an uptake in what we are calling grandstanding submissions: someone is technically posting an admissions result, but they are doing so as an excuse to soapbox about a politically-charged topic. The resulting threads tend to be extremely acrimonious, unproductive as an admissions discussion, and time-consuming to moderate. We are therefore implementing a new rule: no grandstanding.\n\nThis thread is being stickied in order to provide some guidance as to why this rule is being implemented, and to give some real-world examples of how the mod team will handle various scenarios.\n\n**Example 1: Grandstanding for a personal cause**\n\nThese threads usually arise when someone has a bone to pick with a particular individual at a school, usually a dean or a well-known professor who has taken some stance that the poster disagrees with. A recent example of these kinds of posts involved the actions arising from a certain dean's garden graduation party within the past month. You are allowed to disagree with Dean X, but if the purpose of the post is really more about talking about that person's actions than it is about the applicant's decision and outcomes, we will pull the thread. This would not be a potential basis for a ban.\n\n**Example 2: Grandstanding for a political cause**\n\nThese threads usually involve URM, affirmative action, DEI, and other racially-charged topics, as well as accomodations. You are allowed to have views on these topics, but if the post is really an excuse for giving a hot take on one of those issues, it will be pulled. Be advised, this could also be a basis for a ban, if it runs sufficiently afoul of our URM policy.\n\n**Example 3: Grandstanding for a geopolitical cause**\n\nThese threads usually involve issues like Ukraine, or Israel/Palestine, or China/Taiwan. They tend to mirror the same issues as the political causes, and carry the same risk of a ban. \n\nTo be clear: *we are not saying discussion on these topics is entirely forbidden*. We are *asking* you to please exercise discretion when making posts.\n\nThank you.",

            "I think you guys should just ban the political talk altogether. It's become tiresome opening up this subreddit and having multiple threads about people talking about Columbia for example and spewing whatever garbage they have. Let's just throw it all out and go back to discussing our stats or employment outcomes. \n\nI know I commented a lot in the other thread but only because I feel like I need to stand up for all the hate that's been spewed. There's been multiple insane anti-semites in that thread and I think it should just be stamped out. Redirect them to other subreddits where that talk is encouraged.",
            "Political discussions beling on a POLITICS thread, not an ADMISSIONS thread. IMO. That said, there's little doubt the upheavals and conflagrations over Israel and Hamas at Yale and Columbia could adversely affect their expected  yield of RD accepted students at both schools. So, its likely those working wait lists at Columbia and Yale are salivating right now, hoping an unintended benefit of the turmoil embroiling both campuses will engender additional spots opening up from their waitlists.",
            "I think its incredibly dismissive to view this as some political issue or foreign policy that the universities are somehow absolved from. The Columbia protests were so that the university will divest funding to an ongoing genocide. These universities are directly involving themselves using money they are receiving from us as students, they are not just some bystander party. Shouldnt that be discussed as a decision factor?",
            "I got WAITLISTED at Boston College because of my stance on CRT!",
            "We discussed this. Less an outright ban than a moratorium. However, there are absolutely areas where these discussions are a valid consideration for applicants to take into account. If you are considering school X, and school X is making the news for issues related to something that impacts you personally, it is fair to discuss it. To broadly ban all political discussion is to unduly silence an irreducible percentage of our community. \n\nA hard ban is also counter to the principles of the law as a self-regulating profession. We are providing a rule, that we expect community members to understand and to reasonably comply with, much the way a bar expects practitioners to self-regulate on ethical issues.",
            "I disagree, I think politics and actions/inactions by colleges are a factor some use to determine where they want to go to school. I see many posts criticizing schools for being overly conservative and people using that as a basis for their decisions, and now just because the issue pertains to how schools respond to Palestine/Israel it should be stamped out? \n\nJust dont open the post, or click out of it if you dont want to engage with it.",
            "If you dont like talking about politics I have some bad news for you about the legal profession",
            "true bc as long as the protests go on at Columbia (which will increase as the election approaches), classes will be remote.",
            "Actually the Columbia protestors are uninformed and what is happening in Gaza is not genocide. If it was genocide it would have been over on October 8th.... See, this is exactly why political opinions should be banned. However I think it would be fair to discuss how unsafe it would feel to be a Jewish student at Columbia and perhaps that would be a reason to choose U of C over Columbia.",
            "You can discuss the politics of the school without getting into specifics. I saw a very nice thread with good conversation discussing a school being very liberal. Nobody got specific, nobody had any problems. \n\nThe issue is when you say a school is liberal or conservative and then go deep into your gripes with the ideology that you find to be bad. When I say ban the politics, I mean ban the specifics. You can ask if George Mason's conservative nature is going to be an issue for you as a liberal but you shouldn't be asking if voting for Biden is going to cause those damn Trumper assholes at George Mason to hate you and have no friends (I don't actually believe this statement about George Mason students). You see the difference?"
