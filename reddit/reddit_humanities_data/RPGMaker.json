        "content": "Welcome!\n\nIf you are reading this post, then you are likely a new arrival to this subreddit. Perhaps you dabbled with RPGMaker years ago and you want to get back into game development, but don't know where to jump back in. Perhaps you saw a sale on an RPGMaker product and think this might be the time to start your gamedev journey. Or perhaps you're looking to buy a gift for an aspiring game developer in your life and you've come across our humble subreddit. Regardless as to what brought you here, we hope that this guide (and the discussion below) may provide you with input as to which RPGMaker you should buy.\n\n**I'm in a hurry. What should I get?**\n\nRPGMaker MZ. If the cost is prohibitive, please be aware that it goes on sale regularly.\n\n**Which RPGMakers are available?**\n\nBy searching the official RPGMaker website or Steam, you will be able to find: RPGMaker 2000, 2003, XP, VX, VXAce, MV, and MZ. There are also RPGMakers available on home consoles and as a Unity plug-in.\n\n**Are there any I should stay away from?**\n\nJust to get this out of the way, we would encourage people to stay away from RPGMaker Unite (the Unity plug-in), any of the home console versions (including the newly announced RPGMaker WITH), and VX. Unite is not well supported and is generally considered by the community as a product failure. Also, Unity's reputation has been sullied as a tool for aspiring game developers. The home console versions are quaint and may be fun, but they do not support plug-ins and you can only share with others on the console. VX is an older RPGMaker and was exceeded in every way by VXAce, including major bug fixes.\n\n**Let's start with 2000, 2003, XP, VXAce. What do people think about those?**\n\nLet's focus on the older makers first: 2000, 2003, and XP. If people use these engines, it is generally because they like the graphical style of the standard pack-in (\"RTP\") graphics. In general, people have migrated away from 2000 and 2003 (with 2003 having more features and an improvement over 2000). However, there are still some people who develop with XP. XP supports scripts (\"scripts\" are extra code plug-ins that add mechanics and other functions). XP also has a relatively unique mapping system that can result in some particularly pretty maps, including support for very large tilesets. It is not uncommon for some of the most attractive non-parallax maps (i.e., not built outside the engine in photoshop and imported back in) to have been created in XP. Many find that XP captures the SNES 16-bit era perfectly. However, since XP (and 2000 and 2003) are older products, there is limited active support online; you will find yourself having to look at old message boards hoping that your question has already been asked and answered. That said, if you strapped for cash and don't mind the extra effort, you can develop something quite attractive and fun in XP.\n\nVXAce was a major upgrade from XP and added some new things like .avi support, a more recent scripting language, higher caps on variables and switches, and some better options when configuring text boxes. The mapping functions are arguably downgraded from XP. And some people find the RTP graphics to be too \"chibi\" for their liking compared to XP, although some people like them more than the XP RTP; regardless, it is a major graphical shift from XP so google some screenshots to see which you like more. Scripts are still supported in VXAce. You may also find that there are still active VXAce developers and scripters, so you may be able to find help online. Also, many script repositories are still active and used. VXAce goes on sale regularly and, if you have experience with the scripting language (Ruby), you can do some very powerful things with it. It is regularly on sale for less than US$5 and is considered the extreme-budget-conscious choice.\n\n**It seems like the debate falls down around MV vs MZ. What's the deal with that?**\n\nMV was a huge jump forward after VXAce. There were a number of major improvements including: changing to a new language (Javascript from Ruby); adding export support for Mac (kinda - see the comments below about Mac support), Linux, Android, and iOS; changing to an easier and streamlined plug-in support system; an improved in-engine character generator; and supporting side-view battling natively. The RTP changed again from VXAce, although the chibi nature of the graphics generally remain.\n\nMZ is generally considered to be an improvement over MV. I encourage you to visit this page for a larger discussion: [https://www.reddit.com/r/RPGMaker/comments/vk9yqh/is\\_mz\\_worth\\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RPGMaker/comments/vk9yqh/is_mz_worth_it/) and u/Fear5d 's excellent breakdown. Put simply, MZ: improved performance, improved the mapping and layering system, supports different tileset resolutions (including those from previous RPGMakers), improved script calling, changed/improved the animation system (although some find it finicky), added a few battle modes, comes with more pre-made sounds and music and traits, has new game data information that can be tracked, shows a preview of move routes when creating them, and improved plug-in management.\n\n**With all those advantages, why is there a debate? Seems like MZ is the clear winner.**\n\nSince MZ is the \"newest\" (we don't talk about Unite), it is the most expensive. And MV goes on bigger sales more regularly. Put simply, MV is cheaper than MZ.\n\nMV also has a very active userbase, has a lot of existing plug-ins (many of which are supported or so well-tested that they are very stable), and many plug-ins are cheap-to-free. If you don't feel like many of the improvements in MZ would be worth it to you (e.g., you don't care about layering or tileset flexibility or the extra sounds and music or the increased performance/stability), then you can make a very good and modern game in MV for a fraction of the cost.\n\nMany plug-ins exist for MZ - and many are the same and/or similar to the ones available for MV - but many are paid.\n\n**If I make a game in VXAce or MV, can I move it to MZ later?**\n\nNot really. If it is a very standard game using RTP elements, you may have some luck moving from MV to MZ; there are a handful of converter programs or processes out there. In general, if your game has any complexity or scripts/plug-ins, it's will be harder. Converting from VXAce to MZ is incredibly challenging. \n\n**Can I make a FPS, MMO, shmup, side-scroller platformer, or visual novel in RPGMaker? Is one maker better than the others for non-RPG game development?**\n\nSomeone once said, \"RPGMaker makes easy things easier, and hard things harder.\" Yes, you CAN make those kinds of games in RPGMaker. And those non-RPG games are easier to develop in MV or MZ than any other RPGMaker. But it still isn't easy. If you want to make those kinds of games, I would encourage you to try PixelGameMaker or Godot or VNMaker or Renpy, or even things like GameMaker, Unreal, or Unity.",
