I specifically leave the trees around the arena alone as much as possible because any two hits will break them, so you can use them to kill the witches very effectively even as a sheep. The other two are just not downtime. They both give you something to do, whether it\u2019s killing the witches while avoiding the hex or testing the copies to see which one is real (though 90% of the time it will be the furthest one anyway)",

            "We are definitely getting more of Zagreus by the time of full release. Can hardly wait to see how Mel's interactions with her big bro will be! (Preparing myself because I have a feeling I'll be emotionally wrecked)",
            "I just want to be able to pet Cerberus again",
            "I like Mel, but I think the overall tone of her story lends her to be less *entertaining*, at least from a certain perspective. Mel's mission has really stakes that she has dedicated her life to. And she takes her mission really seriously. As a result i also take the mission quite seriously, but at the same time, it means Mel is not going to be cracking jokes as often as Zah did. So I think it's less that Mel is a worse protag and more that her mission is much darker than Zag's",
            "I love Zag, but dont want him as a protag. It's nice if he returns as a permanent side character you can interact with in the crossroads and who would help in the underworld.",
            "Since we see Chronos throw Mel into past-Asphodel, my theory is that Zagreus is just constantly doing runs in a time loop and doesn\u2019t realize it",
            "Zag is definitely coming back in 1.0 I don't think you have to worry about that his fate isn't sealed yet. As for Melinoe I think she is incredibly badass I can't rank one or the other.",
            "I really like when the sequel to a game has you fight the player character from the previous game as a super hard postgame boss, so I\u2019m honestly kinda hoping they do something along those lines with Zag.  It doesn\u2019t matter much how they justify it (a friendly training match, he\u2019s brainwashed, etc.), but it would be super cool!",
            "Tbh everyone clamoring endlessly for Zag is starting to get a little annoying. I like him too, and he will have his time I am sure, but him being gone is important for other characters to shine and grow into their own.\n\nI don't know, I don't want to assume things but at the same time I wonder if people are really giving Mel a chance. I feel like there is a very real chance people got Zag first and now are reacting to having a different playable character by going \"No, I want Zag. I hope they make Zag playable. Zag is so much funnier. My favorite line in the game is Chaos dissing Mel by saying Zag is better.\" And so on.\n\nIdk. Not really directed at you OP. Just at the Zag discourse in general, I guess.",
            "Well it's been implied that Zagreus is the god of blood (theorised and stated as much by Achilles) so it's possible that  the ultimate endgame involves breaking Zagreus out of temporal stasis in order to have him revoke the blood sacrifices made to Chronos in order to restore him (like stealing his tribute to weaken him) allowing for the true death of Chronos or at least allowing Mel to re-scatter him across Tartarus.\n\nObviously we still need to be able to do runs after the end of the story so perhaps they build several fake houses of hades and store Chronos's dismembered parts in each one. Each run of Melinoe's being an expedition to cull the reformation of that particular part.\n\nAs for the surface perhaps once Chronos goes down properly the undead and mortals on his side decide to seek revenge for their master by attacking olympus and so the war rages on.",
            "I am desperate to see Zagreus (and everyone back at the house) again but I also very much want H2 to stay Melino\u00eb\u2019s story and not get overshadowed by his return, so I think Supergiant will probably trickle information about him until a pivotal moment. I suspect Zag might actually be a key to defeating Chronos (god of blood) so I expect he\u2019ll be important in some way.\n\nMostly I want Mel and Zag to finally unite in a safe place and the \u201cTIME PASSES\u2026\u201d header to crop up so that you know instinctively they cried into each other\u2019s arms for hours and hours. I need it so badly"
