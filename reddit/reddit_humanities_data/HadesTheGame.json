I specifically leave the trees around the arena alone as much as possible because any two hits will break them, so you can use them to kill the witches very effectively even as a sheep. The other two are just not downtime. They both give you something to do, whether it\u2019s killing the witches while avoiding the hex or testing the copies to see which one is real (though 90% of the time it will be the furthest one anyway)",

Mel's mission has really stakes that she has dedicated her life to. And she takes her mission really seriously. As a result i also take the mission quite seriously, but at the same time, it means Mel is not going to be cracking jokes as often as Zah did. So I think it's less that Mel is a worse protag and more that her mission is much darker than Zag's",

I suspect Zag might actually be a key to defeating Chronos (god of blood) so I expect he\u2019ll be important in some way.\n\nMostly I want Mel and Zag to finally unite in a safe place and the \u201cTIME PASSES\u2026\u201d header to crop up so that you know instinctively they cried into each other\u2019s arms for hours and hours.
