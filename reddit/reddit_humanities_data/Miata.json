        "content": "I have recently updated the rules and wanted to announce the changes. Although some of it is new, none of this should be surprising.\n\n**1. be excellent to each other!**\n\nSelf explanatory. Don't be a dick.\n\n**2. No Car Shaming**\n\nHaving a preference and stating it is okay. Making a point to be rude about it is not.\n\nThis includes being obnoxious about your preference for manual transmissions.\n\n**3. No Price Checks!**\n\nThe old rule 3 has been split in two, just to emphasize it. No. Price. Check. Posts. Please comment in the purchase advice thread.\n\n**4. No car buying/selling advice posts.**\n\nThis includes, but is not limited to:\n\n* Is this a good price? See rule 3.\n* What should I look for? Buyers guides are linked in the buying advice topic.\n* Will I fit? Go to a dealership, car show, or driving event, and sit in one.\n* What's your insurance rate? Talk to an agent or check a providers website.\n* Can/should it be a daily? No one knows your commute better than you.\n* Is it a good first car? Depends on who you are.\n* Help me convince my parents? That never works.\n\nPosts asking for advice on individual parts are encouraged! Do you have a question about a specific factory feature that you can't find info on? All good! Want buying advice on coilovers, turbo kits, spoilers, etc? Ask away! Did you find a hilariously bad car listing no one will buy? Share the laughs!\n\n**5. No AI Prompt Submissions**\n\nWhen polled, the vast majority of the community was in agreement that they did not want to see AI posts.\n\n[Let's talk about AI art prompts. : Miata (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Miata/comments/1al3bd7/lets_talk_about_ai_art_prompts/)\n\n**6. No Spam Content**\n\nIncluding but not limited to:\n\n* Bot reposts - report these, please!\n* Any clothing focused post is subject to deletion. Too many bots.\n* No begging for donations. Fund your own hobbies.  Any such posts will be deleted, and you might be banned.\n* This isn't Marketplace or Craigslist, don't post your own used items or car for sale.\n\nSelf-promotion is acceptable, within reason. The content must be immediately and primarily Miata focused and should stand on its own. Don't plead for everyone to like and subscribe to your channel.\n\nVendors of Miata products (not clothing!) are welcome!\n\n**Why do we have the rules on post content?**\n\nTo avoid daily, or even hourly, repeats of the same conversations, and to encourage a minimum level of effort invested. We want to make room for discussion of less well documented topics. While we do want those new to the community to feel welcome, we also don't want experienced hands feeling like they only see the same 5 conversations on repeat. In case you feel like this is not fair, please note that \"Search for duplicates before posting\" is sitewide guidance and not just an /r/miata rule.",

I am aware that I will have to make a lot of compromises (= renting a car to carry friends/equipment) but I am willing to risk it.\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t know what would be a sensible choice. Slightly used 2023 ND2 with Sports Package (~27.000\u20ac)/slightly used 2023 ND2 Homura (~30.000\u20ac) or a new 2024 ND3 Homura (~38.000\u20ac).\n\nDo you think that the one-year longer warranty as well as the new upgrades for the ND3 are worth the premium? Should we expect slightly used ND3s to hit the market with good prices soon?\n\nI was thinking it might even be a financial sensible idea due to the short production of it and potentially good resale value.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nThanks in advance!",

Kind of the ideal situation- garage kept weekend car, original owner, Grand Touring, manual, 38k(!!!) original miles, not cross listed online- I was the first caller, apparently. He wants $9k for it (or best offer). I am trying to determine if this is a \u201cpretty good\u201d or \u201crun buy it right now idiot\u201d level of a deal. Trying to parse used prices before the recent market upswings has been a bit hard, so I figured I\u2019d field opinions here. It\u2019s white with a brown leather interior- my perfect color combo on an NC, personally. It\u2019s in incredible cosmetic shape and was gleaming in the sunset when I ran across it."
