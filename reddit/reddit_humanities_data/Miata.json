        "content": "I have recently updated the rules and wanted to announce the changes. Although some of it is new, none of this should be surprising.\n\n**1. be excellent to each other!**\n\nSelf explanatory. Don't be a dick.\n\n**2. No Car Shaming**\n\nHaving a preference and stating it is okay. Making a point to be rude about it is not.\n\nThis includes being obnoxious about your preference for manual transmissions.\n\n**3. No Price Checks!**\n\nThe old rule 3 has been split in two, just to emphasize it. No. Price. Check. Posts. Please comment in the purchase advice thread.\n\n**4. No car buying/selling advice posts.**\n\nThis includes, but is not limited to:\n\n* Is this a good price? See rule 3.\n* What should I look for? Buyers guides are linked in the buying advice topic.\n* Will I fit? Go to a dealership, car show, or driving event, and sit in one.\n* What's your insurance rate? Talk to an agent or check a providers website.\n* Can/should it be a daily? No one knows your commute better than you.\n* Is it a good first car? Depends on who you are.\n* Help me convince my parents? That never works.\n\nPosts asking for advice on individual parts are encouraged! Do you have a question about a specific factory feature that you can't find info on? All good! Want buying advice on coilovers, turbo kits, spoilers, etc? Ask away! Did you find a hilariously bad car listing no one will buy? Share the laughs!\n\n**5. No AI Prompt Submissions**\n\nWhen polled, the vast majority of the community was in agreement that they did not want to see AI posts.\n\n[Let's talk about AI art prompts. : Miata (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Miata/comments/1al3bd7/lets_talk_about_ai_art_prompts/)\n\n**6. No Spam Content**\n\nIncluding but not limited to:\n\n* Bot reposts - report these, please!\n* Any clothing focused post is subject to deletion. Too many bots.\n* No begging for donations. Fund your own hobbies.  Any such posts will be deleted, and you might be banned.\n* This isn't Marketplace or Craigslist, don't post your own used items or car for sale.\n\nSelf-promotion is acceptable, within reason. The content must be immediately and primarily Miata focused and should stand on its own. Don't plead for everyone to like and subscribe to your channel.\n\nVendors of Miata products (not clothing!) are welcome!\n\n**Why do we have the rules on post content?**\n\nTo avoid daily, or even hourly, repeats of the same conversations, and to encourage a minimum level of effort invested. We want to make room for discussion of less well documented topics. While we do want those new to the community to feel welcome, we also don't want experienced hands feeling like they only see the same 5 conversations on repeat. In case you feel like this is not fair, please note that \"Search for duplicates before posting\" is sitewide guidance and not just an /r/miata rule.",

            "Looking to buy this 1999 with 121k miles on it for $4k. Its an automatic. I dont know shit about Miatas or cars in general but this one seems like a good price and nicely maintained? It has the original hard top which Ive read is rare. Timing belt changed at 90k miles. Anything I should ask about or look for? KBB says that fair value for this car is like $5k-$7k in my area.",

            "I am looking at an NC (2007) locally for sale in a cute old mans yard. Kind of the ideal situation- garage kept weekend car, original owner, Grand Touring, manual, 38k(!!!) original miles, not cross listed online- I was the first caller, apparently. He wants $9k for it (or best offer). I am trying to determine if this is a pretty good or run buy it right now idiot level of a deal. Trying to parse used prices before the recent market upswings has been a bit hard, so I figured Id field opinions here. Its white with a brown leather interior- my perfect color combo on an NC, personally. Its in incredible cosmetic shape and was gleaming in the sunset when I ran across it.",
            "I Turo'd a RF recently, and the owner was pretty adimant that it was better than the soft top. he pointed out that the soft top is, unsuprisingly, delicate, and may need some care from time to time. I'm also 6'3\" and there was only an inch or so of head room left. not a problem for me, but if you are a tall person you might prefer the extra headroom from a soft top.",
            "You can fling the soft top open / closed with one arm in something like two seconds. \n\nThe RF has an awesome side profile with the roof closed.",
            "I am kind of under a similar place. Can buy cash for either, but draining a bit of my savings in order to pay for a run car is daunting. Ive been more so going back and forth between NC2 or ND2. ND1 with the worse engine and transmission issues makes me want to avoid.",
            "That looks rough for 30k miles. I would bet it needs some money to replace wear items like radiator, gaskets, etc since it doesnt seem super well taken care of despite low miles. Id probably pay $9k max for that specific one"

This color and rims only came in the 2002 year model SE special edition trim, I believe only 1491 made in that color. The se also came in blazing yellow, which there are 1000 of. Basically the top trim plus extras and is limited. The rims are OEM and made by enkei.",
            "Yes, if you look carefully at a bunch of NB side profiles, it's normal. How prominent it looks varies depending on how it's sitting, alignment, and lighting/shadow. It carried over from the NA, where it was a last-minute design change to improve handling by shortening the wheelbase, after the body was finalized. The NB wasn't a ground-up new chassis, but more of a major facelift focused on the outer panels, so they didn't fix this quirk until the NC.",
