        "content": "Edit on 2/21/2024: This is still up-to-date info!\n\nTime capsules are still being approved today. It's a slow process, but it's still happening. Not every capsule gets approved, and the ones that do are hand-selected. \n\nSo if you see anyone saying otherwise, feel free to reference this post :)\n\nUse this thread to AMA about time capsules!\n\nEdit: A couple important things I want to point out:\n\n- When a capsule is jettisoned, it's uploaded to the [time capsule website](https://subnautica.unknownworlds.com/time-capsules) where devs manually review them.  \n- A dev must approve a capsule before it starts showing up in the game.  \n- Around 40 time capsules are placed in your game as you explore, and only spawn in surface biomes.  \n- Time capsules can come from any game mode, but they are platform-specific. Which means PC will only get capsules from other PC players, Switch from Switch players, etc.    \n- A list of blacklisted items can be found [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/zq65tg/lots_of_people_are_saying_time_capsules_are_not/j0z7sdt/)  \n\nThere have been some fantastic questions so far. Feel free to scroll through the comments (or my post history) to find them. If you don't get an answer it's likely because it has already been answered.",

            "Huh. I didn't know there was an approval process! Figured it was sort of automated. Makes me a bit sad to know though, as it probably means the ion batteries I filled my capsules with likely didn't get approved. Boo.",
