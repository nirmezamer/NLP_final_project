        "content": "Edit on 2/21/2024: This is still up-to-date info!\n\nTime capsules are still being approved today. It's a slow process, but it's still happening. Not every capsule gets approved, and the ones that do are hand-selected. \n\nSo if you see anyone saying otherwise, feel free to reference this post :)\n\nUse this thread to AMA about time capsules!\n\nEdit: A couple important things I want to point out:\n\n- When a capsule is jettisoned, it's uploaded to the [time capsule website](https://subnautica.unknownworlds.com/time-capsules) where devs manually review them.  \n- A dev must approve a capsule before it starts showing up in the game.  \n- Around 40 time capsules are placed in your game as you explore, and only spawn in surface biomes.  \n- Time capsules can come from any game mode, but they are platform-specific. Which means PC will only get capsules from other PC players, Switch from Switch players, etc.    \n- A list of blacklisted items can be found [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/zq65tg/lots_of_people_are_saying_time_capsules_are_not/j0z7sdt/)  \n\nThere have been some fantastic questions so far. Feel free to scroll through the comments (or my post history) to find them. If you don't get an answer it's likely because it has already been answered.",

            "Really cool to hear from the team! I'm extremely excited for the next game. I know some of these you probably can't comment on but I'm just stoked to get info about it before we end up seeing it.\n\n1. If the game's tone is closer to the original with more horror, like I think most people want, will it still have some of the more adventure oriented vibes of Below Zero? I really love that BZ is a bit more laid back and it's one of my all time favorite comfort games. I also like how in the main game you can easily avoid areas with reapers if you want to and make the game more calm in that way as well.\n\n2. Will land based sections be a prominent thing?\n\n3. I really like how Subnautica is sci fi but it's kind of subtle and in the background. At the same time though I'd love to see more sci fi elements, any chance we see any space content? Talking about either story or gameplay.\n\n4. I love the custom settings for BZ, will we see more of that for the new game?",
