            "\"maybe this WR will survive at least a day?\" its the description that i put on my Speedrun World Record in [MS Pac-Man 10000 points gameboy version](https://youtu.be/91yQrvJdRQA) that i set more than 3 years and 3 months ago thats still standing to this day, i even forgot about me getting it and just find it again after setting the WR for the Atari 2600 version and for fun checking the other categories, it isnt the most contested record ever or even in MS Pacman itself but its cool to think about it."

This link says as of now there are 67 spots open. https://gamesdonequick.com/marathons/clut3zj5r0002xc01yi4t61gf\n\nI hope you are able to go! I\u2019ve been watching GDQs for so long now, attending one seems kinda fun despite what anyone says. Digging into their registration process kinda got me thinking of going for the hell of it. One day, maybe\u2026"
