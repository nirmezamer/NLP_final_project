            "\"maybe this WR will survive at least a day?\" its the description that i put on my Speedrun World Record in [MS Pac-Man 10000 points gameboy version](https://youtu.be/91yQrvJdRQA) that i set more than 3 years and 3 months ago thats still standing to this day, i even forgot about me getting it and just find it again after setting the WR for the Atari 2600 version and for fun checking the other categories, it isnt the most contested record ever or even in MS Pacman itself but its cool to think about it.",
            "Damn, nice dude. It's especially impressive when a record on such a short run lasts that long. It's holding strong despite a relatively low barrier to entry. Nice job."

Thorebane, once again, I am here to give you  the upcoming GDQ event info and links as I do each year!**\n\nWith that now out the way, **WELCOME!!!**\n\nThis year, we are hosting at and from:-\n\n# Hilton Minneapolis Downtown1001 Marquette Ave, Minneapolis\n\n\n\n* **This event will be a mixed of in person, AND online runs!!!**\n\n* **This event will also be raising money for the charity: --**  \n\n# Doctors Without Borders/M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF)\n\n\n\nSo... what is GDQ?\n\n**GDQ** is a semi-annual video game speed-run charity marathon held in the United States, originally organized by the Speed Demo's Archive and Speed-runs Live communities. The two main marathons, **AGDQ** and **SGDQ**, are both 7-day, 24-hour straight marathons that are streamed on Twitch and YouTube.\n\nApart from the streams being in English, in the last few years there has been a French, German, Spanish, Russian and even a full Japanese re-stream, with people giving up their own time to translate and commentate in their own native language. Since 2015, it has been handled by Games Done Quick, LLC.\n\nHeld since 2010, the events have raised money for several charities; the most common two being the Prevent Cancer Foundation (**AGDQ**) and Doctors Without Borders (**SGDQ**)\n\nBelow is this year's schedule! (The schedule will automatically revert to the time zone you're logged in on now!)\n\n[--- Schedule ---](https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule/48)-- (Updated now and should be the new fancy layout!)\n\n**Below is the VOD Post for the last major marathon - AGDQ2024 if you'd like to catch up on some games that ran earlier this year!

Here you can also split amounts and pick depending on what money you donate, to win prizes and other things like choosing names of characters in some games, or even voting for bonus  games/levels/rounds!\n\n(More will unlock as the event goes on)\n\n(100% of **ALL** donated money goes directly to Prevent Cancer Foundation).

(Most typically a week either at  the end of  June or the start of July, again, running Sunday to Sunday).\n\nIn total, as of June 2024, GDQ has now raised for charities since it began over:\n\n* **$49.1 million (That's insane!!!)** across multiple marathons and through more than 877,000 separate donations from over 265,000 unique donors.\n\n---- **(WE'RE GONNA BREAK THE 50 MILLION MARK THIS EVENT!!!)** ----\n\n* Last event - **AGDQ 2024** raised a total of --- **$2,539,832 - Let's BEAT THAT FOR THIS EVENT!!!**\n\n\n\nSo what games or runners are catching your attention?!\n\nWhat intro are the hosts going to make us laugh with this year?!\n\nWhat prize do you want to donate for?!\n\nLet's get some HYPE! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udd79\ufe0f\ud83c\udfae\n\nSee you on Sunday peeps!!",
