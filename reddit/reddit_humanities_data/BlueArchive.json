Is there any way for me to complete \"Win 2 battles with Ninjutsu Club students\" quest grom the Guide Task? Its the only one remaining that I can try to do without being able to start Volume 5.",
            "So, I've been trying to follow a few tutorials and comps for this quest, and after changing some stuff, I thought I had achieved a good team, but I still can't do it...\n\nMy best run was the one where the boss had 6 HP bars at the end to the battle. So I'm showing you guys all the details of my team, and I hope I can have some advice! thank you all in advance <3\n\nObs: tsubaki and yuuka are my tanks, I have Shun for boss damage, so Chise and Akane can kill those nuns. Fuuka can heal my entire team. I made this team based on\u00a0[Minami Kotori's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QV49kZuj2bg). I already tried the famous comp of Tsubaki, Yuuka, Serika, Asuna, Serina and Hanae, but it didn't fit well for me at all.\n\n**Strikers:**\n\n**Tsubaki**\u00a0**\u2605\u2605**\n\nLv. 39  \nSkills: 2 / 2 / 3  \nArtifacts: T2 / T4 / T1\n\n**Shun (Small)**\u00a0**\u2605\u2605\u2605**\n\nLv. 39  \nSkills: 1 / 2 / 2 / 1  \nArtifacts: T3 / T3 / T3\n\n**Chise**\u00a0**\u2605\u2605**\n\nLv. 39  \nSkills: 1 / 1 / 1  \nArtifacts: T2 / T1 / T1\n\n**Yuuka**\u00a0**\u2605\u2605**\n\nLv. 39  \nSkills: 2 / 2 / 2  \nArtifacts: T3 / T3 / T1\n\n**Specials:**\n\n**Fuuka \u2605\u2605\u2605**\n\nLv. 39  \nSkills: 3 / 3 / 3 / 3  \nArtifacts: T3 / T3 / T3\n\n**Akane (Bunny) \u2605\u2605\u2605**\n\nLv. 39  \nSkills: 2 / 1 / 1 / 1  \nArtifacts: T1 / T1 / T1\n\nAlso, I don't mind giving a full list of my student list, or listing the most upgraded ones. I really want to clear this fight so I can complete my missions that will expire in 2 days :')",
            "Is it worth it to invest in a UE40 C. Hare to get her passive skill+ that increases buff duration? I know that this is useful for Himari, but C. Hare's skill seems already long enough.",
            "Do attack buffs stack? Like I just Himari and been thinking of using her attack buffs with Kotama's (I'm referring to their EX skills specifically)",
            "In lore, is Tomoe just, uh, a big fan of Cherino, as in that's her whole character? I got to her memory scene and yeah, it's a bit contrived, but I was kinda expecting her to have a bit more personality, instead of just being purely a Cherino fan girl?",
            "Anyone in Asia server have Izuna or Tsukuyo that I can borrow for the Hyakkiyako Lantern Festival event mission that's ending soon? I'm still rather new to the game and haven't unlocked Volume 5 yet. Currently stuck at 99 Chicken Skewers and need to win 2 battles using Ninjutsu Research Club students to get enough for the 10-pull ticket but I don't have any of them. My friend code is AYUNEBME. Hope you guys can help.",
            "Lv. 63, 63K pyroxenes.\n\n* Red dealers are **Serika, Hina, Mutsuki,** and Akari.  \n* Yellow are **Momoi, Nonomi, Iori,** Junko, Neru, Mikoto, Pina, and Maki.  \n* Blue are **Chise**, Aris, Haruna, and Asuna.  \n* Purple is **Momiji**.  \n* Tanks are **Yuuka, Tsubaki, Mine,** and Hoshino.\n* Notable supports are **Ui, Kokona, Cherino, Himari**, and **S. Shiroko**.\n\nBolded are the units I'm currently finding useful. Is it worth pulling for C. Hare given this roster, or do I save for later banners?\n\ne: I'm also hitting the enhancement stone/credit bottlenecks (11M left after using all my permits) now that I'm trying to gear up to T7 and max out EX skills. Are there proper/improper strats for earning and managing these resources from here on?",
            "Serious question, how strong is D.Hina? Everyone is saying she is a must pull, so save for her. Is she like Mika but for Light armor?",
            "I've been playing for almost 3 months now and managed to do most permanent content in the game after hitting level 70. For now I'm trying to plan my pulls a bit more in the long term trying to get supports and limiteds in this first year of playing and focusing on my favorites later.\n\nRight now I got 68k pyro and the first and most obvious choice is saving 400 pulls for D.Hina and S.Hoshino. The banners has double hate, can get other Fes limited spooks on top of regular spooks, and getting potential D.Hina dupes sounds really good regardless if I get both banner characters early. So as a new payer spending 400 here regardless is a really good plan, correct?\n\nNow after this is where I'm not sure. Focusing more on limited characters for this first year I can guarantee another 2 characters before stopping to save for the next Fes. Looking at the upcoming schedule between: NY.Mutsuki/NY.Aru, or NY.Fuuka/NY.Haruna, or Nagisa/Toki, or B.Kazusa/B.Yoshimi, which ones are the best options for a new player? NY.Fuuka seems like a no-brainer, but between the others I'm not sure which one would be a better generic pick."
