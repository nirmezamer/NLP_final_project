            "D.Hina banner is unofficially scheduled for July 30th. The Goz GA ticket expires July 31st. There *should* be ~1.5 day window to use it. But it also means you're not sparking D.Ako/Makoto, so be careful to not roll extra on that banner if you really want to save that ticket.",

            "I ran a defense composition similar to this for a while but instead of Iroha I had Nagisa set, most people ran the speed wipe comp on offense with Iori, Yuuka / Marina, Shun, Haruna(New Year) with Shiroko(Swimsuit) and Nagisa. \n\nThat is also the standard offense comp that I use when dealing with a Iroha on DEF hopefully ending it quick before she spawns in.",
            "I tried this exact comp today and 4 out of 5 times my team got wiped up before I could even get to Iroha.\nShe's really strong if you could get to her early but if you're unlucky she just dies from Iori's stray shots. Hell, my Marina was the first to fell twice today cuz enemy Iori never fail to land crits against her.",
            "The unconfirmed predictions say that we will have 1.5 days to use it in D.Hina. So hope that there won't be some super extended maintenance."

            "Something worth noting, that I always forget: the drop bonus rounds up. So a bonus of 80% on a stage that drops 4 of the corresponding item is no worse than a 100% bonus. For a stage that drops 6, 85% is as good as 100%.\n\nThat can save you a run, as well as making lower-tier stages more efficient through larger rounding error."
