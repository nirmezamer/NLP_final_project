            "Which should I complain about most? Completely uneven matchmaking, hidden skill not making sense, bugs lasting weeks, recycled arcade events, hyping up paying 120$ for a shiny sticker and a couple of mediocre exclusive skins while content and balancing is extremely light... Pretty sad that fixing the membership was the highest dev priority and pressing a button to release the skin shop was seen as one of the highlights of this season.",

            "I filled it out. My main concern is by far and away the cheating problem on PC. With the exception of the few days following a new season, update or massive ban wave, the game is literally unplayable for my friends and I. People blatantly walling and using aim bot just mowing through teams resulting in crazy stat lines like 3.0kds and 90% win rates going untouched for weeks or months at a time. It\u2019s a rarity to have more than one or two actual legit matches anymore.",

            "You've always defended this game? No wonder ubisoft can pull of shit like this seriously where do you expect to go defending a multi billion dollar corporation that couldn't give two shits about the community and the quality of their game? Ubisoft does shit like this because they know they have players like you backing them up, they know they have nothing to lose since people will buy their shitty membership regardless. The number one rule when it comes to the gaming industry is that you should never back up developers/ corporations it never works out the developers could care less and instead find ways to fuck over their game and community. Look a respawn for example."
