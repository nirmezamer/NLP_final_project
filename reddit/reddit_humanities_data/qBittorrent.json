        "content": "( This is a work in progress. )\n\n**Q: How could I protect myself against ISP letters and anti-piracy laws?**\n\nPiracy posts are out of scope of this sub.\n\nHowever, you have a few options:\n\n**VPN with port forward** : \\[ 4/5 \\]. Not every VPN provider supports port forwarding. Check (or ask) before you purchase.\n\nUsing a VPN on your host PC might be cumbersome because all traffic will go through that. Yes, there are providers that offer \"Split Tunneling\" but personally, I never had much luck with that. Of course you can always run a Virtual Machine with a VPN inside - but then it will consume extra resources. Not only that, transferring files in-out or shared files is a chore and some anti-cheats will kick you for a VM in the background.\n\nNote 1: Use interface binding in Advanced Settings. If you don't see your VPN's interface in the list, change protocols in settings. OpenVPN usually supports this, so switch to that if all else fails.\n\nPros: You can use qBittorrent like normal.Cons: You may lose some speed. It can be cumbersome, esp. if you can't route all traffic through.\n\n**Seedbox** : \\[ 4/5 \\]. You can just Google \"seedbox provider\" and find tons. It's like a remote server which you can use to download and also seed. To get your files, you have to transfer them to your PC via protocols such as FTP, SFTP, etc.\n\nPros: Great speed, great ratio keeping, sometimes you get PLEX/Jellyfin too, great way to seed. Doesn't take up any local storage.Cons: Have to transfer whatever you need by hand.\n\n**SOCKS5 proxy** : \\[ 3/5 \\]. Some VPN providers offer this option with their VPN subscription.\n\nPros: Only qBittorrent will go through this tunnel. So no mess with other applications, games, etc. No need to run third-party applications.Cons: No port forward, so seeding won't be easy. The connection is not encrypted, but this is usually not an issue. It depends on the config file, so it may get disabled during an upgrade, or if anything happens to your config file. Some trackers don't like it and you may get some trouble with the Staff.\n\n**Q: My issue is not listed yet I require some help.**\n\nI'd heavily recommend asking Bing, ChatGPT or Gemini first. Of course you are free to make a post about it here but \"AI\" has gotten so good, it can even help with very specific problems. Sometimes it might offer an instant solution.\n\n**Q: I encounter these Chinese clients like Xunlei and they just waste my upload?!**\n\nFeel free to use the unofficial Enhanced Edition.[https://github.com/c0re100/qBittorrent-Enhanced-Edition/](https://github.com/c0re100/qBittorrent-Enhanced-Edition/)\n\nIt has features to counter this behavior. DO NOT report bugs on the official tracker if you use this client. Report them on THEIR tracker.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nv1, last updated 2/27/2024",

Now with \" all \" selected, these are a mixed up mess. All because my finger slipped while doing a \" force resume \" Aw man, now it's even worse, all the category colors are gone, it's all teal colored now Edit: ok at this point what I need to do is return to default view. I can't find anything like that in options/settings.. Anyone?"
