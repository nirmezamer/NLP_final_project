            "Hi guys, feel free to ask me anything about Enterpreneurship. add my name lah OP. These are the things that what I have done and are still currently doing for 20+ years:\n\nmusic - first and longest drumline group, most show performed by a music band in msia, teacher  \nmedia - tv and film producer, director, (ex) actor, etc.  \ntech - storage specialist, AI, iot, automation  \nmining - one and only company with a processing factory in msia  \nbus - first (and only?) local branded aircond manufacturer in msia last time (for intrakota, proton waja, etc)\n\n  \nthere are a few more, but just tag my name and I'll probably have an experience in that field- eg. valve, petrochemical complex, taxi/bus, water telemetry). Some of the FAQs that I got over the years:\n\nSo you suck at SPM. game over right?  \nHeck no! a kampung guy in (almost) all sense of life metric a loser, is one of the very, very few expert metallurgist IN ASIA in kuantan - the kind of guy who can tell you the % of Carbon in coal just by looking and feeling.\n\nSo you're nowhere near big cities. game over right?  \na friend who flopped hard on spm, turned his life around by following the tvet road, is now a contract worker doing welding and diving every few months earning 6 digits in a few weeks of work. \n\nHow important are academics to be successful in life?  \nNot related to be honest. Being good academically, or being good in working life, both don't need to be related. Not all successes are measure-worthy, this is the key takeaway point. My grandmother only was in school for a few years, have rm20+ in the bank, but raised 14 kids on her own, and have 6 figure assets in terms of gold and diamond luxury accessories around her body for trading (now), keeps the gold and cash in her room and her bra. doesn't care about politics, doesn't care about causes, doesn't care (too much) about the environment, just care about upbringing. since only us and her buyers know about the gold bangles and necklaces and shit, in all metrics she is a failure in life.\n\nSo what good is SPM then?  \nmy own opinion after 40+ years of living, is that SPM is really good to instill good behaviour, long-term and CONSISTENT learning - consistently doing something over and over and over again to reach a long-term goal that's only measurable in the form of time (makin lama makin near the goal). that's the only metric that you need to evaluate yourself, not the grade. this is the most important life skill that you can have. so if you fail this, now what? you have lots of chances after - college, uni, work, etc. it's not the end of the world.",
