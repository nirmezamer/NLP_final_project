        "content": "Hello everyone,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis weeks Spotlight feature is u/HolleringElk, who creates the comic Hollering Elk. In keeping with the intricate and detailed art style of her comic, her answers are equally in-depth and well-thought out. A real treat for fans!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ugppl5tmlk8d1.jpg?width=2285&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4cb031e99182ccb64e5929eaefb1758a1db4b597\n\n**1: When you started posting to** [**r/comics**](https://old.reddit.com/r/comics)  **you posted \"slice of life\" comics and later moved towards posting body  horror. How did you make the decision this was more your thing to  create?**\n\nI have always had a keen interest in the macabre. Prior to the  pandemic, I was a full time traditional painter and illustrator drawing  silly comics on the side, both traditionally and digitally drawn. Comics  had always been something I\u2019d dabbled in since I was a child, but I was  instructed over the years that it could never be something I could  realistically pursue professionally. If I was wise, I\u2019d stick with fine  art. So, after college, I primarily used these doodles and comics to  advertise commissions, events, or showings I was a part of. They were  crude, sometimes narratively and visually outrageous, horrific, and  unsettling as seen in my current work, but I had nowhere near the same  level of competency or expertise in digital art as I did in traditional  painting, so they weren\u2019t all that awe-inspiring on the technical side.  Though, I understood the best way to drive traffic to my \u201cserious\u201d work  was to occasionally employ a bit of relatable or crass meme humor online  on my personal social media accounts. The internet is a fickle place  for a growing artist and I came to understand you have to play the  algorithm game to generate interest in your craft, especially if you\u2019re  burned out on the in-person grind. My paintings were also unconventional  and disturbing, so it took special effort to get them out of the house  and into an oddball collector\u2019s home.\n\nIn 2018, I was accepted into and spent a year or so vending at a  popular art market on Frenchmen Street here in New Orleans. This stint  in the market scene helped me to learn a great deal about how to  effectively appeal to a large audience through interactions with  thousands of tourists from all over the world coming through every night  seeking souvenirs and artwork to purchase, and from my fellow local  artists who had years of experience selling and promoting their work in  the city. Eventually I was granted the opportunity to display a  significant set of my large-scale paintings in the center of the market  for a weekend, an enormous highlight of my career as a painter. I had  plans to move on from the market and seek gallery space of my own in the  French Quarter in the hopes of refining and selling my work in a more  professional setting. This pursuit came crashing down with the arrival  of Covid-19. New Orleans was one of the first major metros in the US to  completely shut down in March of 2020, promptly killing the bustling art  scene, including the market and any public venues I may have tried to  access to grow my status in the community.\n\nWhile I was still accepting and producing painting commissions during  the lockdown, I chose to take a massive risk and pivot into solely  prioritizing my comics. Based on my knowledge of social media marketing  and having developed a strong sales persona during my time churning out  paintings, I knew diving headfirst into webcomics as a nobody with the  off-the-wall, frequently shocking themes customary to my older comics  was not at all going to fly as an introduction on a platform like  reddit, the one place I knew I could potentially quickly grow a modest  audience assuming the quality was exceptional. I\u2019d lurked on [r/comics](https://old.reddit.com/r/comics)  for years before considering posting my own work, and continued to do  so for all of 2020, on a mission to rapidly improve my skills in digital  art and sequential storytelling, and studying other artists, their  styles, and how they maneuvered online. My first effort to arrive to [r/comics](https://old.reddit.com/r/comics)  was \u201cUpkeep\u201d in the summer of 2021, a slice of life gag about unwanted  female facial hair that performed very well. I continued to produce and  share comics of this style as well as heavily interacting with regular  posters in the community that I admired to establish myself, and it  wasn\u2019t until \u201cQuality Time\u201d came out the following year that users on  reddit began to suspect I had a distinctly dark side. How they were able  to identify this, I still do not know. I decided then it was time to  spread my wings and unveil my true passion with the arrival of \u201cThe  Airbnb.\u201d In the same way I would spend many months planning a collection  of paintings, I had planned for my shift into horror comedy long before  my friendly quarrel with the great u/armpit_penguin . The response to \u201cThe Airbnb\u201d was wildly positive to my relief, and the rest is history.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2ehs9ajolk8d1.jpg?width=2871&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=420a4406fa1150a6ca2e8cfa4a34bea6a6fa2f32\n\n**2: Your art style signifies itself by being somewhat more realistic  and elaborate than that of most webcomic artists. Is this a deliberate  choice, do you feel what you have to say comes to right better using  this style closer to realism?**\n\nAs outlined in my answer to your first question, my style is rooted  in an academic background and an interest in high detail, dense graphic  novels, concept art, and traditional illustration. Prior to attending  art school, (where I was persistently advised against including  narratives in representational art), I produced highly detailed and  complex graphite drawings on 18x24 sheets and crosshatch heavy ink  drawings on bristol. My current style in digital comics is a stripped  down version of the sort of art I\u2019d spend weeks upon per piece, and it\u2019s  taken me a lot of time to \u201cunlearn\u201d a lot of the tedious habits I  developed in order to accelerate my output of comics, and that hasn't  been easy. I\u2019ve gotten comments about some of the jarring stylistic  decisions I\u2019ve made in earlier comics, and that\u2019s a result of my attempt  to modify my former process and technique into something more  aesthetically digestible. Aside from ventures like \u201cELK HUNT,\u201d I choose  to maintain mild realism in my designs as I gradually transition into  producing more longform work in the future. In short, like most, I draw  in the style I am most comfortable utilizing to portray my ideas.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w9c41coplk8d1.jpg?width=3844&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=91d97b9b9ce6158fad77e89c9a7084ace4b57af6\n\n**3: The lore surrounding  your comics is getting to be as intricate and involved as your art  style. Have you considered creating a wiki or database explaining to  newer readers the backstory of your characters?**\n\nI have a history of gently declining requests for \u201clore dumps\u201d in  comments, other platforms outside of reddit, and even Patreon. It isn\u2019t a  method I intend for my readers to use to extract clues from the larger  comics and understand the world for themselves. I have operated the same  way for previous projects of varying mediums, revealing a little at a  time and allowing for long pauses between additions of new material. For  reddit in particular, I\u2019ve compiled the existing comics into an  organized list I continually add to, of which there really aren\u2019t many,  and have highlighted the most notable entries as being crucial to the  development of the ongoing story. Other platforms, (mainly Patreon)  receive expositional written content that have accompanied pivotal  comics like \u201cThe Airbnb,\u201d \u201cThe Chosen One,\u201d and \u201cThrill Seeker,\u201d and  ancillary content that doesn't quite fit on reddit.\n\nAt the moment, I do not have interest in preparing a Wiki or a  database, at least not until the first set of chapters of \u201cThe Velluto  Duo\u201d have been completed and shared. I\u2019ll then be free to be less  cryptic and vague about key events and character attributes. TVD has  been in the works for over 2 years, features 7+ chapters that each focus  on a specific character, and answers a majority of the questions I\u2019ve  seen pop up numerous times as my one-offs have grown in popularity. I\u2019ve  had to dedicate a great deal of time improving my art before committing  to the full story, with the current collection functioning as a means  to generate and maintain interest in what I hope to be a mind-bending  long-form black comedy. I understand some are frustrated that I refuse  to divulge anything of real substance within my standalone work, but I  can\u2019t risk spoiling the most shocking scenes to come; carnage I\u2019ve been  sitting on since before we knew Ellie was a bloodthirsty man-eater.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k75lqgoqlk8d1.jpg?width=3093&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fdcbcda5e0367365691c01e474ae358d78e94702\n\n**4: I think the most exposition of the world you have created for your characters was seen in your recent** [**r/comics**](https://old.reddit.com/r/comics) **event \"Elk Hunt\". Was the Elk Hunt intended to explain your worldbuilding to the readers?**\n\n\u201cELK HUNT,'' a nauseating collection of pages one could call an  offbeat satire of my own work, came about for a variety of reasons, one  of which indeed was to act as a sort of recap of everything we've  learned about Vivian and the Castellos in the mainline comics. At the  same time, EH was not a canon series despite featuring the same cast of  characters, aside from the Hollering Elk herself. As has occurred in  previous years, the arc represented a new phase of the Elk persona,  commencing with her mysterious disappearance and death, and the  subsequent peculiar activity on all of the Hollering Elk accounts. I  wrote the comic in December and January, and planned for the arc to play  out on both Facebook and reddit, each receiving different types of  multimedia content. I did not include Instagram. I considered the app  too limiting and stubborn for what I wanted to achieve.\n\nElk has perished once before from a bizarre illness that stretched  for seven months in real time, slowly decaying with every appearance  without her ever directly acknowledging her alarming decline, and  eventually succumbing to her ailment and regenerating in early spring of  2023. \u201cELK HUNT\u201d debuted on the one year anniversary of her initial  demise, and this time we witnessed the hallucinatory manifestations of  her crumbling mind, that being the outlandish antics and interactions of  the characters she created, inserting her mindless, monstrous rampage  as the central conflict, and expanding on or confirming dynamics and  theories folks have pitched about the main comics and the Hollering Elk  persona in the past. For an added layer of fun and shenanigans, the  comic itself is speculated to have been illustrated by Ellie herself in  an attempt to conceal the monumental blunder of recklessly dispatching  and mistakenly turning the beloved cryptid artist.\n\nI had no way of knowing if all of the elements of EH's introductory  phase and focal comic would reach and entertain readers as intended, but  it all went off without a hitch with the help of the [r/comics](https://old.reddit.com/r/comics)  community, including Ellen of Pizza Cake Comics who played along the  week of Elk's disappearance. It was an absolute joy to produce, and  worked wonders in helping to introduce tons of newcomers to the main  comics. I loved watching redditors try to piece it all together during  the initial chaos of the arc, engaging with the story and creating works  of their own in tandem with the main \u201cELK HUNT\u201d comic. I happened upon  some true gems in between EH pages, and have noticed several artists  enjoyed an explosion in followers as a result of their contribution to  the arc. After some griping about the meta wave from some of my  followers, I made a statement sometime during the turmoil approving the  use of \u201crogue elk\u201d by lesser known artists to bolster their views. I had  conflicted feelings about how much EH dominated the subreddit, but also  was thrilled to see so many new artists enjoying the spotlight that  previously struggled with obscurity. It was also important to me that I  gave my audience something truly goofy and exciting before shifting into  an era that is conversely dark and shocking in tone as we near the  release of \u201cThe Velluto Duo.\u201d\n\nOverall, \u201cELK HUNT\u201d was an absolute blast, and it will be a significant challenge to top come the next \u201cphase\u201d of Hollering Elk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mda3h7prlk8d1.jpg?width=3093&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fa61f8eb91ab1198fb105c3d585bdb6a2f5fa68d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5: You have been co-creating with other posters to** [**r/comics**](https://old.reddit.com/r/comics) **such as** [**/u/colmscomics**](https://old.reddit.com/u/colmscomics) **And** [**/u/pizzacakecomic**](https://old.reddit.com/u/pizzacakecomic)**. How did this collaboration start and what will your next shared project be?**\n\nI've developed a lot of friendships online over the years through  various art based websites and social media, but the comradery I share  with Ellen and Colm is something truly wonderful. We aren\u2019t just content  creators who periodically collaborate, we are a genuine trio of friends  who give each other crap on the daily, like good friends do.\n\nIf I recall correctly, Ellen began posting around the time I returned  from an extended hiatus following Hurricane Ida. At the time, I was  floundering through a \u201cthrowing spaghetti at the wall\u201d era as I  attempted to jumpstart the fervor I had before the storm. Meanwhile,  Pizza Cake Comics was experiencing meteoric success seemingly out of  nowhere. Before participating in the two million subscribers event with a  comic revealing the Hollering Elk persona for the first time, I  remember thinking how hilarious it would be for the wretched, rotting,  horror artist to strike up an alliance with the sub\u2019s resident  wholesome, slice-of-life mom artist.\n\nShortly following \u201cThe Airbnb,\u201d the first true horror comic I\u2019d bring to [r/comics](https://old.reddit.com/r/comics),  I followed through on this cheeky idea, and depicted Ellen in \u201cI Want  to Belong,\u201d a comic in which Elk sheepishly proposes the two become  companions in spite of their dramatic dissimilarities as creators. This  would spark further back and forth on each other\u2019s comics, and a handful  of small collaborations between Ellen and I and others, until Colm  would reach out to Ellen about an idea he had for an ambitious  collaborative comic that would require direct coordination between all 3  of us to achieve. I agreed to take part, and thus \u201cThe Elders\u201d came to  be in January of 2023, which remains my all time favorite collaborative  comic.\n\nSince then, we kept in touch, chatting everyday until we evolved from  distant peers who occasionally collaborated into good friends with a  mutual love of the craft of comic creation. To this day, we share our  sketches, scripts, finals, and rejected ideas amongst each other, banter  and bully one another with wild abandon, and recently successfully  launched our Youtube channel, \u201cPen Pals,\u201d something Colm pitched to us  in early 2023. I dragged my feet on getting my parts together for the  channel, but I\u2019m glad I committed to it. Recording with them is  something I look forward to every week in between making comics, and it  seems to me each of our fan bases are enjoying the series as well, which  warms my heart.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what the future holds as far as shared projects outside  of the channel. I\u2019m simply thankful to have two great, like-minded  buddies belonging to the same sphere of internet tomfoolery that I can  chat with when I hit a rut with my work or life. Just delightful folks,  and I am blessed to have them in my life. The channel has also led to  the expansion of our cohort of comic artists, so I\u2019m certain we can  expect all kinds of neat collaborative efforts in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zzhf5fmslk8d1.jpg?width=3093&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=611209c400089f6b1ecb1a60819f70e3040fa6b3\n\n**6: How long does it take you to create a comic starting from the idea stage?**\n\nIn response to this question, I will describe step by step the process. It is very interesting, I assure you.\n\nI rise bright and early every morning and take care of basic chores  in a specific order: brush my teeth, make my bed, start a pot of coffee,  cook for cat, wash what is always a singular dish and fork left in the  sink from the previous night\u2019s meal, then sit on my balcony with my  coffee for several hours and write new scripts as ideas pop into my  mind, or revisit and revise old scripts until I settle on something  compelling, relevant, hilarious (to me), or consisting of the perfect  balance of terrifying and stupid. I don\u2019t always begin the comic the day  of choosing a script, typically taking time to run it by my mother, my  gen z friends, my patrons, and a handful of other artists belonging to  various age groups, all of this to get a feel for whether or not it is  worth committing to a full-fledged comic. If it gets enough laughs or a  specific intended reaction, I spend a day working out formatting,  panels, number of pages needed, wording of the dialogue, and all  remaining technical details before embarking on the sketch. If the  response is lackluster from my network, I will shelve the script and  revisit it another time. This stage of fiddling around with an idea can  carry on for a few days to a few weeks. \u201cThrill Seeker,\u201d  for example, I  toyed with for several months before I was satisfied with the narrative  and finally sat down to sketch the pages.\n\nComics that are 7-11 pages will take about 3 to 4 days to sketch,  shorter comics about a day. Line art for comics like \u201cThe Drain\u201d and  \u201cThrill Seeker\u201d will have a timeframe of a full week, and colors another  week, sometimes more depending on the complexity of the backgrounds.  Throughout this time I am consistently sharing the progress with people I  trust to point out issues.  All together, my largest comics will take  about 3 weeks to a month to produce, while simpler entries ranging  between 1-3 pages at 4 to 5 days.\n\nSketching and drawing the final product is fairly straightforward,  and I find it to be the easiest part of the process. It is the writing  and development stage I sit with the longest, and even then it doesn\u2019t  always land by the end! Upon completing a comic, I will send the file to  my friends to search for errors in the art or grammar if there is  dialogue. It is then \u201cdropped\u201d on a weekday on all platforms.\n\nThen I order chinese and sleep for 3 days straight.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xeeg4iftlk8d1.jpg?width=3093&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5bdf2f9346132c8b825e840dae8a7a13fcd08276\n\n**7: You are one of our most  popular regular posters and have been getting a lot of praise, though  sometimes there is critique as well. What would you like to say to  people who \"don't get it\" or think it is \"gore\"?**\n\nI accept that I've reached a point that I should expect an avalanche  of negative feedback for the particularly \u201cprovocative\u201d submissions,  however it was certainly bewildering during those first several  instances of reaching the frontpage or [r/all](https://old.reddit.com/r/all).  It's an odd experience being in the spotlight online at that scale for  the first time, which I'm sure many of the other regular artists here  could tell you. Early on, I learned to be unbothered by some of the more  incensed responses directed at me as a person for having the audacity  to illustrate scenes deliberately designed to upset my readers, and  nowadays I am genuinely amused by the more creative vitriol. It's the  downright vicious comments tearing me apart without any idea of what I'm  truly about that make me chuckle. I sometimes wish I could request an  exception from the moderators to allow the threads below my comics to go  untamed for my own entertainment, but I understand that isn't  productive. Unless?\n\nOn the subject of the less aggressive, general critique, it was the  impassioned discourse and long-winded insights unique to reddit that  drew me to this community in the first place. I've read spectacular  diatribes from folks who were clearly enthusiasts of the medium pleading  for me to concentrate on resolving weak areas in my writing, artistic  skill, and choice in subject matter, and I take those comments to heart.  In some ways I have improved dramatically thanks to these anonymous  individuals, and in other ways I still have a long way to go if I wish  to succeed professionally, and those flustered anons are going to keep  on me until I do. For that I am grateful.\n\nAs for the \u201cI don't get its,\u201d it\u2019s difficult to judge what will and  won\u2019t land with some readers. I\u2019ve decided it depends on the sort of  artistic media a person is accustomed to consuming versus the subtle,  unique visual techniques and narrative devices I choose to apply in my  art, as well as the influences informing my work. In other words,  different strokes for different folks? The strange scenarios and jokes I  think up obviously make sense in my mind and to the circle of people I  share my drafts with, all with extensive backgrounds in art and  literature, but it\u2019s impossible to expect every person who stumbles upon  my comics for the first time to grasp every odd little detail, obscure  joke, twist, or emotional theme. A lot of folks didn't \u2018get\u2019 \u201cThrill  Seeker\u201d or \u201cThe Chosen One.\u201d On the other end of the spectrum, there are  hundreds who regard these comics as some of the best I've ever  produced. There really is no in between. I respect it's often difficult  to discern what on God's green earth is going on in these got dang  confounding cartoons if you aren't familiar with the trusty catalog, but  I always encourage people to explore my pages if they find themselves  even slightly curious.\n\nWith all that said, to those who leave the dismissive comments you've  quoted, I completely get it. My comics are remarkably weird,  disjointed, worrying, manic, abstract, gross, dumb, stupid, horrifying,  and downright offensive to the eyes at times. I am a certain type of  person who draws a certain type of content meant for a certain type of  audience, and it is absolutely not an issue if you don\u2019t vibe with it.  That is perfectly fine and I don't sweat it if you choose to voice this  to me in the comments or dms. You are entitled to your opinion, and it  would be supremely ignorant of me to demand universal praise for my  nonsense. Just remember I am also just a regular person who isn't going  to nail it every time if you are someone who has taken a liking to my  debauchery. I'm doing my best!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i74kk6bulk8d1.jpg?width=4013&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c607b1a3262f60a24e721b58dcfa151906da2e62\n\n**8: Will there be a printed version of your Elk World series of comics?**\n\nI am currently planning two physical books to be printed, the first  will be the entire \u201cELK HUNT\u201d comic, featuring new art, content I didn\u2019t  have the opportunity to work into the original \u201cmeta\u201d arc, and other  neat, strange little goodies. The second will hopefully be the full  collection of comics that preceded \u201cThe Velluto Duo,\u201d and can be  referred to as a kind of \u201cHollering Elk Handbook.\u201d The latter will take  some time to put together, considering a majority of my energy will be  directed towards producing \u201cThe Velluto Duo.\u201d \u201cELK HUNT\u201d should not be  too far off, and I will of course make a bunch of noise like the  woodland creature that I am upon its arrival.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g1ipp7jvlk8d1.jpg?width=3390&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=97b0bafb3fb59f4b0dd195949ead88605769a5f4\n\n**9: Is there anything you'd like to add or want to say to the readers of** [**r/Comics**](https://old.reddit.com/r/Comics)**?**\n\nI love you guys.

This is just a huge strawman argument.\n\n2: A pronoun is not the same as a title. A title is a reference to what your work/social-position is. A pronoun denotes (or has historically denoted) gender, which to his eyes is unchanging. As such, while you could argue he's wrong in thinking gender is unchanging, it makes no sense to argue he's being inconsistent in his views.",
