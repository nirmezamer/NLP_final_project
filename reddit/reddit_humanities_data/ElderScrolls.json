            "Features I want to see return:\n\nSpell crafting, talking Morrow wind, this with a new visuals and hopefully new engine update would be amazing.\n\nWay shrines, mainly from ESO(Eldar scrolls online), I love that there is some sort of way outside of wagons to help none fast travel or survival mode runs be a bit less tedious.\n\nOblivion's class creation system that would allow for greater role playing potential as well as just make it a bit easier to go into other gameplay/combat styles and not force early game stealth archer.\n\nNew Features I would like to have:\n\nAnimal taming: tons of creatures all over tamriel and it would be cool to have a none modded way to have animal companions.\n\nModular armour(this was said by someone else as well), for armour I would absolutely love being able to kit out my armour more as well as make more cool armour sets viable to mix and match.\n\nMore unique and varied spells(this is quite biased because I'm a magic user since the game came out) but I think the spells that are currently in Skyrim and Oblivion are cool but are so limited to what we have in lore and what is possible, so I think adding more would be a nice touch, also would further increase the spell crafting feature.\n\nVampire lord equivalent to werewolf or something similar, in lore there have been experiments where vampires and werewolfs were fused(also a cool mod in Skyrim for it) and I would not only like to see a new variant so werewolf gets some love(even though I prefer vampires, wolf's feel so lack luster) and possibly a return/fusion of the two? It would be neat.\n\nBetter companions, not only more diversity but the ability to make custom ones would be really nice? Maybe having an option for player characters from other saves to also exist, would be difficult but aside from Serena, all the companions feel really basic without mods in Skyrim and previous games.\n\nIf character customisation isn't massively improved on to the point we don't need mods for almost everything or every piece of hair, I will riot, also please a few more hair styles for guys.\n\nFinally, I want more weapons types and skills and abilities locked to them that make going melee worth it later in the game and beginning, maybe different styles or schools or techniques you could use that can even the playing field.",
            "I want full \"what you see is what you get\" loot system like skyrim, and not like starfield",
            "It needs to feel like a game released in 2026/whenever it comes out. Midfield felt like it would have come out around the same time as Fallout 4. Gaming has advanced since then, and so has the expectations of large cutting edge single player experiences. Bethesda needs to do a lot of catching up for ES6.",
            "There\u2019s a certain element of Baldur\u2019s Gate 3\u2019s character creator that would be fun to see lmao",
            "Why has this thread opened? Did I miss something",
            "Man I just want the game, 16 years or whatever it\u2019s gonna turn out to be between install is actually nuts\nThat\u2019s the same amount of time between arena and Skyrim\nMicrosoft needs to change bethesdas pipeline this isn\u2019t sustainable for a franchise at this rate I\u2019d be retired before elder scrolls 7",
            "My #1 ask is in-depth crafting, especially modular armor. That was my favorite part of Fallout 4, along with creating settlements.",
            "I hope they add a dodge/roll mechanic system similar to Witcher 3 so that light armor + dagger builds actually make sense for melee combat",
            "At this point I would settle for mutually exclusive factions so my roleplay choices actually matter like in Morrowind. Branching questlines and interesting dialogue options are probably too much to ask.",
            "for the love of all that is holy i dont want fallout 4 legendary weapons. Oh my god they are awful worst thing ever"

            "They disappeared",
            "I'm kind of starting to get a suspicion Lorkhan did like a mass soul trap, and they're imprisoned in some plane of Oblivion or Aetherius.",
            "I believe when they disappeared, they entered a special demi-plane within the Heart of Lorkan. When the Nerevarine destroyed the Heart, that demi-plane was also destroyed. \n\nThey have become nothing. Their souls have not passed on to Aetherius, nor fallen to the cycles of a Daedric plane.  If not for their great architecture and works, it\u2019d be as though they never existed.",
            "My two theories have always been that they either became part of the Numidium, or that they were sent forward in time.",
            "With how far they had their heads up their own asses I\u2019d assume they just got sucked up completely into them.",
            "On a difrent planet or something",
            "During the creation of Numidium, Chief Tonal Architect Kagrenac travelled beyond the confines of Nirn and beheld the wheel and tower. Due to the nature of of the Dwemer mind being intensely logical, he couldn't hold the twin concepts of \"I am\" and \"I am not\" in his head concurrently, and zero summed.\n\nThanks to Tonal architecture being spread across all Dwemer cities and automaton, the entire race (on Nirn) was also subjected to his revelation and zero summed as well.\n\nThe last living Dwemer was shielded from this by means of being in a different dimension at the time.",
