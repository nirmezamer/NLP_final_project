            "Playing the GBA game on NSO and I just got Lucious on my team. However, I can't do anything. It make me select them first but if I try to move them they say \"sorry, I prefer to attack from this location' but I can't seem to pull up the option to attack. Is this a glitch or am I missing something? Wrong button being pressed?\nEdit: I'm an idiot. Didn't see the square they wanted to move to kept getting highlighted",
            "Would anyone be interested in a guide on how to efficiently grind BP and VP in Fates? Most of the core information is available on Serenes and is relatively self explanatory, but since 3DS online is shutting down I know some people have been stressing over obtaining the Battle and Visitation seals while they\u2019re still legitimately available. So I figured a post containing the basic information on how the system works and some strategy tips could be helpful. \n\nIf enough people are interested I could do a quick write up. If not, that\u2019s totally fine since I\u2019ve been busy lately. Just trying to gage interest!",

            "Could you suggest any turned-based games (Fire Emblem or other) that have similar difficulty (for at least few missions) to maddening chapter 6 Fell Xenologue? I know lots of people hate it, but i absolutely loved it, in fact that may have been my favorite battle i ever played. I loved how i actually had to use every resource in my disposal and even then it was very very hard (took me about 10 days just to beat, maybe like 2-3 more to prepare, probably around 20 hours total), loved every moment of it. I also loved that i couldn't just outlevel/outgrind it like other battles.",
            "Loving Engage having just gotten it recently for my birthday.\n\nJust checking that it is normal to get absolutely tanked on the training/skirmishes on hard mode but finding the actual chapters fine? This didn\u2019t happen in 3 Houses so just wondering. Thanks!",
            "**Fates: Conquest** I want to have my female Corrin be able to  have romantic relationships with female characters (and preferably have children too) as well as having other same-sex romances. Are there any mods/hacks I can do to make this possible on my 3ds? Thanks.",
            "FE:3H\n\nI'm trying to find better ways of grinding out class masteries (mostly the important Intermediate classes). Physical Units, especially females, give me the most trouble. Trying to get Death Blow, Hit +20, and Darting Blow is incredibly difficult. I know I don't NEED to get these, but I would like to.  Any strategies to make it easier to build up class mastery would be very much appreciated."

            "We learned through Emblem Marth they become corporeal coming to Askr, Marth: \"As an Emblem, I am not accustomed to being corporeal. I can fight as a Hero here\u2014and even eat!\" \"Oh, I see. I can be touched in this world.\" Ike: \"Not needing food was convenient, but you won't find me complaining about a post-training spicy meat dish.\" \"Huh, I keep forgetting you can touch me in this world. That wasn't possible in Elyos.\"",

            "Come to think of it, it's weirdly inconsistent what the emblems do and don't make contact with. Most of the conversations they talk as though they just pass through solid objects, but in battle the animations imply they're attacking with you and doing damage. And when they're enemies or if you use Veronica they do make physical contact with the enemies and the enemies make contact with them. They also dodge as if they have a reason to avoid attacks.\n\nHuh",
            "I think this falls on the camp of Heroes lore people forget about with Emblems Being Corporeal in Askr. It\u2019s in a similar camp to OG Lyon being the Lyon from after the end of Sacred Stones, aka, the Breidablik can bring people back the dead, as we can see proved further with characters like Lumera, Greil, Rudolf, and so on. There\u2019s also the fact the Breidablik, selectively restores the memories of a person or gives them weapons they shouldn\u2019t have in some cases like Deidre wielding the Naga in her first appearance. With Dark Veyle we also know that the Breidablik either gives alternative personalities full control of their bodies or simply gives each personality a body of their own.
