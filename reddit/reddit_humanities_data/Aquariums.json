            "Not very experienced\nI have a 22 gallon tank that had three angelfish and three tetras, about 5 years old, and two of the angelfish passed pretty young not too long ago. There are a couple plants in there and some wood inside they can hide behind. What should i do?",
            "Hi, I have a 15 gallon tank pretty well planted and currently have 6 neon tetra in there. I also have a smaller tank with 5 guppies, I was thinking of moving them into the 15g  one and also adding 2/3 otocinclus. Is this ok doable  or am i close to overstocking here? I work from home and keep up with maintenance pretty religiously so I'm not concerned it means slightly more maintenance, but would appreciate some advice cheers",
            "I just got some of those glass planaria traps. I don't have bloodworms on hand - could I just put regular fish food in there as well?",
            "No question, just happy my algae issue is receding. I was getting about 8\" long strands of blue-green algae to grow per week and the tank was gross. Anti-bacterial didn't do a thing and neither did any algaecide. Got new nitrate pads for the filter and added some kind of de-phosphorous stuff and it's really helped. Just have some sticking to the plants and gravel now, but it's not growing. Also added a couple watermelon plants for the top of the tank to help remove nitrates as I only recently learned that was a thing.\n\nWould love to redecorate one of these days, but moving the gravel so much would probably spike the ammonia and kill the lemon tetras I've had in there for five years now.",
            "I've got two angelfish, one male and one female, who just laid eggs. I can handle a couple new fish but not more than 3/4, what are the odds that more will survive?",
            "Hello everyone.  I have a 30 gallon, heavily planted tank with cherry shrimp, nerite snails and 2 bristlenose plecos at my school which, due to construction, I may not have access to for the summer.  I'm looking for an automatic feeder that has the ability to add food about once or twice a week.  All of the ones I have found add food everyday.  Any suggestions?  Thanks in advance.",
            "I have a yabbie in a fresh water tank. I cleaned his tank last week, and two nights ago he molted. Pretty normal except he just molted in April, so really soon, but he seems fine. Just now I went to look in on him and there are weird whitish puffy little balls forming on his tank furniture and there are some on him too. What is it?? I have photos but not sure how to add them",
            "I recently upgraded to a 20gallon Long planted aquarium. I currently only have 5 white cloud minnows in it and would like a small community. How many Cory catfish should I realistically and safely get without overstocking?\n\nEdit: its a 20gallon long, not 20L my bad!!",

        "content": "I'm coming from another aquarium subreddit. Ive been here much longer, but I branched out and joined other for more content. I came across a typical post, asking a simple question. Should they still do a water change even if the water level is low? Fair enough question. The answer is yes, you should be doing weekly maintenance. But the comments on this post were ENTIRELY people shitting on the fact that this person had fake plants and rainbow gravel. They were assuming this person does 0 maintenence and was abusing their fish and telling them to return all their fish. This post didn't even have a description, just the question. I don't understand why people are so cruel to new people in this hobby. We all started somewhere. Petstores tend to encourage these types of decor. Im so glad this sub is for the most part a safe space for new fish keepers to learn from their mistakes, instead of being harassed for it with no constructive criticism. We need to do better.",

            "To be fair, the water level on that tank was very low. I saw more people criticizing the obvious lack of maintenance than the decor.",
            "I think the main thing are people are fed up with seeing subpar care for live animals when it takes less than 10 minutes to find good information on fish. Plastic decor is terrible for fish and youll never convince me otherwise, especially fish with delicate fins such as a betta",

            "It sure doesn't sound like this subreddit.  People here are fairly chill, and generally welcoming to people unless they are actively being assholes.   \n\nBut yeah, subreddits exits, and users exist, where it's more about their opportunities to judge others than anything else.",
