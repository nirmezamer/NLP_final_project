            "Holiday Care.\n\nI will be travelling and want to ensure I have the best possible solution to protect my fish when I\u2019m away for over a week, almost two. I want to ensure I have a camera to watch and see them. My biggest concern is the feeder getting stuck or malfunctioning. I will test for a week before.\n\nIs there anything else I need, specifically wifi camera ideas to get the best fish coverage?\u00a0\n\n**Kit List**\u00a0\n\n1.

            "Looking for some help. Doing a fish-in cycle right now as I transferred tanks, and all of the filter media and some of the items in the tank. Wasn't expecting anything too grand of a change but my PH is changing and I'm not sure why.\n\nTanks as seachem black flourite substrate, some sand and then at the base some lava rock. Otherwise it's just driftwood, live plants and Ohko Dragon stone.\n\npH on day one was 6.8, pH on day 5 is 7.4. I am testing for pH, AMmonia, Nitrite, Nitrate, Phosphate, Calcium, GH, KH & copper. The only results that changed substanstially are the ph and GH. But I don't know what in my tank could  be raising the GH. Any thoughts/ideas?\n\nIt shouldn't affecting anything too much, but I was trying to test the water for a week or two and let everything settle so I can determine the bubbles per second I need to introduce CO2",
            "Not very experienced\nI have a 22 gallon tank that had three angelfish and three tetras, about 5 years old, and two of the angelfish passed pretty young not too long ago. There are a couple plants in there and some wood inside they can hide behind. What should i do?",
            "Hey all, I know the discussion around cycling a tank has been covered since the dawn of the internet but I wanted to get some opinions on if my tank is ready for my Oscar and Pleco.\n\n  \nWe recently upgraded from a 75g to a 125g tank to give these two monsters a bit more space. \n\nThe new tank is using a new substrate, so we were unable to bring over the bacteria that resides on the gravel of our last tank. We were able to use alot of filter media from the established tank in the new tank and filled it up with fresh water and used some Fresh Start in it.\n\nEverywhere I read explains that a Tank is cycled once Nitrite and Ammonia reach 0ppm and Nitrate is present in the tank.\n\nI have tested the water twice in the last two days and found Nitrate present both times (around 15 and 20 ppm. However when I tested yesterday my Ammonia was at 1ppm and is now at .5ppm.\n\nI know the cycle goes Ammonia > Nitrite > Nitrate. Seeing as I already have Nitrate present is it better to assume the tank is cycled and just do a water change to target the ammonia spike?\n\nAm I good to move the fish over after a water change?  \nShould I wait until ammonia an Nitrite both reach 0ppm before moving any fish over?\n\nI would appreciate any pointers",
            "Hi! I'm just getting started. I'd like to do a filter-less no-fish tank. I have a small tank right now--rounded maybe around 9x12--and I'd like to fill it with live plants, and maybe some microcritters to help with supporting the plants (tiny snails etc?). I don't want fish right now and I don't know if I ever would. I especially don't want to add fish to such a small tank and I've read that might be cruel to them :(\n\nI've seen a lot of videos on which plants to use for a filter-less tanks but they all involve eventually adding fish to balance out nutrients etc. Do I NEED fish to maintain the plants and maybe other tiny bugs etc or can I do just plants? And if I don't need to add fish, are there resources for making fish-less aquariums? I can't seem to find any that seem trustworthy :/\n\nAny and all advice and opinions welcome. I don't hate fish, I just would prefer to do plants and tiny snails for a long time before I felt comfortable tackling fish, if I ever get there.",

            "Beginner here, I have a bunch of dragon rocks that I wanna stick together to form into a single rock formation. Is regular super glue fine to use?\n\nFrom research it says so, furthermore a YT vid I saw said to use tissue paper in between the rocks with super glue to better hold the porous rocks together.\n\nEdit: update I decided to buy a liquid aquascaping cyano glue bottle. Did bunch more research and apparently people do use tissue or wool with the liquid glue to hold rocks/wood together.",
            "Hi, I have a 15 gallon tank pretty well planted and currently have 6 neon tetra in there. I also have a smaller tank with 5 guppies, I was thinking of moving them into the 15g  one and also adding 2/3 otocinclus. Is this ok doable  or am i close to overstocking here? I work from home and keep up with maintenance pretty religiously so I'm not concerned it means slightly more maintenance, but would appreciate some advice cheers",

I came across a typical post, asking a simple question. Should they still do a water change even if the water level is low? Fair enough question. The answer is yes, you should be doing weekly maintenance. But the comments on this post were ENTIRELY people shitting on the fact that this person had fake plants and rainbow gravel. They were assuming this person does 0 maintenence and was abusing their fish and telling them to return all their fish. This post didn't even have a description, just the question. I don't understand why people are so cruel to new people in this hobby. We all started somewhere. Petstores tend to encourage these types of decor. Im so glad this sub is for the most part a safe space for new fish keepers to learn from their mistakes, instead of being harassed for it with no constructive criticism. We need to do better.",

A couple of posters get all huffy, post-some self-righteous or gate-keeping crap and then tons of people join in for whatever reason.

Lord knows I\u2019ve made my share of mistakes in this hobby, so trying to get people up to speed and avoid those mistakes is understandable. \n\nOn the other hand\u2026yeah a lot of people are dicks, even in this sub. Intentions may be good but I swear too many people just jump at the chance to correct others and make them feel bad for \u201ctorturing\u201d fish because of their ignorance. Once one person hops on that it\u2019s a wrap because the herd follows. \n\nI can\u2019t tell you the amount of times I\u2019ve seen people just in this sub cry wolf over a tank that may not be perfectly ideal but is completely stable and reasonable.
