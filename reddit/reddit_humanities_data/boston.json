        "content": "Hey r/boston, u/meghankellywbur here with an AMA from WBUR and [The Emancipator](https://theemancipator.org/). Last week, we ran a joint series on the history of busing in Boston schools, marking 50 years since a federal judge ordered BPS to desegregate. \n\nIf you're not familiar with what happened with busing, the brief history is that the judge's decision meant that BPS students were bused all over the city to different neighborhoods than the ones they lived in in an effort to more evenly distribute racial diversity across the district. White Bostonians responded with violent riots.\n\nYou can catch up on the series at [The Emancipator's website](https://theemancipator.org/busing/) and at [WBUR's website](https://www.wbur.org/tag/50-years-busing-boston). There is a ton to explore, from first-person essays to how things stand today in BPS. \n\nWhat questions do you have for us? What would you like to know about the history of busing in BPS? We eagerly await your questions and hope to have an interesting and fruitful discussion.\n\nThe AMA starts tomorrow, Friday, June 28, at 11 a.m. Feel free to submit questions now, or when we log on tomorrow at 11. Talk to you then! ",

            "The BTU has been pushing \u201chub schools\u201d. Are hub schools effectively neighborhood schools? Is it possible to desegregate and have hub schools? Or is it less about desegregation and more about making our schools comparable in terms of quality, programming, funding, etc.?",
            "Who were the major players in the anti-busing effort in Boston? Who organized what would eventually become said violent riots? Did they face any consequences?",
            "With the push for district-wide inclusion and hub schools, do you think the city is looking/hoping to save money on school transportation costs?",
