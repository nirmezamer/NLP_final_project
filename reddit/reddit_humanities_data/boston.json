            "Your post appears to be one of a number of commonly asked questions about the port city of Boston. Anyway, Royale is fine if you're just trying to get drunk and dance and hookup. The Grand is more of the same as Royale but more expensive and a stricter dress code. Bijou is fine if you're into house music, the last few times I've been to Bijou the crowd was mostly freshly 21 people. Legacy is under Royale and a pretty great queer club if that's you're thing. Good Life, Phoenix Landing, Middlesex, and The Lower Level are all great for underground shows if that's your thing. The vibes at those 4 places are all pretty good. Good Life is my favorite and they open back up this weekend. If you're just looking to get trashed and don't care what you dance to or who you dance around, any of the bars around Haymarket/Faneuil Hall will do. Ned Devine's, Hennessey's, Hong Kong ($1 chicken sticks!), Sissy K's, Coogan's. I think there's a few more I'm missing but those are the big ones. Also, I can't believe I forgot this, but if you're into top 40 or hip hop, Venu, Cure, Icon, and Hava are places to go if you're looking for something a little nicer/fancier/more upscale than what the Faneuil Hall/Haymarket bars and clubs offer. I also forgot about Memoire because it's in the casino but frankly I don't really know anyone who goes to Memoire regularly. It's more of the same stuff they play at the Grand and Royale. Now I think I've named them all.
