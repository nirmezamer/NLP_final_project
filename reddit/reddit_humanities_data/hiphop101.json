            "**Why does r/hiphop101 need moderators?**\n\nI (u/Wasthereonce) have been a moderator on r/hiphop101 for about 5 years now. I started out by posting quality guides on this subreddit, and got the attention of one of the mods on here. He invited me to be a mod, so I took it.\n\nI redid the sidebar, added some rules, and [revamped the Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphop101/wiki/index/?utm_name=hiphop101). Then I took on moderating. \n\nSome moderators were active for a few months after I joined, but many of them soon became inactive. So, I've been trying to manage what I've been able to ever since, and it's become too much for me. I was able to add an Automoderator to help with the load, but it has become too much now. \n\nI joined as a moderator to be able to share more hip hop knowledge and to do what I can to make it more presentable, but the responsibilities of daily moderation with little to no help have drained me from my original goals. So that's part of why I'm looking for new people that can help out.\n\n**How can I help?**\n\nWe have over 900k subscribers on here. Recently, there have been several posts getting over 500 comments (even some with over 1500!). We could use some moderators to get a handle on comments.\n\nBut that's not the only reason. This subreddit has been stagnant for a while, and I'm hoping to get it to a place where people are really able to learn about hip hop and are more inspired to research it and teach others about it. So, I'm also looking for people that can do CSS, make Reddit bots, make community posts, make and/or update artwork for the subreddit, and can contribute and implement new ideas that would make this subreddit stand out among the rest.\n\n**Where do I apply?**\n\nIf you are interested, [I have created a Google Form you can go through here.](https://forms.gle/NQQHif1vfoAE4ZuJ9) This form has a lot of detail in order to help me find good candidates and to help me understand you better. There's opportunity to be creative and grow an awesome community here. Extra skills, positive post/comment history, and most of all a passion for **ALL things Hip Hop** is a plus to being part of the mod team. Thanks for reading, and I'm looking forward to your application!\n\nHave any questions about this moderator-seeking process? Or even any suggestions for r/hiphop101 moderation? Feel free to leave them in the comments.",

            "Amazing album. Play it constantly. Defjux is so underrated",
            "One of my favorites. There was also an EP of this that was released before. \n\n1. Funcrusher Plus is an Underground classic in every way, from start to finish. It helped define and start the underground era. EL-P's production was like nothing out at the time. The two things I didn't like about it were the track order and that goofy sample in the beginning. \n\n2. My favorites from this record are Collude/Intrude and Blind. This was when the album started rocking hard. \n\n3. The Funcrusher EP dropped in 1995. When you listen to this LP you think it's from 2003. They were ahead of their time. EL-Ps production is just as popular now as ever and no one can copy that shit. Musically, this is one of the most experimental albums ever. \n\n4. This album has a rugged grimy perspective. I picked it up in 2001. Stealing 40s from gas stations. Doing graffiti on the bus. Hooking up with random broads at parties. Running from the 5-0. This was a good soundtrack for all that. There's an anarchy in this album. \n\n5. Already talked about production. One of the most experimental albums ever made. Nothing sounded like this around that time in 1995. When most of hip-hop was still producing jazz beats. \n\n6. El-Ps wordplay and lyrics were also very experimental for the time. EL-P saw the breakdown of small labels into large mega corporations like Universal. He had problems with Rawkus. Which forced him to start DEF-JUX. His verses are laced with criticisms of normality and power structures. And I love it.   \n\n[*The prime directive is to mostly play a part of utter psychosis*](https://genius.com/777634/Company-flow-blind/The-prime-directive-is-to-mostly-play-a-part-of-utter-psychosis)  \n*Not prone to play stationary man hopeless*  \n*Gene pool tumors get rocked without discretion*  \n*Fashion MC's drop now they part of my fall collection*  \n*Dementia earth burners while Earth sinks further into servitude*  \n*Hollow UFO's is comin in*  \n*And bill collectors get clicked on*  \n*Subtle murderous murder verse form a corporation*  \n*In beef we briefly bankrupt but you suck litigation* \n\n7. Most of the criticisms of this album are because of the muddy mixing done for it. There are songs where the hi-hats are getting drowned out by muddy bass. I think they could have saved up some more money for better mixing engineers. But it was 1995 and they needed to get this out as soon as possible.\n\n8. This is very experimental. So getting into the more experimental artists from this era would be a good compliment. I'll list some of those artists. Alias, Subtitle, The ShapeShifters, Mr. Lif, Cloudead, and Arsonists.\n\n9. A lot of the warnings about labels that EL-P came true. Nothing false about any of it. With repeat listens this should be better over time. And it might not be well understood at first. This album almost requires multiple listens. \n\n10. The tracklist is one of my complaints about this album. Most of my favorite songs are upfront. I would have scattered the first 6 songs throughout the album. Ending with Blind. Starting the album with Funcrush Scratch as an intro. Because of the muddy mixing. It all sounds very cohesive. \n\n11. This is a rallying cry for poor kids growing up in metro areas in the 90s. Dealing with corrupt cops. Bombing freeways and trains. Exposing labels. Cyphering outside of shows. If I had to say one word to represent the political view of this album it's anarchy. \n\n12. This is the late '90s and 00s underground. At this time all of it was underground. We didn't have a million subgenres for rap like they do now. There was the west and east coast. Underground and mainstream. The overall vibe of the underground was anti-corporatism in hip-hop. Going independent. Forming support networks for artists to collaborate. A rejection of gangster rap and a more traditional view of the culture. Underground artists had graffiti writers and B-Boys in their videos. Most groups had some form of turntablism and scratching within their records. Underground was the counterculture to large mainstream labels.   \n\n13.  The cover art encapsulates the hellish anarchy of NYC in the 90s. It is saying we are doomed for a hellish dystopia if we keep going. The character in the front is inviting us to hell itself. It's a great cover. The boombox conveys the genre. \n\n14. Yes. This album jumpstarted the Def-Jux era. So many artists and sounds came out of this. This is a massively influential album that still has an effect today. I wouldn't be writing this almost 30 years later if it wasn't.",
            "Nice reminder that i should listen to this album again",
            "This might be controversial but oh well, just my opinion. It's actually my least favourite album produced by El-P.\u00a0\n\n\nI understand that there was nothing like it back in '96, I understand its impact on kick-starting Rawkus records and the whole late 90's underground/backpacker scene, but to me it doesn't hold up as well than basically everything else those guys ever did, including that instrumental album \"Little Johnny from the Hospitul\".\u00a0\n\n\nMaybe it was because they were obviously still developing their sound, maybe it's shitty mixing, but it's ultimately the album of that crew I don't actually listen to that often. Except \"8 Steps to Perfection\". That one is in regular rotation here.",
