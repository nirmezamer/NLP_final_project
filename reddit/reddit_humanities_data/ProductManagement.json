That being said I'm getting a lot of judgmental recruiters due to my short stint here. I guess I am seeking two pieces of advice, how do I navigate this when I do land interviews?

            "I'm kind of over PM. I feel stifled in my current role, definitely burning out at a rapid pace. Management controls all decisions, I feel more like a project manager than a product manager. I've given up on making an impact because I have almost no autonomy. I don't get inspired writing docs, by the politics, endless meetings, and fruitless arguing. Although I work on a technical set of products, the org has been pushing all of us to sideline technical understanding and focus on making more money. This is totally draining and not the type of challenge I enjoy, mostly because it involves garbage ideas and not focusing on the customer.\n\nI've PM'd technical products such as search, recommender systems, etc. I know how to write code and understand how to build enterprise level software to some degree. I've been making hobby projects for years and am currently pursuing a masters in computer science with a focus on ML. I find myself far more interested and engaged when I have to write some code, yoink some data and write a complex query then clean it up. All the technical stuff seems to fulfill me far more than the business stuff.\n\nWith that being said, I'm curious if anyone here has successfully transitioned to a SWE or Data Engineer role. If so, how did you do it? Did you start at the very bottom as a SE I or did your experience net you a more senior role? Do you have any advice?",

            "Well. You invited me vent so... here goes. \n\n\\[\n\nWas hired at a global company to help integrate 5 separate products into one martech solution. They sold me into the idea hard. You'll join a team. There's a product leader at the top of each product and a CTO that is very product oriented. He interviewed me in fact and I was pleased with the idea of working under him. \"Join us and you'll get us ready to rock in this new vertical. Here's a nice big salary and the kind of level of responsibility that is a bit of a stretch but just enough of a stretch. It will be fun.\" \n\n  \nCut to two weeks after I joined...and the CTO quits.  I was able to corner him before he left and asked him why he was leaving. \"I don't want to get into advertising.\" \n\nIt caught me off guard. I'll be honest. I put my head down and kept at it. \n\nCut to 3 months after I joined... they fire the product heads of two of the other product lines and shutter the other one. Just close it up and walk away. Then they come to me and say \"We think you're amazing. You can be the product leader now. Isn't that great?\" And I took on the extra responsibility without a raise. \n\nGuys, I believed them. I literally believed them. Looking back now, that was perhaps the biggest mistake I made. I let them flatter me and I let it get to my head and I ignored all the very loud sirens going off all around me. Business collapsing. Product leaders getting fired. CTO leaving. Braintrust exedus. I told myself, \"I can save this. I can fix this.\" \n\n(sigh) \n\nCut to 15 months after joining. Business is in the toilet. I've participated in layoffs, actually fired 20+ people over the course of the last six months. I've worked crazy hours. I've turned into a bit of a monster at home and I get an email from the COO. No salutation. Just \"Errors and missed deliverables from your department that caused revenue losses:\" and bulleted list of the engineering deliverables that were late or that didn't deliver the business value in terms of sales that the sales org has surmised or just new features that had never been prioritized officially but were now on a list of items that were costing us money because they weren't complete. \n\n  \nAnd guys, I still didn't get it. I still didn't hear the sirens. I mean this one was just blaring in my face. \"They are building a paper trail to ax you! Dude! run!\" \n\nCut to 18 months after joining. They tell my team before me and so I have a morning of meetings with my team looking at me funny and laughing too hard at jokes. And on my 1:1 with the CEO they let me go and lock my computer, give me half my wages for 4 weeks and 2 months of Cobra and I'm gone. \n\n  \nOoof. \n\n  \nWhy am I venting to this thread? Learn from me lads and lasses. Pay attention to the signs. Be on the look out for the devil hubris. It will convince you you are invincible. If the person who hires you quits two weeks after you join. Leave immediately. Do not get attached to your team, or the project. You are doomed. \n\nRant complete  \n\\]",
