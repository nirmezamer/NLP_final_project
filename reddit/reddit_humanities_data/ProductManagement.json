            "I'm taking a beating on my job search thus far, something like a thousand applies without bearing anything fruitful and barely any interviews.  Anyone have any recommendations on where else to look?  I have eight years experience, solid resume.  I made it all the way through to the team match stage at google last year before they froze everything and started only filling their roles with internals etc.. \n\nIf anyone has any leads I'd love to hear any and all of them, tia ",

            "Hi all, been on the search for a few months now with few call backs and even fewer interviews, this is including using recruiters and getting a few referrals from my network. I have a total of 11 years working on digital products but only 2 years with an official PM title. \n\nAll of this to say, can someone experienced in hiring PMs or a PM who gets a call back frequently review my resume?",

No I have not been catering my resume and I guess I will start doing that. Does anyone have any insight as to why it's so hard now and what will happen in the next year or so?"

You'll join a team. There's a product leader at the top of each product and a CTO that is very product oriented. He interviewed me in fact and I was pleased with the idea of working under him. \"Join us and you'll get us ready to rock in this new vertical. Here's a nice big salary and the kind of level of responsibility that is a bit of a stretch but just enough of a stretch. It will be fun.\" \n\n  \nCut to two weeks after I joined...and the CTO quits.  I was able to corner him before he left and asked him why he was leaving. \"I don't want to get into advertising.\" \n\nIt caught me off guard. I'll be honest. I put my head down and kept at it. \n\nCut to 3 months after I joined... they fire the product heads of two of the other product lines and shutter the other one. Just close it up and walk away. Then they come to me and say \"We think you're amazing. You can be the product leader now. Isn't that great?\" And I took on the extra responsibility without a raise. \n\nGuys, I believed them. I literally believed them. Looking back now, that was perhaps the biggest mistake I made. I let them flatter me and I let it get to my head and I ignored all the very loud sirens going off all around me. Business collapsing. Product leaders getting fired. CTO leaving. Braintrust exedus. I told myself, \"I can save this. I can fix this.\" \n\n(sigh) \n\nCut to 15 months after joining. Business is in the toilet. I've participated in layoffs, actually fired 20+ people over the course of the last six months. I've worked crazy hours. I've turned into a bit of a monster at home and I get an email from the COO. No salutation. Just \"Errors and missed deliverables from your department that caused revenue losses:\" and bulleted list of the engineering deliverables that were late or that didn't deliver the business value in terms of sales that the sales org has surmised or just new features that had never been prioritized officially but were now on a list of items that were costing us money because they weren't complete. \n\n  \nAnd guys, I still didn't get it. I still didn't hear the sirens. I mean this one was just blaring in my face. \"They are building a paper trail to ax you! Dude! run!\" \n\nCut to 18 months after joining. They tell my team before me and so I have a morning of meetings with my team looking at me funny and laughing too hard at jokes. And on my 1:1 with the CEO they let me go and lock my computer, give me half my wages for 4 weeks and 2 months of Cobra and I'm gone. \n\n  \nOoof. \n\n  \nWhy am I venting to this thread? Learn from me lads and lasses. Pay attention to the signs. Be on the look out for the devil hubris. It will convince you you are invincible. If the person who hires you quits two weeks after you join. Leave immediately. Do not get attached to your team, or the project. You are doomed. \n\nRant complete  \n\\]"

Then you ask questions like: what did you want to become when you were little? what bands/musicians do you listen to? etc.\n3. Everyone gets their turn to answer the question.\n4. If you have a similarity to the person's answer (ex. I also wanted to be an astronaut like Jerry), then you draw a line from your name to that person's name.\n5. At the end you see how many lines you have to your colleagues or how thick your line is to someone, which represents your connection to them.\n\nMight sound childish or too simple, but for me it worked surprisingly well.",
