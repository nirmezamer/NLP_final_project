They both seem like embarrassments, but at least one may bring back Wade v Roe and isn't a felon. \n\nI almost feel sorry for the thinking, sensible Americans, and desperately sorry for the women having their rights eroded.",

            "I lasted about 30 minutes and gave up. I hate Trump with a vengeance but how anyone thinks either of them are up to the job is beyond me. The parade of Tory leaders in the UK look like shining beacons next to those two. Biden needs to give it up and someone needs to hold Trump accountable for the never-ending torrent of lies he spouts.",

A food typically associated with America. Hamburgers, hotdogs, pizza can all be traced back to other countries. It\u2019s no different that British food, okay we have hot pots, stews, but you\u2019ll find variants of the same meal around the world. Let\u2019s go chicken tika masala, I think and I might be wrong, first appeared in Britain it\u2019s however Indian. The whole out shot is better than your shit is so far out because most of your shit, their shit and other shit came from or is inspired by another country.
