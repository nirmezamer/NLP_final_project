            "G-Helper is a godsend!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't forget to support the dev.  \nI did it, best money I ever paid for an app.  \n20 more bucks to be able to properly use a 1500 USD+ laptop simply doesn't count :)",
            "10/10 would download again, just works and looks better.",
            "Absolutely insane improvement on idle temps and HUGE jump in battery life.\n\nWas getting idle temps in at around 59-65 degree with Armory Crate open. Now idling at around 42 degrees.\n\nExpected battery life went from around 4-5 hours to over 10hrs!\n\n20/10 would download again. Thank you!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1o4t3lg93sbb1.png?width=3024&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b385079eeefaaa6283208517713a6b697d5ad7c",
            "My idle temps on a Zephyrus G15 are 90+. I have to disable turbo boost just to use the laptop without it melting. I just uninstalled everything Armoury Crate related and installed G-Helper and now my idle temps are in the 50's and I can use my computer as normal.\n\nAnd even better, it gives you easy access to disable the CPU Boost, which is helpful when you're gaming and your laptop is getting too hot. Just turn that off and your PC will be much cooler.",
            "Will try this later today.  I was just getting used to AC and MyAsus and frankly it\u2019s a cluttered mess.  It seems this also supports undervolting.",
            "I\u2019ve just gotten 2023- with 16gb or ram. Out of box it utilises close to 60% ram. After removing a lot of apps, it went down to about 50%. \n\nSwitched to G-Helper and uninstalling AC using the utility, it\u2019s now sitting slightly below 40%. It\u2019s still kinda high but it\u2019s still 10% (1.6gb of RAM) less utilised. Pretty happy so far.",

            "This is the OLED 120 Hz/16 GB RAM/RTX 4060 build that retails at Best Buy for $1599.99\n\nWas debating between this one and the white Lenovo Legion 7i so went to Best Buy to see them both in person and this one impressed me more. I just really loved the OLED display on this and was surprised at how light it felt. Plus they had an Open Box - Excellent option for it at $1261 so I ended up going with it\n\nI know the 32 GB RAM/RTX 3070 would\u2019ve been better but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be using it much for gaming, if at all. Mostly just regular computer stuff like browsing and Microsoft office for college work so I figured this 16 GB RAM/RTX 3060 model would be more than enough for that",
            "There was an open box g14 2023 with the ryzen 9 and 4060 going for $850 last week.\n\nIt was in my cart but someone bought it while I was deciding between the g16 I've just gotten versus that.\n\nWhoever bought that made out like a thief.",

            "I would recommend you the:\n\n-SSD Acer GM7 NVMe, 2TB, PCI Express 4.0, M.2\nor Samsung 990Pro. \nFor me are the best SSDs in the market, but GM7 is more power efficient.\n\nI have the same G14 2021 model.\n\nFor 2 years I used the stock 1TB SSD.\nThen I changed it to the Samsung 990Pro 2TB. Great drive, but I noticed a little higher power draw  (usually was 8W and then was 10-12W) I did not mind that much, but I checked the specs and indeed it draws more power (don\u2019t remember how much).\n\n6 Months later I saw a discount for the GM7 and decided to try it. Absolutely worth it. I moved the Samsung 990Pro to my PC and stick the GM7 on my G14.\n\n990Pro and GM7 are the same, almost same speeds, same capacity, same 1200TBW and 5 year warranty. The only difference is that the GM7 draws less power."

I believe it is not a software issue but rather a hardware one because it does have a texture when running my fingers across the line. Tried many google-solutions but non worked. Is this fixable or is this a warranty valid problem of the G14. \n\nHoping for your helpful responses\n",

Seems like a somewhat significant physical issue to be marked excellent but not too sure! \n",
