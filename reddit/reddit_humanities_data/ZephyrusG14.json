            "10/10 would download again, just works and looks better.",
            "My idle temps on a Zephyrus G15 are 90+. I have to disable turbo boost just to use the laptop without it melting. I just uninstalled everything Armoury Crate related and installed G-Helper and now my idle temps are in the 50's and I can use my computer as normal.\n\nAnd even better, it gives you easy access to disable the CPU Boost, which is helpful when you're gaming and your laptop is getting too hot. Just turn that off and your PC will be much cooler.",
            "I\u2019ve just gotten 2023- with 16gb or ram. Out of box it utilises close to 60% ram. After removing a lot of apps, it went down to about 50%. \n\nSwitched to G-Helper and uninstalling AC using the utility, it\u2019s now sitting slightly below 40%. It\u2019s still kinda high but it\u2019s still 10% (1.6gb of RAM) less utilised. Pretty happy so far.",
            "yall been talking bout this so much i might finally try it out, Im just cautious about deleting armory crate cause i like to change my keyboard color lol",
            "Just want to say this is fantastic.",
            "Will this work on an M zephyrus or only G models?",
            "Has anyone managed to extract the animations from armoury crate? I like the ROG logo shimmer one. Literally the only thing I miss from having AC installed",
            "Need some help here!\n\nGot rid of most of the asus bloatware and installed ghleper. Ghelper says I have 9 asus services running in the background. Should I click stop? And how do I uninstall that shit?",
            "Anyone using this with the 2020 model?",
            "This is so wonderful. THANK YOU!!! This is what Armoury Crate should have been."

            "for the past year, my g14 was running at a constant 76deg C base level, heating like a hot potato even when im on igpu only, silent, etc on armoury crate. College work was toughh af with the battery life of such laptop; how did i not realise the diff it would have made if i just deleted that armoury crate and installed g-helper instead",
            "It happens. We're quick to dismiss things even if it's in our line of sight. It's not until we really need it that we start paying more attention, lol. It gets posted nearly every week to remove AC and install g-helper.",
            "Glad you have eventually discovered our lord and savior GHelper. \n\nFun tip, I've found that I can turn my settings down to around 15w, and can stably hit 8\\~ hours with very light tasks like notes, and web browsing.",
            "Right. I always knew armoury sucks, but did not have a secure alternative for the same features (the discounts on steam were tempting me to keep it). Ah, so much better now",
            "I'm not in front of mine right now, but if you click on extras a new screen will pop up. It'll give you the option at the very bottom to stop every Asus app that's currently running in the background\n\nI'm glad you made the switch. Welcome to the cool kids club \ud83d\ude02",

Never going back to armory crate ever again\ud83d\ude42 Glad you got on G-helper too OP, you deserved better\ud83d\udcaa"

Left side of the screen is noticeably raised in the middle when closed and the bend is pretty visible when open as well. Seems like a somewhat significant physical issue to be marked excellent but not too sure! \n",

            "I've found the g series screens bends insanely easily (I have a g2021 used), so I personally wouldn't worry about it, but you did pay for excellent edition so if you feel it's a problem return it, you have a one week return window for exactly this reason.",

            "BestBuy cant be trusted with their open box items man. Especially with these g14\u2019s. I\u2019ve bought and returned two open boxes now. The first was a good condition that turned out to be a store display so it was dirty and the battery was depleted. The second was an excellent condition with a cpu fan that did not spin. I too noticed the slight bend in the screen in both units and now realize it\u2019s not normal lol",
            "It's open box, you get what you get. You're acting like someone just returned it because they felt like it.",
            "Yeah planning on returning mainly because I did pay more for excellent so more out of money perspective then a concern for future use. Thanks!",
            "No. OP is right. If it is marked as excellent condition it should be excellent. Hopefully you can refund.",
            "Seems like you\u2019re the seller of said product lol",
            "Alrighty. Also, always check out \"worse\" qualities too, as j found a legion 5 slim in \"good\" that was in perfect condition, because when stock sits long enough they will just put it down a quality tag to lower the price, so you can look for double tags on the boxes",
            "Thanks for your input, that\u2019s what I was thinking. I\u2019m within my 14 day window so I\u2019ll head into a store tomorrow and see what they think!"
