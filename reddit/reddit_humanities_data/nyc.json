        "content": "This July marks the end of the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s [*Before Technicolor*](https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/5603), an exhibit and film series of early examples of color on film. That exhibit may be ending, but it goes to show that New York City\u2019s colors of July involve much more than simply red, white, and blue. (Though for anyone seeking information on viewing July 4 fireworks in NYC, there is a [dedicated website](https://www.macys.com/s/fireworks/).)\n\nRainbows in particular are a funny thing in July, at least they seem that way in NYC. For a while, they\u2019re mostly found on clearance racks as stores try to offload last month\u2019s pride merchandise. Then as the month lumbers along, they go back to being a pretty decoration that can carry additional meaning. Rainbows in the sky are rare, but they\u2019re beautiful and golden\u2014and often in oppressive heat.\n\nFor this month, I team up with Alexa Weiser of the newsletter [City Happenings](https://cityhappenings.substack.com/) to present a rainbow of events across New York City. If you are looking for more events still, she deserves additional credit for helping to curate some of the events in the more expansive [July 2024 Blankman List](https://blankmanlist.substack.com/p/things-to-do-in-nyc-july-2024).\n\n*Disclaimer: before going anywhere, please confirm the date, time, location, cost, and description using the listed website. Any event is at risk of being rescheduled, relocated, sold out, at capacity, or canceled. Costs are rounded to the nearest dollar and may change. I try to vet quality and describe accurately, but I may misjudge. All views are my own.*\n\n# Red\n\nIt\u2019s appropriate that the rainbow begins with colors that feel the most representative of summer. (At least when placed in order of decreasing wavelength.) Red-themed events are of course not limited to warm months, but with activities like a baseball game and outdoor movie screening, it\u2019s striking how naturally they fit.\n\n* Every Thursday: [Rockin\u2019 Lobster Thursdays at Red Hook Lobster Pound](https://www.redhooklobster.com/event/rockaway-lobster-boils-2024/)\n   * Oceanfront lobster dining with live music; 5\u20138 pm\n   * Dishes are generally $11\u2013$29 ([full menu](https://redhooklobster.getbento.com/location/rockaway/))\n   * Red Hook Lobster Pound\n   * 97-01 Shorefront Pkwy (Rockaway Park, Queens)\n* Friday, July 5\u2013Sunday, July 7: [Boston Red Sox at New York Yankees](https://www.mlb.com/yankees/schedule/2024-07)\n   * Regular season MLB \\[Major League Baseball\\] game; start time depends on day\n   * $60\u2013$443+\n   * Yankee Stadium\n   * 1 E 161st St (South Bronx, The Bronx)\n* Sunday, July 7: [*Jurassic Park* at Rooftop Reds Vineyard](https://bucketlisters.com/experience/movies-on-a-rooftop-vineyard)\n   * Rooftop screening of the 1993 sci-fi Steven Spielberg film with dinner and wine; 8 pm (6 pm happy hour begins); movies every Sunday and Thursday\n   * $35 (includes pizza and wine)\n   * Rooftop Reds Vineyard\n   * 299 Sands St, Building 275 (Navy Yard, Brooklyn)\n* Friday, July 26: [Red NOT Chili Peppers](https://www.brooklynbowl.com/brooklyn/events/detail/red-not-chili-peppers-k7vgfb6v8zf22)\n   * Red Hot Chili Peppers cover band with pop rock band[ Scotia Rose](https://www.instagram.com/scotiaroseband/) opening; 8 pm (6 pm doors)\n   * $20\n   * Brooklyn Bowl\n   * 61 Wythe Ave (Williamsburg, Brooklyn)\n\n# Orange\n\nOnce the vision of a rainbow lineup was decided, Alexa and I each had our moonshots. I was hoping that British doom metal act Orange Goblin was touring the US, and Alexa was hoping that R&B pop duo Emotional Oranges were stopping by New York. Alas, it turns out that bands do not plan world tours based on fledgling online event lists. However, we are thankful to feature Orange Glou, a wine store that specializes in orange wines. Alexa had featured them in her newsletter once before, and it couldn\u2019t be more fit for summer libations.\n\n* Weekdays: [Happy Hour at 67 Orange Street](https://67orangestreet.square.site/)\n   * Food and drink specials at a cozy craft cocktail bar; 5\u20137 pm; every Monday through Friday\n   * Drinks are $8\u2013$12, entrees are $10 ([happy hour menu](https://67orangestreet.square.site/))\n   * 67 Orange Street\n   * 2082 Frederick Douglass Blvd (Harlem, Manhattan)\n* Every Friday: [Free Tastings at Orange Glou](https://www.orangeglou.com/)\n   * Public tastings at a shop dedicated to orange wines; 6\u20138 pm\n   * Free\n   * Orange Glou\n   * 264 Broome Street (Lower East Side, Manhattan)\n* Saturday, July 13: [Silent Mass, Orange Peel Mystic, others at the New Colossus Festival](https://dice.fm/event/3oqod8-the-new-colossus-festival-presents-summer-saturdays-with-silent-mass-king-bug-joyce-golder-orangepeelmystic-13th-jul-18th-ward-brewing-new-york-city-tickets)\n   * Experimental rock concert ([Orange Peel Mystic Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/orangepeelmystic/?hl=en)); 12\u20137 pm\n   * Free\n   * 18th Ward Brewing\n   * 300 Richardson St (East Williamsburg, Brooklyn)\n* Friday, July 26: [Into Another, Orange 9mm, others at Tattoo Arts Convention](https://www.nyctatcon.com/)\n   * Post-hardcore metal concert at the first annual tattoo arts convention ([Orange 9mm Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/orange9mmnyc/?hl=en)); 6 pm\n   * $35 (concert only; convention access is additional $30)\n   * Terminal 5\n   * 610 W 56th St (Hell\u2019s Kitchen, Manhattan)\n\n# Yellow\n\nJuly means sunflowers are finally back in season, and if you\u2019re looking to add some yellow to your home, be sure to check whether your nearest bodega carries them. (Alexa does this every week!) Alternatively, there are a few events around town that let you add some yellow to your life without requiring any plant care.\n\n* Tuesday, July 2\u2013Saturday, July 6: [Yellowjackets](https://www.birdlandjazz.com/tm-event/yellowjackets-2/)\n   * Jazz fusion concert ([Yellowjackets website](https://www.yellowjackets.com/)); start time depends on day but ranges from 7 pm to 10:30 pm\n   * $35\u2013$46, plus $20 food and drink minimum\n   * Birdland Jazz Club\n   * 315 W 44th St (Hell\u2019s Kitchen, Manhattan)\n* Through Sunday, July 14: [Euros 2024 Matches at The Canary](https://www.instagram.com/p/C8ChovBOKmV/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==)\n   * Irish pub telecast of the UEFA European Championship (European association football); matches at 12 pm and/or 3 pm, depending on day\n   * [Menu](https://www.thecanarybk.com/) entrees are $12\u2013$21\n   * The Canary\n   * 789 Franklin Ave (Crown Heights, Brooklyn)\n* Friday, July 26: [The Golden Ball (Le Ballon d\u2019or)](https://villa-albertine.org/events/the-golden-ball/)\n   * Screening of 1994 French and Guinean comedy-drama film about a 12-year-old soccer prodigy; 8:30 pm; part of [Films on the Green 2024](https://villa-albertine.org/events/filmsonthegreen2024/)\n   * Free\n   * Riverside Park, Pier 1\n   * 500 W 70th St (Upper West Side, Manhattan)\n* Saturday, July 27: [It\u2019s an R&B Thing: Yellow & White Affair](https://allevents.in/new%20york/it%E2%80%99s-an-randb-thing-yellow-and-white-affair-w-ted-smooth-and-dj-lp/10000901017516647)\n   * R&B music party at Caribbean restaurant with yellow and/or white attire required; 9 pm\u20133 am\n   * $25 entry (full food and drink menu available)\n   * Gran Maya Restaurant\n   * 3920 Broadway (Washington Heights, Manhattan)\n\n# Green\n\nThere is no need to escape the city to find greenery. In fact, we were finding so many green options that with a heavy heart, we cut [Sierra Green and the Giants](https://sierragreenandthegiants.com/tour/)\u2014a New Orleans-style soul group performing at City Winery on July 17\u2014to keep to the pattern of four events per color. Alexa bleeds a little green, in fact, and is hoping others will join her in a monthlong celebration of a (hopeful) Celtics NBA Finals win.\n\n* Most Fridays and Saturdays: [Green-Wood After Hours](https://www.green-wood.com/series/green-wood-after-hours-14/)\n   * Cemetery history walking tour; 7:30\u20139:30 pm; most Fridays and Saturdays\n   * $30\n   * The Green-Wood Cemetery\n   * 500 25th St (Greenwood Heights, Brooklyn)\n* Sunday, July 7: [Community Garden Volunteer Green-Up](https://www.morusnyc.org/community-garden-volunteer-green-up/)\n   * Community garden volunteer work, such as watering plants, remediating soil, and composting food waste; 12 pm; first Sunday of each month\n   * Free\n   * Green Oasis Community Garden\n   * 370 E 8th St (East Village, Manhattan)\n* Saturday, July 13: [Greenlight Bookstore Sidewalk Sale](https://www.greenlightbookstore.com/event/sidewalk-sale)\n   * Special outdoor sale on books, music, and merchandise; 10 am\u20135 pm\n   * Free entry\n   * Greenlight Bookstore\n   * 686 Fulton St (Fort Greene, Brooklyn)\n* Monday, July 22: [At This Performance\u2026 at the Green Room 42](https://thegreenroom42.venuetix.com/show/details/Ddo1VrggiKbcE3Nm9TCj)\n   * Cabaret performance by Broadway understudies; 7 pm\n   * $37\u2013$68\n   * The Green Room 42\n   * 570 10th Ave (Hell\u2019s Kitchen, Manhattan)\n\n# Blue\n\nFrom blues to bluegrass, the color blue has long been associated with music. Here, we rhapsodize New York City in blue with a range of blue artists and bands.\n\n* Monday, July 1\u2013Thursday, July 4: [Blue Note Jazz Festival: Joey Alexander](https://www.bluenotejazz.com/jazz-festival-nyc/shows/?eid=13373573)\n   * Concert series featuring Indonesian pianist [Joey Alexander](https://www.instagram.com/joeyalexandermusic/?hl=en) that concludes an annual citywide jazz festival; sets at 8 & 10:30 pm\n   * $35 bar / $52 table, plus $20 food and drink minimum\n   * Blue Note Jazz Club\n   * 131 W 3rd St (Greenwich Village, Manhattan)\n* Saturday, July 20: [The Blue Dahlia](https://www.viewcy.com/e/the_blue_dahlia_1)\n   * Eclectic indie pop concert ([The Blue Dahlia webpage](https://thebluedahliamusic.com/)); 8 pm\u201312 am\n   * $20 suggested donation\n   * Barb\u00e8s\n   * 376 9th St (Park Slope, Brooklyn)\n* Wednesday, July 24: [T.K.

The sequence originally comes from Isaac Newton, whose blue would nowadays be considered cyan and whose indigo would be blue ([Waldman, 2002](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Introduction_to_Light/PbsoAXWbnr4C)). This July, we ask to unite the indigo/violet divide among us and seek purple citywide harmony.\n\n* Saturday, July 6: [Lavender Fields](https://www.petescandystore.com/calendar/)\n   * Peaceful synth indie rock concert ([Lavender Fields website](https://www.lavenderfieldsmusic.com/)); 8 pm\n   * Free entry\n   * Pete\u2019s Candy Store\n   * 709 Lorimer St (Williamsburg, Brooklyn)\n* Tuesday, July 9: [Indigo Dyeing](https://textileartscenter.com/adult-classes/class-calendar/)\n   * Workshop on creating an indigo dye vat, followed by practice on different fabrics; 6:30\u20139 pm\n   * $85 (includes materials)\n   * Textile Arts Center, Brooklyn Studio\n   * 505 Carroll St (Park Slope, Brooklyn)\n* Friday, July 19: [Powerviolets, Noun, Sweet Harm, Big Band](https://dice.fm/event/oe2kxy-powerviolets-noun-sweet-harm-big-band-19th-jul-alphaville-new-york-tickets)\n   * Indie rock concert ([Powerviolets Bandcamp](https://powerviolets.bandcamp.com/)); 8 pm\n   * $14\n   * Alphaville\n   * 140 Wilson Ave (Bushwick, Brooklyn)\n* Friday, July 26\u2013Saturday, July 27: [*Purple Rain* 40th Anniversary Celebration](https://brooklynbridgepark.org/series/purple-rain-40th-anniversary-celebration/)\n   * Film screening of Prince\u2019s 1984 movie *Purple Rain* with dance party tribute; 6:30\u201310:30 pm\n   * Free\n   * Brooklyn Bridge Park, Pier 3 Plaza\n   * 334 Furman St (Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn)",
