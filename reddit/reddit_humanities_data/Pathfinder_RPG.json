        "content": "I am planning on making an eldritch guardian character and have been doing a lot of theorizing on ways to get the most milage out of my familiar. The idea I came up with is the Ioun Wyrd as it is a construct and so it would seem it could be upgraded through craft construct. Besides the basic upgrades listed under the feat [Craft Construct ](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/item-creation-feats/craft-Construct-item-creation/#modifying_constructs) or those modifications found under the [Building and Modifying Constructs rules](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/building-and-modifying-constructs/) there are also the Construct [templates](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/), all of which are acquired templates:\n\n>Acquired Templates\n\n>This kind of template is added to a creature well after its birth or creation.\n\n>Some templates, like the\u00a0[lich](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/lich), are the results of a creature\u2019s choice and desire to transform. Others, like the\u00a0[ghost](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/ghost)\u00a0template, are the result of an external force acting upon a creature (for example, when a tormented person dies and becomes a ghost). Yet in both cases, the template changed a creature well after its birth or creation\u2014these types are called \u201cacquired templates,\u201d and can be added to a creature at any time during its existence.\n\nSo for my purposes it would seem that it is entirely possible to upgrade my ioun wyrd with the [\"Commando Construct\" template](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/commando-construct-cr-varies/), however I would have to hire someone to do (or have a party member with Craft Construct assist) this as I don't believe there is any for a non-caster to get Craft Construct. \n\nIf this assumption is correct and this is possible this brings up a few questions:  \n1. The Commando gains special abilities according to its HD, would the Familiar Hit Dice rule apply here in a similar way that it does for familiar's whose DC for poison depends on their masters hit dice? \n\n>\"*Hit Dice*: For the purpose of effects related to number of Hit Dice, use the master\u2019s character level or the familiar\u2019s normal HD total, whichever is higher.\"\n\n2.  The commando construct gains bonus feats, 1 at base and 1 more for every 4HD (to a max of 10), is the familiar even capable of receiving the first feat? what about the feat per 4HD?\n\n  \n3. This is not directly related to the commando template, however I plan on giving my familiar the[ Mauler archetype](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/familiar/familiar-archetypes/mauler-familiar-archetype/), when in the battle form the size increase to medium, as per the rules for constructs they gain addition HP depending on their size (20 for medium) would my Ioun Wyrd gain this bonus HP when in battle form?\n\nIf all of this is possible then I think this would be one of the strongest combat familiars:  \nit would get:  \n +10(+4 commando, +4 tiny to medium, +2 mauler size bonus) to str (plus the addition str for leveling) when in battle form @ level 10 this is 17 strength\n\n+ 2 dex (+4 commando, -2 tiny to medium) when in battle form for a total dex of 17 \n\nAc of 20 (15 base, +1 for dex increase, +4 natural armor from commando) +any additional armor you give it\n\n+30 Hp when in battle form (Commando give 1.5x the size bonus) \n\n@ level 10, assuming the fighters Hp is 90 ( slightly above average rolls with +2 con and favored class bonus), the maulers health in battle for would be 75 (which is d8 HD for that level with the same +2con and favored class)\n\nAs a commando the Ioun wyrd would also be able to gain sneak attack again assuming level 10 master that would be 5d6 sneak attack from flanking which wouldn't be too hard to do. And could do an extra attack every turn at full BAB (again a commando ability) or you could give it the ability to deal damage and cause the enemy to make a DC 18 (10+half HD + str Mod) or be knocked unconscious \n\nThis doesn't even consider its own combat feats, which would be in addition to the combat feats shared with the fighter as an eldritch guardian. (Maybe the familiar can attack with a weapon now as I could pick up proficiency, Although I would have to find a work around for the fact that in the chart [Magic Item Slots for Animals](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/) the Ioun Wyrd can not grasp/carry items, maybe another modification could add limbs/hands)  \n\n\nFinally a number of other basic or complex modifications could be added including, better ability scores, better AC, better resistances, and even fast healing. \n\nOverall I think this package would make for a really impressive combat familiar and I'm looking forward to hear what you all think about it and whether or not it works and any ways I could improve the build.

            "> A commando construct\u2019s materials cost an additional 10,000 gp above the base creature\u2019s cost. The Craft check required to make the body has a DC 4 higher than normal for the base construct\u2019s kind. The construct is animated using a special laboratory or workroom that costs 1,000 gp to establish. If the creator is personally constructing the creature\u2019s body, the crafting and the ritual can be performed simultaneously. The creator must have a minimum caster level 1 higher than the base creature\u2019s minimum required caster level. In addition, the following spells must be cast during the ritual: bull\u2019s strength, greater heroism, and limited wish.\n\nEven if it's called an acquired template somewhere, I think all that needs to be done when the commando construct's made.\n\nIf you can get it done, the commando construct should get feats including 'backdated' ones for 1 HD etc. The hit points are set by the half master's hp + possible mauler's endurance feat, the size based hp are overridden by this and would not apply. Certainly it cant wield weapons by default (it's a pet rock surrounded by orbiting pebbles and has nothing resembling hands) but one possible construct modification adds a built in weapon."
