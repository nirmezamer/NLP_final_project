            "How Do Birthdays and Aging Work in Japanese?\n\nThis may seem like an odd question, but I'm doing personal research into the Japanese school system along with Japan in general.\n\nSay a student is born on April 1, 2009. In the United States, they would turn 15 on April 1, 2024. In Japan, does the same rule apply? I've read articles that still leave me confused, but I think what it said was that the age of the person doesn't actually increase until the day after.\n\nSo if you're a first year in high school, for instance, and your birthday is December 2. If it's now December 2, would you not say that you're 16 until the day after? I want to be sure I'm understanding how the system actually works.\n\nI read something about Civil Code Article 143 but I'm really not familiar at all to understand. I just wanted someone with more knowledge to answer.\n\nThank you for indulging in my weird questions.",
            "Oh hey look at that, right there in the guide...\n\nThis is probably dumb but, due to the frequency of earthquakes and the possibility of them occurring at night, do people in Japan usually wear pyjamas or some other clothing to sleep? If you're woken up in the middle of the night (ideally by an alarm I guess) do you have time to dress? Or do you have to get out immediately in whatever state of dress you're in?",

I checked their Twitter and Instagram, and there doesn't seem to be any problem on their end. Can someone else with a japan vpn check for me? \n\nhttps://sunho.store/",

            "Ill visit Japan in a few months and im curious how the prices for glasses vary. \n\nFor Context i spontaneously visitet last Year Soul because it was very reasonably priced, but only for a short period of time and wasnt really prepared. I went shopping and walked by a glasses store. I liked the frames a lot but \"i havent had the time to wait for the glasses to be done\". A friend told me shortly after the trip that they could make them on the spot just by copying my current glasses. So i regreted not making myself new glasses there. In germany they are a bit of pricy, you have to wait quite long for them to be done and i dont really like the availability of the style of the frames.\n\nIf the procedure in Japan is similar to S.Korea i would like to know how much roundabout the Spectacle lenses cost/Glasses and more importantly how long does it take till the glasses are ready.",

            "Hello! I'm feeling pretty silly but for some reason don't 100% understand the wording around purchasing same-day tickets for the Sailor Moon museum exhibit currently in Fukuoka. I'm in Tokyo for an international law program for four months, and want to take advantage of my proximity to do a weekend trip to see the exhibit and the city. I'd like to purchase tickets ahead of time, but it looks like the only ones available are \"same day.\" However, it then says that they are valid from February 6th to March 20th. So are they just general admission and can be used any day? Thank you for your help!!

            "Hi, complete noob here, can someone explain like I'm five how exchange rates are determined? What is causing the yen to depreciate in value and what needs to happen for it to rise back up?",
            "Hi there, this is Emma Ockerman from Nikkei Asia's audience engagement team. Here's an excerpt from a story we posted today, on a topic I see being discussed here often.\n\n*TOKYO -- Japanese households face a 90,000 yen ($560) increase in their yearly expenses from higher prices for food and energy imports, one estimate shows, as the country's weak currency drains purchasing power.*\n\n*The yen depreciated as far as 161.20 to the U.S. dollar on Friday, the lowest in over 37 years. Japan's government*\u00a0[*said on Friday*](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Markets/Currencies/Japan-appoints-Atsushi-Mimura-as-top-currency-diplomat-as-yen-falls)\u00a0*it will replace top currency diplomat Masato Kanda, but this announcement is expected to have limited impact on the market.*\n\n*The yen's recent fall appears more linked to import companies and institutional investors buying up dollars late in the April-June quarter.*\n\n*Ripples from this push to buy dollars and sell yen are spreading to other currencies. The yen fell to the 172 range against the euro on Friday, breaking the record low set at the end of April. The yen is also at its lowest against the Australian dollar since 2007.*\n\n*The broad decline makes purchasing overseas goods -- such as food and energy -- more expensive in yen terms.*\n\n*Saisuke Sakai, chief economist for Mizuho Research & Technologies, estimates that the average cost burden per household will rise 90,000 yen from last year if the Japanese currency stays around 160 to the dollar, even with measures to combat rising prices.*",
            "so... a Y7500 increase per month. Meanwhile, any company selling overseas is *making* more than it did previously.\n\nLast time I checked, Japan exports. Like, a lot.",
            "Hmm I mean, for any projects I do in other currencies, yay, I guess?\n\nOn the other hand, probably means more price increases in my industry across the board, again.",

            "They say \u2018I get paid in yen and live in Japan so it\u2019s fine :)\u2019 \nYes you get paid in yen in a country where everything is imported which means the prices around you will continue to go up and your salary won\u2019t. It WILL effect us living here.\u2019"
