If you're woken up in the middle of the night (ideally by an alarm I guess) do you have time to dress? Or do you have to get out immediately in whatever state of dress you're in?",

The shinkansen was PACKED, but 95% of the train just got off at Shin-Aomori. I thought that most people would go to Shin-Hakodate and to Sapporo, but why did everyone disembark at Aomori? Isn't it a small town with 300k people? Why are so many people from presumably Tokyo taking a shinkansen to Aomori?",

            "I buy Japanese products from time to time (mostly electronics) and was wondering what Japanese social media sites and forums the Japanese use to discuss products, product reviews and product tips and tricks. Some things are released there first, and I'd like to get information or talk to other users. For example, I just bought a Yamaha Seqtrak (mini groove box synth), and not many users in the west yet. Any ideas where to look?"

I dont mind the tourist that much, mostly theyre confined to the tourist areas and dont venture into the more residential areas. \n\nProbably the only thing that annoys me is the bombardment of social media post hyping everything Japan related, and the influx of how can I move to Japan or why (insert moronic stereotype or question) all over Reddit."

It is like catching up what probably should have happened earlier. You have to take the choice of reduced GDP adjusted by other currencies term, or let inflation and interest rate to go up. However it is more complex than that. \n\nWhat unique to Japan economy is relatively high degree of self sufficiency. A main driver of inflation is food and basic consumer goods, and Japan produces most of its own food; weak yen has limited impact to the daily needs. Also surge of tourism and exports is supposed to counter weak yen by driving up demand of currency. Also there has no economic distress and social disorder in the country (well I guess Abe did get killed but thats was only thing happened, which had nothing to do with the economy). Yes, yen may be weak, but so what. Is life still generally ok in Japan? That is the real question.",
