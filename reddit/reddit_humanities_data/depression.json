        "content": "We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say \"PM me anytime\" in a casual social context.  \n\nWe have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  \n\nOur new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.\n\n*****\n\n###Summary###\n\n**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** \n\n\n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\n\n* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \n\n* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \n\n* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  \n\n* In our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \n\n*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\n\n* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",

            "Understood and I apologise if I forget in the future and break it",
            "Biggest Problem on private talks may be that you may reach a point where you're out of advice for the one who needs help and then what ? just leave the chat ? - that would even make it worse for both of you. In Public chat there's a good chance others may jump in where you got lost",
            "Thank you for this ! Offers like this intend to help but no.. Just no lol",
            "Thank you so much for this.",
            "I think I broke this rule more than once in the past..I'm sorry guys I will think more before leaving a comment.",
            "I agree \"pm me anytime\" is useless, imo if someone was that concerned, drop them a message not with a \"I'm here to help message me anytime\" but ask them what's up, people don't want to ask for help, especially in cases like this where someone's depression might feel silly even though it's not, I'm not sure on how much harm would come of it but possibly just being direct and making the person talk about it, starting with the concerning person might possibly be the way to do it",
            "Wow. I understand that the rules are the rules, but you just painted *everyone* who offers that as either a psycho or a predator. I must say I am feeling like one now because of all the stuff you have said about a simple act of kindness, which is the only reason I ever offered to do so. Sad really. But, the rules are the rules. Now I have some hard thinking to do. Again, just wow...",
            "I wish I would've seen this sooner. I apologize for all the infractions.",
            "I think this is a good rule, thanks. Someone's who's depressed doesn't need to risk being hurt by anyone here potentially offering to talk to them but not following through on it, then maybe feeling even more like no one cares. Besides, perhaps others could use the advice that would otherwise be given in PM's.",
            "Good shout. I would never presume to offer that kind of one-on-one interaction mainly because *I do not want that myself*, and I am pretty sure most of us are in the same boat."

        "content": "Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the \"role model\" rule, but are permitted here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.\n\n-----\n\nOur subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.\n\nWe also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the \"depression\" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.\n\nYSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:\n\n- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact\n\n- \"I'm here to help\" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The \"giving help\" wiki explains more about this.\n\n- Role modelling, i.e. \"achievement\" or \"advice\" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that \"internet culture\" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.\n\n- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).\n\n- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The \"what is depression\" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",

Its not every moment but odd times in the day it just pops into my head. The last exchange I had with my ex made me want to kill myself. It was horrible. I dont fault him in the slightest for being upset and angry. Though I wish he chose his words better. I know what it means to take responsibility for your actions. I had to learn it in the worst possible way because of my own faults. Though every wound that was starting to scab up, opened up again. When someone sees you in the worst possible way and explicitly tells you how youre an awful person. You start to believe it yourself. And Im still fighting and trying to reassure myself that Im not what he says I am all over again. Though today its a losing battle. I dont know what I need today to feel better but Im going to try and figure it out. The sun is out. Its a beautiful day.",

I think I did everything I could to have a good weekend. I think the hardest part is when I'm alone again, travelling back to where I live and the reality of the world I've created for myself. I don't think I'll be able to shake the pain I've caused my ex. The guilt is crippling at times and you have to deal with the reality that they'll probably think the absolute worst of you for the rest of their lives. \n\nBut with that said, this weekend reminded me that I have so many people in my life that still care about me and even if at times like now when I'm writing this I don't much care for myself.

Maybe you doubt your boyfriend\u2019s true intentions. Now we may think that this is the reason we are upset. I mean, we could be. But when it comes to depression, this isn\u2019t the reason, it\u2019s the trigger.\u00a0\n\nWe don\u2019t realize what may come next, so how can we self soothe?\u00a0\n\nAt first, we might be severely upset at our trigger. Still trying to think of logical solutions to solve the problem. Now weather we have solved our trigger or not is quite irrelevant in this matter. Next comes the disproportionate severity of emotions. The sadness is intense. But what\u2019s worse is the anxiety. It goes 0 to 100 real quick. Once your emotions start affecting you in other areas of your life, and you are finding it hard to keep the mask on event at work, that\u2019s when you know you are fucked.\n\nYou keep shivering from head to toe and Oh God the nasty things you say to yourself! By this time you have probably fucked it up with your relationships. Pushing people away because you believe that that\u2019s the source. But when the shivering starts even after the anger stops, that\u2019s when you know, there is no where you can hide.\u00a0\n\nYou desperately want to be home. Not be seen outside. People will think your crazy. You are too much. You feel like a burden. You are afraid of being seen for the weakling you truly are. Because you know that from outside it doesn\u2019t make any sense. So you push people away more. You are scared that people can now see you. And just like your mother taught you, you are afraid that people will stop loving you.\n\nYou do everything you can to keep people out. If they see you, there is the risk of being unloved. Being chosen 2nd or even last, because why would anyone choose you when you can\u2019t even choose yourself.\n\nSo you behave harsh and cold towards others, inherently fucking it all up, making it nearly impossible for anyone to stay near you for too long.\n\nNow what else is left there to do? You get back home and under the blanket. You sink and you sink in the thoughts of how much everyone hates you, how much you inconvenience others, how unlovable you are.\u00a0\n\nYou are unable to scream for help, because that risks showing that you are much worse than others. That you should not be an option for anyone. So all you can hope now, is to sink in your bed, close your eyes, and never wake up. Not for your sake.
