            "I invited a guy like this out camping with a bunch of us years ago. He wanted to rough it by building a hammock in a tree with branches. Only brought a light sleeping bag. He watched a video on youtube, so he was an expert. Woke up early the next morning, it froze overnight, found him huddled next to fire shivering, trying to stay warm.  He learned a lesson that day, don't be stupid.",
            "This is a bizarre rescue. He planned to camp along the creek but somehow lost his shoes. He ended up south of the canyon but was lost. Ive hiked along Lynn creek many times it baffles me that he was lost in the area he was in.",
            "When search and rescue saves you in the woods, do they charge you for the time, effort and equipment needed? Like how the ambulance mails you the bill...",
            "Wild, this is like an afternoon run for some and an epic nearly catastrophic mishap for others.",

            "The media doesn't help in how they report these issues, such as this one here which doesn't even tell us what she actually took, and then uses a stock image of knock off carfentanil pills as the feature image. \n\nDid she take a carfentanil tablet? Or was this accidental cross contamination in something like coke or mdma? This is useful info for the public.",
            "Also weed needs to stop being touted as a gateway drug. Just cuz you smoke weed doesnt mean you have to progress",

            "Cos kids experiment with drugs",
            "Like with sex education, an abstinence only drug education is only hurting people.  \n  \nWe need to teach kids about testing their drugs, having naloxone, starting low and slow, and never using without supervision.  \nThere will *always* be kids experimenting with drugs, ignoring that fact and neglecting to teach them how to be safer about it is killing them.",
            "I work for a health care non profit and the actual most difficult part of this is the politics. \n\nThere are a whole ton of out of touch adults that think that this content should not be for kids, or that it encourages substance use. \n\nThe fact is that kids are ODing at 14, 15, 16 and sometimes way younger than that. They need to see and engage with harm reduction practices AND prevention based messaging for many years before that to truly learn to make safe decisions for themselves. \n\nThe hard sell is introducing this messaging to kids that are 12, 13 because those are the ages when many kids start to get curious. Adults are horrified by this but it's just reality."
