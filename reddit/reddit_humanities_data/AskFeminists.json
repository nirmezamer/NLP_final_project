Some posts will have higher walls than others. Your posts and/or comments may not appear right away or even for some time, depending on factors like account karma, our spam filter, and Reddit's [crowd control](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/15484545006996-Crowd-Control) function. **If your post/comment doesn't appear immediately, *please* do not jump into modmail demanding to know why this is, or begging us to approve your post or perform some kind of verification on your account that will allow you to post freely.** This clutters up modmail and takes up the time we need to actually moderate the content that is there. It is not personal; you are not being shadowbanned. This is simply how this sub needs to operate in order to ensure a reasonable user experience for all.\n\nSecondly, we will be taking a harder approach to comments and posts that are personally derogatory or that are adding only negativity to the discussion. A year ago we made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/ug5kyr/a_reminder_about_the_rules/) regarding engagement in good faith and reminding people what the purpose of the sub is. It is clear that we need to take further action to ensure that this environment remains one of bridge-building and openness to learning and discussing. Users falling afoul of the spirit of this sub may find their comments are removed, or that they receive a temporary \"timeout\" ban. Repeated infractions will result in longer, and eventually permanent, bans.\n\nAs always, please use the report button as needed-- we cannot monitor every individual post and comment, so help us help you!\n\nThank you all for helping to make this sub a better place.",

        "content": "I've recently started to think that misogyny, homophobia, and transphobia are all representation of the same idea: an obsession with traditional gender roles. Therefore, it's not possible for a person to be bigoted in one respect, but not the others. But I wonder if this applies to other bigotries like racism. Are there are any studies or rationalizations for racism and misogyny being inherently linked? ",

            "I don't know if they are inherently linked.  I've known misogynistic people who weren't racist and racists who weren't terribly misogynistic but there is going to be a lot of overlap because the kind of people who hate everyone they view as lesser as a personality is going to discriminate against everyone.  I work in the field of developmental disabilities and you see it with abelism frequently.  The same people who complain about them out in the community, are the same ones who say white lives matter every time BLM is brought up, the same ones who think they should be able to legislate women's bodies and pride parades will scar children.  It's linked but I'm not sure it's inherently so.",
            "Eugenics contains many gendered concepts. White men are considered more masculine in the hierarchy than men of color. So I would definitely say they intersect both for the oppressors and the oppressed.",
            "Yes and no. Countries with very little to no history of racism can still be very misogynistic.",
            "Human cultural evolution away from hunter gatherer into property/landowning is attributed to the start of the patriarchy, seeing as men would need heirs to pass their property onto. This also made women into property or vessels to continue their lineage. Racism was created to justify imperialist expansion and chattel slavery, the ownership and subjugation of other people's to both expand property ownership and accumulate wealth. The gender dynamics of women being property is magnified on non white colonized women/slaves. It's absolutely all connected and understanding this history is paramount to truly understand the world and systems that exist around us today. Economics is a huge factor many overlook in discussions about racism/sexism but is essential.",
            "They are inherently linked in the way crying happens when youre mad or sad or happy. Theyre all expressions of hate which at its core is an unwillingness to know another person and understanding arbitrary personal choice.\n\nRead The Evolution of Beauty by Richard Prum. It goes into a whole deep dive in the first chapter into true sexual selection and how that it should be assumed organisms often are simply chose to be choosy, to express desire, to express choice, and then those choices making these fantastic natural wonders like birds that can make sounds like a cricket using the tips of their feathered wings. It really just takes all of the weird personal choices anyone can make and puts them and anyone who chooses to be harmful and hateful into a new perspective.",
            "White Supremacy and the Patriarchy are inextricably linked in Christian Nationalism. The ones who attack DEIA and hijacked the terms work and CRY as meaning anti-white are the same people outlawing abortion and hoping to move on to contraception and no-fault divorce. Just look at Project 2025 as their playbook.",
            "You might be interested in learning about misogynoir. A lot of ideas of femininity (and therefore even beauty standards) were actually built on racism to begin with.",

        "content": "I\u2019ve heard about a statistical trend that women are increasingly deciding to date men less, either they are choosing to exclusively date women if they are biromantic or bisexual, or they are simply choosing to remain single. First off, do you believe this trend is true and if so, why do you think this is happening?",

            "All of my expertise on this topic comes from TikTok, where the prevailing theory is women no longer need men financially, so their standards looking for a mate are higher. They demand emotional intelligence and a partner who makes their life better than being alone, which is a high bar because alone is awesome.",
            "Its happening because women are no longer dependent on men financially. Women used to choose men to live with because society had made womens survival dependent on having a man. Of course, there has long been social pressure. There is still much chatter that aims to shame a woman if she is alone: why is she alone? What is wrong with her? She must be a man hater? Oh I dont want to be a man hater. If she had a man she would be happy. Why doesnt she want children? What is wrong with her. She is bitter and ugly. Etc., etc.",
            "For me its not a trend. I have decided to live 4B life. Im content with my life and I wish to continue living this way forever. My desire to date a man or even sign a domestic slave aka marriage to a man has been completely diminished. I grow up watching and still watch women suffering at the hands of men directly and indirectly from my family and relatives, friends and of course media. I have no desire to bring a child into this cruel world just for it to carry his mediocre last name and still take care of that man-child. Men have refused to evolve and its ridiculous to lower our standards to accommodate their mistreatment to us for nothing. Im living a life my grandmothers wished they would do but could not due to patriarchy. Being single and independent is a privilege and I will live in that privilege forever.",
            "Im just speaking for myself here and even then, really only hypothetically for the most part. I also need to preface this by saying Im queer but the closest traditional label for my sexuality is bisexual. I am marrying a woman this year and dont anticipate having any other romantic or sexual partners in my life.\n\nIf things did somehow dramatically change, I dont plan on dating or sleeping with men again despite recognizing my capacity to be attracted to them. In part, I feel like I just lean toward women regardless and am more attracted to and satisfied by women. But its also a conscious decision because I feel better seen and understood by women. I feel more comfortable with building a life with another woman. I just am at the point where I cant see myself finding a man Id want to be a life partner and Im not particularly interested in ever having sex with them again either.",
            "I hope it's true. It's not safe for many women to date right now. We lost rights over our own bodies in many states. And unhealthy men are everywhere. Luckily, women are getting more and more educated on how to identify dangerous / unhealthy men and to steer clear of them.",
            "Not sure since I don't date, but most dating apps are comprised of men, and I believe there are more single men than single women. I think women stepped their game up and men didn't get the memo, so women are just deciding the juice ain't worth the squeeze.",
            "I know this isn't really what this post is about but I just have to say I am ssssooooooo tired of men bringing their dating issues to feminists and being like \"fix this for me!\" like bro u not having your choice of women to date isn't a feminist issue. feminism has nothing to do with it. I don't understand. they come here like \"I saw a tweet where a woman said she hated short guys. tell me why women everywhere deserve to continue living\" like broTHER eughhh what?? reopen the schools",
