Some posts will have higher walls than others. Your posts and/or comments may not appear right away or even for some time, depending on factors like account karma, our spam filter, and Reddit's [crowd control](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/15484545006996-Crowd-Control) function. **If your post/comment doesn't appear immediately, *please* do not jump into modmail demanding to know why this is, or begging us to approve your post or perform some kind of verification on your account that will allow you to post freely.** This clutters up modmail and takes up the time we need to actually moderate the content that is there. It is not personal; you are not being shadowbanned. This is simply how this sub needs to operate in order to ensure a reasonable user experience for all.\n\nSecondly, we will be taking a harder approach to comments and posts that are personally derogatory or that are adding only negativity to the discussion. A year ago we made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/ug5kyr/a_reminder_about_the_rules/) regarding engagement in good faith and reminding people what the purpose of the sub is. It is clear that we need to take further action to ensure that this environment remains one of bridge-building and openness to learning and discussing. Users falling afoul of the spirit of this sub may find their comments are removed, or that they receive a temporary \"timeout\" ban. Repeated infractions will result in longer, and eventually permanent, bans.\n\nAs always, please use the report button as needed-- we cannot monitor every individual post and comment, so help us help you!\n\nThank you all for helping to make this sub a better place.",

Therefore, it's not possible for a person to be bigoted in one respect, but not the others. But I wonder if this applies to other bigotries like racism. Are there are any studies or rationalizations for racism and misogyny being inherently linked? ",

            "I wanna recommend you the book Enjoyment Left and Right, by Todd McGowan.\n\n I agree with u/TooNuanced that all oppression is inherently linked together, and I think the phenomenon you're seeking out is what McGowan addresses as the right-wing response to non-belonging.\n\n It's a very Lacanian position but that in itself ties with the recommendations of Butler and to a lesser extent Bourdieu (just transform his habitus into performance and it's the same core message)\n\n Essentially no human ever truly belongs in any category or even self-identity, but the right-wing solution to this crisis of identity is to declare someone who 'truly' doesn't belong so that by you not being them it is implied that you do belong. Your feelings of non-belonging are silenced by the actively violent act of forbidding someone from belonging altogether. In this interpretation, society is quite literally like LeGuin's book Those Who Walk Away from Omelas: the city IS built on the suffering of a child. \n\n  \n A left-wing solution to non-belonging would be to find freedom in that non-belonging. You're only truly self-identified when you're dead, other than that you're always free to be something more, something else, and that exploration not only lets you be more than you already were and in that way be even more yourself than you are, but also you always know that no one else belongs just like you do and that is the common universal ground by which no matter how different you and I are, we are alike in that we are not even truly alike to ourselves. This explains why self-expression is so liberating and such a common unquestioned virtue in inclusive communities, as well as why it feels empty when something that felt like self-expression before starts feeling like just new stereotypes of a recent but already well understood identity.",
            "All oppression is inherently linked together.\n\nAll oppression stems from domination and exclusion.\n\nAny form of oppression validates and exacerbates all other forms of oppression.  And while a strong argument could be made that misogyny is the foundation of transphobia and homophobia, there are people who consider sexuality/gender/race to be either inseparable in understanding oppression or even unifiable as single social construct:\n\n* Patricia Hill Collins: race, gender, and sexuality are interlocking systems of oppression that must be understood as mutually constitutive rather than separate entities\n* Michel Foucault: the same mechanisms that construct sexuality also influence the construction of gender and race\n* Pierre Bourdieu: categories like gender, race, and sexuality are embedded in societal norms and practices, thus becoming internalized by individuals\n* Judith Butler: gender is not a fixed biological or natural category \u2014 further, gender, sexuality, (and race) are subjectifying forces, hegemonic norms, and performative",
            "Both rely on maintaining a hierarchy based on immutable characteristics.",
            "I don't know if they are inherently linked.  I've known misogynistic people who weren't racist and racists who weren't terribly misogynistic but there is going to be a lot of overlap because the kind of people who hate everyone they view as lesser as a personality is going to discriminate against everyone.  I work in the field of developmental disabilities and you see it with abelism frequently.  The same people who complain about them out in the community, are the same ones who say white lives matter every time BLM is brought up, the same ones who think they should be able to legislate women's bodies and pride parades will scar children.  It's linked but I'm not sure it's inherently so.",
            "Eugenics contains many gendered concepts. White men are considered more masculine in the hierarchy than men of color. So I would definitely say they intersect both for the oppressors and the oppressed.",
            "Yes and no. Countries with very little to no history of racism can still be very misogynistic.",
            "It\u2019s the same line of hierarchy, in group/out group thinking but.. it\u2019s not required to have both in one person. White feminists, for example, are incredibly racist. And of course, much of the world, spanning across cultures, is misogynistic",
            "This is a really fascinating take. No notes, I just wanted you to know I had my perspective shifted a great deal.",
            "Idk man. Oppression is the result of post hoc rationalizations a person or group uses to justify benefiting themselves at the expense of others. They are after the fact fictions that reassure us that we are correct to cause suffering to others in the name of self preservation.\u00a0",
            "Yeah, I think linked is the wrong word. It comes out of the same kind of thinking, so they are mutually intelligible to each other, but people can be one without being the other."

            "Sexism?",
            "Subjectification is giving individuals defined, categorized, and given social identities based on societal norms and power structures. Whenever you feel icky being labeled as something, as being reduced from the individual you are to being understood through the lens and framing of that label, it's the ickiness of being subjectified.\n\nIt's what makes radical queerness so freeing. Each and every person is free to relate to and understand others without relying on labels, acceptance regardless of normatively, acceptance of fluidity/change, and understanding of intersectional concerns. Accepting and making space for the uniqueness of individuals, how we relate to each other, respect for our boundaries, and valuing our desires (sexual, romantic, platonic, or alterous).\n\nWhat you may also / primarily be asking about, though, is gender essentialism (or more generally, biological essentialism). Of treating people as what we'd classify their sex as and treating that as equivalent to their gender. While gender is a social construct that can feel vague, transphobic people can feel comfort in relying in their over-simplified understanding of sex \u2014 which is also a social construct (as are all categories and communication \u2014 that doesn't mean these things are meaningless, just that transphobes rely on a motte-and-bailey fallacy of 'gender=sex' to create a false sense of certainty and security from their misunderstanding of gender). \n\nThe 2-minute explanation is that sex is far more complicated than a 1-dimensional binary of \"female\"/\"male\", though that can be a useful simplification if it's understood as a simplification that's on the border of being misleading. Scientists looked for examples of cisnormative, heteronormative rigidity in nature and found countless examples that defied these 'rules' \u2014\u00a0and many of the examples they tried to use to support that in humans are laughably untrue or misleading.\n\nThe short of it is that trying to impose a flawed understanding of gender or sex upon us all and getting mad at those of us who make its flaws become apparent is stupid. But that's what people are currently doing because they are struggling with their own gendered/sexual/racial trauma and it's easier to deflect that their dysphoria is external.",

It's exactly the belief that there are such things as solid identities with permanence such that it makes more sense to talk about the type the person belongs to than the person themselves and their circumstance.\n\nIf it's to them though I think the point would be missed and I would just say they're wanking philosophical.",

Critikal, Ian Kung, podcast bros, jocks, LongBeachGriffy, Tra Rags, etc. People like Markiplier, ProZD, Stephen Fry, and Johnny Depp are people I wouldn't consider bro types."
