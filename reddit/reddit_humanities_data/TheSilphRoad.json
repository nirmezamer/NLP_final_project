        "content": "# Hey travelers! \n\nIf you have any questions about Pokemon GO (anything from basics to specifics of a certain mechanic), ask here! We also have a wealth of information available in historical posts, so try using the search bar. Or [click the Discord link in our topbar](https://discord.gg/thesilphroad) and head to the #boot\\_camp channel - where helpful travelers are standing by to answer questions.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# What is /r/TheSilphRoad?\n\nThe Silph Road is primarily focused on discoveries and analysis related to Pokemon GO, as well as constructing an in-person network of Pokemon GO enthusiasts. General discussion topics (Jokes, stories, a photo of a recent catch) would likely be better suited for another subreddit, such as a general subreddit like /r/PokemonGO, or /r/Pokemon, or a subreddit with a more specific focus, like /r/PokemonGoSnap, /r/PokemonBuddy, /r/ShinyPokemon, /r/PoGoRaids, /r/TheSilphArena, /r/PokemonGOTrades, /r/PokemonGOFriends, or /r/NianticWayfarer. \n\n**Silph Road Content Policy**\n\nThe Silph Road is **heavily moderated to promote civility/courtesy, and high-quality content and discussion.** You can read our full policies in the sidebar, but don't be surprised if a comment is removed for being rude, cynical, or off-topic. We strive to foster civil discussion about the game. We are first and foremost a network of real people, and this network is being built by volunteers! If you simply want to complain or bring something to Niantic's attention, your post would be better suited elsewhere.\n\n**Research**\n\nThe community culture here also attracts the more analytically-minded element of Pokemon GO. Consequently, the Silph Research group was formed to align this brainpower and leverage the massive Silph datasets that the community can gather. We post our findings in infographics, videos, and walls of text on Reddit. Check out the top bar for [links to the current pools](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/13fwpg8/current_raid_quest_rocket_egg_pools/).\n\n**Final words**\n\nFinally, welcome once more! We're glad to have you join us on the Road :) \n\n\\- The Silph Executives -\n\n[Link to other Questions & Answers posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/?f=flair_name%3A\"Weekly%20Megathread\")",

            "Should I be evolving Gigalith now or waiting for an event it can learn Meteor Beam? I figure I can just make a team of 6 Gigaliths to raid and replace them with higher tier Rock attackers (Tyranitar, Rampardos, etc.) as I acquire them.",

Even if we caught him during the comm day he probably won't learn it because it looks like he doesn't have blast burn in his moves list.",
            "Any idea when the next storage increase will be?",
            "I\u2019ve got my spare Rocket Radar from the last event. I have one shadow Groudon 6/7/7, should I go for a second one?",
            "Can solo player do mega raid ( level 37) ? And if not how many players does it take?",
            "For the level 47 requirement of win 30 raids with unique Pok\u00e9mon, if you white out, do you need to bring 6 different Pok\u00e9mon the second time as well? Or does it only have to be the first party to count?",
            "Does anyone know if they've put out a map for NYC Go Fest yet? I'm attending for the first time this year but can't find anything anywhere. I know they put out a map last year but I'm unsure how far in advance that was. Thanks!"
