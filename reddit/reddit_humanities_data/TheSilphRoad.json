        "content": "# Hey travelers! \n\nIf you have any questions about Pokemon GO (anything from basics to specifics of a certain mechanic), ask here! We also have a wealth of information available in historical posts, so try using the search bar. Or [click the Discord link in our topbar](https://discord.gg/thesilphroad) and head to the #boot\\_camp channel - where helpful travelers are standing by to answer questions.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# What is /r/TheSilphRoad?\n\nThe Silph Road is primarily focused on discoveries and analysis related to Pokemon GO, as well as constructing an in-person network of Pokemon GO enthusiasts. General discussion topics (Jokes, stories, a photo of a recent catch) would likely be better suited for another subreddit, such as a general subreddit like /r/PokemonGO, or /r/Pokemon, or a subreddit with a more specific focus, like /r/PokemonGoSnap, /r/PokemonBuddy, /r/ShinyPokemon, /r/PoGoRaids, /r/TheSilphArena, /r/PokemonGOTrades, /r/PokemonGOFriends, or /r/NianticWayfarer. \n\n**Silph Road Content Policy**\n\nThe Silph Road is **heavily moderated to promote civility/courtesy, and high-quality content and discussion.** You can read our full policies in the sidebar, but don't be surprised if a comment is removed for being rude, cynical, or off-topic. We strive to foster civil discussion about the game. We are first and foremost a network of real people, and this network is being built by volunteers! If you simply want to complain or bring something to Niantic's attention, your post would be better suited elsewhere.\n\n**Research**\n\nThe community culture here also attracts the more analytically-minded element of Pokemon GO. Consequently, the Silph Research group was formed to align this brainpower and leverage the massive Silph datasets that the community can gather. We post our findings in infographics, videos, and walls of text on Reddit. Check out the top bar for [links to the current pools](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/13fwpg8/current_raid_quest_rocket_egg_pools/).\n\n**Final words**\n\nFinally, welcome once more! We're glad to have you join us on the Road :) \n\n\\- The Silph Executives -\n\n[Link to other Questions & Answers posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/?f=flair_name%3A\"Weekly%20Megathread\")",

            "Pretty simple question, but I've never done an in-person go fest before. I did one of the in-person Go Fests and got the marshadow. If I buy the global ticket, do I get a 2nd Marshadow or is it replaced with something else?"

            "Question about the Mystery Box spawns: Do you get more if you catch the spawned Meltan, or is the rate of appearance basically the same if you let each one despawn? From a rough estimate opening a box today, it seemed to be the same (about one a minute) regardless of whether I caught the spawned Meltan or let it despawn, but I'm curious if we know any numbers (and whether this also applies to the Incenses). Thanks!",
            "The number in the field research task matches the generation of the starter that it rewards (e.g. \"spin 2 PokStops\" rewards a Gen 2 starter). This is a nice detail, and it makes it easy to remember what the possible reward Pokmon are. Kudos to the designer(s) on that one."

        "content": "When Mega Rayquaza becomes a Elite Raid Boss, we all wondered how its stats are. Are they following Mega Legendary Raids (\\~0.79 CP Multiplier, 22500 HP)? or Elite Raid (1 CP Multiplier, 20000 HP)? Turn out, it seems both of them are wrong, and instead, Mega Rayquaza has both stats combined on the difficult side, with 1 CPM and 22500 HP.\n\nVideo evidence: [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/OtifiwF5ZRI](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/OtifiwF5ZRI)\n\nAs soon as we know its CP, 88200, we can immediately tells it is the same as how much it had in Mega Legendary Raid, aka 22500 HP. But, we knew CP value of raid boss does not associated with CP Multiplier correctly. In order to find out its CP Multiplier, the most straightforward way is let a high HP Pokemon tanks its powerful charged move and see how much it takes.\n\nThis simulation shows how much damage an Outrage from Mega Rayquaza on Blissey: \n\n[https://www.pokebattler.com/fights/attackers/BLISSEY/quickMoves/ZEN\\_HEADBUTT\\_FAST/cinMoves/HYPER\\_BEAM,MOVE\\_NONE/levels/30/ivs/FFC/defenders/RAYQUAZA\\_MEGA/quickMoves/AIR\\_SLASH\\_FAST/cinMoves/OUTRAGE,MOVE\\_NONE/levels/RAID\\_LEVEL\\_MEGA\\_5/strategies/CINEMATIC\\_ATTACK\\_WHEN\\_POSSIBLE/DEFENSE\\_RANDOM\\_MC?includeDetails=true&weatherCondition=NO\\_WEATHER&randomAssistants=0&numMegas=0&numParty=1&monteCarlo=DEFENSE\\_RANDOM\\_MC&seed=1719628042625](https://www.pokebattler.com/fights/attackers/BLISSEY/quickMoves/ZEN_HEADBUTT_FAST/cinMoves/HYPER_BEAM,MOVE_NONE/levels/30/ivs/FFC/defenders/RAYQUAZA_MEGA/quickMoves/AIR_SLASH_FAST/cinMoves/OUTRAGE,MOVE_NONE/levels/RAID_LEVEL_MEGA_5/strategies/CINEMATIC_ATTACK_WHEN_POSSIBLE/DEFENSE_RANDOM_MC?includeDetails=true&weatherCondition=NO_WEATHER&randomAssistants=0&numMegas=0&numParty=1&monteCarlo=DEFENSE_RANDOM_MC&seed=1719628042625)\n\n  \nwhich means it should deals 152 damage if it has CP Multiplier of \\~0.79.\n\nHowever, the result was 181/371 after taking one Outrage from full, which is 190 damage, which aligns better to Elite Raid stats.\n\nSo, how much is the difference between this stats and normal T6? It basically cancelled both Best Friend bonus and non-STAB Primal Boost while it does 20\uff05 more damage to your team.
