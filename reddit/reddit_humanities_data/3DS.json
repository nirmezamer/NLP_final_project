            "I'm seeking some advice, the top screen on my 3dsxl has been fractured. My local Console repair shops says the total Charge is $160.  He says the labor fee is $120. The replacement top screen part is $40 does this seem right or is he trying to fool me.  Figured I'd ask you guys first.",
            "I have been attempting to fix my og 3ds for a little while now after replacing the screen. worked for a couple of days and then stopped working all together, connections are all in place. have narrowed it down to an F2 fuse problem, but cant seem to find it. I was able to find the F1 fuse up by the charging port. Everything that I find is in reference to the DS lite, so now am curious if it is even a potential issue on the 3ds. If anyone has a similar experience, or has an idea on where the fuse would be located, any help would be greatly appreciated!",
            "I have been trying to connect to Nintendo Network using Pretendo/Nimbus. It worked in another 3DS that I have (I precise they both are updated). But now, on my 3 3DS, when I go to the settings, the \"blue internet box\" becomes grey and the connexion with Nintendo Network will fail ! I Couldn't find any answer on the internet and almost nobody talking about it.\nCould you please try to help me ? I am desperate right now ",
            "I swapped to anew SD card last night and it worked fine then, but waking up today it won't connect to the router at all. Gone through the typical troubleshooting of router distance and resetting it (works with every other device). As well as changing the wireless mode to b/g and a/b/g with no change. Totally at a loss.",
            "Should I get a 2 DS XL or 3DS XL?\n\nSo, two friends got me into Pokemon, and Ive become addicted. Im tired of playing on Delta, so I figured Id find a DS to play on via offer up or Facebook marketplace. I was planning on getting a 2DS XL. I never had a 3DS, but I remember thinking the 3d was gimmicky. Does it make that much of a difference?"
