        "content": "Hello!\n\nI moved from a rather old office monitor, which probably was a TN panel, to an Acer Nitro VG271US (IPS) gaming monitor a few months ago. Since then, every time I look at the display for an extended period of time, I have severe eye strain that becomes worse. I can hardly keep my eyes open because they become so dry, red, and stressed out.\n\nI reasoned that the IPS screen must be the problem because I could play games day and night on my previous office monitor without experiencing any kind of eye strain. Then, in an attempt to resolve the problem, I've chosen to get a VA monitor (Samsung Odyssey G5 LC27G55TQBUXEN). It was of little help - same problem.\n\nAdditionally, I experimented with the contrast settings and changed the color mode from sRGB to another, but none of it was helpful. I've run out of ideas. Do I really have no choice except to go and game on a 10+ year old monitor again? This can't be it.\n\nAny ideas what it could be?\n\nTL;DR extreme eye strain with IPS and VA gaming monitors, no issue with old a\\*\\* office monitor somehow, help.\n\nThanks!",

            "I dealt with this exact problem. I switched from an older TN panel to two IPS panels and got intense eye-strain nausea. I eventually solved it, but it took attacking the issue from multiple angles. It won\u2019t be one quick solution. First, you are switching to something your brain is unfamiliar with, so it will take time and exposure to acclimate. Second, for me a big factor turned out to not be screen type (I stuck with IPS) but rather refresh rate. Turning the screens to the same refresh rate and getting monitors with a higher refresh rate really helped. I went up from 60hz to 144Hz. My nausea was majorly reduced by this. I also switched brands from BenQ to Gigabyte with the M32U. Lighting on your desk helps too. Got a desk lamp. The biggest shift, however, was getting my eyes checked. Turns out I needed a new prescription. My eyes had changed. If you wear glasses, go do this. With the new prescription and all the changes, the eye-strain and nausea disappeared. Now I look at my IPS panels all day every day with no issue. Took months to figure out though. Good luck!",
            "Two things.\n\nFirstly, in the case of the Samsung, is it this monitor? [https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/samsung/odyssey-g5-c27g55t](https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/samsung/odyssey-g5-c27g55t) If so, that monitor flickers at a bizarrely low rate and could genuinely give you headaches. I cannot find the same kind of information about your IPS, though; it may or may not flicker.\n\nIn both cases, if the screen is larger than your old one, you may also be sitting too close to it. If your old viewing distance was correct for for 24\" panel, you're probably sitting too close now. You're aiming to be about 2.6-3.6 ft away from your monitor\u2014an outstretched arm's length could be a good guide, depending on your height. If you're too close, you'll start moving your head around too much and causing strain. This goes triple if you tend to lean in closer to the display without thinking. Err towards further away; closer viewing distances aren't recommended for fast motion.\n\nAdjust the height so that either the top of the screen is at eye level, or about 3\" down from the top is at eye level, whatever you find more comfortable. Tilt the monitor so that the bottom is ever so slightly closer to you than the top.\n\nDon't adjust the brightness down too low, either; keep the monitor about as bright as your room. No more, and no less.\n\nFixing ergonomics will usually fix headaches.\n\nEDIT: I seem to have skimmed the samsung review a bit too quickly. It only flickers that way at 0 backlight brightness, for whatever reason. The advice about desktop ergonomics still applies, though.",
            "Flicker. That causes issues for me in many monitors that have pwm controlled backlight. Strobing might be also one cause. It is used to help with motion clarity.",
            "The problem could be because these new monitors have a higher PPI (Pixels per inch) which at default OS settings make your text and UI elements smaller than before and maybe you've also placed your new monitor further from your eyes. Any of these will cause to much eye strain.  \n\nTry these:\n\n1. Increase Windows DPI, try with 125% or even 150%. Don't worry about icons and elements becoming too big, the focus should be on reading stuff without effort.\n&nbsp;\n\n2. In games, increase the size of UI elements. You may also try with a lower resolution.\n&nbsp;\n\n\n3. Place you monitor closer.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnother thing could be the higher brightness. Try lowering it. You should lower it in steps as it take a bit to get used to a lower brightness. Go down up until you notice it affects the output quality and your eyes no longer adjust to this lower brightness.",
            "Have you used a laptop ever in your life for a substantial amount of time and if so did you get eye strain from that? \n\nJust curious because 95% of those screens are IPS.\n\nThis is tough because eye strain can be a bunch of different factors. \n\nWhat about OLED? Most phones these days are OLED so I'm guessing you're ok with that?",
            "Have you tried lubricating eye drops also known as artificial tears?\n\nit help when my eyes are feeling tired and dry, my optician recommends them, also to take breaks where possible, they also told me about the 20-20 rule, about looking at something 20 meters away every 20 mins for 20 seconds? I think that's what they said. Not sure how effective it is but the eye drops help\n\nMaybe it's the refresh rate possibly or syncing of the frames",
            "Are you sure it isn't just a fan running, heat from the gaming PC, AC creating airflow, or something environmental that is causing the issue? Dry eye can cause similar symptoms and people often assume it's the display.",
            "Lower brightness. \nFind a somewhat decent distance between your eyes and screen.\nIf available enlarge the game UI specially those smaller text.\n\nTake a break. Take off your eyes from the screen for 10 minutes.\nJust look to the farthest thing you could find.",
            "IPS (and VA) are not usually, by themselves, causes of eyestrain.  Usually strobing/refresh/flicker is the culprit of eyestrain or headaches.\n\nHave you made sure that you are running well above 60hz, with a source signal that is also above 60hz, with a judder-free framerate?\n\nIf all that is OK, then check to see if your monitor uses low frequency pwm for brightness control, 30khz and above is usually no problem (even for those sensitive to flickering), but lower than that can cause headaches.",
            "So much same old gaslighting in this thread: check your eyes, fan noise, flicker etc. However there could be a massive number of factors at play: bad coating, bad backlight spectrum (which would irritate vision at any color temperature), Vcomm flicker etc. There could be no good blanket answer."

        "content": "#Some Background Information\n\n[Obligatory setup picture]( https://imgur.com/knbtGbv)\n\nHey all, I was the winner of the FO27Q3 in [this recent giveaway.]( https://old.reddit.com/r/Monitors/comments/1cmpuzj/giveaway_gigabyte_aorus_oled_x_rmonitors_be_the/) This is a 27\u201d 1440p QD-OLED monitor with a refresh rate of 360hz; you can read the full spec sheet [here]( https://www.gigabyte.com/Monitor/AORUS-FO27Q3/sp#sp). My previous primary monitor was an MSI MAG27QRF-QD, a 27\u201d 1440p IPS monitor with a refresh rate of 165hz; you can view its specifications [here]( https://www.msi.com/Monitor/Optix-MAG274QRF-QD/Specification), and read RTings\u2019s analysis of it [here]( https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/msi/optix-mag274qrf-qd). Most of my comparisons will be done with the outgoing MSI as my frame of reference, though I also have a Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 to do some *very* surface-level OLED-to-OLED comparisons. I do not possess a colorimeter, so all impressions regarding color quality are subjective. \n\nFor testing how it looks and handles games, I have a PS5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox 360, and of course my computer hooked up to it to test HDR, how it handles lower resolution content, and how the image quality and motion clarity stacks up. My PC build is a Ryzen 7 5800X3D, an EVGA RTX 3080 FTW3 Ultra, 16 GB of DDR4-3200 RAM, and a 2 TB Crucial P5 Plus, so I was not bottlenecked in the hardware department. It\u2019s not the focus of the review whatsoever, but if you want or need to see, [this is my full build.](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/9C2dRK) I was unable to test the KVM switch due to lacking appropriate USB Type-C cables, but I see no reason why it wouldn\u2019t work well. \n\nWhile this monitor was given to me for free in a giveaway, all impressions are my honest thoughts provided to the absolute best of my ability to convey them. I\u2019m not nearly as familiar with monitors as a true enthusiast nor do I have the tools to take objective measurements, so my perspective is very much that of a layman\u2019s; a purely objective, scientific RTings review this is not. \n\n#TL;DR\n\nPros:\n\n* Glossy coating\n* Incredible motion handling\n* Incredible colors with lots of customization\n* Actual functional HDR\n\nCons:\n\n* Text fringing is extremely noticeable\n* Buggy firmware\n* VRR flickering\n* Random shutoffs\n\n\n#Display Quality \u2013 Colors, Motion Handling, Brightness, HDR\n\nPut simply, this is an *insane* display for gaming and content consumption. The colors pop regardless of which profile you prefer, and you can tweak the display profile to your liking whether you want natural or saturated colors. I personally found the display too warm out of the box and wished for more saturation, and I was able to tweak it to my tastes just poking around the OSD for a minute or two. I have no doubt what I found most appealing is highly inaccurate\u2014there\u2019s a slip of paper in the box showing measurements and how carefully the panel was calibrated, and my preferred profile looks nothing like the out-of-the-box configuration\u2014but I enjoy the settings I chose, and it can be reset to its defaults with ease. I couldn\u2019t tell you how accurate the panel *really* is fresh out of the box as I lack a colorimeter, but it has a lot to tweak just using the built-in OSD (which I\u2019ll cover further below). \n\nThe profile I preferred (Movie preset with Vibrance set to 12 and Color Temperature set to Natural) matches my Tab S6 near-identically; most colors appear very similar to my Tab S6\u2019s Vivid mode with the white balance set to its coolest setting, though shades of brown appear a hair redder on my Tab S6. Compared to my MSI, colors in my preferred profile appear noticeably punchier and more saturated. On its default profile\u2014Standard, with a color temperature of Normal\u2014colors appear closer to my Tab S6 than to my old MSI, but duller and with a redder tint all across the board. Compared to my MSI, colors still appear punchier but take on a brighter, more orange-yellow tone. I do not fully remember how I tweaked my MSI, but I believe I use factory settings with the color temperature set to cool; there\u2019s not a lot to customize on my old monitor. I understand this is not a scientific comparison\u2014please use RTings or Monitor Unboxed for that\u2014but I\u2019m hoping at the very least, a reference to an older high-end OLED panel will be useful to someone. \n\nViewing angles are rock-solid. No matter which way I tilt or how off-axis I view the image, colors remain consistent. This is especially pleasant coming from Samsung\u2019s tablet OLEDs, which tend to have bad blue shift on whites (as of the Tab S2 and S6, I\u2019m unsure if newer Samsung tablets fixed that issue.) My MSI *also* has blue shift funny enough, the edges all have a noticeable blue tint most noticeable on whites and solid colors. This is a solid upgrade in that regard. \n\nGigabyte opted for a glossy coating, and for that I cannot give enough praise. I understand the flaws of glossy coatings, and this panel isn\u2019t immune to those flaws\u2014with my curtains open I notice reflections, and while I\u2019ve been unable to test it, I imagine it would be very difficult to use in the roughly-hour-long period in which the sun directly shines through my window in the morning. If you\u2019ll be using it directly facing the sun, it probably won\u2019t be a viable option for you. If, however, you\u2019re like me and you use it in a dimly lit room with curtains, the glossy coating is a *huge* benefit; one of the largest flaws of early OLED monitors is that they used matte coatings that turned blacks into dark grey, negating much of the point of OLED. Blacks on this monitor are black, and colors pop as you\u2019d expect them to.\n\nBearing in mind there\u2019s a lot of subjectivity here, I primarily used Blur Busters to test motion handling; all impressions are by my naked eye. At its native refresh rate of 360hz, it crushed both the UFO test and game test. I\u2019m able to track the scenes with my eyes with no loss of detail. In the persistence of vision test, the image appears fairly clear; there\u2019s still some wobble and the lines can still be seen, but the image is much stabler than on my 165hz IPS panel. I noticed no ghosting whatsoever in the UFO ghosting test. To my eye, the most impressive test was in the moving inversion patterns test; the checkerboard remained wholly intact unlike my IPS panel, and there was no black smear to speak of like I was expecting to see. I also looked at a dedicated black smear test, and once again noticed no black smear at 100% or 50% brightness. I don\u2019t *believe* I noticed any black smear at 25%, but that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t there.\n\nI\u2019d be remiss not to mention the singular flaw I noticed with the panel quality: the text fringing. It was a big problem with first-gen OLED monitors, and it\u2019s still a problem today. I noticed it quite literally the second I got to the Windows login screen, and while I\u2019ve gotten used to it after just over a week of usage, I still notice it. This fringing is inherent to all current OLED monitors that I\u2019m aware of; it\u2019s to do with the triangular subpixel layout, 1440p is simply too low a resolution to overcome it. 4K QD-OLED panels should *not* display fringing to this degree (if at all), but 4K OLEDs come at a hefty premium vs. 1440p, and 4K\u2019s much harder to drive. I cannot emphasize enough that I\u2019ve largely adjusted to the fringing, but I hesitate to recommend this to anyone that\u2019s going to be using it less for content consumption and more for reading, coding, working in Excel, etc. This is one of the best gaming monitors on the market, not an office monitor.\n\nWhile not related to the panel, I also noticed a strange software quirk. Whenever inputs switch\u2014including just simply loading a game in full screen\u2014the color temperature resets, and the monitor has issues with settings tweaks sticking. I\u2019ve already learned to just let it be when playing games, but I notice it immediately when I return to a white screen, and I hope it can be addressed in a firmware update down the line. I\u2019ve also had the monitor turn itself off completely four times. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s Pixel Clean functionality kicking in, as my keyboard got taken out with it, which Pixel Clean doesn\u2019t do. My speakers also pop, meaning power was lost. It immediately turns back on when I push the power button every time, but it\u2019s still a strange issue to run into.\n\nVRR flickering is present, which is unfortunate. I noticed it immediately at night in FFXIV, which I have capped at 90 FPS to keep the heat down in my room. Shutting adaptive sync off made the flicker go away. It\u2019s much harder to notice in brighter scenes, but I personally found leaving VRR off was the best solution as the flicker annoyed me. I\u2019m not super well-versed on OLED VRR flicker as I was initially unaware it was a thing, but to my understanding the higher your frame rate (and the stabler your frame rate), the less likely it is the image will flicker. If you don\u2019t notice it or it doesn\u2019t bug you, keep VRR; if it does bug you, the only fix is to turn VRR off or figure out how to get a higher frame rate.\n\nI did three tests to check for image retention, one of which was accidental: a real-world example in which I left Final Fantasy XIV idle for a few hours and then played the game for a few hours longer, an unrealistic test in which I set Twitter to the darkest mode and let it sit for about an hour, and an accidental test where I left my wallpaper visible for a few hours because I forgot to put my PC to sleep before going AFK for a few hours. I chose FFXIV for its static UI elements: there\u2019s always a string of text and a mini-map at the top right of the screen, a chat window in the bottom left, and hotbars at the bottom of the screen. While the icons on hotbars change based on what job you\u2019re playing, the borders remain the same. It passed the realistic FFXIV test with flying colors; I was unable to notice any retention, even when dragging a grey image across the screen where there were darker static UI elements. I *did* notice retention in the unrealistic Twitter test, in which a grey profile picture and the rectangular outline of a bright white image were left on-screen while dragging a grey image across the screen, but that\u2019s an unfair, worst-case scenario test: any pixel that wasn\u2019t bright white text, that aforementioned image post, or a profile picture was completely turned off. It was also very subtle\u2014I only barely noticed it while dragging a grey image over the screen, but it\u2019s there. It cleared up quickly, and I\u2019d wager it won\u2019t at all be an issue in real-world use even a few years down the line\u2014I had to go out of my way to induce retention. I also noticed a bit of retention on the accidental wallpaper test, but it was even subtler than the Twitter test. The outline of the person in the center of my wallpaper was faintly visible with a grey image in full screen, particularly around her hair on the right side where there\u2019s a lot of contrast between dark shades and white. \n\nI don\u2019t have a way to test actual brightness numbers, but brightness ranges from satisfactory to great in the vast majority of cases. In games (which is really what matters most considering the heavy media focus of this monitor) and on darker windows, it gets exceptionally bright. When displaying a lot white, brightness noticeably drops and can start to ping-pong around; this is of course fundamental to OLED, but it\u2019s still something to keep in mind depending on what programs you use and what the lighting in your room is like. You can rein in the peak brightness to minimize how noticeable the dimming on whites is, but this makes the display noticeably dim. Likewise, there\u2019s a setting that makes peak brightness even higher than default, but that makes the dimming more noticeable. I find leaving it on the medium setting the best compromise as I\u2019m one of those psychopaths that likes to keep the brightness cranked high. I imagine most people will prefer the low setting, particularly in darker rooms.  On the medium setting, its brightness in games, media, dark screens, etc. is noticeably brighter than my MSI. Its brightness in full-screen web browsers, MS Word, etc.\u2014white screens\u2014is noticeably lower than my MSI. \n\nMy attempts at testing HDR in Windows didn\u2019t go the greatest, which was *not* Gigabyte\u2019s fault. To put it bluntly, HDR on Windows is a terrible experience, and most HDR games I own on my PC have broken HDR. Unless you want to use Auto HDR, I find it\u2019s best to just leave HDR off in Windows and enable it on a per-game basis, as HDR on the Windows desktop forces very specific color tuning and appears to mess with either ClearType or the weight of fonts. I hope Microsoft eventually fixes HDR on Windows, particularly as using OLED TVs as a monitor grows in popularity and both miniLED and OLED monitors continue to take off in usage. HDR on Windows was a niche a few years ago, as truly HDR-capable monitors were few and far between, but it\u2019s not a few years ago anymore.\n\nTangent aside, I tried out the default HDR modes in Cyberpunk 2077 and Resident Evil 2 Remake, and I tested Auto HDR in Final Fantasy XIV. In normal gameplay, I couldn\u2019t really tell if HDR was doing anything in Cyberpunk 2077. I chose a spot in the city with several neon lights and waited for nighttime for my comparison. In a side-by-side with my old monitor in Cyberpunk 2077, a few specific details on bright lighting seemed less blown out\u2014clarity on a bright blue neon sign in particular was stronger\u2014but that\u2019s hardly a scientific comparison, and the difference was otherwise subtle. I also tried Resident Evil 2 Remake, but HDR in that game is broken and colors appear very washed out with HDR on. The washing out was most noticeable in dark areas, where there appeared to be a glowing grey filter that made the image appear like you\u2019d expect to see on an IPS monitor. This was very much a bug in the game; turning HDR off made dark areas look as dark as you\u2019d expect. Point being, RE2 was useless for testing HDR despite my best efforts to fix it. \n\nAuto HDR in FFXIV made a *very* subtle difference in one specific zone that I could notice. There\u2019s an overworld zone with a large, black planet in the sky\u2014with HDR off, the entire planet appears pitch-black, and the detail inside of the planet is lost because the pixels don\u2019t illuminate themselves enough. With Auto HDR enabled, there\u2019s more clarity on brighter-lit details inside of the planet that get crushed away with HDR turned off. Outside of that very specific instance, every difference I noticed had to do with the difference in color profiles with HDR on vs. HDR off, as Windows HDR forces warmer color temperatures with de-saturated colors. It\u2019s possible I\u2019d have noticed HDR making a difference in a couple of combat instances with dark arenas (as those are where I notice OLED\u2019s strengths the most), but I was unable to test this as it\u2019s completely impossible to do a proper comparison given the multiplayer nature of combat instances. Beyond that, Auto HDR introduces bright bands to the edges of loading screens, and if it makes any improvements to other zones I was unable to notice them. \n\nGiven the subpar experience that is enabling HDR on Windows, I also tested HDR on my PS5 in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Horizon Forbidden West. Though subtle, HDR *did* make a noticeable difference in Horizon Forbidden West\u2014portions of foliage appear darker, almost as if receiving better ambient occlusion, and I noticed rock textures darkened in some spots. I struggled to notice any differences beyond dark scenes appearing darker, but that\u2019s not the monitor\u2019s fault; I\u2019m not used to using HDR, really, and I\u2019m unsure what to look for, nor can I do a direct side-by-side comparison. The game certainly looked *better* with HDR on, but whether it's a good implementation or not is something I just simply can\u2019t answer. Outside of noticing Aerith and Tifa\u2019s clothing appearing brighter, I could not for the life of me spot the difference between an HDR luminance setting of 0 and 10 in FF7 Rebirth; whether this is because the game has a poor HDR implementation or because my eyes just don\u2019t work is up in the air.\n\nIn short, HDR works on this monitor, and that\u2019s really what I wanted to check for\u2014it\u2019s certified for the lowest HDR specification an OLED can get (DisplayHDR True Black 400), and I know the equivalent IPS/VA cert (DisplayHDR 400) may as well mean your panel can\u2019t do HDR. HDR on this panel works, and because it\u2019s an OLED you\u2019ll see an appreciable difference vs. competing technologies but whether it\u2019s a *good* implementation of HDR or not is something I can\u2019t answer. Windows HDR also leaves a lot to be desired, which is not Gigabyte\u2019s fault.\n\n#Image Scaling\n\nUnderstanding this is a high-end monitor meant for extreme PC gaming and modern consoles, I plugged my Nintendo Switch and my Xbox 360\u2014yes, the old one\u2014into it to see what happened. Specifically, to see how games looked with a resolution mismatch, and more practically to test out the 24\u201d 1080p mode built into the monitor; to access this, you push a button on the bottom right and accept the prompt. Switching to 1080p mode was seamless, and as long as you can live with the giant black border at the top and sides, it\u2019s actually a pretty useful feature to have\u2014both for use cases exactly like this and to squeeze some extra frames out in a game like it\u2019s intended for.\n\n**The following are purely subjective impressions, this section is why my review is being posted right now and not a few days earlier**; as far as I can tell, there\u2019s *some* built-in upscaling, insofar as I can\u2019t tell much of a difference in low-res games between stretched 27\u201d and scaled 24\u201d. If the image looked soft in the normal 27\u201d mode, it looked soft at 24\u201d, too, where there shouldn\u2019t be any scaling happening on the monitor\u2019s end. I\u2019ve done numerous comparisons in games with my Switch and my 360, and games at 27\u201d lack the characteristic fuzzy softness of games being stretched out; I cannot definitively say that I\u2019m not falling victim to the placebo effect as non-native res games are certainly *soft*, and if the image is truly being scaled it\u2019s doing a worse job at it than a TV would, but the image looks better than it did on my old 1440p monitor. Image quality is still *soft* overall, but whether the softness is because of the low base resolution (Switch is usually 720p-1080p, 360 is 720p with hardware upscaling to 1080p) or because of a lack of scaling, I cannot say. I also found some games looked better than others, which has thrown me for a loop while trying to determine if there\u2019s any native upscaling. I\u2019ve tested several games across the Switch and 360, and played Fable 3 to completion, and I\u2019m still as inconclusive on what, if any, scaling exists as I was on the first day I tested out the scaling (or lack thereof.)\n\nThere\u2019s an optional feature called \u201cSuper Resolution\u201d that attempts to sharpen non-native res images, but I find its functionality hit-or-miss as it\u2019s really just a secondary sharpening filter. I found that it generally made Switch games look better, but it introduces definite artifacts around aliased images\u2014this was most noticeable in Red Dead Redemption on my 360, though it also exaggerated the aliasing around my character in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (which I found looked great with and without Super Resolution turned on.) Admittedly, the softer image in scaled games didn\u2019t bug me as much as it normally would. Whether this is the placebo effect in play, if it has to do with how strong the panel quality is, or if there *is* rudimentary image scaling\u2014just not strong enough to truly un-soften the image\u2014is unknown to me. \n\nIf you find image quality is too soft at 27\u201d\u2014personally, I felt most games looked fine (soft, but fine) despite my typical dislike of resolution mismatches\u2014the 24\u201d 1080p mode exists, though I find it made very little difference in image quality in most games I tried. I prefer to play 360 games in 24\u201d mode due to the poor antialiasing and low-resolution textures common in games of that era, but the image doesn\u2019t look markedly different between the two modes. Switch games already tend to have a soft appearance. Games are undeniably softer at 27\u201d, but if they look soft or jagged or even both at 27\u201d, they\u2019re going to look soft or jagged or both in the 24\u201d mode. Just a bit less so.\n\nI pondered whether to leave this section in given this is obviously out of my depth, but I felt it was worth mentioning despite my conclusion being to throw my hands up in the air and ask, \u201cwhy do games look like there\u2019s *some* scaling going on when there clearly isn\u2019t?\u201d At the very least, I don\u2019t miss my old 1080p side monitor (which I dubbed \u201cThe Switchinator\u201d) that I used specifically for Switch games and the occasional romp on the ol\u2019 360 as much as I was expecting I would. If there is absolutely 0 scaling and I\u2019ve fallen for the placebo effect, I\u2019m at least still happy. To sum up my overall thoughts, I find the quality of non-native resolution games worse than the downstairs LG TV (LG has *cracked* scaling), on par with my old 1080p monitor, and noticeably improved over my old 1440p monitor. I think the answer to my confusion lies more in my experience playing scaled games on a TV than anything else\u2014games clearly look better on the TV but clearly look worse on other monitors, so there\u2019s likely *something* going on beyond rudimentary image stretching. \n\nI *do* think the Super Resolution feature could have some uses, with several asterisks. I find it generally looks worse than native\u2014be it scaled or in 24\u201d mode\u2014but it subjectively improves clarity, and in games that have better antialiasing I found it reasonably useful. It\u2019s certainly not for everyone though as it introduces obvious artifacts (ESPECIALLY in games with poor AA), and it should be left off on the Windows desktop entirely. It\u2019s set to 2 by default, and it\u2019s noticeable; I thought my weird, artifacty taskbar icons were a casualty of the subpixel layout struggling with small, low-resolution images, but it was entirely a result of Super Resolution being enabled by default. Unfortunately, turning it off had no impact on the text fringing. You\u2019re making a tradeoff between softness or sharpening artifacts\u2014distant details and softer edges in particular become noticeably clearer, but the sharpening artifacts are *not* for everybody. If you like the look, you\u2019re who the feature exists for. If you don\u2019t like the look and you think old consoles look bad at 27\u201d, use the 24\u201d mode or do what most people would do and plug your 720p device into a TV.\n\n#OSD\n\nI have nothing but good things to say about the OSD\u2019s functionality, but it has some kinks that really need to be ironed out. I\u2019ve discussed the bugs a bit above, and I\u2019ll go deeper into them below after an overview of each feature on the OSD.\n\nThe gaming tab contains a few features primarily aimed at, you guessed it, gaming. \u201cBlack Equalizer 2.0\u201d tweaks how darker colors display, though I find it just washes darks out even on lower settings; to my understanding this feature is *mostly* a holdover from their older IPS panels, but at the absolute lowest settings some people might find it useful. \u201cSuper Resolution\u201d is as described above, an additional sharpening filter intended to make low-resolution images look better; I find its utility questionable on the Windows desktop, but I very subjectively, personally felt that it made Switch games look better. As I said, most people aren\u2019t going to like what it does due to the artifacts it introduces; I leave it off for 360 games for a reason. There\u2019s a \u201cDisplay Mode\u201d setting that makes it report and behave as other aspect ratios and screen sizes, and it doesn\u2019t work if you have Adaptive Sync turned on. You can also turn Adaptive Sync on or off in the Gaming tab.\n\nIn the Picture tab, there are several image presets to choose from, and you can customize each preset (Standard, Racing, FPS, Movie, etc.) to your liking. Each preset primarily just tweaks the color profile and color temperature. You can adjust the brightness, contrast, vibrance (saturation of colors), gamma, color temperature, and color space (native, Adobe, Display P3) after picking a preset as well. \n\nThe Display tab is exactly what you\u2019d expect. You can change inputs, select which KVM input is active (note that there\u2019s also a button on the bottom of the monitor to do this, but I lack a USB C cable capable of display out to test it out), adjust the RGB range, and set your color tweaks in the Display tab per-input. \n\nThe PIP/PBP setting lets you configure picture-in-picture (one input inside of another input) or picture-by-picture (two inputs side-by-side, most commonly seen on professional ultrawides). I briefly tried out both, and while I wish it would let you play audio from both sources (you have to pick and choose), both features worked fine. PIP seems more useful than PBP due to the 16:9 aspect ratio, but I\u2019m sure PBP has niche applications. Note that you can\u2019t use PIP/PBP if you have Adaptive Sync enabled.\n\nThere\u2019s also a Game Assist mode that gives you various enhancements in games. Eagle Eye adds a zoomed-in section of part of your window to the middle of your screen (admittedly, I\u2019m unsure what benefit this actually gives, but it\u2019s there), you can add a crosshair to the middle of your screen, and there are a couple of frame counter/etc. monitoring stats you can toggle on. I could see this stuff being useful for FPS players in particular, but I am not the target audience of any of these as I don\u2019t play competitive shooters or esports titles.\n\nLastly, there\u2019s a dedicated OLED Care setting. \u201cPixel Clean\u201d is probably the most notable feature\u2014it runs for several minutes, during which your screen goes black and it works some magic behind the scenes while the screen\u2019s off. I\u2019m not going to pretend I\u2019m smart enough to know what it\u2019s doing or how it works, but my understanding is that it checks for inconsistencies in pixel brightness and attempts to correct pixels it detects are at risk of degradation. I don\u2019t doubt that it works to be clear, but I\u2019m unsure what it does to work and so I find describing it difficult. You can manually run it after four hours of use, else it runs automatically sometime after you\u2019ve turned the monitor off. It\u2019s also got settings to automatically dim the display if left inactive, to dim static UI elements, to dim the corners, and a setting for brightness stabilization to minimize brightness swings\u2014all of these are enabled by default. I find the corner dimming noticeable at times while web browsing, but in games I\u2019m yet to notice it and every other setting has thus far been unintrusive to my eyes. As I mentioned in the panel quality section, the brightness equalizer is picking your poison: do you want high peak brightness with very obvious dimming, or low peak brightness with subtler dimming? There\u2019s no right answer, and while it\u2019s not strictly a *flaw*, it\u2019s one of the few areas OLED is still weaker than competing technologies. \n\nMy only complaint with the OSD, as I\u2019ve mentioned above, is that the firmware is buggy. My color temperature resets whenever my input switches or the monitor goes to sleep, and changes do not stick. As soon as inputs change (which, again, usually happens just from putting a game in full screen), any change I\u2019ve made gets reset. I\u2019ve been unable to turn the auto-shutdown feature on because of this, as it just gets reset when I shut my computer down or when I switch inputs. I\u2019ve tried applying my settings to all inputs and just to my current input, and in both cases the stuff that gets wiped still gets wiped. I understand this is the most non-issue to ever non-issue, but there\u2019s also a typo in the text prompt for changing to the 24\u201d 1080p mode and back: it says, \u201cPlease close the full-screen display application before activate Resolution Switch\u201d when it should say, \u201cPlease close the full-screen display application before activating Resolution Switch.\u201d Obviously, this is as minor as minor can be, but it does suggest the firmware needed a bit more time in the oven. When the monitor first released (a few weeks before I got my hands on it), OLED Care was also non-functional, which was an issue I didn\u2019t personally run into as I updated immediately; you can grab the firmware update to fix that [here.]( https://www.gigabyte.com/Monitor/AORUS-FO27Q3/support#support-dl-firmware) I mention this only as more evidence that the firmware needs some smoothing out. \n\nI\u2019ve been unable to diagnose or reproduce the shutdowns, too. I forget what I was doing the third time it shut down (I *believe* it was while web browsing or while editing this review), but I was web browsing the first time, playing FFXIV the second time, [and my screen looked EXACTLY like this (just in a different spot in the review) when it shut down the fourth time](https://imgur.com/o5rt3ct). Two shutdowns were after several hours of operation, the third was after no more than an hour or two of use, and the fourth was after about three hours of use. My first guess was that the cause is some form of firmware bug, not a hardware defect, but my inability to reproduce it or even have an inkling when the shutdowns will trigger makes it difficult to speak about or try to diagnose. It\u2019s survived a long Resident Evil 2 session and two even longer Fable 3 sessions without shutting down. It also turns back on immediately when I push the power button; I don\u2019t need to unplug it or reconnect any cables, and it throws up no warnings.\n\nMy only other guess, which I\u2019m beginning to suspect is what\u2019s happening after the fourth and most recent shutdown, is that I\u2019m triggering a safety feature\u2014I favor high brightness, and ambient temperatures in my room are high during the day (around 85\u00b0F by the afternoon, or 29.4\u00b0C; this will only get worse in the summer.) If that\u2019s the case, I don\u2019t understand why it doesn\u2019t either dim itself or at least give a warning first, but I shouldn\u2019t complain about something I can\u2019t confirm is even true. I *will* note that neither the power brick and back of the monitor are warm to the touch when it shuts down, but the display itself\u2014particularly where the screen is displaying white\u2014is warm (not *hot*, but warm) to the touch. It doesn\u2019t *always* shut off when displaying bright whites for extended periods of time, so I can\u2019t definitively say \u201cit\u2019s firmware\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s heat\u201d or anything of that nature. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a hardware defect, else it likely would have shut off during my Fable 3 or Resident Evil 2 binges. My main evidence against this is that it doesn\u2019t shut back off when I turn it back on while staying on whatever screen it was on when it shut off. Either way, even if it\u2019s a safety feature (which I can\u2019t say for certain), it feels worth mentioning.\n\n#Build Quality, IO, Speakers\n\nThe built-in stand is nice, if stiff. I find I need more force than feels comfortable to apply to adjust the monitor\u2019s height, but that could simply be because I\u2019m still treating it as a hyper-delicate product or it could just simply be stiff from being brand-new. Either way, stiffness aside, the stand allows for height adjustment, tilting forwards and backwards, and vertical rotation to be used in portrait mode. Considering the text fringing, I would *not* advise this to buy as a monitor to use in vertical orientation for reading/coding/whatever, but the option is there if you want or need it to do that. There are also RGB LEDs on the back, though I only notice they\u2019re there when my lamp is turned off while in darker areas in games. I have no doubt it\u2019s a cool addition if you\u2019ve got it mounted directly against the wall, but it\u2019s just a bit too far away from the wall to add much to my setup despite my unironic love of RGB.  At least I notice them at all, unlike my MSI; I honestly forgot the MSI had RGB whatsoever until writing this review of its replacement.\n\nThe monitor\u2019s IO is satisfactory. You\u2019ve got two HDMI 2.1 ports, one DP 1.4 port, and a USB Type-C port that supports display out. DP 2.1 would have been nice to see just for future-proofing, but I understand the omission\u2014only Radeon 7000 series cards support DP 2.1 right now to my knowledge, and HDMI 2.1 should be able to do 1440p360 without DSC so newer GPUs don\u2019t *really* miss out. HDMI ports are just in short supply; consoles still use HDMI, and every GPU I\u2019ve owned has had 3x DP out and 1x HDMI out, meaning HDMI ports on both the GPU and monitor side are very coveted. There\u2019s a USB Type-B port to serve as a bridge for firmware updates and to enable access to the monitor\u2019s built-in USB hub, which gives you access to two USB Type-A ports. There\u2019s a KVM switch to swap the hub between the Type-C and Type-B connection, which will be exceptionally useful for me once I own a Type-C cable capable of display out; I have a laptop that would be nice for lightweight 1440p gaming to dump less heat into my room. Unsurprisingly, there\u2019s a 3.5mm jack to connect headphones or speakers to, and surprisingly there\u2019s a second 3.5mm jack specifically for microphones. Considering the KVM switch, I could see the additional microphone jack being useful. You can also control the volume of speakers connected to the monitor through the monitor itself, something my old MSI did not allow. \n\nSpeaker quality won\u2019t blow your mind, but for built-in speakers I\u2019m mostly impressed. Audio is a bit on the tinnier side and lacks richness, but if I didn\u2019t already possess dedicated speakers, the quality\u2019s good enough that I probably wouldn\u2019t have rushed to go buy a pair of speakers for it. Unsurprisingly, the largest flaw in the speakers is a lack of bass; deep tones sound flat and lack punch. I also find that they struggle with louder, deeper tones\u2014think explosions or the noises of spells going off in a game\u2014and numerous overlapped tones, but I\u2019ve used much worse built-in speakers than this and I\u2019d rather have these speakers than have no external audio at all. It probably sounds like I\u2019m whelmed, but I\u2019m not\u2014for built-in speakers they\u2019re genuinely quite good, certainly better than I was expecting. Their weaknesses leave a lot to be desired for more chaotic games in the audio department like FFXIV, but for basic media consumption, they\u2019re shockingly good.\n\nThis leads into the one real issue with the speakers: there\u2019s no way to switch between the built-in speakers and whatever you\u2019ve plugged into the 3.5mm jack. This obviously isn\u2019t a problem if you\u2019ve plugged your own speakers in and/or if you use your front-panel audio for headphones, but I could see it being annoying if you want to plug headphones directly into the monitor and swap between headphones and the monitor\u2019s speakers. The ports are bottom-mounted as well, so unplugging and plugging back in inputs when you want to switch is annoying. \n\n#Final Thoughts\n\nThis is an insane monitor for content consumption, full stop. Games and movies look *gorgeous* on this display\u2014it gets plenty bright, the colors are fantastic, and the infinite contrast of OLED makes even lower fidelity games like FFXIV pop in ways they don\u2019t and never will on IPS panels. If you\u2019ve never used an OLED before, it\u2019s hard to explain just how big of a difference the perfect blacks make; not being subject to IPS glow in dark scenes or on black loading screens just hits different in a way that words alone struggle to convey. Even in old, low-fidelity games like Fable 3, the panel manages to wow me any time I go into a dark cave or whatever and see perfect darks with no IPS glow. The only panel better than a 1440p QD-OLED for gaming and content consumption would be a 4K QD-OLED, as 1440p\u2019s pixel density is just too low to overcome the weird subpixel layout for text rendering.\n\nIt's not good for office use, however. That's not its intended use case, and I fully understand that it's not its intended use case, but it still bears repeating. The text fringing is very noticeable, and brightness plummets in bright-white windows. I\u2019ve made my peace with the fringing, but it still bugs me. There\u2019s also the ever-present risk of burn-in, which would be exacerbated by wholly static window usage. There are hardware and software mitigations in place, yes, and you can perform mitigations of your own (move windows around, hide the taskbar, lower the brightness, etc.) but it\u2019s impossible to say how effective they\u2019ll be one, two, three, five years down the line, and if you\u2019re in Excel or Visual Studio or whatever 8 hours a day 5 days a week no amount of mitigation will stop the inevitable. This is a 10/10 panel for gaming and media consumption, but it\u2019s best to look elsewhere if you\u2019re shopping for something to upgrade your work monitor to. \n\nI\u2019m curious to see how it will hold up for my use. Most of my game time is spent in Final Fantasy XIV, which has a very static UI, and I often use my computer for several hours daily. I\u2019ve taken a few steps to minimize the risks: I\u2019ve hidden the taskbar, I try to keep programs I know I\u2019ll be using for hours on end like Chrome or Discord on my side monitor instead of on my new one, and I\u2019ll probably be swapping to an all-black wallpaper in the next few days if a firmware fix isn\u2019t pushed to make settings changed stick. I still put a lot of time into FFXIV, however, and I\u2019m likely to have a lot of power-on hours\u2014OLED degrades in more ways than just burn-in. Burn-in is, after all, simply uneven degradation; if you were into the smartphone hobby circa 2015, you\u2019re likely very aware of OLED color degradation (especially on shades of white). I remember old comparisons of Galaxy S3-S4s and, if memory serves correctly, Lumia 950s where a less-used model compared to a heavily-used model of the same phone would display *completely* different shades of white. Modern OLED is much better about this to my knowledge, but it\u2019s something you need to worry about on OLED that isn\u2019t a concern at all on other panel technologies. \n\nAs long as you won't mind the text fringing, I can wholeheartedly recommend the FO27Q3. It\u2019s a marked upgrade over my previous monitor, and my old MSI is still among the best non-miniLED IPS has to offer. I don't think VA or even top-end miniLED would be nearly as big an improvement in most regards. Every time I go into an instance in FFXIV with a dark arena, or I walk into a cave in a game, or really *anything* at all that displays the strength of OLED, I\u2019m wowed all over again. I can only imagine what it\u2019s going to be like when I finally get around to playing something like Alan Wake 2 or Resident Evil 4, neither of which I yet own. Games are forever going to look awesome from now on, regardless of how old they are or what platform they\u2019re on, and in that regard I\u2019m as happy as can be. It\u2019s going to shine even more when I upgrade from the 3080 and can *really* let the 360hz refresh rate rip, and I think *that\u2019s* really the appeal of this panel\u2014it\u2019s awesome now, and it\u2019s going to get even more awesome when better hardware becomes available to really make use of everything it can do. \n\nThere are of course things I wish were better, most of which are related to the firmware\u2014the color temperature constantly resetting is annoying, and the random shutdowns *really* need to be fixed if they\u2019re firmware-related\u2014but this panel does exactly what it says on the tin and it does it with flying colors. The insane motion clarity of OLED combined with its high native refresh rate makes it an excellent esports monitor, the inherent perfect blacks and self-illuminated pixels combined with the color properties of OLED make it an excellent monitor for content consumption and gaming with the highest possible fidelity, and it\u2019s just all-around a solid panel for literally anything that isn\u2019t text-focused with highly static elements. I can confidently recommend this monitor for anyone looking for the absolute best for content consumption and gaming\u2014it won\u2019t disappoint.",

Strangely, I can't find any information about this monitor on Google or any other place. It seems to be a QD-OLED monitor exclusively provided by Acer for China. Its specifications are similar to the Alienware AW3225QF. Does anyone have more information about this monitor?\n\nwell,here's the link of that pre-oreder page:https://item.jd.com/10106590581175.html#product-deta\n\n",

            "I would assume this is the same 4k/32\" qd-led panel that everyone else is using.  So baseline performance should be similar, and then it's just a question of whether acer does a good job with fit/finish/firmware.",
            "Shame its curved\n\nI assume this is same as the new MSI oled and msrp is similar as well but there is currently promotion",
            "Seems similar to this? https://tftcentral.co.uk/news/acer-predator-x32-x3-announced-with-a-32-4k-dual-mode-240hz-480hz-oled-panel",
            "Only $900?",
            "thats true,definitely wonder how acer would do with it,and still..why China only?Maybe it's an early test for the market i guess:\\\\",
            "well,i personally rarely tried any cured monitors,so i do wonder why people hate about it :\\\\",
            "This is just a naming similarity. The actual product specifications are more like Alienware's AW3225QF, but without Dolby Vision.",
            "according to exchange rate,yes",
            "Or it might be pricing, if there is a china-market specific competitor that acer wants to compete with at a certain price point without canniballizing their sales in the west.",
            "Its good when it works but you have to be in that one spot where the curves converge to get maximum effect. Any deviation from that spot makes image worse than flat screen so its really annoying and tiring on the body. Low viewing angles etc"

        "content": "I was fortunate to win the LG Ultragear 32GS95UE OLED Gaming Monitor from a giveaway on the r/Monitors subreddit. After using it for a couple weeks, I\u2019m excited to share my first impressions and experiences with this impressive piece of technology.\n\nThe LG 32GS95UE features a sleek, modern design with a minimalist aesthetic. The branding-free front as well as the simple \"non-gamer\" stand give it a sophisticated look that fits well into any setup. The build quality feels premium, with sturdy materials and an adjustable stand that allows for height, tilt, and swivel adjustments.\n\nThe 32\u201d 4K 240Hz OLED display is truly a marvel. The colours are outstanding, and the level of detail is remarkable, making gaming, media and professional work a visual delight. The 240Hz refresh rate ensures smooth motion handling, and the response time is excellent, providing a competitive edge in fast-paced games.\n\nI\u2019ve tested the monitor with a variety of games, including Call of Duty: Warzone, Octopath Traveler, Hellblade 1 and 2, CS2, and Valorant. Here\u2019s a breakdown of my experience:\n\n* **Call of Duty: Warzone**: This is the first game I tried. The 4K resolution combined with the high refresh rate delivers an incredibly immersive experience. The resolution bump coming from a 1440p monitor is great, making everything clearer and more pleasant to look at.\n* **Octopath Traveler**: The vibrant colours and deep blacks of the OLED panel bring the game's beautiful art style to life.\n* **Hellblade 1 and 2**: The high dynamic range (HDR) enhances the atmospheric visuals, making the dark, moody environments more captivating.\n* **CS2 and Valorant**: The high refresh rate and low response time are perfect for these competitive shooters. The motion clarity and lack of ghosting give me a noticeable advantage.\n\nMy experience gaming has been nothing short of amazing. The colours, resolution, HDR, it all makes gaming so much nicer. My only issue is that I now have to upgrade my GPU as my 3080 can't push as many frames as it did on my 1440p monitor haha. I'll be waiting for the 50 series NVIDIA cards.\n\nAs someone who does a fair amount of programming, I\u2019ve found the text clarity on this monitor to be excellent. The 4K resolution at 32\u201d provides ample screen real estate for multitasking and detailed work. Reading text is comfortable, and the high resolution ensures everything is sharp and easy to read. I also haven't noticed any text fringing while using the monitor.\n\nThe 1080p 480Hz mode using the Dual Mode feature is a great addition for competitive gaming. Although the difference from 240Hz to 480Hz is subtle, I did notice it while playing CS2 and Valorant where I was able to achieve enough frames. Although I did prefer the quality bump at 4K vs the refresh rate bump at 1080p, this is a very welcomed feature for those that want it. Switching modes is seamless and can be done on the fly with a button on the underside of the monitor.\n\nI was a little surprised at the built-in pixel sound speakers, as I expected something that was a 1 or 2 out of 10 considering they're built-in speakers, but they're actually good enough that I wouldn't mind using them instead of my dedicated speaker setup if I'm watching YouTube videos. Definitely a plus for those that don't have speakers as part of their setups. My other two monitors don't have built-in speakers so this is a nice addition.\n\nI know the matte finish is a controversial topic on this subreddit, and while I am definitely someone who would pick a glossy screen over a matte one, it is in no way a dealbreaker on this monitor. I'm loving the screen quality and HDR performance so much that I sometimes now watch movies at my desk instead of the home theatre when I don't feel like getting up after a day's work.\n\nBrightness is another divisive topic around here. Personally, this monitor, as well as my 27GR95QE, are plenty bright enough, usually running them below 70% when viewing SDR content. Though one improvement I would like to see in future iterations of this OLED monitor is increased peak brightness for an even better HDR viewing experience (not that I am disappointed now, HDR movies look so so good on this, but the more, the better :D).\n\nI am very happy with this monitor and look forward to using it for the years to come.\n\nI know this isn't the most detailed review and this is more of a first impressions type of review, as I am no expert in evaluating monitors, but I'll definitely be happy to answer any questions below (I am on holiday so might I might not reply quickly). For reference, I'm also using a 27GR95QE and a 27GL850 alongside this new monitor.\n\n[Images of setup](https://imgur.com/a/xHXlXD4)\n\n**TLDR**: The LG 32GS95UE OLED Gaming Monitor is an outstanding piece of technology that excels in both gaming and productivity. The combination of 4K resolution, 240Hz refresh rate, and OLED quality makes it a top-tier choice for anyone looking to upgrade their setup. Whether you\u2019re gaming, working, or just enjoying multimedia content, this monitor delivers a premium experience that\u2019s hard to beat.",
