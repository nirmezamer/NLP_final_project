            "Im not joking what must be going thru Dres head introducing that song? Is he just thinking thank god I came up before the internet or does he really block out the fact that he shouldnt be throwing stones",

            "Dr. Dre seems to be one of the only cases of a person that's too influential or iconic to bring down, only way to do it would be with an investigation like Diddy. Seems like even Kendrick is guilty of turning a blind eye for someone he looks up to.",
            "Dr. Dre beat his girlfriend so hard that she had to get plastic surgery. No wonder they call him the Doctor ",
            "uj for a second this is for sure hypocrisy. Kendrick has this thing going about platforming abusers as some kind of redemption, but the people he chooses are ones who have not done the work to be better and earn back the trust of the public. I cant pretend to know the interior lives of Kodack or Dre, but I do know they havent done much to publicly address the individuals theyve hurt. Dee Barnes obviously doesnt forgive Dre, and that lame ass ghost written apology he put out around when his movie was popping off doesnt cover it tbh.  \n\nI get that this was supposed to be a West Coast reunion, but this combined with the big steppers rollout makes me think Kendrick prioritizes the concepts of his artistic projects over his own ethics",
            "Sounds like you forgot about Dre\n\nBut seriously, dude has made more off selling headphones than his own music",
            "What the fuck is cancel culture, dawg\n\n- Kendrick Lamar, N95",
            "You know what fuck this sub and its dog shit automod messages. NBAcirclejerk was so much better once that shit was gone. \n\nIts like wadding through shit just to find something funny.",
            "Dre has a whole Wikipedia section titled violence against women dawg wtf is Midrick on ",
            "It was never about him caring about weird cases or victims, it was always about him hating Drake."
