            "I\u2019m not joking what must be going thru Dre\u2019s head introducing that song? Is he just thinking \u201cthank god I came up before the internet\u201d or does he really block out the fact that he shouldn\u2019t be throwing stones",

            "Dr. Dre seems to be one of the only cases of a person that's too influential or iconic to bring down, only way to do it would be with an investigation like Diddy. Seems like even Kendrick is guilty of turning a blind eye for someone he looks up to.",
            "Dr. Dre beat his girlfriend so hard that she had to get plastic surgery. No wonder they call him the \u201cDoctor\u201d \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
            "uj for a second this is for sure hypocrisy. Kendrick has this thing going about platforming abusers as some kind of redemption, but the people he chooses are ones who have not done the work to be better and earn back the trust of the public. I can\u2019t pretend to know the interior lives of Kodack or Dre, but I do know they haven\u2019t done much to publicly address the individuals they\u2019ve hurt. Dee Barnes obviously doesn\u2019t forgive Dre, and that lame ass ghost written apology he put out around when his movie was popping off doesn\u2019t cover it tbh.  \n\nI get that this was supposed to be a West Coast reunion, but this combined with the big steppers rollout makes me think Kendrick prioritizes the concepts of his artistic projects over his own ethics",
