        "content": "#Devoted Rejects,  \n\nHere are the patch notes for our latest update, Secrets of the Machine God, which just went live on Steam and it will shortly be available on our other platforms.\n\n# New Mission: Clandestium Gloriana\nThe new mission, Clandestium Gloriana (previously mentioned as Atelium Foundryplex Omega V), sees our brave strike teams venture deep into the forgotten heart of Tertium for a rendezvous with a mysterious new character. The players are tasked with reawakening a long-dormant Adeptus Mechanicus Foundryplex, one of the fabled, lost Machinaria Gloriana. This level presents a new, frozen environment, sees a mission-giver accompany the strike team within the gameplay space and supports greater replayability with a new, variable end event. We\u2019re delighted with how it\u2019s turned out and we hope you\u2019ll enjoy playing it as much as we did making it!\n\n# New In-Game Event: Test Your Metal\nClandestium Gloriana\u2019s awakening brings greater resources to the war effort. New weapons have been added to the armoury. Take up these arms and smite the enemies of the Imperium.\n\nUse the Bolt Pistol, Double-Barrelled Shotgun, Shock Maul or Pickaxe to kill Elite and Specialist enemies. Qualifying kills from all party members count.\n\nThis event will start on Thursday, 27 June. The rewards will be Ordo Dockets, Plasteel and Diamantine.\n\n[Test Your Metal Rewards - Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/fatshark/original/3X/9/0/900f6b8817c1d48b457a29d2a5eaa95b3f415533.png)\n\n# New Weapons\n## Message from Hadron:\n\nListen up, Varlets. The awakening of the Clandestium Gloriana has opened new supply lines, increasing the arsenal available to the Rejects. All praise the Omnissiah.\n\nWith these sacred tools, available to requisition from Brunt\u2019s Armoury, the Heretics will find no respite from our blessed fury. Take up these arms and deliver unto our foe a fate deserving of such base treachery.\n\n# **Availability**\nThe Pickaxes will be available for Ogryns, while the Shock Mauls, the Double Barreled Shotgun and the Bolt Pistol will be available for the Veteran, Zealot and Psyker classes.\n\n# Pickaxes\nOgryns\u2019 first two-handed weapon! Taking brutality and force to a new level.\n\n* Branx Pickaxe - Heavy\n* Borovian Pickaxe - Medium\n* Karsolas Pickaxe - Light  \n\nFor these weapons, we really wanted to lean into the differences in the Heavy, Medium and Light between marks in terms of speed, handling and purpose.\n\n* **Heavy** is Strikedown focus, using the pickaxe as it was meant to be used on heretics skulls and with a powerful bash attack as weapon special.\n* **Medium** is somewhere in between both in terms of handling and damage, with a mix of Strikedown and vanguard attacks and a hook pull as a weapon special that sets up enemies for big damage.\n* **Light** is horde control focus with wide sweeps and more cleave, and a pull weapon special like the medium pickaxe. These weapons have big damage and impact.\n\n# **Shock Mauls**\nThe perfect Warhammer 40,000 riot gear, an electric weapon that stuns and adds a shocked status to enemies.\n\n* **Agni Mk Ia Shock Maul**  \n* **Indignatus Mk III Shock Maul**  \n\nTwo words: stun and impact. They are versatile weapons with rich movesets; the mark difference relates to the moveset variance, with the Agni MK la having more immediate access to Strikedown attacks and the Indignatus Mk III having delayed access to a looping heavy Strikedown chain.\n\nThe weapon special is a \u201ccattle prod poke\u201d that adds damage over time and keeps enemies stunned.\n\n#Double Barreled Shotgun\nA very close range and nervous shotgun that inflicts brutal damage and impact.\n\n* **Ironhelm \u201cHacker\u201d Mk IV Assault Shotgun**  \n\nWith fast handling and movement speed, this shotgun supports Assault-style game play.\n\nAccess the bracing stance with the secondary action to shoot both barrels at the same time (for maximum carnage). The weapon special is a weapon bash combo.\n\n#Bolt Pistol\nAn iconic Warhammer 40,000 weapon, mobile and perfect to lead an assault.\n\nGodwyn-Branx Pattern Bolt Pistol\nBetter handling and faster reload, but more difficult to control than the Boltgun version. The weapon special is a bash, which can be combo\u2019ed into a hipfire shot.\n\n#Features and QoL  \n\n#Mission Updates from Community Feedback\nWe\u2019ve made a number of changes to existing missions in this update based on player feedback. The detailed changes are listed further down.\n\n#Updated Crosshairs\nCrosshairs have had a two-fold issue:\n\n* They were in general larger than what the spread system (which handles how much a shot will deviate from where the barrel is pointing) was using.\n* They were affected by the Field of View and HUD Scale user settings.\n\nThe combined effect of this was that at default settings shots would hit approximately within the centre 50-75% areas of the extents of any given crosshair, meaning that the crosshair itself was not a reliable way to gauge the extent of the weapon spread.\n\nAdditionally, increasing the Field of View would make the crosshair appear larger, while decreasing the FoV, especially when combined with lowering the HUD Scale, would make the crosshair appear smaller.\n\nFixing the first issue meant that several crosshairs now started to overlap with hit markers, which led to redesigning most of the crosshairs, as well as the hit markers themselves.\n\nHit markers are now slightly smaller and have an outline to be easier to see against light backgrounds. The major changes are that we now use a different hit marker for weakspot hits, to differentiate them from critical strike hits.\n\nWeakspot hit markers are now doubled up, and like non-weakspot hits colour coded according to the type of hit (white = standard, blue = no or reduced damage, orange = critical strike, red = kill).\n\nDev Note: Previously both weakspot hits and critical strike hits were coloured orange.\n\n[Standard Kill - Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/fatshark/original/3X/3/8/38653ada3582bc27907cc6feb1a093355990d7f6.jpeg)\n\n[Weakspot Kill - Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/fatshark/original/3X/a/2/a2108887c730abc64cfb826cc1cc8097419d6d2d.jpeg)\n\n[Standard No Damage - Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/fatshark/original/3X/f/5/f5f992483759210a723733cb822e0d732373a8f8.jpeg)\n\n[Weakspot No Damage - Image\n](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/fatshark/original/3X/c/7/c76deed6e9b4439f6aa1f0b9dd889a2637b06db4.jpeg)\n\n\nThe major reason for this change is primarily due to several Blessings and Talents being triggered by either weakspot hits or critical strikes, and this change should hopefully make it easier to understand which hits should (or shouldn\u2019t) trigger a specific bonus. Plus it\u2019s satisfying knowing that the heretic killed died from a masterful blow to the head.\n\nCrosshairs have been categorised in several categories, each with their own style of crosshair that always leaves an empty space for hit markers no matter how high or low the weapon\u2019s spread is.\n\nAll weapons have been categorised into one of these categories and by extension hit markers:\n\n* \u201cRapid Fire\u201d for accurate single-shot or burst weapons, such as Infantry Lasguns or Headhunter Autoguns.\n\n* \u201cAssault\u201d for mid-range high rate of fire weapons, such as Infantry Autoguns or Shredder Autopistols.\n\n* \u201cHeavy\u201d for slow-firing high-damage weapons, such as Quickdraw Stubrevolvers or Plasma Guns.\n\n* \u201cSpreadshot\u201d for pellet weapons, such as Combat Shotguns or Ripper Guns.\n\n* \u201cTorrent\u201d for inaccurate high-volume fire weapons, such as Twin-Linked Heavy Stubbers or alternate fire for Braced Autoguns.\n\n* \u201cFlamer\u201d for, well, Flamers.\n\n* \u201cDot\u201d for melee weapons and Force Staves.\n\n[Old Assault Crosshair - Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/fatshark/original/3X/5/1/51ad696fa7a644cd709d3c1b2af88efff3949f03.jpeg)\n\n[New Assault Crosshair - Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/fatshark/original/3X/0/b/0b6cefa75d6d9378a5907e91926d231ae5fa1409.jpeg)\n\n[Old Heavy Crosshair - Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/fatshark/original/3X/e/8/e81e19883f8d050d0676851743fbd1a22212f12a.jpeg) \n\n[New Heavy Crosshair - Image\n](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/fatshark/original/3X/a/e/ae6835502d744bcc4cb78c796da00b49c0471e81.jpeg) \n\n\nIn addition, there are a few new user settings to tweak and change the look and behaviour of crosshairs and hit markers:\n\n* Turn on/off crosshairs, aim trajectories, and/or hit markers.\n* Increase the time for which hit markers are shown.\n* Override all crosshairs with a specific style.\n*The \u201cFlamer\u201d type is not available for the override.\n\n[New Options for Crosshairs - Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/fatshark/original/3X/c/f/cf76a1163c27e1da7547901e1ad0aaa15d1bc738.jpeg)\n\n\n#Known Issues for Crosshairs\n\n* \u201cCrosshair Type\u201d user settings don\u2019t revert when using the \u201cReset to default settings\u201d button.\n* Force Staves incorrectly have their crosshairs overridden when using anything but the \u201cWeapon Specific\u201d option of \u201cCrosshair Type\u201d.\n\n#Cosmetic Headgear Voice Preview Option\nPlayers can now preview the voice of any headgear which their operative can equip, including ones that modulate their voice. This preview is currently available by going into the Inspect to Show on Operative menu.\n\n[Cosmetic Headgear Voice Preview - Image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/fatshark/original/3X/6/b/6b56ac9e9eb0b341fba5d6f7f2b18cbdcdeb8109.jpeg)\n\n#Sound Changes to Footsteps for Prosthetic Leg Cosmetics\nThe footsteps of your character while wearing a lower body cosmetic item that has a prosthetic will now sound different, to better match the visual and be closer paired with your actual gait. These items have a small icon on the item preview tiles, as well as a clarifying text in the item details.\n\n**Dev note:** This is more noticeable in active gameplay/first person view, while footsteps in general are more subdued in the Mourningstar/third person view.\n\n#Bug Fixes and Changes\n\n#Weapon Changes\n#Recon Lasguns\n\nThe Recon Lasguns, while having a really iconic and fun playstyle, failed to perform adequately due to a mix of low punching power and struggling ammo economy, especially when rising up in difficulties.\n\nWe performed a balance pass on every mark, strengthening their identity as assault, almost recoilless full-auto rifles while also inserting some peculiarities on each mark, while keeping some of their weaknesses (such as difficulty to pierce Carapace armoured enemies).\n\nThe MkII version received a significant base power bump, remaining a good all-rounder for the category.\n\nThe MkVId mostly maintained its previous base power profile, but received hefty buffs in fire speed and magazine size to lay down suppressing fire and reward keeping the aim on the targets.\n\nFinally, the MkVIIa place as the heavy variant was confirmed by a further increase in its base attack and impact power values. To help with its increased ammo consumption per shot compared to the other two marks, we significantly increased the total ammo in reserve.\n\nWe will monitor the performance of the weapons and your feedback after the changes to evaluate possible additional adjustments!\n\n**Detailed changes:**  \n\n* All Marks\n* Slightly increased the hipfire spread.\n* Upgraded the Dodge, Sprint and Aimed Movement templates to the Assault and bespoke Recon Lasgun profiles.\nDev Note: This will make the weapons more suited for agile engagements compared to other rifles like the Infantry Lasguns.\n\n* Accatran Mk II Recon Lasgun\n * Attack power distribution {40,70} to {78,108}\n * Armor Damage Modifier against Maniac 0.75 to 0.8 (near), 0.65 to 0.7 (far)\n * Armor Damage Modifier against Infested and Unarmoured 1.25 to 1.0 (near)\n * Armor Damage Modifier against Flak down to 0.75 (near), 0.5 (far)\n * Armor Damage Modifier against Unyielding down to 0.75 (near)\n * Impact modifier against Unyielding upped to 1.0 (near), down to 0.5 (far).\n* Accatran Mk VId Recon Lasgun\n * Set bespoke power distribution values:\n * Attack = {40,70} (unchanged)\n * Impact = {1.0,2.0} (unchanged).\n * Armor Damage Modifier against Unarmoured 0.9 to 1.0 (near).\n * Armor Damage Modifier against Maniac 0.6 to 0.8 (near).\n * Fire rate from 16.77 to 20.00.\n * Magazine size from 60-120 to 100-200.\n * Removed one magazine in reserve (60x5-120x6 to 100x4-200x5).\n * Reload and Wield speed time slowed by 20%.\n* Accatran Mk VIIa Recon Lasgun\n * Set bespoke power distribution values:\n * Attack = {95,165} (around 33% buff)\n * Impact = {1.5,3.0} (around 10% buff).\n * Armor Damage Modifier against Flak 1 to 0.75 (near).\n * Armor Damage Modifier against Unyielding from 1 to 0.75 (near).\n * Added two magazines in reserve (60x5-120x6 to 60x7-120x8).\n\n\n#Achlys Mk I Power Maul\nThe power budget of the Ogryn Power Maul (aka \u201cPaul\u201d) was very unbalanced towards its Special activated attacks, while the rest of the moveset remained anaemic. This made spamming Light activated attacks often the optimal attack rotation for the weapon, leading to a very monotonous (and still underwhelming) experience.\n\nWe rebalanced the whole moveset, significantly increasing the usability of both standard Light and Heavy attacks while leaving the stagger and power of activated attacks mostly unchanged.\n\nWe also added a new Vanguard Light attack performed during a Slide, and new attack chains which will reward mastering the weapon by performing the correct attack strings in different situations.\n\nFor example, players could lead with an activated Heavy 1 into a flurry of Light Strikedowns (Special activate > H1 > LFollow-up > L1 > L2 > repeat) to quickly pile on damage on priority targets while keeping players safe due to the initial staggering explosion; or clear crowds by reaching the Light 3 > Light 4 attack loop through Heavy attacks or the brand new Light slide attack (H1 > H2 > L3 > L4 > L3 > L4 > \u2026 / LSlide > L4 > L3 > L4 > \u2026).\n\nWe will monitor the performance of the weapon and player feedback after the changes to evaluate possible additional adjustments!\n\n**Detailed changes:**\n\n* Light follow-up attack from Heavy 1 changed from Vanguard to Strikedown damage profile\n* Heavy 2 now chains into Light 3 / Heavy 1 (instead of Light 1 / Heavy 1)\n* Added an attack start from Slide, chaining into Heavy 1 and a new Light slide attack with Vanguard profile (same as Light 3 / Light 4):\n* The new Light slide attack chains into Light 4 / Heavy 2.\n* Lowered the total action time of the Special activate action from 2.6 to 1.2 seconds.\n\n**Dev Note:** Activation time will remain unaffected at 0.8 seconds, but it will be easier to chain into the new Light slide attack.\n\n* Aligned windup time for all Heavy attacks to 0.6 seconds  \n\n**Dev note:** \u201cWindup time\u201d is the minimum amount of time an Heavy attack needs to be charged before being released.\n\n* Light 1 / Light 2 Strikedown profile:\n * Changed stagger duration from {0.1, 0.5} to {0.1, 2.5}\n * Changed inherent finesse boost multiplier from 0.25 to 1\n * Armor Damage Modifier against Maniac from 0.5 to 0.75\n * Armor Damage Modifier against Carapace armour from 0.25 to 0.5\n * Armor Damage Modifier against Flak armour from 1 to 0.9\n * Equalised finesse boost to 0.5 against all armour types.\n* Light 3 / Light 4 Vanguard profile:\n * Armor Damage Modifier against Flak from 0.75 to 0.9\n * Armor Damage Modifier against Unyielding from 0.75 to 0.8\n * Armor Damage Modifier against Maniac from 0.5 to 0.7\n * Armor Damage Modifier against Carapace from 0.25 to 0.65\n * Cleave from medium to big\n * Added a 4th target damage profile\n * Power distribution from 1st (target) {60,120} / 2nd {35,70} / 3rd {25,50} / 4th n/a / Default {10,20} to 1st {80,150} / 2nd {60,110} / 3rd {40,80} / 4th {25,60} / Default {10,30}.\n\n\n**Dev Note:** These changes will be also applied to the Ogryn Slab Shield L3 and L4 attacks.\n\n* Light 3 / Light 4 Vanguard Special activated profile:\n * Power distribution override from {90,165} to {120,200}.\n* Heavy 1 / Heavy 2 Relentless profile:\n * Armor Damage Modifier against Flak from 0.75 to 0.9\n * Armor Damage Modifier against Unyielding from 1 to 0.8\n * Armor Damage Modifier against Maniac from 0.5 to 0.8\n * Armor Damage Modifier against Carapace from 0.25 to 0.75\n * Power distribution from 1st (target) {120,220} / 2nd {80,110} / 3rd {20,30} / 4th {10,25} / Default {5,10} to 1st {175,350} / 2nd {80,160} / 3rd {60,120} / 4th {50,100} / \n Default {40,80}.\n* Heavy 1 / Heavy 2 Relentless Special activated profile:\n * Power distribution override from {220,440} to {250,475}.\n\n#Additional Weapon Changes\n* Atrox Mk VII Tactical Axe\n * Increased the range of the Light 2 and Light 3 attacks to be more in line with the Light 1 range, to avoid missing on the following attacks when chaining light attacks at the very edge of the weapon range.\n * Tweaked the hitbox of the Light 2 attack to be more aligned with the crosshair position.\n * Duelling Sword Mk II\n * Aligned chain timing for the Heavy 2 attack to be equal when chained from every attack.\n* Devil\u2019s Claw Mk IV\n * Fixed the icon in the Inspect screen for the Light 3 attack to display the correct attack type (changed from Strikedown to Vanguard).\n* Cadia Mk XIIIg Assault Chainsword\n * Changed the Heavy 3 attack to chain into Light 3 instead of Light 1 to allow for a Vanguard attack loop.\n* Deimos Mk IV Blaze Force Sword\n * Fixed an issue where an incorrect push direction was used if an enemy survived the Heavy 2 attack. It will now correctly push enemies away from you, instead of sending them to the right.\n* Autoguns\n* Lowered the amount of hits that do increased damage on a critical hit string:\n  * Columbus Mk V Autoguns from 4 to 3\n  * Braced Autoguns from 3 to 2.\n* Locke Mk IIb Spearhead Boltgun\n * Increased ammo reserve from 80 to 100.\n* Obscurus Mk II Blaze Force Sword\n * Added a new Heavy Strikedown damage profile for the Heavy 1 attack that suits the actual attack better, including slightly better Weakspot / Critical Hit values.\n  * First Target:\n      * Damage increased from 100-200 to 150-350\n      * Stagger increased from 4-8 to 7-15.\n * Second Target:\n     * Damage reduced from 80-160 to 60-130.\n* Maccabian Mk II Duelling Sword\n * Fixed a bug where the Heavy 1 attack dealt less damage than it was supposed to do.\n * Fixed an issue causing melee weapons to get blood spatters when hitting inanimate damageable objects such as explosive barrels.\n\n\n#Talent and Blessing Tweaks\n* \u2018Brutal Momentum\u2019 weapon blessing: Removed Ogryns as possible enemies whose Hit Mass can be ignored.\n\n\n**Dev Note:** *The \u2018Brutal Momentum\u2019 blessing paired with powerful Strikedown attacks (like the special activated attack on Ogryn folding shovels) led to possible one-hit kills on multiple stacked Ogryn-type enemies, like Crushers. This expanded too much out of the single target nature of those Strikedown attacks, and also made Strikedown weapons which did not have access to the blessing to feel comparatively less useful in situations where they should have excelled.*\n\n**Dev Note:** *This is part of ongoing prep work we are carrying out for itemization as we rebalance existing weapon blessings. We are curious to collect player thoughts and feedback as we continue optimizing.*\n\n* \u2018Run \u2018n\u2019 Gun\u2019\n  * Close Damage while sprinting: 10% \u2192 12%.\n* \u2018Perfect Strike\u2019\n * Now also grants 7.5% Crit Chance.\n* \u2018Surge\u2019\n * Now also grants 5% Crit Chance.\n* \u2018Focused Channelling\u2019\n * Now also removes 30% of Charging Movement Speed Penalties.\n* \u2018Blazing Spirit\u2019\n * Tier 3:\n     * Stacks Per Crit: 2 \u2192 3\n     * Max Stacks: 10 \u2192 9.\n* \u2018Sunder\u2019\n * Now also grants 20% Heavy Melee Damage.\n* \u2018Man-Stopper\u2019\n * Now also grants 15% Bonus Impact.\n* \u2018Adhesive Charge\u2019\n * Now also grants 15% Damage vs Ogryns and Monstrosities.\n* \u2018Infernus\u2019\n * Tier 3:\n     * Stacks per crit: 4 \u2192 3\n     * Max Stacks: 10 \u2192 9.\n* \u2018Ceaseless Barrage\u2019\n * Suppression Bonus: 20% \u2192 10%\n * Damage vs Suppressed: 6% \u2192 4%.\n* \u2018Blaze Away\u2019\n * Power Level: 8% \u2192 7%.\n* \u2018Point Blank\u2019 weapon blessing: Fixed an issue where the blessing failed to trigger from kills with the primary weapon.\n\n* \u2018Take a Swing\u2019 weapon blessing: Fixed an issue where the bonus weakspot damage failed to be added upon triggering the blessing.\n\n#Psyker\n* Changed \u2018Perfect Timing\u2019 to trigger once per hit, instead of once per attack.\n\n#Ogryn\n* Fixed an issue where the talent \u2018Bullet Bravado\u2019 failed to replenish toughness when shooting projectile-type weapons (e.g. Rumbler, Grenadier Gauntlet).\n* Fixed an issue where the Close Range Damage bonus from the Ogryn \u2018Thick of the Fray\u2019 talent was applied also to damage from the primary melee weapon.\n* Fixed an issue where stacks of the keystone talent \u2018Feel No Pain\u2019 would be removed incorrectly also when successfully blocking an attack, or when hit by friendly fire.\n* Fixed an issue where the talent \u2018Pacemaker\u2019 could fail to be triggered.\n* Fixed an issue where the talent \u2018Crunch\u2019 failed to be triggered if the talent \u2018No Pushover\u2019 was also selected.\n* Fixed an issue where the Blitzes \u2018Big Box of Hurt\u2019/\u2018Bombs Away\u2019 and \u2018Big Friendly Rock\u2019 would fail to instakill Poxbursters and special Mutants spawned from the related Maelstrom mutator.\n* Increased the interval in between explosions of \u2018Big Box of Hurt\u2019 from (0.3 - 0.5) To (0.4 - 0.8).\n\n**Dev Note:** *This will reduce the overlap of the staggers, to allow for a slightly longer total Stagger Duration for those hit by the explosions.*\n\n#Zealot\n* \u2018Punishment\u2019\n * Impact per Stack: 30% \u2192 5%. The \u2018Uninterruptible\u2019 bonus still remains the same.\n\n**Dev Note:** *A total of 150% Stagger left very little room for other bonuses such as \u2018Hammer of Faith\u2019 and various Weapon Blessings.*\n\n* \u2018Chastise the Wicked\u2019 and \u2018Fury of the Faithful\u2019\n * 100% Rending \u2192 100% Melee Rending\n\n**Dev Note:** *This talent was always intended to emphasize the melee prowess of Zealots allowing them to charge up to enemies and devastating them with their melee attacks. This change is made to bring this talent back to its intended purpose.*\n\n#Combat\n* Bolt-type Explosions\n  * Bolt-type explosions are now always the same size, no matter if they hit or kill.\n  * Added additional damage to the explosion when killing an enemy.\n  * Removed the VFX explosion effect on close range hits where the bolt does not have time to prime the explosive package.\n\n* Fixed an issue where the visual targeting effect of the secondary attack of Trauma Force Staves was mismatched to the actual explosion radius.\n* Fixed an issue where it was not possible to cancel into a block while starting an heavy attack with Force Swords.\n* Updated reflector pattern and colour of weapon flashlights. There are now specific styles of flashlights used for Infantry Lasguns, Recon Lasguns, Infantry Autoguns, and the Shredder Autopistol, instead of all sharing the same.\n* Fixed issue that could cause some players to be left behind when hogtied players were moved further ahead.\n* Made improvements to placement of rescued hang ledged players to avoid them being placed on the wrong floor.\n* Fixed an issue where players grabbed by a disabler enemy could fall through elevator floors once released.\n* Fixed a multitude of hang ledges issues.\n* Changed so that all player shots ignore body mass from other players.\n\n**Dev note:** *Before, only attacks from specific weapons were able to go through players, but now shots from every weapon should be able to.*\n\n#Enemies\n* Fixed a crash that could occur when dodging into enemies while performing a chain-weapon sawing attack.\n* Fixed a case where enemies could appear burned also from non-burning effects.\n* Fixed a case where the Pox Hound leap could fail if staggered during approach.\n* Fixed Martyr\u2019s skull doors being already opened by enemies.\n\n#Missions\n**Smelter Complex HL17-36:**\n\n* In the mid event enemies can now path to the platform above the elevator and can shoot from there.\n* The end event now has a new stage where players turn valves to restart the smelter.\n* Minor tweaks and adjustments to the end event area, added guardrails and covers for enemies.\n* Tweaked the difficulty of the event spawning to provide a better challenge.\n* Reduced camping scenarios by the extract door at the end event.\n* Fixed enemies that could spawn inside the Martyr\u2019s skull room.\n* Re-worked the area after the airlock in The 'Fab to have a more organic game flow and in-world purpose.\n* Dev Note: With this change we wanted to show a bit more of the ongoing battle for Tertium and how it\u2019s affecting pre-existing areas and structures.\n* \nAll corruptors in The Foundry will now be active from the start, allowing players to choose their approach. Additionally, we\u2019ve made some performance improvements and art updates to the area.\n\n**Dev Note:** *We wanted to try adding some more agency to events, please let us know what you think of this more open approach.*\n\n#Enclavum Baross:\n\n* The mid event now has more spawn locations for enemies.\n* The mid event now has power core spawners more spread out.\n* The end event now has the lower part of the landing pad as an enterable area.\n* The location for the batteries in the \u201cLower the Skylink\u201d event section have been moved around, and additional variety to the enemy spawn locations has been added to the side spaces next to the control room.\n\n#Mercantile HL-70-04:\n\n* Tweaks and adjustments to the end event layout.\n* Added a drop leading into the end event area.\n\n**Dev note:** *The corridor leading to the end event funnelled enemies into a too easily defended chokepoint, and therefore was the de facto best area for players to fight in, ultimately turning most of the huge play space to be unused. This change will force players to enter the arena proper and engage straight on with enemies.*\n\n* Fixed an issue where enemies could spawn inside an unintended area of the penance puzzle.\n* Fixed indestructible heretical icon.\n* Fixed issues with the pickup spawning.\n\n#Consignment Yard HL17-36:\n\n* Added more spawn locations and teleporters for enemies.\n* Removed a hacking point on the balcony in the mid event and expanded the open space to add another hacking point there. Increased the amount of enemies spawned on the balcony and intensified the event.\n* Increased the number of AA-guns that are needed to be destroyed in the end event and decreased the fortification time afterwards to compensate. Increased the overall intensity of the event.\n\n#Magistrati Oubliette TM8-707:\n\n* Added more covers to allow more ranged combat to happen over the chasm before the mid event.\n* Added more spawners and teleporters for enemies.\n* Made it possible for enemies to shoot from above in mid event and increased the amount of places where they could drop down to make it harder for players to camp the spawns. Increased overall intensity of the event.\n* Increased the amount of spawners and intensity of the end event.\n* Added a lever in the Martyr\u2019s skull puzzle area to prevent players to get softlocked.\n\n#Silo Cluster 18-66/a:\n\n* Added more enemy spawners.\n* Changed spawners and enemy pathing in the end event.\n* Tweaks and adjustments to the geometry in the end event.\n* Minor general tweaks to covers and hang ledges.\n\n#Ascension Riser 31:\n\n* Minor tweaks to event enemy spawning and smoother level collisions to provide better player navigation.\n* Fixed location where enemies could spawn and clip through a wall.\n* Fixed an issue where players could land on top of an elevator and get stuck.\n\n#Excise Vault Spireside-13:\n\n* Minor art and layout changes.\n* Added an additional decode location in the mid event.\n\n#Chasm Logistratum:\n\n* Moved the end event respawn beacon location.\n* Tweaked geometry and covers, especially in the broken tunnel section for smoother player navigation.\n* Removed a ladder at the end event and replaced it with crates.\n\n#Chasm Station HL-16-11:\n\n* The end event traitor captain now spawns inside one of the two trains.\n\n#Power Matrix HL-17-36:\n\n* Minor layout changes.\n* Added a side walkway above the steel conveyors in The 'Fab to broaden the traversal options.\n\n**Dev Note:** *This area would often become a very tight and unforgiving corridor, the new side path connects it up in a way that should alleviate it and give a new one-way backtracking drop.*\n\n* Fixed a spot where players could end up floating mid air.\n\n#Refinery Delta-17:\n\n* Fixed players not respawning at the mid event respawn beacon before its activation and completion.\n\n#Hab Dreyko:\n\n* Minor tweaks and adjustments to level for smoother collisions and layout.\n* Fixed an issue where Ogryn characters could pick up the Martyr skull without solving the puzzle.\n\n#Comms-Plex 154/2f:\n\n* Tweaked the difficulty of the event spawning to provide a better challenge.\n\n#Vigil Station Oblivium:\n\n* Added line of sight blockers to prevent snipers from shooting through walls in a specific location.\n* Added more spawners and variety of enemy compositions in mid event.\n* Reworked parts of the end event to make the gameplay space less filled with chokepoints. Increased the overall intensity.\n\n#Warren 6-19:\n\n* Fixed an issue where enemies could potentially open the gate to the penance puzzle.\n\n#Relay Station TRS-150:\n\n* Fixed places where players could find a way to get out of gameplay space.\n\n#Archivum Sycorax:\n\n* Fixed walls that would not break when monstrosities broke through it.\n* VO and Audio\n* Fixed an issue that caused \u201cout of ammo\u201d sounds to play every frame when trying to shoot automatic fire weapons without any ammo in reserve nor magazine.\n* Added custom VO lines for Zealot Chorus of Spiritual Fortitude.\n* Added more banter responses for female Veteran Cutthroat.\n* Hestia may now be a mission handler for Enclavum Baross.\n* Implemented male Zealot Fanatic killstreak responses.\n* Added some new Mourningstar announcement VO.\n\n#HUD/UI\n* Using the Tactical Overlay now blocks interactions in the Mourningstar.\n\n**Dev Note:** *This was done to avoid triggering other actions in the Mourningstar while browsing the tactical overlay.*\n\n* The Change Tactical Overlay Tab key can now be rebound.\n* Fixed issues where the auspex would not aim directly towards some scan targets.\n* Fixed an issue where the \u201cTitle Colour in The Mourningstar\u201d and \u201cTitle Colour in Missions\u201d options didn\u2019t reset when selecting \u201cReset to default settings\u201d.\n* The locked emotes now show on all emote slots when looking at equipping them in the inventory.\n* Fixed an issue where a player could sell the wrong weapon because a new weapon got selected after the confirmation timer started.\n\n#Cosmetics\n* Voice modulation effects granted from a large amount of cosmetic headgears are now more noticeable than before.\n* Added opacity dithering to hair, which will improve the overall quality of hair rendering.\n* Fixed an issue where boots could clip with pants on multiple Zealot lower body cosmetics rewarded from Penances.\n* Fixed an issue where the Veteran \u201cVeteran\u2019s Sentry Uniform\u201d cosmetic upper body right hand was clipping through the glove.\n* Fixed an issue where the arms would clip with the vest on the sides of the Ogryn \u201cHired Muscle Leathers (Sub-level 101)\u201d upper body cosmetic.\n* Fixed the Psyker \u201cScryer\u2019s Mantle With Psykhana Collar\u201d headgear cosmetic removing hair completely.\n* Fixed an issue where ponytails would clip on the Psyker \u201cWitchshroud\u201d headgear cosmetic reward.\n* Fixed the Veteran \u201cArges Pattern Augmetic\u201d headgear cosmetic incorrectly removing eyebrows.\n* Fixed instances of the \u201cMortis Rag Mask\u201d headgear cosmetic clipping with the ears.\n* Fixed clipping issues on the Zealot \u201cCowl of the Avenger\u201d headgear cosmetic reward.\n* Fixed some minor visual issues on the Veteran \u201cAtoman Pattern Combat Helm with Rebreather\u201d headgear cosmetic.\n* Fixed an issue where the Zealot \u201cKrieg Greatcoat (Marked by Faith)\u201d upper body cosmetic\u2019s shoulder candle light did not show up as intended.\n* Fix for an issue related to clipping on the Zealot \u201cEcclesiarchy-Approved Diadem (Words Of Faith Pattern)\u201d headgear cosmetic while viewing it in your loadout.\n* Fixed an issue where the Zealot \u201cPhaeton Pattern Rebreather\u201d cosmetic headgear failed to modify the operative\u2019s voice.\n\n#Miscellaneous\n* Fixed an issue where button mapping could be reset or incorrect on controllers when booting up the game if a non-default layout was selected.\n* Fixed a text issue in the descriptions of the Veteran Executioner\u2019s Stance talent and other talents referencing it.\n* \u201cCompleted\u201d in the penance menu is now translated into other languages.\n* Addressed a uniform infringement on an NPC Guard stationed by the Psykhanium on the Mourningstar.\n\n# **Missed Patch Note(s)**\n\n* There is a known bug for the Antax Mk V Combat Axe where the stats appear incorrectly. This is visual only and there is a hotfix coming in 1.4.1.\n\n * \u2018Invocation of Death\u2019\n   * Can now only trigger once per attack.\n\n **Dev Note:** While class Abilities are really fun to use and a key part of a character build, they are also balanced around their cooldowns.\n\n However, the Abilities cannot find a healthy balance when the cooldown can vary by large degrees due to Ability Cooldown Reduction effects.\n\n We are therefore looking to rebalance the Ability Cooldown Reduction instances which result in extremely high uptimes of Abilities.\n\n *Invocation of Death*, combined with the Zealot\u2019s crit-focused kit, led to unhealthy situations when paired with huge cleaving strikes into multiple enemies; the new version will still be a really valuable pick in the talent tree, but not as overpowering as before by normalizing the amount of cooldown reduction awarded to players when fighting elites or hordes, with single target or cleave based weapons.\n\n\nRead on the Forums:\n\nPart 1: https://forums.fatsharkgames.com/t/secrets-of-the-machine-god-out-now-pt-1/96131  \nPart 2: https://forums.fatsharkgames.com/t/secrets-of-the-machine-god-out-now-pt-2/96132",

        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/jxohhzkidy8d1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6b7fcdd14ac1736f6019bf7ce4a605cf8857adb1\n\n# Hello Devoted Rejects,\n\nIt\u2019s time to talk more about itemization (a.k.a. crafting) and what players can expect.\n\nWe\u2019ve been reading your comments, your posts, your threads and your topics.\n\nOne of the challenges for tackling Itemization was to propose a new experience to the players which felt authentic and natural within the actual live system. We did not want to rush this, as it was important to consider all the progress and time put in by current players of the game, too.\n\nOur goal is to improve player agency. We are putting the focus on giving players a clear path to get the weapons and gameplay they want.\n\nPart of this agency will be achieved by removing the locks on Blessings and Perks.\n\nThe rest of the player agency will be achieved through the introduction of two new major systems for itemization: Mastery and Expertise\u00a0**(final names pending)**. These systems will make the players journey in the game more rewarding and customizable.\n\n# Mastery\n\nThis is the core progression system that is tied to the weapon type / weapon family itself. As players use a specific weapon, they\u2019ll gain more experience. This unlocks new blessings, perks, marks and a special weapon cosmetic along the way via the reward tracks. As players progress, the potential quality and stats of the weapon also increases.\n\nThis system will merge all weapon types/families, meaning players will be able to freely switch between different marks of the same weapon type. For example, once you own an Infantry Lasgun, you have the potential to unlock all the possible marks for this weapon and switch from one mark to another.\n\nWhen viewing any weapon, it will show the weapon\u2019s maximum potential stats. These stats will be randomly determined. It\u2019s up to the players to decide if the weapon profile is interesting enough for them to commit and increase the stats until reaching this potential (which are then applied to the weapon through the Expertise system).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ehj7a6mody8d1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4bc23100526fef7c53c571194130f089db0c20b0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jpqwzhnpdy8d1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7d8d4caf89da363dc93d38feb36ab2eba64ecb4b\n\n# Expertise\n\nWhile the Mastery system is where a player unlocks the potential for a weapon, the Expertise system is where the players apply those changes via crafting. This is when the players create an actual relationship with the weapon. Players will be able to configure the weapon, change the Blessings or Perks, and increase the stats. Players will no longer be locked after making two changes on Perks or Blessings.\n\nThis is also when the player uses resources to make these changes happen.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/77zsyixsdy8d1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4e27cd15e9d02747954d28bb7c5380bb6fa339ab\n\n# What About Resources?\n\nWhile we were planning this itemization rework, there were a lot of discussions around this topic. Creating an entirely new resource is a bit easier for balancing, but we don\u2019t want to start a new grind for players. We wanted to have a system which respects players\u2019 time. As such, we decided to keep plasteel and diamantine steel as the resources for changing weapons, but we worked on balancing.\n\nWe wanted to give a new life to diamantine. As diamantine is a resource introduced at a higher level of game play, it is also the required resource for achieving higher levels of Expertise on a weapon.\n\n# What Happens to My Existing Inventory?\n\nWhen designing itemization, we wanted to commit to ensuring fairness for all players, new and old. As such, we\u2019re implementing a migration system to convert players\u2019 current weapons and blessings into the new system.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: The blessing library of the weapon family will be converted into mastery progression. This means players will start the new systems with a head start in mastery, giving them the chance to unlock previously owned blessings (as well as the chance to unlock some blessings players never had before the update).\n\nOur aim is to preserve players hard-earned progress and make this shift as smooth as possible.\n\n**What about Curios?**\u00a0Curios will have their locks removed but they will remain unaffected beyond this change.\n\nWe are continuing to optimize this system in the coming weeks and we look forward to reading your feedback on the process outlined. **We\u2019ll collect any questions below so that we can release further communications on the topic as we make progress.**\n\nThank you!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qy0n721wdy8d1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f4414c88ec7dc40bdf704f07c1926bb98afa2bb",
