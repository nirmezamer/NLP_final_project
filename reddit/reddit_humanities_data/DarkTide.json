            "NEXT WEEK!",
            "Given the sheer number of leavers in games now, there\u2019s a certain camaraderie with the one other player who was there for the whole game.\n\nI was in a long game in the Hourglass map where at points it was either me or the zealot alive, because something like an aoe knockback, or fire/gas/armies of gunners killed everyone but 1 person and 2 people immediately left.\n\nProbably 10 people came and went in that game, and the 2 people who extracted with us at the end had no idea what a nail biting adventure that entire game was.",
            "You know.\n\nI'd actually dig a social area in the game. Somewhere, where I can chill and look at people's cosmetics. Maybe play the odd mini-game or something like that.",
            "After testing the Rashad and Antax axes on Vet I've come to really apriciate Antax' cleave stat on a recent Maelstorm map with waves of mutants.",
            "I know I'm being optimistic here and a bit naive but\n\nWill the Dev Blog outline all the weapon types we'll be getting?\n\nWill a story outline/progression be mentioned. Like the story between Zola, the Twins and Rannick was really interesting but came to a close abruptly.\n\nWill it be accepting any community suggestions in the comments or somewhere similar?",
            "Can we get a dev blog? There's supposed to be one before the new patch, and it's less than a week left...",
            "Love that the mods are shutting down any negativity towards the piss-weak itemisation announcement of \"We had over a year to do this and still want another three months because we can't do our jobs in a reasonable timeframe\".",
            "Is it just me or are dreg/scab gunners just way too oppresive. I swear they're the cause of 80% of my deaths. The stun lock they cause is just simply unreasonable. Even running 3 gunner resist curios they just absolutely shred you, god forbid more than one of them is targeting you at a time."

Yea, its great that they aren't releasing something thats not ready, Probably know they will get raked over the coals no matter what, but it will be worse if the updates bad. However, like...everything update related to this game takes AGES. This game has been out for 2 years at this point and is different in like 4 ways at first glance from when it came out.  \nThere is no way there is a dedicated team for this game anymore, it has to be on back burner like \"you can work on darktide for overtime\" or something XD",
            "https://i.redd.it/im0yyevffr7d1.gif\n\nShame on me for having hope",
            "This was expected, but why not throw us a bone and remove the locks until the rework comes. The main problem with the current system is the RNG involved with getting both blessings we want",
            "Seems to be what most expected, though when does Summer officially end these days?\n\nI know a lot of people were excited for item rework, me one of them, but am looking forward to new map more (though I also suspect my secret hope that it also includes a new mechanicus/Skitari character to be unrealistic). Though if we are being honest a lot of people were more excited for item update than new map.\n\nSo long as that new map still releases Next Week\u2122",

Sure, the game is going strong now, but in a few months I'm almost completely certain that most of us will have moved on to greener pastures. How can Darktide possibly survive when the Darktide killer is right around the corner?\n\nOf course, I'm talking about Killer Bean: the Videogame. After briefly looking at a couple of promotional screenshots, I can say with 100% certainty that Killer Bean: the Videogame\u2122 is absolutely gonna blow Darktide outta the water. The aesthetics, the setting, the raw sexual energy radiating from the protagonist. Darktide will be as dust in the wind, barely even a memory once Killer Bean\u2122: the Videogame\u00b0 comes out.",
