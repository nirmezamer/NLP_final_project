        "content": "Hey guys. One more fun little thread before we become public again :)\n\nI sincerely love how this community has grown, but I've been around for too long to not be upset at how Reddit is treating users. While I don't plan on jumping ship on this place *just yet*, I want to highlight other alternative spaces in the scene here, on the chance that Reddit isn't around in the next few years.\n\n# [Nuzlocke Forums](https://nuzlockeforums.com/forum/)\n\nYou've probably seen me advertising the [Nuzlocke Forums](https://nuzlockeforums.com/forum/) a bunch since the start of the blackout, and we've always been on good terms, but I genuinely highly recommend giving them a look. NuzForums has been around longer than us, and forums are cool. Seriously, we *fumbled* as an internet ecosystem when we let Reddit kill forums. But this one is alive and is great, so I'd suggest giving them some love.\n\nBack in 2019, The Nuzlocke Forums switched to a new server host and redesigned the entire site. If you were around before the switch, I'll vouch for them when I say the new site is significantly smoother, and a much more enjoyable user experience. If you're a younger member unaware of the forums, they've hosted the largest independent Nuzlocke community for over a decade, and have many different outlets to share your runs, discuss Nuzlocke-related things, or discuss literally anything else.\n\n# [Lemmy](https://lemmy.world/c/nuzlocke)\n\nI'm going to be honest: I have no idea how Lemmy works. Not in the slightest. It seems to be similar to  Mastodon, if you're familiar with that. I cannot be the one to explain it to you because I am illiterate when it comes to this stuff, but [here's a guide](https://join-lemmy.org/docs/en/introduction.html) if you're curious. ANYWAYS, [lemmy.world](https://lemmy.world) is kind of set up like Reddit, and while it's a bit primitive at the moment, I've gone ahead and set up a [Nuzlocke page](https://lemmy.world/c/nuzlocke) over there. Go make an account, give it a swing and maybe we can catch the same magic in a new, more welcoming space :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks everyone for being amazing. I don't expect anyone to want to leave, and I know as general users most of y'all probably aren't phased by what Reddit is doing, but I wanted to share these for anyone who **is** tired of it all. Or if you just want more content in general, you can always hover to the other communities for a bit too!\n\nThat's all for now. The sub will be back up within the next 24 hours, as the poll trends toward that. Thanks, have a good one.",

            "From what I\u2019ve seen the forums doesn\u2019t have nearly as active as a community as this subreddit, they seem to sometimes go days or weeks without a single post. Idk about API whatnot as I\u2019m a scrub who solely uses the mobile app but I think more would be lost than gained if this server was nuked in protest. I suppose it\u2019s ultimately up to the mods though",
            "I call it a Bredlocke. You play as a normal Nuzlocke with capturing first encounter on a route only. If you fail, Nuzlocke rule applies. However, if you capture it you may capture a breeding partner on the same route. You may breed them.\n\nMy reason was to allow egg move usage.\n\nDitto clause for those who want it.\nDupes for full evolutionary line.\nShiny clause.\nStationary clause.\nRoaming clause.\n\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m doing in Gen 2 right now on my PC.",

            "I don't intend on nuking the sub by any means, don't worry about that. I'm more or less predicting Reddit itself will die out if they keep making decisions like this, but we'll just have to see. the forums are a good bit less active nowadays (as all forums are thanks to Reddit) but more tight-knit, and it's a good place. I'd love to see them gain more traction over this whole thing personally.",

            "It really wasn't that long.  Are you in middle school or something?",
            "Most mods never cared about change (Although I believe some did genuinely care, especially smaller subs like here). They caved the second Reddit threatened to replace them with scabs. They'd rather keep the little power they have, then stand up for people who really needed help",
            "Reddit won\u2019t die out because of this at all. Most people seem to clearly not care all to much about API drama",
            "Pretty much the same way. You can start breeding your Pok\u00e9mon as soon as unlock the Daycare."

            ">!I won, but jfc the e4 took me weeks to prepare for!<\n\n\n\nI don't have much to say about this hack that hasn't been said already. This attempt took several months of my life and was by far the most challenging and patience-testing Nuzlocke I've ever done. I felt like this run was carried by some incredible early-game encounters in Togedemaru, Vivillon, and many others, letting me build up a big box that I could aggressively sac from in the late game. By the end, the run felt very secure, although there were certainly several crits that could've ended my run in the elite 4.\n\nScreenshots of my boxes and stuff: [https://imgur.com/a/9klnO9F](https://imgur.com/a/9klnO9F)\n\nI'll reply to this comment with some death/heart scale/rare candy accounting for those interested.\n\nThanks to all the helpful commenters on my previous post from about a month ago!",

Like, the reason I find Nuzlocke so cool is how it makes us get attached to our mons. RR does not, it's about numbers changing other numbers, it's great for hardcore players, it's probably one of the best battle simulators, it's very well made, the one thing it isn't is a good creature collecting game.",
