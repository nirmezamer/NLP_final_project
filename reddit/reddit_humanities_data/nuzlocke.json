        "content": "Hey guys. One more fun little thread before we become public again :)\n\nI sincerely love how this community has grown, but I've been around for too long to not be upset at how Reddit is treating users. While I don't plan on jumping ship on this place *just yet*, I want to highlight other alternative spaces in the scene here, on the chance that Reddit isn't around in the next few years.\n\n# [Nuzlocke Forums](https://nuzlockeforums.com/forum/)\n\nYou've probably seen me advertising the [Nuzlocke Forums](https://nuzlockeforums.com/forum/) a bunch since the start of the blackout, and we've always been on good terms, but I genuinely highly recommend giving them a look. NuzForums has been around longer than us, and forums are cool. Seriously, we *fumbled* as an internet ecosystem when we let Reddit kill forums. But this one is alive and is great, so I'd suggest giving them some love.\n\nBack in 2019, The Nuzlocke Forums switched to a new server host and redesigned the entire site. If you were around before the switch, I'll vouch for them when I say the new site is significantly smoother, and a much more enjoyable user experience. If you're a younger member unaware of the forums, they've hosted the largest independent Nuzlocke community for over a decade, and have many different outlets to share your runs, discuss Nuzlocke-related things, or discuss literally anything else.\n\n# [Lemmy](https://lemmy.world/c/nuzlocke)\n\nI'm going to be honest: I have no idea how Lemmy works. Not in the slightest. It seems to be similar to  Mastodon, if you're familiar with that. I cannot be the one to explain it to you because I am illiterate when it comes to this stuff, but [here's a guide](https://join-lemmy.org/docs/en/introduction.html) if you're curious. ANYWAYS, [lemmy.world](https://lemmy.world) is kind of set up like Reddit, and while it's a bit primitive at the moment, I've gone ahead and set up a [Nuzlocke page](https://lemmy.world/c/nuzlocke) over there. Go make an account, give it a swing and maybe we can catch the same magic in a new, more welcoming space :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks everyone for being amazing. I don't expect anyone to want to leave, and I know as general users most of y'all probably aren't phased by what Reddit is doing, but I wanted to share these for anyone who **is** tired of it all. Or if you just want more content in general, you can always hover to the other communities for a bit too!\n\nThat's all for now. The sub will be back up within the next 24 hours, as the poll trends toward that. Thanks, have a good one.",

            ">\tI don\u2019t expect anyone to want to leave\n\nOh I\u2019m definitely leaving when Apollo shuts down, thanks for making a community over on lemmy :D",
            "Bruh making essays over this dumbass blackout",
            "I don't intend on nuking the sub by any means, don't worry about that. I'm more or less predicting Reddit itself will die out if they keep making decisions like this, but we'll just have to see. the forums are a good bit less active nowadays (as all forums are thanks to Reddit) but more tight-knit, and it's a good place. I'd love to see them gain more traction over this whole thing personally.",
            "Very interesting do you have any idea how this would work in platinum or soul sliver?",
            "It really wasn't that long.  Are you in middle school or something?",
            "Most mods never cared about change (Although I believe some did genuinely care, especially smaller subs like here). They caved the second Reddit threatened to replace them with scabs. They'd rather keep the little power they have, then stand up for people who really needed help",
            "Reddit won\u2019t die out because of this at all. Most people seem to clearly not care all to much about API drama",
            "Pretty much the same way. You can start breeding your Pok\u00e9mon as soon as unlock the Daycare.",
            "If it were up to just me I'd stay private, but it felt appropriate to respond to the situation with a poll. Most users are trending toward wanting to reopen, so that's what we're going to do.\n\nI could care less about \"power\", I don't really have much with a smaller sub like this and just wanted to do what I could with whatever power I did have, but the blackout hasn't gone the way we wanted it to. It just sucks and we either stay blacked out and  continue to get loads of modmail from angry children and Reddit itself for potentially nothing in return, or open and get called power-hungry moderators. I don't want or ask for any kind of sympathy, but hopefully you understand the predicament lol",
            "Interesting and what would the ditto clause be?"
