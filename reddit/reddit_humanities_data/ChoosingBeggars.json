He casually brought up that he lives in a 4 million dollar house in the gated community behind the beach. He asked me what I do and I said private chef and just left my job working exclusively for one family. He said he was looking for a chef and thought I might have found myself a new gig. He said he had a guest house to stay in. I have worked as a live in chef but prefer to keep my work and private life separate so I was skeptical. He wanted an even exchange for living in his guest house for cooking, cleaning and doing laundry everyday. No pay. I\u2019ve been doing this for 15 years so I don\u2019t do trades or work for less anymore. I told him that my last job provided me with an apartment, car, all expenses paid plus a competitive salary which is the standard for this profession. He had the audacity to tell me I could still get another full time job. No sir, working for you would be the full time job. I think he was looking for a live in servant/slave or housewife. ",
