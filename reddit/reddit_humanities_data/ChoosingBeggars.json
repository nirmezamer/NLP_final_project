The person cannot really go far or do much else, unless they live within a few blocks of the place. It isn't like they can work a second job in between. (Those have unexpected overtime, being called in unexpectedly for a staff substitution/shortage, etc., too. \"Oh I can't, I have to babysit\" won't go over well.)\n\nArriving there to get the toddler fed and ready before day care would mean maybe 7 AM, which means rising at 6 AM. It isn't clear at all where the 3-4 hours a day comes in. Laundry is once a week. How often is doing dishes, daily? Bringing the mom some food, when and how often?\n\nIf the child is at day care all day, then where does the 3-4 hours work come in?\n\nThey can send laundry out to a laundry service, some will even deliver. Is there a partner? They can help with dishes.\n\nThese ads are often very vague on the actual details. In this case, how long the person spends at the OOP's house.",
