I played two full ascensions without finding where the Zen market was and I don't know if that was explained in some text I accidentally skipped over.\n\nFrom the way the points were displayed I had also assumed they were some form of currency and was excited to spend some for upgrades when I eventually found the Zen market (which was towards the end of my first ascension - which was also not something I caught an explanation for until it happened). When I did eventually locate the Zen market button and saw it took a currency I had zero of, my built in assumption was this was some form of premium currency store.",
            "You should possibly consider paying more attention while playing, if you're the developer, given that you've almost certainly got a bug with the pin progression - the yellow pins are spawning with significantly more his required to transform them than either the color before or after, which leads to an unnecessary bottleneck in the very early game that doesn't seem to be intentional",

The only negative is that it isnt cross platform. Diablo Immortal, which is, requires too much space that i can't support it for long enough.

Because there are things about it that made it enjoyable and made us stick around a bit longer compared to other games. \n\nIt's realistic, it has colorful and desirable cosmetics, mountains of content to be played and even more through updates, requires a decent amount of skill but still simple enough for others to play, it can be played solo or with friends, not pay to win and relatively low spec.\n\nBut when CODM released people (including myself) went to play it as it was fresh and it revolutionised FPS games on mobile.\n\nTo me it was a gaming fad that was more than a fad, because CODM changed mobile FPS games for the better.\n\nLooking back I made alot of fond memories in PUBG mobile. I haven't redownloaded yet due to the sheer size this behemoth of a game yields.",
