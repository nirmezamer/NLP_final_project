            "***111 Games Reviewed***\n\nBeen playing quite a few games but these are the games that I am expecting to cover in the coming days.\n\n[***Bendy and The Ink Machine***](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jds.batim&hl=en_US): It was a nice change of pace to try this game out considering I picked it up while on sale. I think that it is a pretty simple and quick game to complete but man is there some great world building and lore.\n\n[***Metaverse Keeper***](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dianhun.sparksgames&hl=en_US&pli=1): This was an ok roguelite. I think that this is more akin to BOI or ETG than most but it does have some cool synergies and meta progression. Really weird thing to have loot boxes in a paid game though. Not the biggest fan of that. \n\nLast Week\n\nThese are the games that I covered last week.\n\n[***Skul: The Hero Slayer***](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playdigious.skul&hl=en_US): [Link to Review](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileGameReviewers/comments/1dlcl9c/skul_the_hero_slayer/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n[***Star Wars: Hunters***](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zynga.starwars.hunters&hl=en_US): [Link to Review](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileGameReviewers/comments/1dnvnrw/star_wars_hunters/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n[***Link to all games that I have covered!***](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileGameReviewers/comments/17af7ro/sub_info_current_games/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nIf you have any recommendations, you can comment here and I will add them to the list of recommended games to cover [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileGameReviewers/comments/1d1jjtx/request_your_review_here/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)",
            "[Idle Knight RPG](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.KeremYavuzGames.IdleKnight), Great idle slayer and soda dungeon vibes, write a review but it got taken down?",
            "[Ballpins](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lakerdastudios.ballpin), it's a game I release bit over a week ago, got great feedbacks from the community here and improved it during the passing week.\n\nSince I've created the game to enjoy myself as well, it's pretty much what I play on my phone lately.\n\nHope whomever trying it will enjoy it as I am.",

            "Thanks for sharing your game. The biggest piece of feedback I can give is that clicking on granny's text animation should speed it up instead of skipping it entirely. I played two full ascensions without finding where the Zen market was and I don't know if that was explained in some text I accidentally skipped over.\n\nFrom the way the points were displayed I had also assumed they were some form of currency and was excited to spend some for upgrades when I eventually found the Zen market (which was towards the end of my first ascension - which was also not something I caught an explanation for until it happened). When I did eventually locate the Zen market button and saw it took a currency I had zero of, my built in assumption was this was some form of premium currency store."
