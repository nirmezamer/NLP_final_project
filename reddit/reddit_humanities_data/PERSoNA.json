        "content": "Persona 3 Reload will be out on Friday, February 2nd! Please read through this post for some guidelines and feel free to use this for discussion or small questions.\n\n**Always make sure to mark your spoilers!**\n\n---\n\n#Spoilers\n\nI want to remind people on how spoilers will be treated since Persona 3 reload is a remake.\n\nAs per rule 2, there is no time limit to spoilers. Just because the game is old does not mean that you are allowed to openly spoil the game.\n\nSpoilers must be applied to new Reload content posts. This will be eased as we go along, but especially for people with early copies, we want to keep some surprises for returning players. Please be mindful.\n\nAt least until the game is actually out, anything that is endgame spoilers will be taken down, no matter if it is tagged or not.\n\n---\n\n#What Is Persona 3 Reload?\n\nPersona 3 Reload is a ground up remake of Persona 3's main campaign, *The Journey*. While it is missing the epilogue from Persona 3 FES (*The Answer*) and Persona 3 Portable's Female Main Character Route, Persona 3 Reload will give you Persona 3's main story.\n\n> Step into the shoes of a transfer student thrust into an unexpected fate when entering the hour \"hidden\" between one day and the next. Awaken an incredible power and chase the mysteries of the Dark Hour, fight for your friends, and leave a mark on their memories forever. Persona 3 Reload is a captivating reimagining of the genre-defining RPG, reborn for the modern era.\n\nFeatures:\n\n> * Experience the pivotal game of the Persona series faithfully remade with cutting-edge graphics, modernized quality-of-life features, and signature stylish UI.\n> \n> * Fully immerse yourself in an emotional, gripping journey with new scenes, character interactions, and additional voiceover.\n> \n> * Choose how to meaningfully spend each day through various activities from exploring the Port Island to forging genuine bonds with beloved characters.\n> \n> * Build and command your optimal team to take down otherworldly Shadows and climb closer to the truth.\n\n---\n\n#Version FAQ\n\nIf you have questions about the various versions of Persona 3, please check out the [FAQ post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PERSoNA/comments/16aogd8/persona_3_version_faq/).\n\n---\n\n**Persona 3 Reload (69.99 USD)** - Base Game\n\n* [PSN](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0177-PPSA10872_00-APPLICATION00000)\n* [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2161700/Persona_3_Reload/)\n* [Xbox](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/persona-3-reload/9pm2wf6g0fzt) (Also available on Game Pass)\n\n**Persona 3 Reload Digital Deluxe Edition(79.99 USD)**\n\nIncludes:\n\n> * Base Game\n> * 64 Page Digital Artbook\n> * 60 Song Digital Soundtrack\n\n* [PSN](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0177-PPSA10872_00-ADDCONTENT200011)\n* Steam\n* [Xbox](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/persona-3-reload-digital-deluxe-edition/9p9xrm22tf56)\n\n**Persona 3 Reload Digital Premium Edition(99.99 USD)**\n\nIncludes:\n\n> * Base Game\n> * 64 Page Digital Artbook\n> * 60 Song Digital Soundtrack\n> * Launch DLC (listed below)\n\n* [PSN](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0177-PPSA10872_00-ADDCONTENT200012)\n* Steam\n* [Xbox](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/persona-3-reload-digital-premium-edition/9pfb1crv19qp)\n\n---\n\n#Pre-Order Bonus\n\nPreorder Bonus should come will all editions of the game.

            "Idk why but I find it really funny that no one has uploaded a full version of the new Changing Seasons ost simply because these games are so damn long that no one has reached the point where that song plays. Like I'm sure someone could just directly rip the files, but right now there are so few copies out that no one who could/would do that has the chance, so all the song uploads we're getting are just direct game audio that's recorded as someone plays the game.",
            "Playing this game again makes me realize the thing I like the most about Persona 3--every person in the game constantly updates their dialogue on at least a weekly basis, even random NPCs.  Heck, your dorm-mates often update theirs on a daily basis, and it provides such great development and worldbuilding. \n\nDo not get me wrong, I like 4 and 5 just fine, but I always disliked confining character development and meaningful character interactions to cutscenes and social links.",
            "Now that some people got the game early, I wonder how long it will take until we get the first 100% guide.",
            "Music; I've only heard the full Color Your Night 2 times now but my god it is so good. I teared up, Lotus Juice cooked so hard with the second verse",
            "I'm only 2 hours in and Allegra Clark is sooo good as Mitsuru (as expected) and so is Zeno Robinson as Junpei!",
            "Ok so some new leaked footage dropped and there has been a potentialy major change to social links: >!Chihiro's second rank social link scene was leaked and in it they added new story bits where they go into why she has a fear of men! She mentions that her dad was abusive and used to get angry at her which caused her to fear any other man afterwards. She also talks about one of her teachers that keeps hounding her with tasks, foreshadowing the stolen money plot line much earlier. I rewatched her og SL to make sure and NONE of that was in the game originally. This means that pre-existing social links are going to get new dialogue to help flesh them out. It's unclear how extensive these changes will go for every social link in the game but this is potentially a major change!!<",
            "why does every social link end with them running off to watch their show lmao",
            "Underated change: the character limit on your name seems to be longer, so I can actually fit my whole name in for once.",
            "Honestly shocked how much I love Akihikos new VA. On 9/10 when hes yelling at Shinji and hes so damn good.",
            "Just started P3R, I got to the part where everyone (including the chairman!) is watching Makoto sleep in case he shows powers or whatever.\n\nAll I could think was, what if he started massively jacking off?"

            "At least it's not September 30th lol",
            "Reload version of the FES version of Mass Destruction. Hype. Still waiting for the new P3 FES, though. That track can easily end up leagues better than an already great track. Especially since I doubt they'll do a full new opening, it'll probably just be a Reload version of P3 FES.",
            "I thought this would be revealed tomorrow during the Xbox Showcase \n\nMaybe well get an extended look tomorrow instead",
            "Ngl, I'm a bit disappointed we didn't get a new battle theme, but I guess a new version of the original Episode Aigis verse for Mass Destruction is nice too.",
            "if i buy Persona 3 Reload: Expansion Pass, will it include everything added from beginning to ep aigis ?or i've to buy the previous set stand alone?",
