        "content": "Persona 3 Reload will be out on Friday, February 2nd! Please read through this post for some guidelines and feel free to use this for discussion or small questions.\n\n**Always make sure to mark your spoilers!**\n\n---\n\n#Spoilers\n\nI want to remind people on how spoilers will be treated since Persona 3 reload is a remake.\n\nAs per rule 2, there is no time limit to spoilers. Just because the game is old does not mean that you are allowed to openly spoil the game.\n\nSpoilers must be applied to new Reload content posts. This will be eased as we go along, but especially for people with early copies, we want to keep some surprises for returning players. Please be mindful.\n\nAt least until the game is actually out, anything that is endgame spoilers will be taken down, no matter if it is tagged or not.\n\n---\n\n#What Is Persona 3 Reload?\n\nPersona 3 Reload is a ground up remake of Persona 3's main campaign, *The Journey*. While it is missing the epilogue from Persona 3 FES (*The Answer*) and Persona 3 Portable's Female Main Character Route, Persona 3 Reload will give you Persona 3's main story.\n\n> Step into the shoes of a transfer student thrust into an unexpected fate when entering the hour \"hidden\" between one day and the next. Awaken an incredible power and chase the mysteries of the Dark Hour, fight for your friends, and leave a mark on their memories forever.

            "Idk why but I find it really funny that no one has uploaded a full version of the new Changing Seasons ost simply because these games are so damn long that no one has reached the point where that song plays. Like I'm sure someone could just directly rip the files, but right now there are so few copies out that no one who could/would do that has the chance, so all the song uploads we're getting are just direct game audio that's recorded as someone plays the game.",
            "Playing this game again makes me realize the thing I like the most about Persona 3--every person in the game constantly updates their dialogue on at least a weekly basis, even random NPCs.  Heck, your dorm-mates often update theirs on a daily basis, and it provides such great development and worldbuilding. \n\nDo not get me wrong, I like 4 and 5 just fine, but I always disliked confining character development and meaningful character interactions to cutscenes and social links.",
            "Now that some people got the game early, I wonder how long it will take until we get the first 100% guide.",
            "My envy of those that got it early is deep and burning. I'm half tempted to check my Best Buy but I doubt big stores like that are crazy enough to break street date about two weeks early.\u00a0\n\n\nOn the other hand congrats, you lucky bastards.",
            "Music; I've only heard the full Color Your Night 2 times now but my god it is so good. I teared up, Lotus Juice cooked so hard with the second verse",
            "So. \nMitsuru has -kunda skills. Only Aki did before\n\nAki has shock boost. So from these two we can see that the team members are redesigned for battle\n\nEiha and Kouha are in. Maybe Ken and Koro see some actual play\n\nA few new personas. So compendium is updated. Anyone seen Yoshitsune?\n\nExcited to build me some game-breaking Personas\n\nEdit: new moves - Multi Target Boost, Anti-Fire Master, and (new to P3) heat riser",
            "Noteable buffs and nerfs I've found so far:\n\nAkihiko lost Rakunda and Sukunda. Gained Shock Boost, Gigantic Fist, Tarukaja, and Sukukaja. Overall he got nerfed.\n\nMitsuru got Rakunda, some slash attacks, and lost healing. Overall she got buffed.\n\nAigis starts with Arrow Rain and Swift Strike. Gets Myriad Arrows and Diarama now. Marakukaja and Matarukaja come way earlier. Seems to have lost Sukukaja and Masukukaja. Overall she got buffed.\n\nKen gets Mediarama earlier ala Portable. Has the Kouha line instead of Hama now. Gets Makarakarn, Tetrakarn, and Dekaja now. Note that the reflectors are single target now. Overall, buffed super hard he's looking real good now.\n\nI have not seen any gameplay for Junpei and Koro so far, hopefully they got buffed but don't know.",
            "I love it so far I just don\u2019t like that it forces you to join the track team. I always chose kendo when I played the original",
            "I'm only 2 hours in and Allegra Clark is sooo good as Mitsuru (as expected) and so is Zeno Robinson as Junpei!",
            "Ok so some new leaked footage dropped and there has been a potentialy major change to social links: >!Chihiro's second rank social link scene was leaked and in it they added new story bits where they go into why she has a fear of men! She mentions that her dad was abusive and used to get angry at her which caused her to fear any other man afterwards. She also talks about one of her teachers that keeps hounding her with tasks, foreshadowing the stolen money plot line much earlier. I rewatched her og SL to make sure and NONE of that was in the game originally. This means that pre-existing social links are going to get new dialogue to help flesh them out. It's unclear how extensive these changes will go for every social link in the game but this is potentially a major change!!<"
