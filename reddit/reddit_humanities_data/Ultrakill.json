            "The description also says not to expect Fraud this year, which is somewhat disappointing but I guess it's better to have the game in its complete state before the end of the story is released. \n\nAlso what does he mean by the \"enemy rewrite\"? Is the AI going to be improved?",
            "Looks really cool and a shame fraud wont be coming out soon, but at least it gives some closure on the state of the game. Maybe they can pull a wrath/heresy double update if possible.\u00a0",

            "This has always been my least favorite level but if Hakita released this like that without upgrading any of the others it would probably be my 6th favorite.",

I'd also ask that you respond truthfully, this is something me, and the other moderators, are genuinely curious about and would like to know the answer to, as \"all r/ULTRAKILL does is talk about gays\"  is a common complain we get from people who get commonly complained about.\n\nI also could not fit every sexuality on the poll, so I summarized it to the most basic ones, I hope it's not a big issue.\n\nThe poll will end in 3 days from the time of posting.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1dqt86g)",
