            "Gentle reminder that Elon probably lied about having a degree to get an H1-B visa, which (if true) would make him an illegal immigrant subject to having his citizenship revoked.\n\n* For many years, Elon claimed that he received a physics degree from Penn in 1995. He claimed this to the media, to investors, and even in [SEC filings](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FhyLhizWYAEHUET?format=jpg&name=medium). However, in reality he didn't get any of his degrees until [1997](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/musk-physics-degree/).\n* Why the lie? His brother Kimbal gave it away in a 2013 interview. Once they found investors for Zip2 in late 95, their investors realized that they were illegal immigrants. Kimbal [admitted it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T55CcN5c5as&feature=youtu.be&t=13m32s), saying \"When they did fund us, they realized that we were illegal immigrants.\" Elon tried to backtrack by calling it a gray area, but Kimbal emphatically denied it and said they were definitely illegal.\n* In order to get legal status, Elon needed an H1-B, which normally requires a degree. He even [claims](https://twitter.com/capitolhunters/status/1593307580515876866) that the H1-B is *why* he bothered with college in the first place. And yet, he managed to get a visa without one. This begs the question: did he lie about graduating in 1995 on his visa application?\n* In the fall of 1995, he began interviewing for jobs and telling employers that he was a [current](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FhyO17eXgAQo9-_?format=jpg&name=large) Stanford student. This too, was a lie because he never enrolled. All graduate schools require an undergrad degree, and Stanford is no exception. Since he did not graduate from Penn, even if he was admitted that admission would have been revoked.",
