            "You can also do it with [privacy.com](http://privacy.com) 's closing mechanism. I'm pretty sure a lot of banks are also having this feature that you can effectively lock the card from charges. Way before this and the lawsuit from the FTC and the DOJ, I've seen someone happened to be lucky - [https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/comments/1alwwnc/i\\_cancel\\_my\\_adobe\\_subscription\\_2\\_days\\_ago\\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/comments/1alwwnc/i_cancel_my_adobe_subscription_2_days_ago_and/) the payment information given to adobe is a credit card that expired and they cannot take money from it. \ud83e\udd23\n\nJust be careful that some software companies doing these shady anti-cancellation practices (especially when they require your payment information BEFORE you can try out the \"free\" trial) may have the payment enforced via \"obligation to pay\" terms in the EULA/ToS, akin to post-paid plan, like what phone carriers do. That means no payment could result in you being sent to collections. Adobe so far as I seen, try to sound scary sending emails that your payment didn't went through.",

            "Fun Fact: If you use your bank to threaten *anyone*, they'll capitulate immediately in almost every case.\n\nWhen you issue an automated chargeback, your bank launches a tiny investigation into the circumstances of that specific chargeback. If they determine that you're committing fraud, they can come after you but if they don't, then they'll do nothing else about it. The bank relies on the fact that the merchant has no chance in hell of beating them in court, which is true.\n\nHowever, if you actually call your bank or go to the local branch and explain *why* you feel a merchant is violating your rights, *the bank itself* will issue the fraud claim into the way that merchant interacts *with the bank*, and since the bank is issuing the claim, the bank will investigate it much more seriously. They investigate the merchant, not a specific transaction.\n\nThis has 2 possible outcomes. Either A; The bank determines that you are wrong, in which case they spent a bunch of  time and money for nothing, which as you might have guessed they're not going to do... Or B, the much more likely option, they determine that the merchant is committing fraud.\n\nIf they come to the very very likely determination that the merchant is committing fraud, they'll block that merchant from transacting **with the entire bank**. So, if you're a customer of JP Morgan Chase, for example, *every* customer from JP Morgan Chase (\\~30 million people) will instantly stop doing business with the merchant, forever. *Every* Adobe account with a payment method tied to the specific bank, just got cancelled.\n\nAs a merchant, this is instant death, so if you get the bank to levy the threat on your behalf, it's almost guaranteed that the merchant immediately caves.\n\n==\n\nNow, admittedly, because of how drastic the impact on both organisations is, your bank *probably* isn't going to do this against Adobe. But, if it's a local business that's fucking around, your bank **will** kill them on your behalf, I swear I've seen it done.\n\nEither way, even for a company as big as Adobe, your bank will still protect you out of any bullshit. Banks have the ability to move money without asking (to some extent), so they can absolutely cancel your sub, pay the cancellation fee for you, and then straight up charge Adobe for it. What's the next move? Adobe has to sue the bank, and again, good fucking luck.",
            "I don't even need to use Adobe products, but I still pirate them just because it's my civic duty",

            "Another reason to pirate Adobe products\n\nMorally justified",
            "Welllllll in EU, there's a consumer law, that when the company providing a service changes the terms of that service during the run of the service, you have the right to unconditional cancel of that service within of 30 days of terms change (EVEN IF YOU STILL OWE MONEY, its waived). \n\nI wish people outside EU could enjoy similar laws, that would make such scummy moves a bit harder. Companies can either wait to the end of the initial agreement, to change the terms or face unconditional end of it."
