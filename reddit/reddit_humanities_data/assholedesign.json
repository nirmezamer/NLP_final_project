            "It'd be nice to have some sort of restriction on \"how dare this company make me pay for something I find valuable\" posts. And on a similar note, posts complaining about companies keeping exactly the same business model when demand for their services spike, instead of suddenly turning into a charity.\n\nYes, businesses get you to give them money, that's how businesses work. If they offer a product or service you want and ask you to pay for it, that's not asshole design. Nor is it asshole design when they offer you a cheaper or free version of the product that isn't as good as the higher-priced version.",

Classic examples are built in ads on paid devices like TVs. Sure it\u2019s incredibly annoying and the decision from Samsung to include ads is super shady. But it\u2019s not design.",

Companies can either wait to the end of the initial agreement, to change the terms or face unconditional end of it.",
