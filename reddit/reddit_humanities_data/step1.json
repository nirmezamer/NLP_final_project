        "content": "# WELCOME!\n\nA lot of students ask the same questions, so I created this guide to help everyone out. If you have something to add please let me know. Happy studying!\n\n### What is USMLE Step 1?\n\nIn the past, USMLE Step 1 was the crucial exam for med students. While it's now pass/fail, it remains a tough test that demands serious preparation. Passing is essential, and the skills you develop here will benefit you for Step 2 and Step 3. **Tldr- Take Step 1 seriously.**\n\n### What is the format of Step 1?\n\nThe exam is held over one day, divided into seven 60-minute blocks. It's an 8-hour session, with an optional 15-minute tutorial and 45 minutes of break time included. Each block contains a varying number of questions, up to a maximum of 40, with a total of no more than 280 questions on Step 1. \n\nYou can run the [Step 1 interactive testing experience here](https://orientation.nbme.org/Launch/USMLE/STPF1), to get used to the test software prior to taking the exam. It\u2019s the same interface as UWorld/Bootcamp/any big question bank.\n\n### How many questions do I need to answer correctly to pass?\n\nThe USMLE doesn\u2019t release this data, but based on historical norms and the new passing standard of 196, you need to score higher than the lowest 5th percentile of students. That usually comes out to answering \\~60% of the questions correctly. \n\n### When should I start preparing?\n\nYou should\u2019ve been preparing through M1/M2. Most schools give you a dedicated study period in your 4th semester to pass the exam, so you want to start studying heavier in the 6 months leading up to that.\n\n### What are the best resources for Step 1?\n\nThis guide does not favor one product over another, and the price tag doesn't necessarily reflect the quality. These resources have been effective for many students and are provided to assist you in making informed choices.\n\n#### Most popular resources for Step 1\n\n1. [UWorld:](https://www.uworld.com/step1/step1_qbank.aspx) Popular qbank with good explanations and images. Some questions can be harder than the real exam, but good practice.\n2. [Med School Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.com/med-school): A well-rounded resource for Step 1 prep. Has both great video lessons and a qbank similar to Step 1.\n3. [First Aid](https://www.mhprofessional.com/usmle): Great for a high-level, high-yield overview of target areas for review. As valuable as it is, First Aid is not recommended as a stand-alone resource. Also if you like books, this is the best option.\n4. [Anking](https://www.ankihub.net/step-deck): If you swear by Anki, this is the deck for you. It\u2019s worth the $5 to get the latest deck.\n5. [Pathoma](https://www.pathoma.com/): Video lessons covering high yield pathology. Step 1 has gotten progressively harder so it\u2019s good for a high level overview, but Ch. 1-3 is still a helpful refresher on core concepts. All content is covered in other resources.\n6. [NBME Self-Assessments](https://www.nbme.org/examinees/self-assessments): Web based self assessments. Do these towards the end of your dedicated period. You want to be scoring 65%+ consistently to pass.\n7. [NBME Free 120](https://orientation.nbme.org/Launch/USMLE/STPF1): Everyone should do this before their exam. [Review the explanations here](https://bootcamp.com/blog/new-free-120-nbme-step-1-explanations) after.\n8. [Sketchymedical:](https://www.sketchy.com/) Good for visual learners. Mostly known for its microbiology series. Pharm/path series have mixed reception.\n9. [Amboss](https://www.amboss.com/us): Top contender to UW, but also adds a library so you can look up anything. I recommend downloading their Anki extension.\n10. [Boards and Beyond:](https://www.boardsbeyond.com/homepage) Decent video review source, although some videos look a little outdated. Step 1 qbank quality is a bit of a miss, but good practice after watching the video.\n11. [Pixorize](https://pixorize.com/): A visual mnemonic series for biochemistry, microbiology, immunology, and pharmacology, similar to Sketchy. Recommended mostly for biochem. \n12. [Lecturio:](https://www.lecturio.com/medical/usmle-step-1-qbank/) Some people use this for classes, but not really used for Step 1.\n\n#### YouTube Channel Recommendations\n\n1. [Dirty Medicine](https://www.youtube.com/c/DirtyMedicine?app=desktop): Known for excellent biochemistry videos and mnemonics.\n2. [Randy Neil biostatistics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuyQGqW98Zlsm4MInaD2LJCub8i9D3pms): Good playlist covering biostats.\n3. [Ninja Nerd Official](https://www.youtube.com/@NinjaNerdOfficial): Goes into a ton of detail, better for classes.\n4. [Med School Moose](https://www.youtube.com/@MedSchoolMoose): Good for buzzwords and HY Images.\n\n### Quick tips on Step 1 strategy\n\n* Read the last sentence of the question first. Sometimes, that\u2019s all you need to answer the question, and the rest of the information is fluff.\n* Pay attention to any histology, pathology, tumor markers, high confidence evidence, etc. This will usually override any vague/conflicting clinical information in the question.\n* Your first answer is probably right. Avoid changing answers unless you are 100% sure.\n* \u201cWhich of the following is a risk factor for x\u2026\u201d the answer is smoking.\n* If the disease is lasting months and there\u2019s weight loss, it\u2019s cancer. UNLESS if you suspect GI involvement, then it could be a bunch of things.\n* If you can\u2019t interpret the media questions (ex. heart sounds), you can probably answer the question without it. Look at the case history for clues.\n* About 15-20% of your questions will be experimental (unscored) questions. So don\u2019t get stuck on the impossibly hard questions, make your best guess and move on.\n\n### Step 1 Study Schedules\n\n* [9-week study schedule](https://bootcamp.com/blog/9-week-step-1-study-schedule) from Bootcamp, they have a system-based schedule too.\n* [10-week study schedule ](https://elitemedicalprep.com/the-ultimate-10-week-step-1-study-schedule/)from Elite Medical Prep\n\n### Passed posts from the P/F era\n\n* [Unconventional prep: Passed Step 1 using ONLY Bootcamp + Sketchy + UW primarily. Did NOT use First Aid AT ALL.](https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/1b6ygm9/unconventional_prep_passed_step_1_using_only/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n* [4 Month Dedicated Step 1 Prep Schedule Breakdown ](https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/175g6mu/passed_my_step_1_4_month_journey/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n* [PASSED!! You can do it too](https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/wlwpif/passed_you_can_do_it_too/)\n* [I passed with <55% NBME!!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/16hljrj/i_passed_with_55_nbme/)\n* [Passed Step 1 with resource breakdown, study methods and advice (long post)](https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/yyt6ay/passed_step_1_my_journey_advice_long_post/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n* [IMG Step 1 Journey, PASS](https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/19ffsze/passed_dare_to_believe/)\n* [Passed Step with low UWSAs + Resource Breakdown](https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/1ar7q9o/passed_with_really_low_uwsas/)\n* [11 Month Prep for Step 1, resource breakdown with study methods](https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/1765lpc/heres_how_i_passed_without_basic/)\n* [Write-Up on Stats, Sources, Exam Thoughts, and Advice.](https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/130qyhz/passed_yesterday_entire_writeup_on_stats_sources/)\n* [Passed Step 1 with 4 resources!](https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/14f2dqi/passed_step_1_with_4_resources/)\n\n#### When do I get my Step 1 results?\n\nUsually, you'll get your exam results within 2\u20134 weeks after completion. If you pass, you won't receive specific feedback on the content. If you fail, you'll receive details on how close you were to passing, along with feedback on the content.\n\nScores for all USMLE Step exams are usually released on Wednesdays. [Check USMLE announcements](https://www.usmle.org/announcements) for possible score result delays.\n\nYour permit will disappear on Sunday/Monday before an expected Wednesday score release on the NBME website (or OASIS if you\u2019re IMG). Or your permit will disappear when your eligibility ends, whichever happens first.\n\n\u2018Permit disappear\u2019 means the print button is gone. If you see the print button, your permit has not disappeared.\n\n\ud83d\udccc Feel free to message the mods if you want anything added to this sticky thread.",

So many people always ask how to use UW, blah blah and so many people slept on the amazing features available on uworld like the analysis section, the charts etc, keeping track of average time spent per question and also noting how many times the user changed the answers and what category (wrong to wrong, wrong to correct, correct to wrong). \n\nThe last one really helped me understand that I tend to change wrong answers to correct ones most of the time based on my stats so I continued the approach in my NBMEs and the exam itself.",

            "Seen a few of these posts lately. I was here (exactly here, down to the engagement) and I did a break up during dedicated. I'll say the same thing I've said on the others- If she calls it off, then that's on her. She couldn't take it, it's not your fault, lots of people can't, be glad you found out before you got engaged or married because the time and dedication doesn't stop after step 1. You're working on a future right now, one that she currently stands to benefit from. Your partner should be supporting you through this in every way possible, no exceptions. A lot of people will say you just need to leave her. I agree, but don't don't just yet.\u00a0\n\n\nRight now, you have one objective- pass. I know it's hard, but you just gotta put the relationship on a back burner, don't fight, don't deal with the engagement, don't give any of it the time of day, and don't feel guilty. Just pacify as much as possible. If you've got to stay somewhere else so you can focus, that's totally okay- go stay with your family or whoever you have. I'd avoid\u00a0going through a breakup during dedicated if you can. It\u00a0can be devastating to your ability to study. Wait until after you've passed, then consider if a person that refuses to be supportive of you during your time of need is really someone you can trust to be with for the rest of your life. If not, then shortly after step is a good time to call it.\u00a0If she decides to break it off now- get it done fast, separate the stuff, then block her. Any communication after it's done is only going to take way more time and distract you more. I know it sucks, but if you let it get to you, it'll get a lot worse. She can walk away completely unscathed if she'd like, but if you let her mess with your ability to move forward in your career, you take damage regardless of if you two stay together or not.\u00a0",
            "Have a talk with her. If she doesn't understand Leave her.\n\n\nLife is tough.\u00a0\nThere are going to be times where you won't be able to give her time, love and care, a person deserves, and there will be times when she won't be able to do so.\n\n\nPartners are partners for tough times too, they need to understand this.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0We need people more when we are going through rough times, good times well, if you offer me a beer and a party, why would I or anyone say no?
