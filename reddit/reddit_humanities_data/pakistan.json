        "content": "So this simple but impactful encounter just happened to me in my city (Riyadh), I decided to go out for a walk in a new neighbourhood assuming every neighbourhood is as safe as mine (big mistake). But a black creepy car with no plates (basically like every car you see in a crime investigation show) kept following me everywhere and going back in circles and stopping when I stopped like they were making sure if I was alone, to a point where I booked an uber and called the cops to send someone because it kept getting closer, and they told me only if the person comes up to me or harasses me they can send help. So I called the uber not to be late explaining to him the situation and when he arrived I told him to make sure the car isn't following us, he asked who he was, I said idk, but I thought he didn't understand me because he was way too chill watching tiktok at the stop light lol, so I kept looking back for the car myself but the uber driver said in his broken Arabic something like \"Don't be afraid of anyone, you're with a Pakistani\". It was a simple statement but it was all I needed to hear for the fear to disappear. So yes he did understand me the first time, and now I'm safe at the park enjoying the rest of my night. Thank you to all men who fear god, and protect women in an unsafe world, as this is one of many positive situations I've experienced with Pakistanis throughout my life. ",
