I don't care sister if you have a 3 layered burqa on so that men doesn't gaze upon you or you are wearing tight jeans, if there is a line respect it! It is not about not respecting women it bout respect to each and every individual. at the ATM everyone follows the line, at the nearby Tandoor we have a tokenized system but the cashier usually get their orders by going behind. Of course I usually give space to senior citizens whether it be men or women. All those saying aapki ammi ya behn k sath karein aisa acha lagega kia? Mothers are considered as snr citizens and mein apni ammi ka in kaamon k liye bahar nikalna pasand nahi karta. My sister doesn't go out for chores, her husband does but even if she did I would prefer that she stands in a line GIVEN THAT MEN DO NOT STARE AT HER AND MAKE HER FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE. \nIn a nutshell, try to make women feel comfortable around you, stop staring at them and then make them follow the norm.",
            "I remember when at work I would finish up and stand at the punch machine 15 minutes earlier, and then we would all form a line. The women would brazenly walk up to the front, the other people would stop me from punching, letting all the women punch first. When we get to the secretory gate, getting stopped just to let all the women out first, like bro I worked 12 hours of physical labour, I wanna get out, how is this fucking fair",

But a black creepy car with no plates (basically like every car you see in a crime investigation show) kept following me everywhere and going back in circles and stopping when I stopped like they were making sure if I was alone, to a point where I booked an uber and called the cops to send someone because it kept getting closer, and they told me only if the person comes up to me or harasses me they can send help. So I called the uber not to be late explaining to him the situation and when he arrived I told him to make sure the car isn't following us, he asked who he was, I said idk, but I thought he didn't understand me because he was way too chill watching tiktok at the stop light lol, so I kept looking back for the car myself but the uber driver said in his broken Arabic something like \"Don't be afraid of anyone, you're with a Pakistani\". It was a simple statement but it was all I needed to hear for the fear to disappear. So yes he did understand me the first time, and now I'm safe at the park enjoying the rest of my night. Thank you to all men who fear god, and protect women in an unsafe world, as this is one of many positive situations I've experienced with Pakistanis throughout my life. ",
