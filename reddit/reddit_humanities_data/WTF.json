They are in the order Hemiptera- as are assassin bugs which can bite- but assassin bugs typically don't aggregate nor wander around all willy-nilly in the open. Assassin bugs are solitary ambush predators. The only risk you'd have touching these guys would be self-inflicted psychological trauma.",

Ah, well, sub-rosa is the type of surveillance that is undetectable by the subject.  Our trained professionals surveil the subject from a distance and under various forms of cover.  The Super-rosa option is just the opposite. We offer highly visible surveillance operations to let the subject know they are being watched.  The Sub-rosa is $250 an hour and the Super-rosa is $250 per day.  Ok, sure, let us know! Thanks for calling.\"",
