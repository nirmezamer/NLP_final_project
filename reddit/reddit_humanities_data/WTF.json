Fire ants went flying everywhere, and lots of pain followed.\n\nThe cockroaches were something else too. Those terrified me more than anything. I had a nest inside my dishwasher that I was deathly afraid to open, because if you did about a dozen would come scurrying out of it, the entire inside was covered in roaches, the big, dark brown flying ones about 2 inches long.",
