At some point, I even feel like they're just making shit up to get these beautiful restless girls eliminated. Like what?! Even Cheer makes a whole lot more sense than this. Leave it to america to make a big deal out of nothing. \n\nEdit: Oh, and not to mention the life-long injuries you'd sustain after the season's over. Just. Wow. ",

            "I just started watching it and from episode 1 , I was shocked by their underpayment despite their significant contributions to the franchise. Despite their hard work and dedication, they barely make minimum wage. Considering the physical demands and commitment required, it's baffling that these cheerleaders, who bring in significant revenue for the Dallas Cowboys, are not rewarded accordingly. I can't help but wonder if Charlotte Jones and others in management are laughing behind their backs at how these talented women essentially work for very little. In any other industry, top talent like this would be compensated fairly. For instance, top background dancers for pop singers reportedly earn between $30,000 to $50,000 annually, whereas the documentary revealed that Cowboys cheerleaders earn only around $10,000. The Dallas Cowboys could easily afford to pay them more. Like hello ladies wake up you are being used. What a great documentary exposing misogyny...",
            "[deleted]",
            "What I love about this show is how hilariously important it is to all of the people in charge.\n\nThey pick 32 or whatever. If they just ditched the top 32 and took the next 32 no one on earth would ever notice. Their job is completely unimportant past the initial screening of people who apply but it means everything in the world to them. Thats inherently entertaining to me.",
            "They had a show on CMT for many years called \u201cMaking the Team\u201d. This seems to be just a continuation of that. It\u2019s completely a status thing for those that make it. And there\u2019s also the \u201clegacy\u201d girls who are daughters of ladies who were DCC in the 70s & 80s. It\u2019s a crazy, weird environment.",
            "They don't pay them well because they don't have to. If, miraculously, women just stopped trying out, I promise panic would set in and pay would increase. That will never happen, though. Being a DCC is like royalty in Texas.",
            "I knew a woman in college that ended up making the Cowboys cheerleader squad. It was her dream, most of the professional cheerleaders think of it the same way, it's about their dance career. This particular woman danced at a private dance studio in school, after graduating she was on the University's dance team, then after college she started cheering for an Arena Football League team, then the local NFL team. After a few years she was able to make the Cowboys squad and was on the old Cowboys cheerleader show. \n\nAll the former college dancers I know are very proud of their time, and it was devastating to them if they didn't make the pro teams. It's not unlike any other competition, it is a passion at this level, and to some of them it may be a stepping stone into their profession as a professional dancer or an owner/coach of a dance studio.",
            "Honestly, I was thinking the same thing. What annoys me is that one of the owners admitted that they aren't paid enough! Surely you could change that then, especially when you were talking about how much they are important to the brand - explotation much?!\nI am also getting Americas Next Top Model vibes when they talk about their weight, it makes me so mad! When they said one of the girls had 'Weight on her face', like wtf is that?",
            "It was very wholesome. Disordered eating, performance anxiety, cutthroat culture, random \"jiggle audits\", cha-ching, low pay.\n\nVictoria was robbed.",
            "I had the same thoughts while watching. The football players make millions, but the cheerleaders don't even make a living wage? I was shocked. The misogyny is still strong, I see. Not to mention all the pressure, stress, and lack of sleep, as well as the injuries/surgeries they have to endure. No thank you. It would not be worth it to me. The women in charge (DCC alumni) also rubbed me the wrong way. I get that it's a brand, but they were so harsh and critical, even though they admitted that it wasn't like that back in their day. Their moment is over, but they still want to cling to the past as much as they can. Even using outdated music. Okay, so AC/DC is an amazing band and Thunderstruck is a classic. I get that it's also tradition to dance to that song, but come on... at some point they need to come into the modern era.",
            "It's classic supply and demand. There is a ton of supply, there are thousands of very talented women vying for those few positions."
