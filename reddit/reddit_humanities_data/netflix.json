I cannot close this window, other than declining or accepting the price and am therefore locked out from my content, unless I will make an immediate decision.

The fact that she had been beaten and shot through the movie wasn\u2019t that ridiculous compared to being within a fatal proximity to a grenade blast.\n\nThe story was actually pretty OK. I guess another criticism I have is how the COPS infiltrated a military depot and stole weapons without getting caught by a sentry.\n\nThis movie was entertaining dumb action movie.",
