            "I would love to make some 3dprints of my child's favorite toys and the scanner would be the easiest way to recreate them",
            "Most of my models I do require them having quite precise measurements to fit into real objects. The main issue that I run into is making sure my dimensions are correct. With the 3d scanner I could scan the real object and model around that scan, making the modeling job way easier and take way less attempts and test prints that don't fit. For example I enjoy the hobby locksport. 3d models need to fit pretry precisely with the locks if I want it to work as I intend, whether it be holding the lock in position in a vice meaning it has to fit just right around the lock, or a follower to push out the core, getting the dimensions as close as possible is a must.",
