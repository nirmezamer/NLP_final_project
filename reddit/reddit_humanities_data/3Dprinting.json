You can choose your canopy (infill) and cut it down to find the tree inside.\n\nI've always wanted to print it in multicolor and have the tree be different from the canopy. The model is just the tree and canopy, the pot is a random one I found online.\n\nEdit: forgot to add the [link](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5710622)\n\nEdit 2: if I win a printer that can do 3 or more colors, I'd love to make an apple tree with apples hidden in the infill to find. Especially because I work in the apple industry.",

I went through several design iterations with spirometric testing to find an optimal design that can be rapidly produced by a 3D printer. It is designed as a single object with a pause during printing to insert a stainless steel ball. The design itself can be quickly customized with the patient\u2019s name, and we have seen this creates improved compliance in our subjects. The total production cost per device is about $2, and for comparison, consumer level devices within the same therapeutic category range from $60 to $150. My vision is that as 3D printing continues to become more end-user friendly it will be easier for patients and providers to get dispensable medical equipment at extremely reasonable costs compared to the US healthcare system right now. (shout out to BBL for setting a new bar! I\u2019ve been in 3D design and rapid prototyping for the past 15 years now and have seen it all grow)",
