Cat bites are full of bacteria and require a good cleaning and antibiotics. \nThese two seem to be testing the boundaries but I don\u2019t see aggression to the point where it would be dangerous.",

She seemed herself after a few days though! Your girl will get through it and then you won\u2019t have to deal with her being in heat :)",
            "It's hard, seeing them recovering from anaesthesia, but I promise, it's the drugs that are the worst part, not the spay itself. \n\nShe will quite likely bounce back in a day or two at the most, and then you'll just have a cute little nugget in a onesie. \n\nMy pup (labrador) had the same onesie, and within 24 hours, she was bouncing off the wall as usual. I'm sure yours will be the same! \n\nIn all seriousness, you did your dog a favour. Getting pregnant and having puppies unintentionally can be very challenging, labour and delivery can be dangerous, and you won't have a mess of puppies to contend with. \n\nYou also reduced her risk of developing a handful of different types of cancer that could have shortened her life. \n\nGive her all the love and cuddles she wants, slowly and gently, and she'll be back to herself in no time, I promise.",

            "Did they do bloodwork? My dog had a day where she puked, I took her to the vet they did bloodwork and said she was dehydrated, try to feed rice and chicken and come back if she doesn't improve in a couple days. Next day she wasn't puking but also wasn't eating. Also did the scary dog thing of sitting off by herself (usually she is anxious and follows me). Took her to the vet they gave me anti nausea meds and said to get bloodwork again if it isn't better in a couple days. Next day she was so lethargic and shaking and still not eating I thought she was dying so took her for more bloodwork and they found out she was in an addisonian crisis (addisons disease) she needed to be hospitalized and will need meds for life, but all good now! If I hadn't kept bringing her in she would have died.\n\nThis to say that if you think something is really wrong, keep bringing her in and get bloodwork. Addison's disease is rare so it probably isn't that, but there is always the chance it's something serious!",

In the meantime, check her gums and make sure they are still pinkish red, if not, use a syringe to feed sugar water to keep her from becoming hypoglycemic.",

I just make sure he pees and feed him and give him a chew and his medicine and by the time he\u2019s done with the chew he\u2019s pretty much down. He does occasionally wake up but he won\u2019t get off his bed for anything. Make sure you talk to your vet about side effects because even though it\u2019s safe the first time I saw him on it was scary. It\u2019s only really as needed, and it doesn\u2019t seem to stress him he\u2019s so high that he doesn\u2019t care but he\u2019s like falling over until it knocks him out."
