They may see things (flies are common) that are not there and become anxious and afraid as a result. His flattened ears and constant lip licking are fear signals. He should be examined by a specialist.",

            "He could have spots on his eyes like a Cadirrac, my dog dies sort of the same thing but he also does fly biting at the same time. Thats when hes having a seizure, Im not saying that what your dogs doing, idk. It just kinda reminds me of that, I would call your vet. My dog has been on seizure medication for a year now.",
            "My dog does this with light reflections. Could be the smallest glimmer. The tags on her collar are the most random and she can never keep her focus on the reflections because if she moves, the light reflection moves. She also has done this with any flying insect, she lets me know if there's a new cob web on the ceiling this way."

        "content": "I\u2019ve got two dogs, Bluey (an 8 year old tan ridgeback cross) and Keeley (a 5 year old black and white bull arab cross) who have lived together for over 5 years. \n\nThis last month Keeley has begun having these violent outbursts at Bluey, seemingly totally unprovoked. \nThe only common thread that I\u2019ve seen is that it\u2019s when Bluey and I are both on the couch. My guess is that it\u2019s Keeley fighting for a spot on the couch? But really I\u2019m not sure. \nThese episodes begin as per the video. Everything\u2019s fine then Keeley tenses up, gets her hackles up and begins a low growl at Bluey. Bluey may growl back or sometimes just eyeballs her. \nThis goes on for about 10 seconds then they onto each other.\nEach time it\u2019s only stopped when I physically separate them and put Keeley in time out outside. After a cooling off period of 10 min it\u2019s like nothing happened. \nI\u2019ve tried a firm command verbally and calming voices but each time physically separating them is the only way to stop it. \n\nThey\u2019re both rescues, Keeley in particular was super anxious when first got her but over the years she\u2019s improved substantially. Now it seems like she\u2019s taking it all out on Bluey, a dog who except where food is concerned (they get fed separately) is chill as. \n\nThe video attached is one of the more chilled out encounters, I\u2019ve needed both hands to separate them otherwise. Right after the video stopped Keeley lunged at Bluey again. \n\nAny advice for what might be the cause? My guess this is developing sibling rivalry as Keeley\u2019s maturing. \nI\u2019ve got a vet visit booked in case it\u2019s something else. She\u2019s otherwise physically well",

            "So the black dog definitely shouldnt have been allowed up on the couch after that and you most definitely should not have stroked her after it. What kind of message are you giving off there? Youre saying if you act aggresively to your sibling then you can come sit next to me and i'll stroke you. Thats bonkers!",
            "Training is more about you than the dog. Like the others have said, you are rewarding bad behavior. You need to stop this now. This isn't about shaming you, but you are doing it all wrong and need to correct yourself before you can do it with the dogs.",
            "What ever happened to telling the black dog to knock it off? You rewarded the behavior. If my dog even gives a hard look at another dog, they get reminded to behave.",
            "Looks like guarding behavior to me. They are communicating clearly between themselves about the couch or you. \nYou just arent comprehending whats being said.",
            "There were plenty of signs. Stiff body language as one.",
            "Any of that shit and theyre both on the floor.",
            "This is not out of the blue in any way- you can see her body and posture change, her face changes, and she pulls her ears back. This is your moment to intervene, not reward the behavior.",
            "both dogs off the couch would be what I'd do. Keely has played second fiddle for five years and now she's probably figured out she doesn't have to as Bluey is getting older. We don't let our dogs on our furniture and if we want to snuggle we go down to them. Helps when visitors come that the dogs know the boundaries.",
            "Good grief. I about dropped my phone, I wasn't expecting that.",
            "No pets after being like that to their sibling- you need to separate them for a little next time and do not give pets. If you don't, the aggression and pushing boundaries will get worse."

Cat bites are full of bacteria and require a good cleaning and antibiotics. \nThese two seem to be testing the boundaries but I dont see aggression to the point where it would be dangerous.",

            "No. Mostly the cat seems annoyed (check body language: ears folded, the long high pitched meow, the swishing tail). Do you also annoy the cat? Because, if not, maybe the cat is stressed by having to coexist with an overly excited puppy and that's why he's biting you, too.\n\nI'd suggest to redirect the dog's interest in something else. Let her waste energy in long walks, training or even toys."
