        "content": "**Hello there.**\n\nYou might've noticed the subreddit's mod list has changed a few times over the last three months, and we'd like to inform you as to why along with our vision for the future of the community.\n\nTo start off, my name is Asher, and I along with the other current moderators on the team have been involved in community management for several years, and are going to be handling mod operations on r/Money moving forward.\n\nWhile we're still investigating the cause, the previous two mod teams were removed for a combination of being inactive (why you were seeing so many low effort/quality posts the last few weeks) and violating **Reddit's** [**Moderator Code of Conduct**](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/moderator-code-of-conduct), specifically the part regarding **moderating with integrity (R5)**.\n\nAs of this moment, we are working on implementing new ways to ensure transparency in the actions we take to uphold civility and focus on the subreddits central topic, money. This will be done to reduce the risk of anything similar to the previously mentioned behaviors taking place by any individual member on the team in the future. The goal of this subreddit is and has always been to foster a community focused on the discussion of anything related to money and financial moves, and bad actors taking advantage of positions of power impacts everyone involved negatively.\n\nOver the next few days, there will be more changes to the subreddit (formatting, rules and guidelines, and the creation of subreddit-specific wiki pages) to further encourage positive/conducive user activity.\n\nIf you have any further questions, comments, suggestions, or concerns, feel free to forward them to us directly via Reddit [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMoney).\n\nThank you for being a part of our community, and best regards,\n\nu/AsherFennec, u/ARoyaleWithCheese, u/ddftgr2a, u/lmaodaniel, u/Randomperson0012, u/strikingsubsidy27, u/sled603, and u/f0rkster",

Try for twice a week. Then once a week. Then once a fortnight. Phase it out.",

Or a tall glass of lemonade. Something to take the place of Fast Food. You could also try something like, whenever you\u2019re driving to the Fast Food place, detour to a park first. Take a lap around the park. Tell yourself it\u2019s your reward for having such a healthy body. Then after the lap assess how you feel.\n\nThe point is to break the craving/satisfy habit."
