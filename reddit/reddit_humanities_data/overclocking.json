I got this kit from AliExpress for \u00a365 in a sale.\n\nMy 8200 kit had tRP stuck at 43 at 8000, used 1.75v for tCL32 and tRFC was at 120.\n\nThis kit took a bit more tuning to match tPHYRDL at 8000, liking more VDDP than the other kit and I used 2/2/2 on the phaseshifts.\n\nAnd yes, it needed 1.69v VDD. Didn't just do it for memes. 1.68v brought an error an hour and something in.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2xapawdo148d1.png?width=2150&format=png&auto=webp&s=561c61e786a2446cb957c16f256bc29e3b7e33f9\n\nI've played a bit with tCL30, but it's needing like 1.92v and it's really just the read bandwidth being pumped a bit more at this point. 11.125w max pumping through each DIMM \ud83d\ude02\n\nEven on water, I'll stick with tCL32 \ud83d\udc4d",

            "That read bandwidth is marginally better despite a 0.23v increase in RAM VDD. At 8000 MT/s and up, lowering tCL that low is more about shoving voltage into it than it is a worthy performance increase.\n\nNevertheless, seeing tCL 30 at 8000 MT/s is impressive even if nearly 2v.",
            "Latency would probably be better as well if the CPU wasn't the limiting factor at this point. I don't have the best 7950x3D and AIDA can become quite CPU sensitive with latency when pushing this hard.\n\nBut yeah, tCL dropping on its own is just about eating voltage now. Nothing else really scales with voltage at this level. tRP is a much more beneficial timing when it comes to read speed/Karhu speed."

But the price (250 euro) really puts me off.\n\nSo, I'm thinking of getting the Thermalright Frozen Notte 360 and I'd like to know, firstly, if it's enough for each of my configurations and, secondly, in which one it's going to be enough but short on margin.\n\nThen, if it's not enough, what watercooling would you recommend for each of these configurations?\n\nIn the event that the Thermalright Frozen Notte 360 is large enough for my use cases, I've heard someone say that they've modified the ventilation curve and I'd like to know how to do it because there's no software. I'm going to take an MSI Z790 Gaming Plus WiFi.\n\nThanks in advance\n\nPS: If you have anything to alert me about the Thermalright Frozen Notte 360 (noise, fan problem, rgb, pump,etc..) let me know.",

            "Few things here, if you\u2019re looking for a 360 AIO the Arctic Liquid Freezer III is basically the best performing AIO for under $250 here in the US (it\u2019s around $120 here). Since the company is German I also *think* you can get that for around \u20ac125 or less and avoid the huge markup a lot of computer components have in Europe, so it\u2019s an even better deal there. The Thermalright should also be fine because\u2026\n\nSecond, there\u2019s no real need for a 360 AIO for a 13/14600KF. I have a 13600KF running on a < $40 air cooler (Frost Spirit 140), and undervolted/overclocked by 300MHz on the P-cores and 200MHz on E-cores it never touches 70\u00b0 unless running something like Cinebench or y-cruncher (only pulls 155W). You would only need a 360 liquid cooling setup for more extreme overclocking, at which point why not buy a more powerful CPU than an i5?\n\nThird, do you already have a 13600KF? If so I wouldn\u2019t waste money to upgrade from a 13600KF to 14600KF. The performance increase is less than 5% and the 14600KF is already clocked 200MHz higher stock. Once you overclock both of them the difference is going to be even smaller. Even a 14700K is only going to give maybe 10% better performance. Of course it\u2019s your money so spend it how you want, but I\u2019m trying to understand your situation better to make a good recommendation versus just saying, \u201cspend a lot of money for no reason.\u201d",
