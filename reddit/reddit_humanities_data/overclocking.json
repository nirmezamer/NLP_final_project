        "content": "tWRWR_sg value seems to be connected to tCCD L. I have my tertiaries at 7477 but because of tCCD L at 8, my second group of tertiaries ends up being 8477 (currently they are 7471 and 8471 since I put all the dd timings to 1 to avoid confusion as I don't need those values) My question is, should I leave that value at 8, or pull it down to 7? The jedec value seems to be 6, but then that sets tWRWR_sg to 6 as well and according to the guide that can cause write bandwidth regression? My ocd is getting triggered. I feel like putting them all at 8488 or something. Am I being stupid? \n\nRam is 2 x 16gb 3200 mt/s cl16 ram (Samsung c die) overclocked to 3700 mt/s cl 18. \n\nCpu is i9 10900k\n\nBoard is Gigabyte aorus z490 pro",

        "content": "Alright, so I have a Microsoft surface pro 5/2017 with an i7-7660u that I want to undervolt. After doing some research, turns out the voltage control was locked in a bios update and according to another thread that I found downgrading the bios isn't possible. I remember on a good amount of Lenovo and dell laptops that had voltage control disabled, I dumped the bios, opened up the Rom in uefitool, searched for a term, opened the section in ifrextractor, found the address of the flag that needs to be changed, then boot up an efi file from where I can enter a shell and change that specific flag, then after a reboot I would be happy to see throttle stop letting me unlock voltage control. Now the problem is, I've looked through nearly the entire bios dump by searching and found no reference to overclocking/voltage unlock, and ifrextractor doesn't seem to be able to extract a part of the bios into a readable form. Now I can't find the specific flag to change, nor am I able to downgrade my bios. Is anyone here able to help me out or clarify?",
