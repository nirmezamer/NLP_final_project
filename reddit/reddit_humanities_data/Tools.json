We also don\u2019t like getting buckets of reports in the inbox.\n\nIf someone posts/comments with politics, resist the urge to reply and argue. Just report, downvote (if that\u2019s your jam) and move on with life.\n\nA small flag, sticker, etc that appears in a photo will generally be allowed (so long as it doesn\u2019t violate other rules and doesn\u2019t draw a bunch of reports) but a bunch of people in the comments saying \u201cHell Yeah, a fellow [INSERT PARTY] Supporter!\u201d is gonna get the post pulled. Political content that is clearly the motivation for the post will get the post pulled.\n\nFirst time it\u2019s a short ban, second time it\u2019s permanent. And as we\u2019ve discussed before, the mod team doesn\u2019t go looking for posts, we\u2019re not lifeguards, we respond to the reports we receive.",

It just all needs to stay out and you guys do a great job with it imo.",

CCP/ChINa!!!\" post or comment, I'll self-immolate.\n\n\"Are these tools made in China/have China-manufactured materials?\" Sure, why not. Folks have the right to know the provenance of things they buy.\n\n\"These tools from China aren't very good quality, *because, x*\"--sure, debating the merits of different tools is kind of the point.\n\nThe political stuff and virtue signaling about it doesn't belong in the subreddit, IMHO.",

I watch quite more then I care to admit tool youtube channels. So I have a background in useing tools in the automotive, construction,  and some other industries. No brand preference however there is a time to recommend a more expensive tool vs harbor freight for that thing you need one time!",
            "I vow to do the bare minimum. I'll delete spam posts and political stuff. I believe a moderator is a janitor and nothing else. I will not support blackouts or anything else of the like. If the website or r/tools wants to change in a way I don't agree with I will quit. I'm offering to take the job because I like the part of r/tools that teaches people, however small it may be. I feel this sub has previously been under and poorly moderated, I'm not afraid to say it, and I'd like to see it change.\n\nI'm willing to work with the Reddit desktop site running on Firefox, either desktop or android.\n\nEdit: short videos of cheap tools do not bother me, there's no rule against it, I think it's better content than the usual 'hey look at my new Milwaukee' or 'crapsman bad upvotes to the left' posts. Tool tiktoks =/= spam",
            "I'd be willing to help. I definitely think removing those low effort short videos showing some junk gimmick tool is something that should be done. 9/10 it's either karma farming or directly spamming drop ship sites. This subreddit is in my feed pretty often and I've seen a lot of low effort posts, so I'm sure others are sick of it too. Can speak to how often they get removed after I see them. \n\nI mod two moderate traffic subs basically alone that see different kind of spam, and I like to keep a clean house.",

            "So I'm not throwing my hat in on this, but from what I've seen over the years, it usually helps to tap one or two of the most active members of the community when expanding the moderation ranks.  \n\nThey're already spending a lot of time on the page/forum/sub/etc helping and chatting with people anyway, so they're able to be more responsive.  They also usually have a better feel for what's ok and not ok and can arbitrate issues a bit more even-handedly.\n\nSome care has to be taken not to accidentally play favorites or let things get clique-ish, as well as to avoid dumping all the weight on one or two people, but I haven't seen any indication that any of these need to be worried about here.",

Back at the store, they got hung up on the physical act of exchanging my broken screwdriver. The only instance of that tool is in a 10 or 18pk, and they wanted me to bring in the \"set of screwdrivers in the original packaging.\"\n\nThe employees are just trained poorly.",

Trust me I\u2019ve exchanged allot I mean ALLOT or craftsman stuff that didn\u2019t match the model number crap! Some Lowe\u2019s workers just don\u2019t give a F and make the transaction possible, I\u2019ve exchanged sockets, screwdrivers, wrenches of all types and sizes! I also pick out the most expensive shit but comparable.",
            "In my opinion:\n\nTo hell with Craftsman... both the drama & tool quality have been dismal since the early 70's. They may have worked a little on appearance & packaging, but beyond that... nada.\n\nPricy now as well.\n\nYou should see the dust on the Craftsman stock at our local Lowes... Ace Hardware too.\n\nThe scant remaining Craftsman I have was delegated to the 'loaner' box ages ago.\n\nNever looked back.\n\nHang the thing on the wall as a reminder; and begin researching for better; never thought I'd say it, but even HF's Icon stuff is superior.
