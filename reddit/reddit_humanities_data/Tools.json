We also don\u2019t like getting buckets of reports in the inbox.\n\nIf someone posts/comments with politics, resist the urge to reply and argue. Just report, downvote (if that\u2019s your jam) and move on with life.\n\nA small flag, sticker, etc that appears in a photo will generally be allowed (so long as it doesn\u2019t violate other rules and doesn\u2019t draw a bunch of reports) but a bunch of people in the comments saying \u201cHell Yeah, a fellow [INSERT PARTY] Supporter!\u201d is gonna get the post pulled. Political content that is clearly the motivation for the post will get the post pulled.\n\nFirst time it\u2019s a short ban, second time it\u2019s permanent. And as we\u2019ve discussed before, the mod team doesn\u2019t go looking for posts, we\u2019re not lifeguards, we respond to the reports we receive.",

So I stopped in the local craft store during lunch to get a seam ripper.  Walking around the store I saw the Husqvarna logo on a banner. I asked an older lady working  in the store \" what's up with the Husqvarna banner, I know you don't sell outdoor equipment here\". She informed me that Husqvarna also makes sewing machines and they have a very long history of making different products. \n \nWhat I learned from a Google search, the company was founded in 1689 to make muskets. They produced muskets and later on shotguns until 1989. They also made kitchen equipment out of cast iron, bicycles, motorcycles, and sewing machines before getting into outdoor equipment. \n\n \n \n\n",
