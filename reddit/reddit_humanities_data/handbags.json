        "content": "Hey folks! Welcome to the weekly question thread. Going forward for a short  while, we will be having a weekly question thread that will be pinned.  You can ask questions about specific bags that don\u2019t require an entire  review to see if anyone has the answer!\n\nWe are doing this so that we can start building up an FAQ so that your  questions can be more easily answered. Questions are NOT restricted to  this post, especially if those questions involve discussions! If you have posted in a previous Weekly Question Thread but your question was not answered, feel free to repost it again. \n\nHere are some example questions:\n\n1. Can an iPhone 13 Pro fit in the Loewe Mini Puzzle?\n2. What bag can I use in the rain under $X?\n3. Does this bag match this outfit? (Can be asked in this thread or as a discussion post).\n4. Has anyone had any experience shopping at <boutique> in <city>?\n\nExamples of what NOT to post:\n\n1. What bag are you wearing today? (This would be better as a discussion post).\n2. Where was your best boutique experience? (This would be better as a discussion post).\n3. Review  request for Mlouye! (There\u2019s a chance someone who\u2019s purchased won\u2019t see  it as a comment and may be better off as a post for now).\n\nThis thread will be reposted every Monday. You can always revisit any previous [Weekly Question Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/handbags/search/?q=flair_name%3A%22Weekly%20Questions%20%F0%9F%94%AE%22&restrict_sr=1). If you cannot see that link, please ensure that you toggle safe mode on your browser, then refresh and try again. Weekly Question Threads have their own post flairs to make searching easier. \n\nThank you for your continued patience as we continue to build up our community! \ud83d\udc96",

So please let me know if this isn\u2019t the best place TIA\n\nI want to buy handbags - one for daily use (one that fits my ipad) and smaller one for going out. I\u2019m not one to discriminate on any shapes but my only non negotiable is that I love long shoulder straps! I want a le pliage just because of that, but I\u2019d love different options. Maybe you guys have suggestions? Thank you in advance for your advice \u263a\ufe0f",

We were evacuating for wildfires. \n\nI'm only now beginning to investigate possible replacements. It was vintage Gucci clutch that belonged to my late grandmother and a caviar Chanel my father gave me in the 90s. \n\nIs there any site or resource someone can recommend to research the names and details of specific pieces from luxury brands? \n\nI feel like it's a long shot, but it would heal my heart a little to have the opportunity to look for similar pieces. The Chanel shoulder bag, for example, had a leather strap it appears isn't made anymore? TIA",

            "I'm looking for a hip/belt bag slash fanny pack that's leather, under $200, and can fit my EDC: phone (Google Pixel), keys, wallet, sunglass case, a small makeup bag, and--most importantly--my headphones. They're the Sony WH-1000XM4, and although they fold, they're still pretty bulky, like about 7\" long and 4\" wide when folded. I'm emphatically not an earbud girlie, so the bag's ability to fit my headphones is non-negotiable, and it's unfortunately put me at a bit of an impasse as I just can't seem to find a bag big enough to accommodate them. \n\nFor reference, I carry a Jansport fanny pack on the weekends that fits all of this just fine, but I'm looking for something a little dressier that can go with my business casual dress code at work. \n\nI found [this](https://kindlycamerabags.com/products/the-photographers-fanny-pack) and it looks like it might work, but $170 is a little more than I'm willing to spend on a brand I've never heard of.",

Ideally something with approx 2-3L volume, zip top, a few internal pockets for organization, and an adjustable strap.\n\nI really like the Lululemon festival bag\u2019s style and quality of construction, but not the foldover top. Uniqlo\u2019s mini shoulder bag looks a bit too casual and lacks enough space/internal pockets. Baggu\u2019s medium crescent looks to be the right size, but the style isn\u2019t for me.\n\nETA: the cheaper the better, but $200 max",
            "Hi! I am going to Tokyo and wanting to buy a new everyday crossbody or shoulder bag to take advantage of the exchange rate. I am late 30s mom with casual somewhat edgy (ie not classic or preppy) style. Here is what I am looking for:\n\n1. Casual Vibe (goes fine with athletic wear for school drop off etc)\n2. Outside or easy access phone pocket\n3. Small to medium size and not too heavy\n4. Zip top for security\n5. Durable finish as I am not going to baby the bag\n6. Prefer less in your face logo but i am open\n\nSo far I am struggling to fine one. The best I have seen so far is YSL envelope tri quilt in the black on black which gives it a more casual vibe. I do like that one but the logo is a bit more prominent that I was thinking. Any suggestions? Thanks so much in advance?"
