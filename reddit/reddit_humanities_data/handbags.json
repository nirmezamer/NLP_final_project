        "content": "Hey folks! Welcome to the weekly question thread. Going forward for a short  while, we will be having a weekly question thread that will be pinned.  You can ask questions about specific bags that don\u2019t require an entire  review to see if anyone has the answer!\n\nWe are doing this so that we can start building up an FAQ so that your  questions can be more easily answered. Questions are NOT restricted to  this post, especially if those questions involve discussions! If you have posted in a previous Weekly Question Thread but your question was not answered, feel free to repost it again. \n\nHere are some example questions:\n\n1. Can an iPhone 13 Pro fit in the Loewe Mini Puzzle?\n2. What bag can I use in the rain under $X?\n3. Does this bag match this outfit? (Can be asked in this thread or as a discussion post).\n4. Has anyone had any experience shopping at <boutique> in <city>?\n\nExamples of what NOT to post:\n\n1. What bag are you wearing today? (This would be better as a discussion post).\n2. Where was your best boutique experience? (This would be better as a discussion post).\n3. Review  request for Mlouye! (There\u2019s a chance someone who\u2019s purchased won\u2019t see  it as a comment and may be better off as a post for now).\n\nThis thread will be reposted every Monday. You can always revisit any previous [Weekly Question Threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/handbags/search/?q=flair_name%3A%22Weekly%20Questions%20%F0%9F%94%AE%22&restrict_sr=1).

Weekly Question Threads have their own post flairs to make searching easier. \n\nThank you for your continued patience as we continue to build up our community! \ud83d\udc96",

            "Hello! I\u2019m new and still unsure whether my question is for this thread or for a separate post. So please let me know if this isn\u2019t the best place TIA\n\nI want to buy handbags - one for daily use (one that fits my ipad) and smaller one for going out. I\u2019m not one to discriminate on any shapes but my only non negotiable is that I love long shoulder straps! I want a le pliage just because of that, but I\u2019d love different options. Maybe you guys have suggestions? Thank you in advance for your advice \u263a\ufe0f",

I've seen some folks asking for a way to help identify who owns what from the larger brands. With that in mind, I've been working on a small project to make the parent companies into something that can be more easily referenced and I'm asking for your help! I would love to add this information to the r/handbags wiki, but want to make sure that I don't miss out any brands. \n\nOn the wiki, this infographic will be in text and image format. Please let me know what additional brands you're looking to see added (and their parent group, if you're aware), if any information below is **incorrect**, and if you'd like to see any additional information either on the infographic or the wiki. I'm also open to changing this to a horizontal format, if that's easier for folks. \n\nBelow is the **first pass**, which means that this is a **draft only**. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cd6z01i2ae6d1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=011e953d89792453aa1ba5114b786b8f46ba8202\n\n# What is this megathread for?\n\n* Discussing transparency in the handbag industry based on [this news](https://www.reddit.com/r/handbags/comments/1deho2m/im_devastated_and_feeling_incredibly_guilty_for/) (multiple threads were posted, sharing the most popular one)\n* Discussing alternatives\n* Discussing parent groups and brands\n\n# Community rules still apply. \n\n* Please remember to be kind to one another.

My opinion is that it is an attempt to lend them some credibility and change their image. Only time will tell.",
