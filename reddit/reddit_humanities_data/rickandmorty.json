            "Huh I thought they already ended the script for season 8. Oh well, gonna wait a little more",
            "What ever happened to less waiting between seasons?",
            "And I'm still here waiting for season 7 to come here in my country",
            "Just a reminder that we had to wait 3 and a half years between season 3 and season 4.",
            "Even more reason to be excited for 2025. While I wait for GTA6 to install, I can watch season 8 of Rick and Morty",
            "Ugh. It's JANUARY 2024.",

            "HI. I've been writing the Rick and Morty comics for eons now (or four years, idk if four years is an eon. It IS like almost half of Rick and Morty's pop culture life though so ya know) and the answer is anything published by Oni has been officially commissioned by the show, and for the most part, each of them are stand alone.\n\nYou really can't go wrong with any of the ones you choose. If you know the show, you won't be lost with the comics, so just grab the one of these that sounds the best to you and go from there.\n\nThe first sixty issues are collected in volumes 1-11. Oni is rereleasing them as compendiums, and they're written by a variety of writers, but the first six are Zac Gorman and most of the rest are by Kyle Starks who is now very very beloved at Marvel/Image/DC. Excalibur/Catwoman/Harley Quinn writer Tini Howard is in the mix, as is Eternity Girl writer Magdalene Visaggio. Both are great. The first compendium can be found here, with a cover by Fred C Stresing, a dear friend of mine and probably my most common collaborator on these: https://www.amazon.com/Rick-Morty-Compendium-Vol-1-3/dp/1637152507/ref=asc_df_1637152507/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=652542027758&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=17970536145950503530&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9030955&hvtargid=pla-2022776494075&psc=1&mcid=b3769d9329fb3e7c97bc072cd0717ffe\n\nThen there's Rick and Morty presents-- usually a guest creator does a story concerning a side character. I've written Birdperson and Mr Nimbus, and to be completely honest, as a reader these are my favorites and where I personally began. A lot of different creators in short self contained stories. Here's Vol 1, but my work (Birdperson, Nimbus, Issue #100) can be found in volumes 3,4,5 respectively: https://www.amazon.com/Rick-Morty-Presents-Vol-1-ebook/dp/B07QPXS589/ref=mp_s_a_1_2?crid=1Q90BT7QDAGJI&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.tnOXtImY3Y4tiQWrSdTkQUXnmD6l5NQ1Lc1qr7w5pyJ1ssRIFWtos2nU9S9BRVbLv8igptyGzrdYvtfd2dZ34xAjtid9UmlQTkzWwjAQVFbOkGdsO7muDBY-89ZKscU_Mtnej0uxcXXhwi9uihkJQ4B-3-4BgYXzxQs5IDHlNnVpQVyuG3TXPN6qVd_7Xm2ETpb8_PgRGXPkHCWkDTJcHA.VIUSpW-z_toir0JSszcmYZwcn3K3woXEzeewIGErl-Y&dib_tag=se&keywords=rick+and+morty+presents&qid=1714111474&sprefix=rick+and+morty+present%2Caps%2C202&sr=8-2\n\nThen beyond that there are the miniseries. Mr Poopy Superstar has a very Adventure Time/art comix vibe to it and is about my dear friend Mr Poopybutthole, Worlds Apart is about the slut dragons, Rick and Morty Go To Hell says it all on the title, I've written Rick's New Hat, my attempt to capture the chaos of a crossover with Rick fighting a space God after he gives him a hat that makes him dumb, and I'll allow my bias here and it'll be the one I link to), Crisis on C-137 is a parody of multiversal DC 80's epics, Pocket Like You Stole It is a Pocket Morty's comic and thus a Pok\u00e9mon parody by Tini Howard, Corporate Assets satirizes the marketing elements of the characters, Heart of Rickness is Rick crashing on a barbaric world with no technology, Meseeks PI, a Meseeks and Jerry noir written and drawn by Fred C Stresing, a Star Wars parody titled Infinity Hour, and Jim Zub's three crossovers-- Rick and Morty DND, Rick and Morty DND Vol 2, and Rick and Morty Vs Cthulu. Here's my own New Hat: https://www.amazon.com/Rick-Morty-Ricks-New-Hat/dp/1620109824/ref=asc_df_1620109824/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=475772680074&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=5362615239424640752&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9030955&hvtargid=pla-1186511562451&psc=1&mcid=fd054cc19a583cc6807f748b9658b078\n\nIn 2023, along with Fred C Stresing and Marc Elletby as artists, we relaunched the Rick and Morty ongoing. It lasted 12 issues before pivoting back to minis, but I'm proud of them! They're collected as Space Shake Saga, about Rick being challenged by a genius Goldenfold, fighting a parody of a Web 3.0 creep, fighting his version of the Fourth World Saga, all while Morty falls in love with Goldenfold's niece. Although we revisit a few characters I created in other comics here, these can be read without any prior knowledge of the comics: https://www.amazon.com/Rick-Morty-Vol-Space-Shake-ebook/dp/B0CN9MQBVZ/ref=mp_s_a_1_4?crid=2VQQS7KLUMW7J&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.p3krpjrGu3CFYMawQejuAPHV39D3DMEVHG79s9HabeeYSA3MwUer6YMsG_Jhg-1Gs0fn2MzZf-to4lwfU7xOQFioctcRq7hJl86m65ZVnsolyg64TVm76JG2XRi10Qq5xHxcdwH7IegGTVaC1sToik64JyzBZDbtgquCG3JV_aJyKlMjKImhTFtIrb1NAIIKaTBCbNgNGsPsaNXZxn8hbg.RhKDfreeCDYj-c-8oPp-mfEVNgvT20naJQyMbewmefM&dib_tag=se&keywords=space+shake+saga&qid=1714112186&sprefix=space+shake+saga%2Caps%2C183&sr=8-4\n\nRight now the series is releasing three kinds of books. One is a special-- 56 pages long. The Spring Break Special was the first and so far only of these to be released and it's great (I have the 10th Anniversary Special with Fred to be released I July), a crossover with different creators titled Finals Week-- the first issue is written by legendary comedy writer Daniel Kibblesmith so you know it's good (I round out the series with the final issue) and the current miniseries is a very funny and very wild Kingdom Hearts parody titled Kingdom Balls.\n\nLastly, there is also a Rick and Morty manga being released that is very very funny. https://www.amazon.com/Rick-Morty-Manga-Vol-Robot/dp/1637152418/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?crid=2UAW4H2S2Q57K&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.EH-DCkqBxWPvGSvigwpKbZtrsfp07kUCyODI5Fto-HrA3lsk6rrcp8CqOUmztzFxbFc4q-vd-MVnJuIk_fnVP6Qng_ubsk0BcUTMpaa7QLklCmMHHSHjwViAbOfaR6nXPb_dop46xUh2w43TQin90CM7Wdng-BHLBlfkHsodXJOGZWBwazS52oq_MORTj0jkJtbgrowNL8QkOhCiwsmv_g.P-hG8NuLjfZYc2rXCMPZYuClJtM2cUwgaCpRwaGLb94&dib_tag=se&keywords=rick+and+morty+manga&qid=1714112434&sprefix=rick+and+morty+manga%2Caps%2C197&sr=8-1\n\nAgain, there's clearly been a lot, but keep in mind, the comics started publishing in 2015. That's about 9 years of Rick and Morty stories. Everything here is official, all approved by Adult Swim and such.\n\nI should also mention before a fan jumps in, that the absolute favorite of the comics series is a three issue arc where Rick and Morty are bested by Doofus Jerry, the Jerry from the Doofus Rick universe who is a savage evil capitalist. That guy keeps appearing all over the place. He's in volume 5 here: https://www.amazon.com/Rick-Morty-Vol-Kyle-Starks/dp/1620104164/ref=asc_df_1620104164/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=266118805355&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=18166552077347309587&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9030955&hvtargid=pla-415742700642&psc=1&mcid=061ec80332b73efc8b2d76c7c8b34063\n\nAlright that's me, I got tagged, I kept going, and I'm sure other readers will chime in with their own favs! As they should! Hope this helps. It's a lot but just choose the ones you like and go from there. It's Rick and Morty, so if you know the show these should be no problem.",

            "First off, there are 0 fan made ones, but they use different artists, so, all of them are original. Second, start with the OG series (2015-2020) they got 60 issues, but last year and this year they are making compendiums. Then move on to \"Rick and Morty Presents\", then to the other spin-offs, they are still making them",
