            "![gif](giphy|Uue0deVjVil0vtMoWg)\n\nMan, not getting a new season within a year is going to feel weird, but honestly, it's what it used to be like, Rick and Morty isn't an easy show to make, and a 2025 release makes me more excited about what they're planning for this \"10 season arc\"",
            "Huh I thought they already ended the script for season 8. Oh well, gonna wait a little more",
            "What ever happened to less waiting between seasons?",
            "And I'm still here waiting for season 7 to come here in my country",
            "Just a reminder that we had to wait 3 and a half years between season 3 and season 4.",
            "Even more reason to be excited for 2025. While I wait for GTA6 to install, I can watch season 8 of Rick and Morty",
            "Damn. Back to two year breaks.",
            "Fuuuuuck that\u2019s too long to wait",
            "Interesting. They've been releasing one season a year for a bit now. I wonder if the writers strike impacted the release date."

            "You're in for a wild ride with the Rick and Morty comics! I recommend starting with the official series published by Oni Press. You can find them at most comic book stores or online retailers like Amazon. Happy reading!",
            "u/GoodBoyPrime, your time to shine.",
            "First off, there are 0 fan made ones, but they use different artists, so, all of them are original. Second, start with the OG series (2015-2020) they got 60 issues, but last year and this year they are making compendiums. Then move on to \"Rick and Morty Presents\", then to the other spin-offs, they are still making them",
