            "Legendary Tales on Psvr2  it really feels like I'm inside the Diablo game I played some 24 years ago \ud83d\ude03",
            "Max Mustard, which is a fun game that can easily be played seated. Perfect for me while I recover from my broken leg.",
            "Just got done playing the Upside Town course on Walkabout. Holy shit that one is a lot harder! I love this game.",
            "Legendary Tales in permadeath mode. I think this time we will manage to kill the final boss.",
            "Started playing Moss Book 2 after finishing the first game. So far it seems like it's the same game with a couple new abilities. Still like it though. \n\nHumanity is next after I finish moss. People were recommending that after mentioned that I enjoyed moss.",
            "Riven, the classic adventure puzzle romp, now fully remade and in VR. \n\nMany people holding for years it's one of the toughest puzzle games ever... nah, I disagree about that, having never played the original, but finished Myst in VR recently and both are pretty straightforward reasoning that you get the hang of after awhile.  I'd say a good part of the old difficulty must have been simply navigating the location by slideshow - you had no real perception of your surroundings, and it's so much easier to figure out \"in person\" in VR.  same for interactions with the puzzles, they just feel intuitive, you can see the purpose of everything by just taking a glance around, instead of going back and forth between different locations with different viewpoints.\n\ntbh, this natural ease and intuitiveness of VR is not just for puzzle games like this:  I always found it much easier to play classic shooters like Doom, Quake or Resident Evil 4 in VR with gun in my hand and same geography intuitiveness about spaces as well...",
            "I picked up quite a few games with the recent promo code trend...lol\n\nI've been playing a bit of Dragon Fist today.\n\nThe game has a ton of characters and stages...way more than I initially thought. It's fun enough to beat up the NPCs, but I wish there were more interactions with the environments. I'll have more thoughts when I finish the campaign. I'll give it four head chops our of five.\n\nI also finished Max Mustard this past week.\n\nMax Mustard was really cute, but I was surprised at how little VR interactions there were. I also wished there was a bit more variety in the music. Despite these reservations, I burned through the game, completing it in 3 or 4 sessions. Some of the collectibles are missable in the levels which is a bit annoying, but overall I had fun. It felt like a proper Mario game, but on Quest. I'll give it 4.5 mudpups out of five.\n\nI also finished Sushi Ben recently.\n\nSushi Ben has a great story, and the vibes were immaculate. Some of the quests were a bit annoying to get through -- in particular the ping-pong one. The story also ends a bit on a cliffhanger. Like Max Mustard, I finished it pretty quickly, just burning through it. I'd give it four tuna sushi out of five.\n\nFor the rest of the weekend, I'm checking out the games in the UploadVR bundle and playing some more Dragon Fist."

I didn\u2019t originally but my son had to do school over zoom at a desk in the same room as my edit suite and he kept not paying attention to his teacher to watch me work so I used the index to have a virtual space with pass through so at any time I could look over and know if he was paying attention without having something in the room distracting him.",
