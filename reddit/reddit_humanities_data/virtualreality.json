This is your spot to chat, share, and discover.\n\nWhen sharing, you might consider sharing:\n\n**Name** of the game or experience.\n\nA brief **insight** or **overview**.\n\nYour **personal rating** and a bit about why.\n\n*Example*: I got hooked on \\[Game Name\\]. It offers \\[Brief Description\\], and I've been having a blast! Rating it 8/10 mainly because \\[Reason\\].\n\nSo, what's been captivating you or challenging you in the VR world lately?",

            "Silent Slayer: Vault of the Vampire - a fun puzzle/horror game in the vein of the old table top game Operation with some good jump scares. \n\nYou are a vampire slayer tasked with dispatching 7 vampires while they sleep in their coffins. Each vampire has a series of increasingly difficult traps you must disarm before you can plunge a stake into its heart. A talking book (with a voice that bears more than a passing resemblance to Darth Sidious) will guide you along the way.\n\nThis is one of those games that is easy to learn but will take multiple tries to beat and has some really well done hand gesture mechanics. It took me about eight hours to see two of the game's three endings so I still have more to see and do.\n\nRating: 4/5 - The last two or three vampires can be really hard to kill and I wouldn't have minded a difficulty slider to make things just a little more forgiving. Also, when using one of your tools to disarm the traps your hands disappear, which has always been a little immersion breaking for me. But both of these are very minor quibbles.",
            "Hal Life Alyx (9/10) and High on Life (9/10) via UEVR :)",
            "Finished Max Mustard on Quest 3. Not a fan of linear level based platformers, but I absolutely loved Max Mustard. Beautiful game, fun levels and just challenging and long enough. Can't recommend this game enough. Btw, I bought it before 90% off code. No regrets. Absolutely worth its full price.\n\n\nPlaying Miracle Pool and this is one of the best MR games yet. Physics are on the same level as in Eleven Table Tennis, but MR graphics are even better and more realistic. Once I lined up MR table with my kitchen table, the realism went through the roof. Feels like playing a real pool game.\n\n\nPlaying around with Figmin XR. Another top MR app. Hours fly while playing around with it."

            "Man, I am doing a VR tour around the US right now in the black square TBM 850, also using quest 3 and VD and map enhancement mod. It\u2019s such an incredible experience and I don\u2019t know a single person in real life who has been able to do this. It seems so inaccessible to so many people (it is expensive and can be tough to get all the tech working) but holy crap man virtual tourism is the future. I am flying to different cities then switching to the Hype H160 helicopter and doing slow city tours with another VR browser window open playing YouTube videos about the city I am flying over (via OpenKneeboard). All on Vatsim or beyond atc and all flights tracked on Volanta.",
            "View looks stunning.  I just don't have the patience for flights.  I love crashing tho...that's fun. Lol",
            "I\u2019d like to get into flight sim. Any sites that are good for a complete beginner?",
            "man i gotta get back into this but I was thinking of getting a new desk to get the height right for my hotas... it never felt right putting it either on the desktop at 31\" high or on the KB tray which groans when you use the keyboard or mouse.",
            "For anyone wondering about performance, something like as ween above will run at about 45 reprojected which is fine because of the slow paced nature of the game.\n\nThis game however is one of the best use cases of a Quest pro or other eye tracked headset. This game supports Quad Views which dramatically increases performance and is a feature only available on headsets with eye tracking",
            "I have Q3 and QP. Below are some hints for both. I play wireless over Virtual Desktop.\n\nClarity is always a thing. I have a 3080 ... and sure enough a 4090 would be better. The trick is to get acceptable results with the hardware at hand. I can live with my specs ...\n\n... Q3 on 72 Hz ... VD on Ultra/Godlike and with SSW always on!! (so fps halfed to 36!!) with streamer on VDXR HEVC10 ... MSFS DLSS(!!) on Balanced/Quality ... 5GHz dedi router 2m/6ft away\n\nThis should make things smooth. Check this with the VD framerate counter! Now tweak gfx, mid to high to ultra (eg clouds on high) etc. Dont push.\n\nDlss makes the picture somewhat soft, which I do not mind. I tried several sharpening flters. They work, but it feels somewhat artificial, so I go for some softness. Np for me.\n\nBtw, I have 32GB ram. And do recording on Quest3 (not on pc)\n\nOne trick for nightflying with Q3 is to lower the brightness all the way down to ZERO\ud83e\udd14\ud83d\udc4d ... It will make nightflying a joy. Not oled joy but very workable. The 'grey mess' is gone and your eyes will(!) adapt to the lower brightness. Low light/Nightflying is a important part of MSFS for me\n\nAnother important setting ... TRAFFIC (cars, ships, fauna) ... set those to ZERO\n\nMicrostutters see https://youtu.be/I8PZJJ25olk \n\nMore info (I took my info form these 2 sources):\n\nhttps://www.avsim.com/forums/topic/645221-where-to-get-the-bing-version-of-google-maps-enhancement/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzWCfIfxUjs\n\nHope this helps",
            "Yeah seriously.  I have the same specs basically and can't get anywhere near this framerate..."
