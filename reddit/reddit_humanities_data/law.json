            "Most of the information in these filings was already known, although it has been memory-holed to some extent because the investigation fizzled out after the Egyptian bank stonewalled for long enough that the DOJ just gave up on the investigation.\n\nOne new and potentially momentous piece of information jumped out at me though. On p. 20 (PDF numbering), the court wrote,\n\n> [Redacted Egyptian bank] argues that complying with the subpoena would require violating Country A's Banking Law, Country A's Anti-Money Laundering Law (\"AML Law\"), and unspecified law in Country B.\n\nLater in the PDF on p. 48, in a separate memo, the court specifies in a footnote that, \"Country B is the People's Republic of China.\"\n\nWhat possible reason would an Egyptian bank need to worry about breaking Chinese law by providing information to a US prosecutor about a $10m transfer from their bank (in Egypt) to Donald Trump (in the US)? I cannot think of a single reason that does not involve some or all of the funds originating in China.\n\nSupposedly Ron Rosenstein told Mueller not to dig too deeply into Trump's finances, so this appears to be the only real probe of Trump's finances as they relate to foreign election interference. What he so poisonously refers to as \"the Russia hoax.\" The Egyptian bank's stonewalling made it impossible for Mueller to proceed with the case as Special Counsel because the rest of the investigation had concluded and it wasn't clear whether the Egypt investigation would go anywhere. So he closed up shop and submitted his report to Barr, handing the rest of the Egypt investigation off to a team at DOJ, which promptly did absolutely nothing about the investigation until it was quietly dropped during the height of the pandemic when the public was distracted, to say the least.\n\nSo this probe never went anywhere, and we should all be very concerned about that. If there was ever going to be a smoking gun demonstrating Trump's corruption, it was always going to be financial. Following the money was always the best strategy and Rosenstein knew precisely what he was doing when told Mueller not to pursue that angle. He was crippling the Mueller probe from the get-go. It is incredibly concerning that a case like this was just summarily dropped, despite a large volume of evidence suggesting a Chinese-domiciled entity or person transferred the enormous sum of $10m to Trump so he could fund his campaign for the last few weeks of the 2016 election season. Given how close that election was, that amount of money could very well have been decisive, and thus it's entirely possible the CCP put Trump in the White House. Making him literally the Manchurian Candidate.\n\nEdit: [Here's a more reputable source than me that summarizes the broad strokes of this strange Mueller subplot.](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/14/politics/trump-campaign-donation-investigation/index.html)",

Which is what is argued in the banality of evil about what happened in Germany in the 1930s. \n\nTrump has been known to be a money launderer for the worst people in the world for decades. I don\u2019t believe the house and senate intel committees didn\u2019t know about all of trumps dirty work. I believe the Rs think they will benefit from him as president. \n\nJust one example, trump built a tower in Azerbaijan that looks like a money wash for the IRGC\u2019s ICBM program.

Now even moderate information sources talk about the Mueller investigation so inconclusively like \"It's definitely a thing that happened\" because what could have been impactful was muted and framed to the party's liking.\n\nThe way republican congressmen talked about Trump before he was the primary candidate indicate fairly wide knowledge of his foreign money laundering operations. And while there is clearly also something alarming going on between Trump and Putin (see: Helsinki Summit), Mueller was ultimately chasing the wrong car.\n\nI wonder what Mueller thought of it? Who would have thought that between Russia and the documents case it would be a hush money case and that rape slander case that caught him. It's all backwards.",
