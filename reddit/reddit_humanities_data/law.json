If you want to talk about the issues surrounding Trump, the warrant, 4th and 5th amendment issues, the work of law enforcement, the difference between the New York case and the fed case, his attorneys and their own liability, etc. you are more than welcome to discuss and learn from each other. You don't have to get everything exactly right but be open to learning new things. \n\nYou are not welcome to show up here and \"tell it like it is\" because it's your \"truth\" or whatever. You have to at least try and discuss the cases here and how they integrate with the justice system. Coming in here stubborn, belligerent, and wrong about the law will get you banned. And, no, you will not be unbanned.",

            "I wasnt sure what tag to use on this, but I noticed that there are still some outstanding cases not ruled on. Since this article is not purely about the immunity decision, I picked SCOTUS. However, everyone was speculating they would rule on Trumps immunity today, so I wanted to post this.\n\nSome of the other outstanding decisions aside from immunity are on the legality of swipe fees and a case regarding the power of the states governments when it comes to social media. Roberts says they will rule on all outstanding decisions on Monday, so I guess they arent waiting till fall or later with these, thankfully.",

Also, theres the ruling on the Fisher obstruction case and how that will affect Jan. 6 obstruction charges. Will be interested to see how Cannon maneuvers the rulings from Fisher and immunity cases to try and throw out docs case. Because as Trumps minion, she wants so badly to do so.",

            "I will take that bet. Im feeling good with my current betting position. (2/3 bets are over and Ive been right on both.) I think what people have been speculating is correct: its going back to the lower courts and will have them decide what is official acts vs not and then those decisions will be appealed back to the SC. I think they will hold steadfast on ruling that only official acts give qualified immunity.",
            "I'm feeling bullish, I think the did their dirty work today and want the weekend and the Monday release to bury any stories about all the cases today which we're very terrible.   \nThey want to hide the Chevron stuff from the general public.   If Monday says what most of us expect aka some immunity but fact finding needed and he definitely isn't fully immune.   That will mean that the cases today only get remember by the type of people in the sub",
