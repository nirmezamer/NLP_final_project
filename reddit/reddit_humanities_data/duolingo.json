            "- pick units to focus on in targeted practice  \n- conjugation practice for languages that have it  \n- short story exercise practice called \"comprehension\"  \n- radio show collection like stories  \n- writing exercise only practice (no word bank)  \n- gender practice for languages with gendered articles. you get nouns and have to select/type the correct articles",

            "1: Suggest Units to review  \n2: Conjugation practice  \n3: Writing Only  \n4: Vocabulary ONLY practice. 1 word, no word bank, gender required (if applicable). Split into two, so if a word has two translations you must get both to fully pass the question. If this idea is really hard, \"use it in a sentence\" questions paired with the AI could be really helpful too.  \n5: Suggested outside reading/listening/general learning/music. Could be paired with sponsors in-app. Suggesting stuff like coffee break podcast, some books, news articles hand picked because they'd be relatively easy to follow for a beginner.  \n6: A word bank to help with personalized practice. So I can basically tell the AI which words it doesn't need to show me anymore. Seriously, I don't need to practice the word \"penser\" for the 150th time. I use it outside of duolingo everyday now.  \n7: Speed Practice. Take a recording (of a human, not a bot), and start slow to test speed of listening comprehension. Then speed it up until you can follow it faster than the average person speaks in that language.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nOther things related to the personalized practice:\n\nSeparate them into super and non-super instead of what it is now. (unless you have super)\n\nTell us in the practice where the questions are coming from so we can manually review it if needed\n\nNotes paired with sections/rules/what the question is attempting to teach. So if I was repeatedly getting a concept incorrect. Let's say conjugations for example, I could write a note and that note would available to see next time conjugations are the main point of the question.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nThank you for taking the time to listen to us.",

And worse some words don't even show up, this needs to be fixed and improve",

            "I really miss a \u201cflashcard\u201d option. So basically being able to choose words/phrases to practice/recall. And then having an opinion to rank it if you know it, kinda knowing it and not knowing it (or something like that). As of right now I use external app for that.\n\nSecondly I would bring stories and words to the languages that don\u2019t have them yet.\n\nAlso I would have a general practice available all the time. Sometimes \u201cforces\u201d you to speak/listen.\n\nI agree with the pretty common theme on this thread of choosing the unit you practice, that would be really good.\n\nAnd specifically for Chinese I wish there was a practice where you translate a spoken sentence. Now we only have spoken to characters. Or spoken+characters to English. But that\u2019s not only in the hub."
