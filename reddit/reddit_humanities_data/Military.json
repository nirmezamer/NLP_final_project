        "content": "I\u2019m currently in the military won\u2019t say which branch but I\u2019m in AIT. Recently someone who had been harassing me for four months made a threat saying they were going to beat my ass and it was brought up to me by my drills who said it was brought up to my commander and in every instance of this situation I\u2019ve been treated like I did something wrong. In the beginning when my property was damaged and they admitted to doing it they rolled their eyes when I complained about it and didn\u2019t reprimand them in any way because \u201cI was also being petty playing my music too loud\u201d. I do not talk to this person interact with them or anything. I didn\u2019t then and I still don\u2019t. When the threat was made they moved me told me not to provoke THEM and when I asked why they\u2019re still in our company when people reported not being comfortable being around them as well my drills basically asked if I was scared of them. This is a person who cuts themselves and scratches themselves to a point where they bleed\u2026. Someone I still share the same laundry room and hallway with like this does nothing for me. 10000% I\u2019m always ready to defend myself without fear but it\u2019s like they\u2019re acting like I\u2019m the one that made the threat and never take any action against this person who doesn\u2019t even show up to formations but will rush to reprimand me the one time I was late to formation. I just really feel like they don\u2019t give a rats ass and want me to handle it on my own and risk getting chaptered out or something by this person that we all know is not in their right mind. Is there anything I can do to sue or anyone above my commander that I can discuss this issue with to get a better resolution because I feel like my leadership doesn\u2019t give a rats ass about me.",

It will be officially recorded, that you did make the report before you had to defend yourself.",
            "You aren't going to like this advice, but I can sum it up in 2 words: Grow up.\n\nThis reads like a high school drama script on the CW minus the supernatural undertones. \"He did this but I got in trouble for my actions and he walked away without any punishment.\" \"He's late all the time but the one time I'm late I get in trouble for it.\" Seriously? They aren't going to share the punishment the other soldier got. They are however still going to hold you accountable for *your* actions.\n\nWorry about you. If he is a threat to himself or others, call the MP's. Report the behavior to your command. Then walk away and stop worrying about them. Things like chaptering a soldier out or med boards take time. Just because you aren't privy to what your command is doing to this soldier doesn't mean they aren't doing anything.",

        "content": "Like the title reads, I am very curious as a german if he still is interested in withdrawing us troops. Germany have just passed the 2% NATO spending target, which I think was the reason he wanted to pull troops out of germany. \n\nAs a german employed within the US Armed Forces I worry that I could be left without a job if he wins the election. Do you think he still wants to achieve what he planned and do you think he would withdraw all troops or only reduce the presence in Germany?",

            "Removing troops from Germany, Japan, or Korea is incredibly unlikely, given how entrenched US presence is in those countries.  \n\nAlso, as Commander-in-Chief, the President obviously has considerable power over the military, but shifting US troop presence around will sooner or later involve funding, and that\u2019s controlled by congress.  \n\nWorst you might see is shifting troops around to different bases and/or consolidating from smaller bases to bigger ones (e.g. there\u2019s been a lot of this in Korea and Japan over the last 7 or 8 years).",

            "Trump hasn't been great about portraying his policies he would like to implement if he wins. He seems to want some retribution and to follow through on some heavy internal changes, but his foreign policy talk has been more about how Ukraine wouldn't have been invaded or how the Isreal situation would be resolved if it were him. He hasn't said anything about Germany in years from what I've seen",
            "Since the top answers are politically biased against Trump, I'll give this a shot. Just like every President for the last 40 years he wants every NATO country to pay their share (as required by the NATO treaty). He is the only one I remember threatening the members who don't meet this requirement. Now ask yourself this question, does the President of the United States have the power to pull out of NATO on his own? Would the members of his own party really support that?",
            "Let him call Putin and see what he wants him to do and then you\u2019ll have your answer",
