If I had paid $130 for it I would complain about the quality but not for $20.\u00a0\nSorry to hear you got the old jersey for some reason.\u00a0",

            "I don\u2019t believe in the concept of  developing a QB on the sidelines, learning as a backup. Maybe for the first feee weeks but real game time reps and experience is how these guys learn he game. If Bo is our future, he needs to be our starter by week 6 if not right out the gate.",
            "Unless Bo Nix gets injured, he pretty much needs to start or it would be a bad look for him.\n\nHe is supposed to be a pro-ready QB, not a raw one.",
            "Even if Nix is ready, maybe wait 8 games or so.  If the roster is a bad as they say, Nix is on a suicide mission that may damage him the rest of his career.\n\nLet Stidham take the bullets early and maximize Nix long term potential.",
            "Odds are based on where people are betting.",
            "Yeah, the real probability is probably closer to 50% Nix, 45% Stidham, 5% Wilson.  Stidham has been the best player so far, but Nix isn't far behind and he gets the shiny new-toy bump.\n\nWilson hasn't looked like he is even in the race.",
            "Pat Mahomes, Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers, Jordan Love and Joe Montana would disagree.",
            "Mahommes is the only one who looked like a vet by the time he started. All the other ones came out looking like they had never been in a real game before but they adapted and learned fast. I believe their careers would have had the same trajectory if they had started right away. Learning in the bench wasn\u2019t the reason for why were successful, they had the intangibles required for being a QB in the NFL. They just had to experience the game to perfect it.",
