            "Hello, seeing if anyone can help with my issue. I have a G15 rog strix Asus. One day the bios setup popped up and i had entered a administrator password. After it kept asking for password to enter my computer. Then I tried clearing password by entering old password and leaving new password blank. Now every time I start up it asks for password. Unfortunately none of the previous passwords work. And it started to not power on anymore. The charging light turned on briefly with the enter password window but it shut off by itself and won't turn on at all anymore. If you or anyone knows a solution, i'd greatly appreciate the help!",

The top black pipe is your heatsink underneath it lies the CPU\n\nThe only two things really upgradable in your laptop would be the SSD which is the fourth one and the ram which is the second one. (Also it kind of depends on your model whether you can upgrade or not)\n\nI would recommend cleaning your CPU fan, and reapplying thermal paste underneath the heat sink on top of your CPU. \n\nThe SSD here is not the regular one, it's kind of like a normal SSD only half the size, I doubt it differs performance wise, although the additional screw bracket suggests that it can accommodate both the types but I still suggest you switch it with the variant that is already slotted in.\n\nIf you are extremely new to this I would suggest you go to an authorised technician.\n\nYou could ask them for parts or you could buy them yourself.\n\nIt would help if you could provide the model number and the model name of your laptop. \n\nHappy upgrading!"
