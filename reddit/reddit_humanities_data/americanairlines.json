A couple of quick notes:\n\nAll shopping portal posts/comments should be contained here. Posts outside of this thread will most likely be removed unless they rise to the level of significant program news/updates. This will be a high bar to clear.\n\nPosts/comments about general award programs, benefits, etc. should go here, but there is a lower bar as to what qualifies for it's own post and will evolve as this thread evolves.\n\nSubreddit rules regarding etiquette and respect will still be enforced, but it pretty much boils down to don't dunk on people who know less than you, even if you think they deserve it.\n\nReferral codes are explicitly not allowed. This includes solicitations for direct message or similar comments.\n\nSince this is the first thread, we will see how this goes before we commit to a specific refresh cadence (weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc)\n\nAs always, the best way to provide feedback is via the modmail functionality.\n\nApril 2024: https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/1bz0uci/aa_points_awards_credit_cards_and_shopping_portal/\n\nMay 2024:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/1cip922/may_mega_thread_aa_points_loyalty_points_award/",

            "Interesting set of stackable AA mile offers popped on my Barclays Aviator Silver card for this summer.\n\n* Spend $300 in each of June, July, and August, earn 2000 AA bonus miles.\n* Register for Flight Cents by June 30 and AA will match all miles from Flight Cents during the first 2 months of enrollment.\n\nWasn't interested in Flight Cents at a cost of $0.02 per mile but at only $0.01 per mile plus an added \\~2X bonus miles from the $300 per month spending offer I think I'll be putting at least a grand of spending on the card to rack up some bonus miles. The card anniversary year resets at end of June so the timing also helps for starting on the companion voucher for next year.",
            "I keep getting an error message every time i try to book a hotel with miles. does this happen to anyone else?",
            "Getting offered 100k miles as a sign up bonus for Aadvantage Executive World Elite Mastercard.  Guessing it is targeted.  Wish it was a better card overall. Even with the points I'm on the fence.",
            "is this the appropriate thread to discuss best current LP offers... Im curious which offers most people take advantage of.. Im pretty new at this.",
            "New to having the Executive World Elite Mastercard and  AAdvantage eShopping. Clicked on a link from their site that said 8 miles per dollar. Spent about $100 on one item. Expected roughly 800 miles.... but got 300. Is there something I'm missing in the fine print somewhere saying the 8/mile per dollar maxes out at a certain point? Does this happen often? \n\nNot a big deal, just also wish it would calculate it somewhere at the checkout so I knew exactly what I was getting before finalizing my purchase.",
            "A few months ago I heard you were no longer going to be able to earn loyalty points unless booking through the app directly (unless booked with a few select travel agencies). Any updates on if Amex Global Business Travel is one of these agencies and when this goes into effect?",
            "I'm considering AA platinum select vs executive as a travel card. Main reasons would be for priority boarding and because we use AA for almost all of our flights. \n\nI just learned that miles and loyalty points are separate. Normally I choose basic economy and pay extra for preferred seats but it seems that for loyalty points its better to choose main cabin for extra if trying to get to gold is that right? \n\nWithout the credit cards is the main way to get loyalty points by buying tickets through the [aa.com](http://aa.com) site?\n\nAnd with the CC I can earn loyalty points by booking flights or using card for every day purchases? Is there any loyalty boosters that they offer as well or is everything other than aa flights and inflight purchases 1$ spend = 1 loyalty point?\n\n  \nAlso If I choose a mileage multiplier - does it give me more loyalty points as well? or is it almost never worth getting the mileage multiplier?",
            "Is it better to sign up for platinum select card separately or when booking a trip?\n\nSeparately - 50k miles after 2500 first 3 months. \n\nWhile booking trip - $200 statement credit + 40k miles \n\nOr\n\nThe Barclays Card 70k miles after 1 purchase \n\nTravel American with work roughly 6-10 times a year plus 1-3 flights for family trips.",
            "Do Miles/LPs calculate at the time you book or at time of flight? (I know they post after the flight itself)\n\nAsking because when my credit card statement posts next week I will jump to the next status class (Gold)\u2026. But I want to book a work trip today. \n\nIf I book today, will the miles be granted at 5x/$ based on status at booking or at 7x/$ based on my status during the flight itself?"

Haven\u2019t really had to pay for a flight that I couldn\u2019t expense in about 10 years. I maybe paid out of pocket a couple times here and there, but that\u2019s because you couldn\u2019t get upgraded on award travel till recently on AA and Ive had to chase status.

I expected the cabin crew to be surly;  they were professional, friendly and accommodating. I  expected the food in 1st to be unappetizing; it was ok, although the gelato had been thawed and refrozen a few too many times.  I expected my luggage to be lost or destroyed; it arrived intact.

            "Yeah my biggest issue with them is their total lack of tier 2 Canadian city service or partners that serve them, especially out east. And their poor onward connection timings out of SFO. All in all not huge gripes. They do a decent job all around. Been EXP for 10 years.",
            "Has virtually nothing to do with it. For starters, while ATL is an incredibly busy airport (which adds to the risk of issues rather than mitigates them), AA has a comparatively minimal presence there.\n\nThere are so many factors that could potentially be the source for a delay or any of the myriad potential issues, being a large hub is generally not one of them.",
            "My issue with smaller airports creating nightmares is that there are way fewer flight options by nature so when delays/cancellations happen (and they happen all the time to me on AA cuz I\u2019m cursed), I\u2019m frequently rescheduled for a different day entirely - so I guess not necessarily that there are more likely to BE issues in smaller ports but that the severity of the issue will be worse if there is one. Couple that with a multi-leg trip where an issue with one flight can f*ck up a bajillion others and you have my life this summer.",
            "Absolutely valid. We just landed at a medium sized airport and due to lots of delays if they canceled our next available option was 345pm tomorrow. And we are 2 executive platinums so the status actually helped (they are good to us) but you're correct as we just experienced. And it was a medium sized airport because the small one near us suffers from what you described."
