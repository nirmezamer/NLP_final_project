A couple of quick notes:\n\nAll shopping portal posts/comments should be contained here. Posts outside of this thread will most likely be removed unless they rise to the level of significant program news/updates. This will be a high bar to clear.\n\nPosts/comments about general award programs, benefits, etc. should go here, but there is a lower bar as to what qualifies for it's own post and will evolve as this thread evolves.\n\nSubreddit rules regarding etiquette and respect will still be enforced, but it pretty much boils down to don't dunk on people who know less than you, even if you think they deserve it.\n\nReferral codes are explicitly not allowed. This includes solicitations for direct message or similar comments.\n\nSince this is the first thread, we will see how this goes before we commit to a specific refresh cadence (weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc)\n\nAs always, the best way to provide feedback is via the modmail functionality.\n\nApril 2024: https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/1bz0uci/aa_points_awards_credit_cards_and_shopping_portal/\n\nMay 2024:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/1cip922/may_mega_thread_aa_points_loyalty_points_award/",

            "is this the appropriate thread to discuss best current LP offers... Im curious which offers most people take advantage of.. Im pretty new at this.",
            "New to having the Executive World Elite Mastercard and  AAdvantage eShopping. Clicked on a link from their site that said 8 miles per dollar. Spent about $100 on one item. Expected roughly 800 miles.... but got 300. Is there something I'm missing in the fine print somewhere saying the 8/mile per dollar maxes out at a certain point? Does this happen often? \n\nNot a big deal, just also wish it would calculate it somewhere at the checkout so I knew exactly what I was getting before finalizing my purchase.",
            "A few months ago I heard you were no longer going to be able to earn loyalty points unless booking through the app directly (unless booked with a few select travel agencies). Any updates on if Amex Global Business Travel is one of these agencies and when this goes into effect?",
            "Regarding hotels from AAs portal, are they all timeshare pushers? I\u2019ve had 4 hotel stays this year at different property owners, and only 1 hotel didn\u2019t try and molest me at check in with fake \u201cgifts\u201d to convince me to go their presentation.\u00a0\n\nThe extra LPs are nice, but 75% of the time is frustrating lol. Am I just unlucky with my selections or does anyone else experience this?",
            "Goofy question.  I am going to level up to platinum today or tomorrow when my exec card LPs post. I check in to a 2 night hotel booking I made through aa tomorrow late afternoon. Is there an additional aahotel LP point bonus for being platinum, or does that only happen after you hit 100k LP level and get up to 30% LP bonus?  The amount of LPs for the hotel stay is 7200 because of my gold status, so I was wondering if it would come in higher after hitting platinum before check in.",

I expected the cabin crew to be surly;  they were professional, friendly and accommodating. I  expected the food in 1st to be unappetizing; it was ok, although the gelato had been thawed and refrozen a few too many times.  I expected my luggage to be lost or destroyed; it arrived intact. Overall, a good experience. Maybe I was just lucky. ",

It\u2019s kind of the chance you take by flying and I\u2019m pretty sure the employees of the airline don\u2019t want to deal with dozens to thousands of angry people who all have the same problem.",
