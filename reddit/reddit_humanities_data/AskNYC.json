If you want help planning your trip, you need to provide us specific information about you. We all love to have fun, see cool things and eat food. That is not specific detail. You will get more help and better help if you can be specific. \n\nGreat posts that have gotten lots of good information include specific details about what people are fans of and the kinds of things they like to do. If you\u2019re looking for meals or experiences, please provide a budget in actual numerical dollars. \u201cCheap\u201d or \u201c$$\u201d is subjective. Tell us the dollar amount you want to spend per person. \n\nBy way of example: saying you like a good bar is not helpful, but saying you're a huge fan of negronis and would love to try New York City's best is. But you could also say that your idea of a great bar is an old wooden place with gruff bartenders and its own local beers, and you're really looking to stay in Manhattan - that's also specific enough that we can help. \n\nIf you have an itinerary or rough sketch of one already and need help finding a few last pieces - we are great at that! If you have no idea where to start, Google \"NYC itinerary for X days\", try ChatGPT, or search this subreddit - but don't just come and post your ChatGPT spit out here. You need to do your own work a bit and then come ask for advice.\n\nWe really do want to assist you, but it's pretty rude to just post \"we are coming next week and we are [ages], we like food and fun, plan our trip for us!\"",

            "People are more straight-forward and fast-paced in NYC. It can take some getting used to for midwesterners, but I love it. People are nicer than their reputation would imply and are usually happy to help, but they don\u2019t suffer fools. Know what you want before you ask for it or else be prepared to deal with a lot of annoyed looks. That\u2019s the main cultural difference I\u2019ve noticed.\n\nIn terms of the rest, if you feel comfortable with big cities, you\u2019ll enjoy NYC. It\u2019s Chicago on steroids. Brooklyn alone has about the same population as Chicago. Speaking of which, Manhattan is great, but I\u2019d recommend exploring the other boroughs when you can. There are so many hidden gems, you\u2019ll never find them all. But if you like exploring and discovering, there\u2019s really no better city in the US.\n\nThat said, if you feel the size of Chicago is overwhelming, or the desire to be a big fish in a little pond and need recognition, then NYC is not for you. Everything will be harder here from apartment hunting to waiting in line at the pharmacy, but the energy is intoxicating. People are always doing things. It\u2019s a bustling town, much more so than any other place in the US. If that\u2019s exciting, then this is the place for you.\n\nEDIT: spelling",
            "Things I like better about NYC:\n\nDon\u2019t need a car. I used to live near Western and Sunnyside, and the CTA got me most places I wanted to go, but my roommates had a car and it was objectively better for certain activities/trips. In NYC, the trains provide SO MUCH more coverage for 99% of the places I want to get to without needing a bus ride before/after to make up the rest of the trip. There\u2019s also just so much more stuff available. Whether it\u2019s restaurants or concerts or museums or sports or shopping, there are just plain more options here. Also, as much as I liked the theatre scene in Chicago, you just can\u2019t beat Broadway for live theatre availability. \n\nThings I miss about Chicago:\n\nLeona\u2019s. The beach. I grew up in Michigan, so I vastly prefer freshwater beaches instead of the saltwater that NYC has. Jewel-Osco. The downside of not needing a car is that you\u2019ll probably have to adjust your grocery shopping habits. Grocery stores aren\u2019t as big in a lot of neighborhoods, and you probably won\u2019t have a trunk to bring it home in, so you buy what you can carry, either in bags or a roll-y cart. I\u2019ve gotten used to more frequent shopping trips with fewer items each trip. The Loop. I personally liked having a bunch of \u201cthe city\u201d in that one defined area. NYC\u2019s points of interest are more numerous, but they\u2019re also spread out all over the place, so it has a different vibe. \n\nOverall, I like both cities a lot. If you liked Chicago, you\u2019ll probably like NYC too; there\u2019s just a bit of a learning curve while you get used to the different rhythms of New York.",
            "Born and raised in Chicago, lived in New York for more than a decade now. I never *really* understood what visitors meant when they said Chicago is so clean. Then I moved here. It\u2019s disgusting but you get used to it. \n\nThat being said, Chicago feels very small to me now. Fewer people walking around, fewer things to do, just less of everything. Which isn\u2019t always bad, just something that feels very palpable when I visit. I\u2019ve seen a lot of Chicagoans come and go in my time here so my general advice is if you\u2019re mostly happy in Chicago, stay in Chicago. New York has a way of wearing you down if you don\u2019t really *really* want to be here.",
            "I moved from NYC to Chicago in 2017 then to Philly then back to NYC.\n\nI loved the lower cost of living, the architecture, the art/music/culture scene, the unique neighborhoods (similar to NYC), the food (also similar to NYC), a lot of the people, the relative cleanliness, the spring and summers. While I never did buy something, the possibility of being able to purchase a house or condo at a much lower price was a huge factor.\n\nI left in 2020 because I missed the East Coast and the winters were brutal. Chicago can also feel isolated. One of the things I love about NYC and the east coast is how easy it is to get to other cities (DC, Boston, Philly, Baltimore) without needing to own or even rent a car or go to an airport. In Chicago, not that easy. I tried Philly for a couple years but it was not for me, I moved back to NYC early this year and am so, so happy that I did. \n\nChicago isn't perfect, but under the right circumstances, I would live there again - it has a ton of pro's and if you are looking for a break or a change from here, it's a solid option.",
            "I\u2019ve lived in Chicago, NYC, and San Francisco. Both NY and San Francisco are a lot more international than Chicago. Trends arrive and leave a lot faster.\n\nChicago is more \u201cAmerican\u201d and there are people from all over the Midwest there. NYC is more international and there are people from all over the world here.\n\nThe food scene is less segregated (I\u2019d have to go to Devon Ave to eat South Asian food in Chicago. In NY I have at least two to three good regional South Asian restaurants in my neighborhood alone) \n\nAlso as someone who dated in both cities, I feel like the beauty standards were very like blonde, blue eyed sorority girl in Chicago. As a poc woman I get a lot more traction here. \n\nI also just think there\u2019s more tolerance for difference here at all levels of society from the elite to the working class",
            "I\u2019m not from Chicago but I\u2019ve lived in both places. NYC is a much more international city, meaning people move there from all around the world, while Chicago feels like the capital of the Midwest. Also NYC is so much better located in proximity to great hiking/outdoor opportunities. Chicago is on Lake Michigan but other than that you\u2019re pretty much SOL if you value access to the outdoors, hiking, etc.",
            "They\u2019re two totally different realm. New York is the capital of the world whereas Chicago is just the capital of the Midwest.",
            "The lake. Beefs. A polish. Taking a stroll on the river walk. The homies. And family. That\u2019s what I miss most about back home.",
            "Public transit in NYC is so much more convenient and less concentrated around one area. Of course, there's also the population density...mixed feelings.",
            "The only thing I miss about Chicago is cheap garage space so I could have a car, and the prices of most things in general. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t been to NY in 8 years, you should probably come check it out for a week or so. Life is *a lot* harder in NYC, and not just because of the cost. It\u2019s more schlepping, more noise, more drama. Not for everyone. \n\nLiving in Chicago is not really like living in a city, it\u2019s like a big clean suburb that happens to have tall buildings. The pace here is so much faster, people are generally smarter and more intellectually curious, and we let our people integrate."
