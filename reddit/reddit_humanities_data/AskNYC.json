If you want help planning your trip, you need to provide us specific information about you. We all love to have fun, see cool things and eat food. That is not specific detail. You will get more help and better help if you can be specific. \n\nGreat posts that have gotten lots of good information include specific details about what people are fans of and the kinds of things they like to do. If you\u2019re looking for meals or experiences, please provide a budget in actual numerical dollars. \u201cCheap\u201d or \u201c$$\u201d is subjective. Tell us the dollar amount you want to spend per person. \n\nBy way of example: saying you like a good bar is not helpful, but saying you're a huge fan of negronis and would love to try New York City's best is. But you could also say that your idea of a great bar is an old wooden place with gruff bartenders and its own local beers, and you're really looking to stay in Manhattan - that's also specific enough that we can help. \n\nIf you have an itinerary or rough sketch of one already and need help finding a few last pieces - we are great at that! If you have no idea where to start, Google \"NYC itinerary for X days\", try ChatGPT, or search this subreddit - but don't just come and post your ChatGPT spit out here. You need to do your own work a bit and then come ask for advice.\n\nWe really do want to assist you, but it's pretty rude to just post \"we are coming next week and we are [ages], we like food and fun, plan our trip for us!\"",

            "unpopular opinion: walking through it once in a while ain't bad and reminds you of what city you're in",
            "Yeah when I\u2019ve had family they want to see it too. For a lot of people it is kind of insane, my family from the English countryside literally was shell shocked by the people and lights and tall buildings. \n\nWe walked around, avoided the scammers, got a drink at the bar in the Marriott marquis. Ended up being one of their favorite days here lol",
            "Let your folks enjoy Times Square like they want to. It makes for a fun walk around.",
            "Aw, come on. It's fun for the sensory overload. Sure there is not much of interest if you live in NYC but I understand the attraction for visitors. IMO the best is just walking around and kind of watching all the nonsense. Let them know ahead of time that this is probably the best way to experience it.",
            "I hadn\u2019t been to NYC the first hunk if my life.  Then I came here and just the sheer magnitude of Manhattan and TS and the park is overwhelming. Now, TS is just another place to me.  But I still remember many years ago when I first walked there at midnight and how crazy it was.  It was great. I totally get why they want to go.",
            "Times square after like 10-11p is actually kinda cool, the lights really pop at night and the crowds are moderately more tolerable",
            "People who live in New York be like WHY would a TOURIST want to VISIT one of the most FAMOUS PLACES IN THE WORLD?!?!!?!!??",
            "I'm not a local per se so take my opinion with a grain of salt, but I struggle to fathom how so many locals don't understand the appeal of Times Square for tourists. People have grown up seeing images of it. There's no other place like it in the world. What one does there is look at it and take photos. It's called sightseeing.",
            "TS is far the most enjoyable area of NYC, but it\u2019s not intolerable in small doses. Heck I\u2019ll even say it\u2019s kind of interesting to witness once or twice, just due to its sheer craziness. Walking around TS for a bit on a Saturday night isn\u2019t the worst thing in the world. You\u2019ll be fine."

        "content": "Here's the details.\n\nFirst floor apartment in a 4 story brick old school style building.\n\nI came back from 4 months out of town and realize that there's a guy who's got a hoard of stuff  tucked away along the side of and behind the building, which is all directly beneath my windows. He seems to bed down right beneath what is my bedroom window. My window is about 8 or 10 feet off the ground in that spot. \n\nI talked to the super next door, who's door faces the guy's pile of stuff, and he said that he and the super of my building have tried to kick this guy out, gotten rid of his stuff, etc, but he keeps coming back. He was like \"I've tried [next to nothing] and I'm all out of ideas\". I get the feeling that he has stopped caring and simply tolerates the guy. \n\nNow, I asked this super how did the guy seem. He says he seems very nice, like a normal guy.\n\nI've observed that his piles of stuff are relatively tidy and he tries to cover them, and this morning I watched as he flossed and brushed his teeth, and he had his toiletries well arranged in ziplock bags. \n\nI don't feel threatened, though I did install some bars to prevent the window on the fire escape from being able to be opened. \n\nI don't wish this guy harm either, as he obviously is on hard times, and having the police do anything (if they even would), might make his life harder. \n\nMy building's super is about as absent and hands off as you can get, though he did threaten to physically harm someone else who was lurking around. \n\nI could start badgering the management to do something. \n\n\nTBH, I wouldn't really care about this guy's presence, especially as he seems to be taking pains to not be a nuisance, *except* for the face that he's directly beneath my window. Ie, he can probably hear me watch movies, engage in romance, etc. \n\nBeyond that, it's not been any issue. \n\nWhat would you do?",

You can get a big ass plant and planter and place it there next time he moves his stuff.

For a multitude of reasons I avoid the first floor unit in any building.  Update what is truly your issue with this person and then we can have a serious conversation about possible solutions.",
            "I know there is some kind of agency that does homeless outreach - I might contact them to see if they would approach him to see if he would go to a shelter, but I would not report him to anyone who would use force him leave (like the police).",
            " If you have neighbors above you or next to you, they can probably also hear you watching movies, etc. just to put it in perspective. If he isn\u2019t bothering you, maybe drop him so clean socks or a few dollars. Sounds like he\u2019s a man going through a hard time trying his best.",
