        "content": "Hi all,\n\nI had my basement framed and drywalled this past spring. I paid the contractor all the invoices that were sent to me and the work was completed. 4 months later, I just got a letter from a building supply company that the contractor has not paid them for material, totaling $1,055, and that the contractor is filing for bankruptcy. So they are looking to place a lien on my property.\n\nAs a homeowner I have no idea how I can be held liable for the contractor not paying them when I paid the invoices sent by the contractor. Has anyone experienced this before? What are my options here?\n\nThank you in advance.",

They told me to ignore it because the material supply company didn't get paid and the roofing company was a week late on payments.\n\nSounds shady as fuck but I guess that's how it gets done.",
            "This doesn\u2019t sound right to me. If they were a sub of your contractor, you shouldn\u2019t have any liability. They likely have a claim in the contractor\u2019s bankruptcy proceeding but that\u2019s as far as their claim goes. They\u2019re overreaching here and I would tell them to talk to your attorney.",

            "Pretty sure there has to be a notice of commencement filed prior to this type of work possibly, depending on your location. The clerk of court is usually where it is filed. It should have a list of all work to be done contractually and is also used to make sure you aren\u2019t paying for anything twice, for example another charge for these materials. You aren\u2019t obligated to this supplier if you did not go into contract with him, that is the contractors responsibility.",
            "This is called a mechanics lien. Yes its generally legal, and you can be liable because the materials in question were installed in your home. The laws surrounding how this work are very location specific. If the general contractor went under, this could be the first of many who might be able place a lien on the house. Getting a consult with a lawyer may be advisable if it was a large job with a lot of subcontractors. If it was a small job, it may be more cost effective to talk with the guy and see if you can settle as a lawyer would cost you way more than $1k. If you did hire a lawyer they could then sue the general contractor but if they went belly up, you are unlikely to recover just like this supplier.\n\nWhat ever you do, don't ignore this. If they do actually place a lien, you could lose your house over $1k if you don't handle it.",
            "This happened to us after replacing a roof. Lesson learned. Like you we had no idea this could happen. In future we would ask for proof of payment to suppliers or some type of release.  As for the payment I was able to get them to accept 50% if u paid them within 48 hours. They agreed.",
            "My company (Cabinets & countertop supplier) has had to do this a couple of times (OR). It was after trying to get payment from the contractor for 6-12 months and then claiming they went under and couldn\u2019t pay. I didn\u2019t even know that was possible until I started working for the company."

            "Inspectors will always blow things out of proportion to cover their ass. No inspector is going to say it\u2019s a self sealed leak and it\u2019s probably completely fine. A self sealed leak was very small to begin with, usually just a seep that doesn\u2019t even go fast enough to drip. And it likely wont leak again unless you get them jet washed or something. I have a few self sealed leaks that have been there for decades and never leaked again.\n\nI would push back and maybe agree to a small credit. If you had multiple offers, use that to your advantage."

The outside temperature this past week has ranged from 92 degrees F to 99 degrees F \u2014 with a Heat index 104-114 \u2014 and our A/C unit just can\u2019t keep up. For the past 4 years I\u2019ve lived in single building luxury apartments (I only include that part because of the hallway situation) literally one block away from where I am now, and they\u2019ve all had 0 issues with keeping the inside temperature at a steady 65 degrees day and night. Currently we\u2019re aiming for 67 degrees but the A/C can\u2019t get past 75 until around 10 pm, and won\u2019t reach 67 until around 4 am.\n\nI can\u2019t sleep in anything above 68 and my 4 month old gets cranky/wont sleep at around 70 degrees. That\u2019s also when I start getting short tempered and uncomfortable. So I\u2019m looking for ways to cool this place down, even if it\u2019s just keeping things at around 70. All of the windows face south west and get beat down in the afternoons. \n\nOur thermostat shows that the humidity is 78% during the day and around 60% at night.\n\nI also cannot place window a/c or reach the outside of the windows (4th floor woes lol)\n\n##My current set up:\n\n- **Reflectix** (Silver Bubble Wrap). Cut to the shape of the window and taped on the glass with insulation tape. Covering all windows. 0 light gets through.\n\n- **Blackout Curtains**. Thick, double layered, 99% light blocking. Covering all window, in front of the reflectix. A few of the windows have an extra layer of blackout curtains.\n\n- **2-3 box fans in each room**. I know fans don\u2019t cool the air but with multiple fans going in each room, the moving air feels a lot better than without.\n\n- **Ceiling fan in each room**. On all day, going counterclockwise.\n\nI\u2019m open to any suggestions or personal anecdotes right now, because I\u2019m desperate at this point. I thought about maybe doubling up the Reflectix and/or adding reflective heat control film to the windows (Gila brand). Would either of those be effective or am I just out of luck here?",
