Is it fair of him to want the asking price reduced by 10k? \n\nEdit: for clarity, I am the seller, and the buyer hired the inspector. He is suggesting to the buyers to lower the offer we had agreed on (it was subject to inspection)",

            "I had mold remediation done in my bathroom a couple years ago and it cost me $5,000. My mold was way worse than this though. If you wanted to fight them on it you could get a air quality/mold presence test done and base your counter off of those results. If the results are within the acceptable range of air quality standards you can just tell them no. If it comes back significantly higher than the outdoor air then they might have a point. \n\nObviously you do have a moisture issue somewhere because there is mold on those sheets and not on others, so something is happening that if you weren't selling I would say is worth looking into why that's happening.",
            "I mean, it's up to you whether you take his advice. But estimate what it would cost to remediate the problem. If i were the buyer, I'd probably go the route of asking the current owner to remediate the issue and provide proof of remediation or an inspection confirming there is no mold anymore. That way it doesn't become the buyers problem to deal with after the sale. \n\nWhen we purchased our house something similar happened, except that it was the banks appraiser that spotted what looked like mold. The bank wouldn't approve our mortgage until it was remediated and there was documented proof of remediation.",
            "How does the inspector tell anyone how much to lower a price? He is there to inspect, not be part of a real estate transaction. That is Resltors job.\nThat said, that attic does not look all that bad. Of course context is important. Is that from a bathroom vent? Lack of attic ventilation? Plumbing vent not going out thru roof? \nSource: inspector for 30 years.",
            "Did he test for mold? I\u2019m a licensed home inspector in Texas and if you don\u2019t test for mold, you never use that word. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not mold, but that\u2019s a lawsuit waiting to happen if the inspector says mold without testing. \n\nRealistically there is mold in every home, you just want to avoid harmful types or levels. Also, inspectors should not have any opinion on home prices.",
            "Yeah that's a lot of mold looks like poor ventilation not leaks. Or maybe the bathroom is vented directly into the attic, or kitchen vent. Plywood is going to have to be replaced to really fix it, although you could try chemicals.",
            "I\u2019ve sprayed my attic with a product that completely removed any mold. Of course found out why there\u2019s mold there in the first place. Could be a disconnected bathroom vent fan or poor attic ventilation",
            "That's not a thing inspectors do, you might have mold but knowing how much it'll cost to fix is outside the scope of the 3 weeks inspector certification course",
            "Some of the top comments so far are so Reddit. Attic mold remediation costs like $500, so no do NOT listen to people saying \"yeah dude take $10k off so you don't have to deal with it\" \n\nAlso it was the buyer's inspector suggesting that you drop $10k. The selling price has zero to do with them so what's going on there? My guess is buyer's RE agent is the one who got them to hire their inspector buddy. It's common and sleazy.\n\nGet your attic remediated, don't lower your asking price, provide receipt. I was on the buyer side of this once and that's how we handled it, no problems. I certainly didn't try to knock $10k off like a clown buyer. If they don't agree, then send them on their merry way\n\nTo everyone else reading this wrong: OP is the seller, the buyer's inspector is the one attempting this tactic",
            "Something about this doesn't make sense.\n\nA home inspector should be inspecting the home and providing you a report of their findings.  If he's a great inspector familiar with the market, he might be able to give you some ballpark idea of the fixes that would be needed and a ballpark estimate of the price, but even that would be beyond his responsibilities.\n\nThe inspector giving you negotiating advice seems incredibly suspect.  Is he encouraging you to have mold remediation done by a friend of his?",
            "Not really sure where a home inspector gets off telling the buyer how much to ask off on a price. Their job is to report found issues. Not give pricing advice. Does he or his family own a mold remediation business and did he also push the clients to them? Seems kinda fishy."

            ">  Am I better off replacing the entire frame and getting a standard size slab and a professional to install it or should I order a custom slab door and just replace the door itself? \n\nThe frame is called a jamb. Door slabs are fitted to the jamb. The two together, pre-fitted, are called pre-hung. You don't want to do them separately typically speaking. \n\nHave you pulled the casing off the interior side above the jamb? Do the jack studs run all the way up to the header or is there a filler? As in, how hard would it be to make the opening a standard height. Typical rough out height for a exterior door is 82\", however you can get get away with 80 3/4\" to 81\" depending on brand.",
            "I'd imagine because exterior doors aren't intended to be cut to height. You'd be cutting off the the weather strip mount and most exterior door are just foam for the core."
