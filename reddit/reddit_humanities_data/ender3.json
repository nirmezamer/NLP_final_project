I bought the silent motherboard V4.2.7 marlin 2.0.1 recently from amazon and while I was at it i got the BLtouch too. Now when I autohome instead of the corner, it goes to the middle of the bed, and when it tries to home the z axis it ignores the steppers (at least that's what I think they are call). Any help is appreciated. I know next to nothing about computers so please go easy on me.",

            "Well, the difficult part is done. You just need to mount your probe lower. Spacers are small round objects with a role in the middle that go between the mount and the probe, using those will make the probe lower. You can print them to the size you need, or use metal ones if you already have some laying around.",
