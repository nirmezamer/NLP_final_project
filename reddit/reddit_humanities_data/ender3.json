I'm not familiar with FDM, all my experience is Elegoo resin, but I have a project he's agreed to help with. Nozzle and print bed questions\n\n  \ntl;dr is there a recommended texture printbed for Ender 3, and a standard Prusa Slicer profile for 0.2mm, as it only seems to have 0.3 listed? The texture bit I'd love a guide or tutorial for, as I don't really understand that at all, I see things about magnets and glue sticks pop up when I search?",
            "Hi All, I hope this is the place to ask questions, I've never really used reddit and this is my first post. \n\nBorrowing my buddies Ender 3 Pro while he's out of the country for my capstone project in college. I'm still a noob, but I've watched a lot of YouTube videos for beginners, and I thought I had the hang of the printer.\n\n  \nThe issue I'm having is when the print starts. Before a print, I always level the bed, pre heat, put filament, the usual stuff, but when the print actually starts, the nozzle moves 2-3 cm from the perfect bed level I had done and starts printing. Since the nozzle is so far away, the print just auto fails, and I can't seem to figure out why the printer keeps on doing this. It does it on every print I have on the SD card. I've watched countless YouTube videos on troubleshooting this problem but I can't seem to figure out the issue. \n\n  \nAny help/advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks for your time : )",

Now your issue is the nozzle is lower than your crtouch probe when extended. So to solve this you need to add some spacers to the crtouch to lower the crtouch so it can activate the probe before",

            "Well, the difficult part is done. You just need to mount your probe lower. Spacers are small round objects with a role in the middle that go between the mount and the probe, using those will make the probe lower. You can print them to the size you need, or use metal ones if you already have some laying around.",

You need to tighten that belt.\n\nSecond thibg your z height is way to high. You will not have material stick that high up. Highly encourage watching a youtube video on setting up your printer.\n\nDid you buy this new? If so what did you pay? If you paid more than $100(even that) id return it and save a little more and get a v3 se for $179 the print speed and quality of life improvement are way better or a bambu a1 mini for $199.",
