        "content": "Hi Guys, On the browser (Chrome latest version) the TOTP verification codes don't autofill for me. I have to go to the Bitwarden app and copy it manually every time. \n\n\n\nI have just moved from Dashlane to Bitwarden and am not sure if something hasn't been set-up correctly for my browser. On Dashane the TOTP code field would get automatically detected and the latest code would come up on single click. Please help!",

            "So when you invoke autofill (ctrl-shift-L) for a login page, if you have a premium subscription (you may need to log out and in again if you just upgraded), and the autofilled vault entry has a TOTP key, then the current TOTP token is placed on the system clipboard.\n\nOn the TOTP web form, just paste (ctrl-V).",
            "To the people calling for \"past\" is the way : you are not that right because it doesn't work flawless nor well, and pasting the code doesn't work on every field (1p, zoho vault, dashlane, iCloud don't past but provide characters 1 by 1 what ever the field and it works that way the same as a single user using a keyboard and that is flawless).",
            "Thanks for the quick response. Yes, I have the premium subscription and I have logged out and logged back in to activate it within the extension. On the login form the fields username and password gets the Bitwarden extension icon and I can quickly choose the values with a single click. \n\nHowever, for the TOTP field the Bitwarden extension doesn't show up and I need to go to the extension manually --> copy the verification code and paste it into the form on the browser which is a lot of steps. Is this the only way to populate TOTP?",
            "No, once you get to the TOTP field you ought to be able to simply click on that field and then paste. There is no \u201cautofill\u201d here. Bitwarden merely puts the current token on your clipboard, and then you paste it at the right time and place.",
            "> However, for the TOTP field the Bitwarden extension doesn't show up and I need to go to the extension manually --> copy the verification code and paste it into the form on the browser which is a lot of steps. \n\n1. Right-click the TOTP field;\n\n2. Select \"Paste\".\n\nThis has the same number of steps as what you want:\n\n1. Left-click the TOTP field (or the Bitwarden icon in the TOTP field);\n\n2. Select the account to auto-fill for.\n\nThe former method works; the latter method is not yet available in Bitwarden for TOTP fields.",
            "Ahh bummer...Dashlane has the feature of recognising TOTP field and presents the extension within the field. Hopefully Bitwarden will add this in the future...glad to know that I am not facing an issue here...thanks for your time!",
            "I think the problem is it can sometimes be difficult to recognize the TOTP field. PayPal and others have SIX fields, others have a single text field, and there is no standard for naming. It is safer to just have the user wait and then press ctrl-V at the right time.\n\nRemember, Bitwarden is a very small company with limited developer resources. This approach requires less exception programming for different websites.",
            "> Ahh bummer...Dashlane has the feature of recognising TOTP field and presents the extension within the field.\n\nBitwarden _does_ have a feature that recognizes TOTP fields, and allows you to auto-fill them using the `Ctrl+Shift+L` keyboard shortcut (or using **Right-Click > Bitwarden > Auto-fill Login**, or by left-clicking the vault item in the browser extension pop-up or sidebar).  Unfortunately, this feature is relatively new, and therefore does not work on all websites.\n\nFurthermore, the inline auto-fill menus do not yet support auto-filling of TOTP fields (unless, perhaps, the TOTP input field is on the same page as the username or password field).  This was discussed briefly in a [thread on the Community Forum](https://community.bitwarden.com/t/just-released-new-inline-auto-fill/61436/16); evidently, to date, no one has made an [official Feature Request](https://community.bitwarden.com/c/feature-requests/pm-feature-requests/55), though."

            ">Does anyone know of a way to deploy preset settings beyond what can be set in the admin console? Registry, JSON, etc?\n\nThere is no officially supported way to do this, as far as I'm aware.  However, the settings configuration for each app & user is stored in a JSON structure that is bundled with the vault cache in the [local data folder](https://bitwarden.com/help/data-storage/#on-your-local-machine).  You will not be able to simply copy this information (as each user evidently has a unique identifier that is used in the JSON field names), but you may be able to write a script to automate the creation of new JSON based on a gold standard version."
