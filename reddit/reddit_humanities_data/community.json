            "I want to set some space to add onto the unrelated content rule. Where is the line between being relevant or not?. When considering posts for approval I will look at whether I want to set a precedent for such posts in future. A few examples that will be declined under this rule include but not limited to:\n\n*\"Streets Ahead\" sightings - I get it's a quote from the show, but it is not a community creation. Posting examples of it found in books dated before the show's airing only proves my point. This will apply to quotes from the show found on other subreddits, twitter, comment sections, etc.\n\n*Lookalike posts.\n\n\n*AI generated content\n\n13/01\n\nOk, I think the Community edition meme has run it's course, and is just spamming the subs at this point. So any future submissions of this type will be declined.\n\n\n**Solicitation and Promoting of goods**\n\nWe have an unwritten rule about items being sold. We want to offer redditors the opportunity to buy such goods if they choose but are not too keen on users constantly promote their wares and potentially spamming the sub. Because of this sellers will get one and only one opportunity to promote it. Future postings will be declined even if \"other users\" post it."
