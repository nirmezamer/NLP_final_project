Since it is a machine translation, there may be awkward parts... Please understand ^_^ the content of all three is the same.\n    \n    * Virus scan completed\n    * PDF 370 megabytes, medium quality. (High quality is about 6 GB.)\n    * I also posted this on Tumblr and Twitter. \n       - Tumblr: https://www.tumblr.com/blog/zii233\n       - Twitter: https://x.com/crosss538534\n    * The work took about 6 months, and about an hour a day, on everage.\n    * No ads, no payments. It would be an honor if many people see it, enjoy it, and own it. I'm really happy to have completed it and shared it. And every time the number of likes, comments, and shares goes up, I feel good all day long haha\n    \n    Well... have a nice day!",

You probably want to go through and do a thorough spell check again.",
