            "Is this for PVP? Because in PvE campaign you can use anything and you'll be fine most of the time.\n\nHere's my notes\n\n* P05 FCS is below average. The only useful FCS are usually these\n   * P10/SLT = Missile correction stat for missile spam/trueno/coral missile\n   * WLT = Mid range builds like linear rifles and lasers\n   * Ocellus = Close range builds, basically everything else\n* You're beyond the Ideal reload weight for Alula. Here are the boosters usually used:\n   * Alula = General use for <75k total weight\n   * NGI-001 = General use for >75k total weight\n   * Buerzel = Assault boost spam\n   * Gridwalker = lightweight float builds\n   * Kikaku = melee spam. high skill ceiling.\n* Your generator is fine but because you're using stun needles with a ridiculous EN load you have other options if you swap it\n   * SANTAI = Best in slot for 95% of builds. High capacity and fast regen.\n   * VP-20D = 2nd best in slot for general use if SANTAI doesn't have the EN capacity\n   * NGI-000 Coral Generator = I'd only suggest this on hover builds. Redlining generators can be detrimental if the enemy can capitalize on the weird pauses\n   * VE-20B/C = Energy builds. Any weapon that needs the Energy Weapon Spec stat would want to use either the B or the C.\n* Stun Needle is hard to use in PVP. It's fine in PvE but the issue with it is that it was nerfed really hard and you can't proc the Stun effect anymore even with 2 of it. You need 3 hits to get the stun proc. The other is that the warning beeps makes it unusable outside enemy stagger states. Which is fine but there are better punish weapons. I think you're better off with something like Earshot which can be used for both punish and stagger.\n* The 10-tube missile launcher is usually used with other missile launchers too, often a different launcher type to have multiple directions of incoming missile. Having just one is really mid and isn't that good because the enemy will only have to dodge once and in one direction. It has long CD, long lock, bad stagger/sec and damage/sec on top of being heavy. The stat investment is not getting good returns. The 6-tube launcher for better spam or the double ACT missile launcher for surprise damage would synergize more with your build because double gatlings are close range weapons and you can be more aggressive.",
            "Alula is not meant for a heavy AC, you're killing your reload speed with those boosters. You're not gonna be very fast either way, so you're not really missing out on any speed swapping to something slower. You've also got a lot of spare unused load, i would either bulk up your AC or get legs with less capacity like the dessert or wrecker if you have those.",
            "I'd be scared to death to see that coming towards me with murderous intent.",
            "thanks, ill probably refer back to this a lot\nedit: just realized that a lot of my problems are that im going from my lightweight builds thrusters/generators/missles and just slapping them on",
            "ah thank you. I'm currently in chapter 4 and have been using this as a \"AC shredder\" of sorts. I've been using those boosters for my light weight build and forgot to swap them. Thanks for the recommendations"
