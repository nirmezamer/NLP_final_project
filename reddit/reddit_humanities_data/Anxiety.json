            "whatever you have been advised about how to taper , just go slower and at your own pace and what feels ok. Anything you are doing is cutting down how much you consume and you will level out. When I was coming of an SSRI which are really difficult to come off, I tried whet the drs advised in terms of rate and dose but it didnt work for me. In the end I devised my own table over a much longer period than had been suggested. Even then it was really hard but I did have some success with it. I looked at my weekly amount rather than daily and I cut that down by 10% each week and that meant cutting my tablets very small with a pill cutter that you can buy in any pharmacy or on line. Though with some SSRIs when you are coming off you can get a liquid - is there such a thing for gabapentin."

I keep thinking about volcanos, supervolcanos, asteroids, false vacum theory, WWIII, climate change etc. just I finally identified my anxiety as both general and existential anxiety. Combined with my OCD pushing me to repeatedly keep reading the news in search of \"something.\" I definitely don't want my anxious thoughts confirmed, but i guess it's like \"if i check the news and see that everythings okay, i'll be okay.\" But now I'm double anxious that my thoughts and anxiety means something when really it's just a resurgence of stuff I was anxious about all my life and having a lot of free time due to not being in school. I just want to enjoy my summer and make my anxiety stop, but how do you fight existential dread/anxiety? I just needed to get this off my chest, thanks",

I fear they will blame me in some way for not keeping the appointment, and I feel that way for the reasons outside my control but ESPECIALLY feel that way when it feels like the source of why I couldn't keep the appointment was me. \n\nI've started to notice that when an appointment is coming up, it feels like I can't breathe, at least in a mental sorta way. Idk how else to describe it, like my mind has stopped and I can't relax, like my mind is tensed up. And the only way to untense is to cancel the appointment because I can't deal with this feeling for hours waiting on my appointment to come and go. And I feel like I literally can't function feeling like this, so if I even made it to the appointment, I would be a complete mess of a human being. Yet the idea of having to go through the process of cancelling terrifies me especially if I've had to cancel a few times before this. It's like I'm damned if I do, damned if I don't. But I can't deal with this tense feeling so I inevitably cancel so I can finally feel like I can untense and breathe again.\n\nIt feels like I'm stuck in some sort of cycle and only very few times when all the planets align do I feel good enough to keep my appointments and nothing else comes my way to ruin my plans. And I hate it, makes me feel like a failure that I can't keep simple appointments.\n\nAnd then if I need to respond to texts, emails, or calls about setting up a new appointment, the negative feelings start up again. I try to ignore everything the best I can but I have to eventually take a look and respond back and what sucks is when it's a short thing I'm responding to, it's like \"why did I ignore this so long instead of responding right away\" and then I respond to confirm a new appointment date and then don't even feel much better anyway.",

I just started to feel off.. felt nauseous, and like I was having trouble breathing, but I maintained. It wasn\u2019t until 4pm when I got back to the shop I told my buddy I wasn\u2019t feeling good. We went inside he got me a Gatorade but told my boss I wasn\u2019t feeling well. By then my entire body was shaking, having trouble standing up, felt shortness of breath, etc. all the typical symptoms I get during a panic attack. My boss suggested calling the ambulance. So they did. \n\nThey took my vitals and all while I was in the office and everything was great, heart rate was 75, Blood oxygen was 98, blood pressure was a little elevated which is typical when I have this issue.. I ended up going to the hospital in the ambulance, I walked out, hopped in. When I got to the hospital I was already feeling better, not great but knew it was cooling off. They took an EKG, no issues with the heart, or lungs. Ended up giving me Atarax (that stuff is AMAZING, btw) and my mom gave me a ride home. \n\nBut god I feel embarrassed. I had 4 people standing over me during a panic attack at work. Get hauled off in an ambulance, all for a panic attack.. granted I have been under an ENORMOUS amount of stress at work from my boss. But I never thought I would be hauled off in an ambulance at work because of this.\n\nShould I feel embarrassed? I feel like I don\u2019t want to show my face at work again. I\u2019m fricken 35.. I hate feeling like this. \n\ntl;dr: feeling off all day, made it until 4am(quitting time) and it hit me, boss ended up calling ambulance, I got sent off with good vitals etc, they gave me atarax, and I went home with a sick note for the next day.

            "Yo! This is insane. The same thing just happened to me today.\n\nI have a perfectly normal start to my day, feeling good. I get into the office and work as usual and then I get a completely unimportant phone call that I fumble a tiny bit. I'm awkward on the phone. This sends me. I get a headache, I'm thinking it's an aneurysm for some reason, I start sweating, I tense up, I think I'm about to pass out and I just can't ground myself.\n\nLike you say the worst part might be the embarrassment. Can my coworkers notice? Do they see me hunched over in my chair all tense not doing anything? Haha.\n\nI'm very new to anxiety but I already had 3 or 4 episodes so I was fairly sure that I wasn't going to die but man the embarrassment...\n\nI have an even worse story. I have an attack in the middle of the night. I struggle to fall asleep again and boom it's 6am, gotta get ready for work. There is no way. I can't work 8h without sleeping. S*hould've just called in sick, idiot* So I sleep in, walk in late, go to my boss and apologize for coming in late. I live in Germany and I don't even know what anxiety is in German so I blurt out \"I had fear in the night, couldn't sleep, sorry\". He was probably as confused as me so at the end of the day he says \"Have a good weekend and good dreams without nightmares\". BRO!!! He thought I came late because of a nightmare. I feel too much shame to talk about this so I just left it there. He's a good boss but he must think that I'm insane now.\n\nAnyway. As someone who has experienced an anxiety attack I have nothing but compassion for you. If other people knew how bad it can feel they wouldn't look down on you. I won't feel embarrassed if you won't!",

            "Are they sending you the medical bill? If so, I would be more pissed than embarrassed unless you have really good insurance. I know they were trying to do the right thing, but if that were me and they stuck me with the crippling debt of an ambulance ride, I'd almost be inclined to sue \ud83d\ude05\n\nIf they are paying for it, it may be a little embarrassing, but at least you got some vital information about your health and that you're doing well you wouldn't have gotten otherwise!",
            "That\u2019s a kind thing to do, if you\u2019re not able to function, it\u2019s okay to get help. Sounds like a compassionate boss, to be honest, at least in this regard. \n\nIt might help him to evaluate the pressure he\u2019s putting on you, but if not, it might be worth a conversation about what you need from him in the relationship. Calmer emails, talks in person, less work, additional hires? Good chance to reflect and share about what\u2019s not working for you. A good boss will work FOR their employees, not against them. And his response demonstrates that he is at least willing to take compassionate action in a crisis situation. This may extend more generally to your work as well if you can talk about it. \n\nBest of luck, and hope you feel better today"

It can help to explain your reasons, but you can just say you've decided against it if you don't want to give reasons. If they try to push for why, just explain that's your final decision.\n- You can ask for them to suggest other medications (and you can also give guidelines there to help them make suggestions like say \"I don't want an SSRI but would be willing to try something else\" or \"I don't want anything addictive\" etc)\n- If you've done your research, you can suggest other medications yourself. The medication I'm on now was NOT something my psychiatrist suggested to me - it was something I found through my own research and asked my psychiatrist if she could prescribe me. She agreed it was a good idea and put me on it.\n\nThey can tell you that they won't prescribe you a certain medication, if there's contraindications like it being an addictive medication that they won't just prescribe to anyone, or it interacting poorly with other medications or health conditions of yours - but they CANNOT force you to take a medication.\n\nThere are only two exceptions to this:\n\n- 1) When you have a court order decreeing that you are no longer fit to govern your medication decisions, in which case someone, usually a family member/guardian, will be able to decide for you which medications you take. \n- 2) When you are in medical custody - this can be when you're undergoing emergency procedures, for example as a result of an accident, they can and will administer painkillers and such without waiting for you to regain consciousness first to ask permission - and this can also be when you're committed at a psych facility, where they can legally force you to take things like antipsychotics.\n\nOtherwise it is completely your decision what medications you do or don't take. Don't be afraid of them making suggestions to you and you having to say no, people say no to their suggestions all the time. If it makes it any easier, just tell them you need some time to think the decision over, so you can go home and plan how to say no to them later.\n\n---\n\n**Last but not least, look at what the different types of doctors in your country do. In many countries, diagnosis AND prescription happens from psychiatrists, but in some countries therapists/psychologists make diagnosis and psychiatrists prescribe medications. If your country has the latter system, then by going to a psychologist you can get your diagnosis without ever being offered/suggested medication.**",

It\u2019s your choice and not wanting to take meds is a valid choice. \n\nI did not want to take meds and I finally gave in to the constant pressure from family, friends, medical personnel and therapist to try it.

Not to mention all of the awful side effects just to met with \u201chere try this other one\u201d that had different horrible side effects. I should have gone with my gut and not given in to the pressure. \n\nIt\u2019s okay to not take medication. You are not wrong for making that decision for yourself. Find you a good therapist that will diagnose you and treat you without meds.",

If medication cured anxiety disorders there would be nobody in this subreddit. You have anxiety not depression. Depression is a chemical imbalance and anxiety is too much adrenaline cause by a misfiring of the amygdala (different part of the brain than depression). Another fun fact is adrenaline comes from an organ called the adrenal glands on top of the kidneys. So that being said anxiety is as related to depression as diabetes is. Anyways anti depressants will take the edge off but won\u2019t ever cure you. Remove the meds and the anxiety floods back again. When I came off the meds I finally did the work myself and that\u2019s what ultimately lead me to my recovery. Not against meds just saying if you need an anxiety break they can help but you don\u2019t NEED them to recover or get better"
