            "whatever you have been advised about how to taper , just go slower and at your own pace and what feels ok. Anything you are doing is cutting down how much you consume and you will level out. When I was coming of an SSRI which are really difficult to come off, I tried whet the drs advised in terms of rate and dose but it didnt work for me. In the end I devised my own table over a much longer period than had been suggested. Even then it was really hard but I did have some success with it. I looked at my weekly amount rather than daily and I cut that down by 10% each week and that meant cutting my tablets very small with a pill cutter that you can buy in any pharmacy or on line. Though with some SSRIs when you are coming off you can get a liquid - is there such a thing for gabapentin."

            "I think I just want someone to tell me my anxiety is nothing and it's all in my head. For days, i've been on edge about everything. I keep thinking about volcanos, supervolcanos, asteroids, false vacum theory, WWIII, climate change etc. just I finally identified my anxiety as both general and existential anxiety. Combined with my OCD pushing me to repeatedly keep reading the news in search of \"something.\" I definitely don't want my anxious thoughts confirmed, but i guess it's like \"if i check the news and see that everythings okay, i'll be okay.\" But now I'm double anxious that my thoughts and anxiety means something when really it's just a resurgence of stuff I was anxious about all my life and having a lot of free time due to not being in school. I just want to enjoy my summer and make my anxiety stop, but how do you fight existential dread/anxiety? I just needed to get this off my chest, thanks",

My last go around was horrific, but that was when I was in my early 20s. Now that I'm 30 I'm hoping for a different experience. I just can't battle my body's anxiety reactions with regular coping mechanisms anymore, it's so overwhelming. Face flushing and feeling hot, feeling dizzy, heart palpitations, chest pain, and other stuff that is just intolerable. Plus my cat is really sick and might pass away, this year is feeling so cruel. I'm trying Wellbutrin, because at least if it doesn't help the anxiety it should at least help me to stop smoking cigarettes or vice versa. Might as well have one win from this. In better news, I have a new job coming up. Which is also anxiety producing but hey at least it's paid anxiety \ud83d\ude0e",

            "i\u2019m really confused at what i just experienced so i\u2019m putting it in here because i want to address it and cope with it properly. but basically i haven\u2019t panicked or had intense anxiety in a really long time. mainly because ive learned to address my symptoms and generally (very) negative thoughts patterns. but today i had a pretty big argument with somebody im close to. it was definitely a very long time coming but i haven\u2019t had something like this happen to me in years. i think i started spiraling because of that and i googled things like \u201cam i bad person? am i a toxic person?\u201d and i started having a flood of negative thoughts about myself. i could feel the\u00a0self-worth i took so long to build shattering. i was legit questioning every single thing about myself. then its like my body just froze.\u00a0i was lying on my bed, not moving at all as i cried. and the negative thoughts just kept coming and i didn\u2019t stop them. finally, after 10ish minutes i snapped out of it and it felt like i kind of came out of a trance. is this something people with anxiety experience? is this a different way of my body coping with it? i\u2019ve always experienced hyperventilating, high heart rate, like the typical anxiety attack symptoms but this was a first for me. i kind of just dissociated but i was also present?? i\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on and im a little bit worried bcs i really don\u2019t want my anxiety getting bad again. it took a lot to pull myself out of the worst parts and get to where i am today.",
