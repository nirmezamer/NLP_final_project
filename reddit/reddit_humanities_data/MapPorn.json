            "I am in the market for a decent globe. I didn\u2019t realize light-up ones were a thing until I started looking. \n\nI\u2019m leaning towards [this one](https://replogleglobes.com/product/odessa-blue-12/) at the moment. \n\nAre Replogle globes a decent brand? Any other suggestions? Budget around $100 ish. Main things I\u2019m looking for are: blue oceans, political boundaries colored (filled in preferably) and good construction. I\u2019ve seen some where the seams are misaligned, etc., and don\u2019t want that.",
            "Hi there I got suggested to come here to try spread my subreddit about maps. This sub redded is for anyone who enjoys walking and or maps so if you do maybe come have a look. We are only a very small sub right now but will hopefully become bigger soon. The sub does mainly focus on osmaps (Ordnance Survey) but any maps are well come. So if your interested come have a look at r/osmaps and I'll see you there",
            "I'm interested in creating a map. I've drawn it out in detail already in Google My Maps. I used GMM as it allowed me to trace rivers and mountains easily, whilst seeing settlement positions. I was wondering if anyone knows if there's a way of using these shape drawings with some software to create a simple map - as print screening isn't very practical. Google My Maps allows exports to KML and KMZ files which could be useful. Would appreciate any directions.",

            "Long story. But I\u2019m trying to draw my own small town fictional map. Are there any free map drawing tools available. This would be for a reference page to a fictional mystery novel a friend is writing. Essentially, it would not need to be hyper detailed; just to layout roads, and major story points and the town center. Any input would be appreciated. Thanks everyone!",
