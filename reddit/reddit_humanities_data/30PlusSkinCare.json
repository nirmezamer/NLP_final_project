            "Most bottled water is treated tap water. Thermal spring water is mineral water extracted from a spring. France ( home country of laroche posay ) has a huge tradition around those thermal springs. There's dozens of thermal cure clinics build around those springs, each renowned for its properties. Some of those springs are advised for this or that ailment. For example if you have asthma a french doctor might send you to la Bourboule. If you have eczema you might be adressed to Avne spring. The composition of mineral water changes from source to source, depending on the rocks it goes through before riching surface. So Laroche Posay having such a thermal spring puts their water in their products. The brand being on the high price range, its bottled water is tagged quite high. Not that high though. In france it's 5-8 dollars.\n\nAll this being said, the real question is : ok, but does it really work and is it really better than bottled water ? As a thermal cure in a spring clinic, yes, it's quite proven. In bottle ? There's no proof.",

            "These are thermal spring water. They are not just water. Yes its pricey but it is able to smoothe and calm slightly irritated skin. I have been using various brands of thermal water to spray my face and body for a decade and I love them. I wont say they are a must have in your skincare routine but a nice to have. The brands I would recommend are Vichy, la Roche posay, Uriage and avene. I find the one from Evian doesnt work like the rest of the brands I mentioned.",

            "Yep, I plunk down the money for these French thermal water sprays. I use it as my last rinse after my evening double cleanse. It helps me feel like Ive gotten every last bit of cleanser off my skin, especially in hard to get places like under my chin. \n\nIts also good for a quick spritz before hyaluronic acid, or anytime, really. Where I live, basically 6 months of the year are hot and humid, from the moderately uncomfortable range to the miserable, takes your breath away when you step outside range. I dont enjoy it refrigerated, but just straight off the shelf it feels so nice and cooling!"
