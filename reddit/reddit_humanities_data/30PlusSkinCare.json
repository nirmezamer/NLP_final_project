Occasionally I\u2019ll see someone who does and think oh hey someone like me\u2026 do most women shave or wax their peach fuzz? (I know this isn\u2019t considered beard hair) ",

            "I have super similar fuzz. I cycle between dermaplaning it and embracing it. Flamingo makes a really nice dermaplaning razor with very affordable refills if you decide to go that route.\n\nBut I once read that Herb Ritz, who frequently photographed Marilyn Monroe, said he loved her peach fuzz because it gave her an ethereal glow (or something similarly poetic) and I kinda think that\u2019s awesome\n\nEdit: someone astutely pointed out that the photog was likely not Herb Ritz and they are probably right. May have been Richard Avedon.",
            "This is only my opinion but I feel like dermaplaning started off as a way to improve skin texture and remove vellus hair (peach fuzz) so makeup is easier to apply, but it's evolved to the point where it's made a lot of women feel pressure to have no vellus hair at all. \n\nVellus hair is normal and I haven't run into any kind of measuring stick that determines how much peach fuzz is too much. If it is causing you woe, you have options, including dermaplaning.",
            "I have always had way more than most people too, but I read something the other day saying there was a positive correlation with vellus hairs and skin elasticity and negative relationship with skin sagging severity. Made me think I should maybe stop hating it so much \n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36823501/#:~:text=We%20found%20that%20vellus%20hair,elastic%20recovery%20to%20total%20deformation).",
            "I think \u201cnormal\u201d varies, really! If I saw you I wouldn\u2019t think twice about it or even really notice it \u2014 but I don\u2019t think my face has quite as much fuzz. BUT I do have a few longer and much darker hairs than you on my chin that I often pluck. \nIf I were in your shoes I\u2019d probably remove it just to help my makeup application, but it\u2019s all about what you feel comfortable with!",
            "I have a similar amount of peach fuzz as you do. I leave mine because it seems like a pretty trivial thing to spend effort on maintaining (along with so many other things!). I feel like it shows up more in pictures like this than in person so I don\u2019t stress about it too much. I say just try not to look at it as we are our own harsh critics. I doubt anyone else in your normal life notices like you do. I wasn\u2019t going to comment but I saw everyone saying to shave it off and was surprised there weren\u2019t at least a few abstainers! All of this being said, I do have a gnarly stache that I trim with a dermaplane tool and it does cause irritation/occasional break outs (I don\u2019t break out much at all) so do be careful if you\u2019re prone.",
            "I just shave mine like once a month. It doesn't grow back any thicker or darker or anything. I just use my regular razor and shave oil. It's been working for men for ages. \n\nI have tried waxing and other methods in the past but shaving is the only one that doesn't give me any irritation or breakouts.",
            "I have lots of light peach fuzz. I leave it alone. I refuse to start some other cosmetic thing I gotta keep up with ha",
            "I'm 42 and started noticing that mine was looking thicker. I wondered if I was imagining things, and then I did a little reading and found out that as we age our vellus hair DOES in fact get thicker due to hormonal changes! LUCKY US! And some vellus hair can even become terminal hair as we approach menopause. I started using those little beauty razors to shave mine off, but honestly, it just caused it to grow back with blunted ends and wonky, which made it more noticeable to me and made me feel even worse about it. I'm at the point where I'm just like, fuck it. I don't care anymore. But I also don't wear makeup, and foundation and powder definitely makes it more noticeable. Anyway, I just came here to say you're perfectly normal. If you decide to start using the razors or dermaplaning, be prepared to keep at it if you don't want to deal with pokey, blunted vellus hair.\n\nEdited to add that all of these people saying \"hairier than most\" are probably just younger and haven't experienced this yet. THEIR TIME WILL COME!!!!",
            "I think its a little more than average, personally I would dermaplane it. I use the tinkle razors you can get for cheap on amazon. Makes your makeup look way better too!",

After few hours of sleep i went out and the sunscreen i used instantly gave me those burns and redness when my skin was already very dull and dry. Last night I applied few rounds of Epaderm ointment+ aquaphor ( skipped tret too) and ta-daa. Completely healed today. Even that nasty smile line looks smoother. I shared it because i am very happy with quick recovery and may be helpful for those who experience sunscreen burn like me\u2026",

There\u2019s no smell, which was a major downside to PC, and the texture is lovely!\nI still suffer from occasional flushing but it\u2019s decreased since starting AzA and regular sunscreen in general.",

So maybe that\u2019s why it stings your nose?\n\nI\u2019m debating taking a break for a week and just moisturizing a lot, maybe slugging Vaseline, and then try again but I am not really sure what to do.\u00a0",

I almost gave up until I came across a few redditors who said that any hint of moisture can cause the acid to penetrate more intensely.  I\u2019ve since started waiting until my face is completely dry before applying, and I haven\u2019t had any irritation since."

I hate to scare you but this reminds me of when my sister had a tumor behind her eye, though that was a little higher up.\u00a0\n\n\nI hope it's something minor or dental in nature! The tumor thing is a very small chance I'm sure. But doesn't hurt to ask, right?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nI agree also that you're really good-looking, so at least it isn't super devastating to your appearance or anything! I'd say you're killing it in that regard.\u00a0\n\n\nGood luck!",

It is does look fuller on one side and could just be your face shape or an overactive masseter muscle, but that\u2019s not likely to be the reason if it\u2019s a new change to your face. \n\nI favor my right side when chewing and have TMJ, death clamping to the point of headaches and shoulder/pain - I started masseter Botox 2 years ago and it has been a godsend. My right muscle needs more units and a little even in the temple area, and it\u2019s made a visible difference,  and no more pain! But you kinda *know* if it\u2019s just an overactive muscle, so if you\u2019re not death clamping your jaw all day everyday, you should get checked out by a doctor! Well you should go anyway but definitely urgently in case it\u2019s an abscess \ud83e\udee0",
