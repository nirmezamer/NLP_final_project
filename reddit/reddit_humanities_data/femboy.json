        "content": "## Titles   \nWhen writing a title to your post, please make sure you're not:      \n- Making it NSFW/explicit in nature.     \n- Engagement baiting, such as:   \n  - Telling the user to upvote or comment a specific thing (\"say X if you think i'm cute\", \"describe me with one word\", \"first thing that comes to mind seeing me?\", \"call me cute\", \"rate me\", \"upvote if you think i'm cute\").   \n  - Simple yes/no questions (\"do i look cute?\", \"do i pass?\", \"do you like me?\", \"am i fem?\").   \n  - More general/original questions do not fall under this and are allowed (such as \"what do you think of my outfit?\", \"which top should i go with?\").      \n- Baiting the reader by including suggestive questions or propositions in it         \n  - (e.g. \"i wanna snuggle with you\", \"what would you do with me?\", \"i'm your femboy\", \"can i be your femboy?, am i X enough for you, would you date me\").   \n- Sympathy baiting/fishing for compliments by being self-demeaning         \n  - (e.g. \"am i ugly?\", \"sorry for not being cute\", \"thought i'd share despite being X\", \"i'm too X to be a femboy\").     \n- Asking for messaging or DMs in any way      \n  - (e.g. \"looking for X\", \"looking for people in X\", \"DM if you want X\").     \n- Advertising or mentioning your socials or other accounts in any way     \n  - (e.g. \"should i wear this on stream\", \"instagram: XXXX\", \"follow me on snapchat\", \"check my profile for more\").       \n\n## Content\nFor a post to be considered SFW and thus approved, you must:        \n- Have sufficient skin coverage (for bottoms, it must cover as much as short shorts, for top, sports bra)         \n  - Lingerie does not count even if it covers the same amount.   \n  - Having any of the \"to cover\" areas be transparent does not count either.   \n  - Censoring them with something else does not count.   \n  - Having things barely show or raising your clothes as a \"tease\" falls under NSFW.   \n- Not show a visible bulge or genital outline.  \n- Not show underwear at all, not even a peek.  \n- Not have the picture/angle focus on butt.  \n- Not have any kink or nsfw gear in the picture, including leashes or certain outfits (like tight latex suits, bunny suits).  \n- Be more than a legs only pic, as in shows more than just lower body.  \n- If you have a watermark on it, then it must be of your reddit username, nothing else.  \n\n## FAQ\n- \"Will i get banned if my post doesn't follow this?\"\n  - It depends, if it's explicit or blatantly/intentionally NSFW, then yes, it will result in a ban, otherwise all that will happen is that the post will get removed.\n- \"*Insert post* is still here despite breaking the guidelines, how come?\n  - If it was submitted before the guidelines were posted, then it is not covered by it, as we do not seek to retroactively punish everyone when the full guidelines weren't even there.\n  - **HOWEVER** if it's clearly NSFW or the post has been submitted after this, then please do report it, as our moderators cannot see every single post on their own and we need the community to help us with this.\n- \"My post got removed/isn't showing up despite respecting the guidelines! why?\"\n  - If it did respect the guidelines then it is likely the automod or spam filter, bring it up to us in modmail and we'll approve it\n\n## Need any help or clarification? send us a message through modmail!",
