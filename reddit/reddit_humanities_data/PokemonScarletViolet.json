            "Since I started with Pearl then SoulSilver and now Scarlet, I've always just trained my Pokemon until they were guaranteed higher levels than the gyms. I only know a few different type advantages and never kept a stats type move, always on offense.\n\nI'm a champion now, trying to finish my Pokedex and beat the 6 starred tera raids. With no knowledge of max stat building, how would you suggest I start?\n\nThe first black tera raid battle I encountered was a ghost tera type talonflame, so obvi I chose a level 100 Gengar and have nothing to show for it. Not so obvi anymore.\n\nHalp\n\nThe more specifics the better.\n\nAlso is a green deerling a shiny or that's just how it's supposed to be?",
            "I have just received the version of the cart that has the DLC already on it (kinda). I bought myself the original cartridge way back when. \n\nThe save is actually on the console, correct? What I\u2019m asking is, can I switch over to the \u2018complete\u2019 game card and have my file be there and keep on going, or would I be staring the game from scratch using the new card?\n\nI\u2019d really like to play the DLC but I don\u2019t want to start a new file without my old friends!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonScarletViolet/comments/1dqzfpy/the_real_reason_geeta_uses_glimmora_as_her_final/",
        "content": "While replaying Pokemon Violet again, I questioned myself for the 4th time why Geeta uses a setup mon as her ace. She\u2019s supposed to be champion-rank! The top Champion! Why doesn\u2019t she send Glimmora out first and Kingambit last? In popular reworks of her team, it is so much better when Glimmora is sent out first to set up Toxic Spikes, and Kingambit last because of Supreme Overlord.\n\nDigging deeper, story-wise, I figured out for myself while Geeta used Glimmora as her ace.\n\nAs you venture into Area Zero with your friends, you and Nemona battle a Glimmora, which Nemona tells you that Glimmora can only be found in Area Zero, and specifically says Geeta uses it. How did Geeta get a Glimmora? I knew it wouldn\u2019t be as simple as she found a Glimmet and evolved it.\n\nWell, when Geeta terrastalizes (apology for the misspelling) her Glimmora into Tera-Rock, she says \"Be the light that guides all trainers, Glimmora.\" And that\u2019s when it hit me. Tera-Rock is in the form of a Treasure Chest, the entire game\u2019s premise is to seek out your treasure. Glimmora is the light that guides all trainers. Geeta\u2019s Glimmora is the one that guides all trainers in seeking out their treasure. The real reason Glimmora is her ace is because it\u2019s the one that guides all trainers. It makes more sense considering GameFreak intentionally had Tera-Rock be the final Tera Type shown to you across the game, because it\u2019s literally the Treasure Chest trainers have been seeking out for. \n\nBut that\u2019s not all, Glimmora IS Geeta\u2019s treasure. Geeta\u2019s first goal was to travel Area Zero, and when she couldn\u2019t open the Gate, she found Glimmora. She found it symbolic that Glimmora is her guide in finding her treasure. So she decides to use Glimmora to help other trainers\u2019 find theirs.\n\nWhile Geeta sending out Glimmora is bad competitively, story-wise, it makes more sense.\n\nTL;DR: Geeta uses Glimmora to guide trainers in seeking out their own treasure, Glimmora IS Geeta\u2019s treasure.",

            "i always interpreted the rock tera crown as a parthenon tbh?? stylized to be smaller on the bottom, but still with the triangle roof and the pillars around the sides. doesn't look much like a treasure chest to me",
            "It's not like in previous games where the champion is fighting for their job. It's just a final exam to get a school rank.",
            "The rock tera crown looks like the Parthenon too me, man, not a treasure chest.",
            "Not to be that guy and i might be stupid, but cant you find glimmet in several caves outside of area zero?",
            "The issue isn\u2019t that Glimmora is her ace, that\u2019s just fine. The issue is the idea that she *must* save her ace for last even when it\u2019s actively a worse move.",
            "I definitely can\u2019t see a treasure chest. I agree that it\u2019s a stylized Greek/Roman structure. \n\nOn top of it all, Geeta\u2019s got a huge incentive to get more champions through. One thing I liked is that everybody has a career, but another post (from forever ago) brought to light that most regions have gym leaders as gym leaders. It looks like there\u2019s a shortage of Pok\u00e9mon leaders in Paldea which is further emphasized by Larry having 3 jobs (his office gig, gym leader, and elite 4 member). Even the elite 4 location has nobody there unlike every other region where there\u2019s a mart, poke center, people to check if you qualify and have all gym badges. In SV, Rika is the one to check you into the elite 4. Again, double duty. \n\nI think my biggest complaint is that these are all theories and the game should\u2019ve done a better job to narrate the reason Geeta doesn\u2019t have her team set up that way. I feel like all champions have had a strong narrative explaining who they are and what makes them so tough. There\u2019s so much interaction with Geeta, but nothing really is explained\u2026",
            "Geeta isn\u2019t losing her job if you win which could be why she isn\u2019t being as tough on the player like previous champions. Also the fact that you have to fight Nemona almost directly afterwards.",
            "I\u2019m sorry but where exactly do you see the treasure chest in the rock Tera lol",
            "This boy ain't right...\n\nI could quite perfectly remember the Rock Tera, but I knew it wasn't a chest, then others freshened me up- totally Greek Parthenon symbol."
