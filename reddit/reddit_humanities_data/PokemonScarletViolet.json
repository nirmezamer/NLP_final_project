        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonScarletViolet/comments/1dqzfpy/the_real_reason_geeta_uses_glimmora_as_her_final/",
        "content": "While replaying Pokemon Violet again, I questioned myself for the 4th time why Geeta uses a setup mon as her ace. She\u2019s supposed to be champion-rank! The top Champion! Why doesn\u2019t she send Glimmora out first and Kingambit last? In popular reworks of her team, it is so much better when Glimmora is sent out first to set up Toxic Spikes, and Kingambit last because of Supreme Overlord.\n\nDigging deeper, story-wise, I figured out for myself while Geeta used Glimmora as her ace.\n\nAs you venture into Area Zero with your friends, you and Nemona battle a Glimmora, which Nemona tells you that Glimmora can only be found in Area Zero, and specifically says Geeta uses it. How did Geeta get a Glimmora? I knew it wouldn\u2019t be as simple as she found a Glimmet and evolved it.\n\nWell, when Geeta terrastalizes (apology for the misspelling) her Glimmora into Tera-Rock, she says \"Be the light that guides all trainers, Glimmora.\" And that\u2019s when it hit me. Tera-Rock is in the form of a Treasure Chest, the entire game\u2019s premise is to seek out your treasure. Glimmora is the light that guides all trainers. Geeta\u2019s Glimmora is the one that guides all trainers in seeking out their treasure. The real reason Glimmora is her ace is because it\u2019s the one that guides all trainers. It makes more sense considering GameFreak intentionally had Tera-Rock be the final Tera Type shown to you across the game, because it\u2019s literally the Treasure Chest trainers have been seeking out for. \n\nBut that\u2019s not all, Glimmora IS Geeta\u2019s treasure. Geeta\u2019s first goal was to travel Area Zero, and when she couldn\u2019t open the Gate, she found Glimmora. She found it symbolic that Glimmora is her guide in finding her treasure. So she decides to use Glimmora to help other trainers\u2019 find theirs.\n\nWhile Geeta sending out Glimmora is bad competitively, story-wise, it makes more sense.\n\nTL;DR: Geeta uses Glimmora to guide trainers in seeking out their own treasure, Glimmora IS Geeta\u2019s treasure.",

            "i always interpreted the rock tera crown as a parthenon tbh?? stylized to be smaller on the bottom, but still with the triangle roof and the pillars around the sides. doesn't look much like a treasure chest to me",
            "It's not like in previous games where the champion is fighting for their job. It's just a final exam to get a school rank.",
            "The rock tera crown looks like the Parthenon too me, man, not a treasure chest.",
            "Not to be that guy and i might be stupid, but cant you find glimmet in several caves outside of area zero?",
            "The issue isnt that Glimmora is her ace, thats just fine. The issue is the idea that she *must* save her ace for last even when its actively a worse move.",
            "Im sorry but where exactly do you see the treasure chest in the rock Tera lol",
            "Geeta isnt losing her job if you win which could be why she isnt being as tough on the player like previous champions. Also the fact that you have to fight Nemona almost directly afterwards.",
            "that is NOT a treasure chest",
            "This boy ain't right...\n\nI could quite perfectly remember the Rock Tera, but I knew it wasn't a chest, then others freshened me up- totally Greek Parthenon symbol.",
