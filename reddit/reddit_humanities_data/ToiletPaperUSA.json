        "content": "## **Pro-Palestinians & Anti-Israel**\n\nWe\u2019ve had an increase in Israel apologia and anti-Palestinian bigotry recently and want to make our stance on the topic clear.  **This is a leftist subreddit; we oppose Israel\u2019s colonization of Palestine and we oppose their genocide of Palestinians.**  Any justifying, celebrating, or endorsing Israel\u2019s genocide or colonialism will get a permanent ban.  (So will any other fascist apologetics.)\n\n## **Rules Updates**\n\nA few weeks ago, [we posted announcing two new moderators](https://www.reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/comments/195wxtn/new_mods_and_what_do_you_all_want_for_the_future/)!  They\u2019ve been able to help us keep up with with moderation, but also make some updates to the rules.  The substance of the rules hasn\u2019t changed, but we simplified them, rewrote some explanations & added examples, and reordered them in the sidebar (hopefully from least \u2192 most obvious).  Please make sure you\u2019re familiar with the rules before participating!\n\nWith our new mods, we can also stay more on top of our quality-control moderation.  We\u2019re especially focused on enforcing [rule 1: Stick to the Toiletverse](https://www.reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/wiki/rules/#wiki_rule_.231_.2014_stick_to_the_toiletverse) and [rule 4: Meme weekends](https://www.reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/wiki/rules/#wiki_rule_.234_.2014_meme_weekends) to encourage more meme posting.\n\n**If you see a post that violates our rules (including for being low-quality/reposted \\[**[**rule 10**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/wiki/rules/#wiki_rule_.2310_.2014_no_low-quality_posts.2Freposts)**\\] or off-topic \\[**[**rule 1**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/wiki/rules/#wiki_rule_.231_.2014_stick_to_the_toiletverse)**\\], among others), please report it.**  We can\u2019t read every single comment & post.\n\n## **Tell Us What You Want**\n\nWe also want to repeat a call we made in [our last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/comments/195wxtn/new_mods_and_what_do_you_all_want_for_the_future/):\n\n>**Now we want to know, what do you want to see for the future of the sub and what do you want from your mod team?**  Better enforcement of meme weekends?  Please funny people, we need you!!  Not just for weekends but the whole week!!  What else?  Stronger enforcement of fake tweets having \"FAKE\" in the title?  You tell us!!  We want to know what you want from us!!\n\nOn our last post, the most popular feedback we saw was:\n\n1. Better enforcement of [rule 2: Fake is Fake](https://www.reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/wiki/rules/#wiki_rule_.232_.2014_fake_is_fake) (i.e., making sure fake tweets/etc. are flaired & titled accordingly)\n2. More meme & satire posts (rather than news or real tweets)\n3. A noticeable lack of canine semen\n4. No tankies\n\nWe hope that having new mods for the last few weeks has helped with #1 & #2 (& #3), but one of the issues we\u2019re having is we just don\u2019t get a ton of meme submissions anymore.  **So, we really encourage you all to take a look at the** [**TPUSA meme templates in the wiki**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/wiki/index/templates/)**.**  Currently, that includes:\n\n* [Charlie Kirk with shrunken face](https://imgur.com/a/X3cmd7g) (includes \\~15)\n* [Charlie Kirk with normal-sized face](https://imgur.com/a/Nyq2pDD) (includes \\~15)\n* [Charlie Kirk with enlarged face](https://imgur.com/a/SYqTd1P) (includes \\~15)\n* [Charles Kirkland](https://i.redd.it/w4mq5g8ak1q21.png) (includes 1, underused atm)\n* [Charlie Kirk Face Scaler](https://blovish.github.io/kirkslider/) \u2014 an interactive tool, get the exact shrinkage you need, or animate something\n* [Candace Owens](https://imgur.com/a/814FUOH) (includes 6)\n* [The Virgin Ben and Tomi Lahren](https://imgur.com/a/WeFQdes) (includes 5)\n\nIf you have ideas (or images) for other templates, please share below or via modmail!\n\nAs for feedback #4, that\u2019s our plan!  Please report any tankies (or shitlibs, fascists, etc.) you see (likely under [rule 5: Don\u2019t be an asshole](https://www.reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/wiki/rules/#wiki_rule_.235_.2014_don.2019t_be_an_asshole), [rule 7: Don\u2019t be a fascist](https://www.reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/wiki/rules/#wiki_rule_.237_.2014_don.2019t_be_a_fascist), [rule 8: Don\u2019t be a troll](https://www.reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/wiki/rules/#wiki_rule_.238_.2014_don.2019t_be_a_troll), or [rule 10: Low-quality content](https://www.reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/wiki/rules/#wiki_rule_.2310_.2014_no_low-quality_posts.2Freposts)).\n\n## **Merry shitposting!**\n\n***Remember that meme weekend starts in about 12 hours!***\n\n### Edits\n\n- Saw some questions around the specifics of a couple rules, which made me realize I forgot to tell you that there\u2019s more details on each rule [in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/wiki/rules/)! Including a [list of Toileverse players](https://www.reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/wiki/rules/#wiki_rule_.231_.2014_stick_to_the_toiletverse) and examples of [low-quality posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/wiki/rules/#wiki_rule_.2310_.2014_no_low-quality_posts.2Freposts). \n\n\n## The Moral of this Story\n\nOur goal audience went \u201cduh\u201d and moved on. The rest smelled honey and got buzzing.\n\n\u2026 it\u2019s been 67 days and this post is still attracting bees. Even with the edit. Fascinating.",

Do you think people are gonna switch with that? Do you think you\u2019re gonna out-racist Donald Trump???? Why??? And it\u2019s not like you can say it confidently even when you do!!\n\nHonestly Dems / Biden have a fork in the road. A real opportunity for them to put a guy in there people are excited about. They need to emergency swap in Bernie, I really think there\u2019s no one that already is really popular, and would actually excite people. Will Dems actually take this route? Probably not. But if beating Donald Trump is the goal I feel like there are many less risky picks than biden. I think it\u2019s possible he still wins? because the anti-Trump vote is pretty strong, but idk.  \n\nIf he\u2019s the guy, I\u2019m still gonna vote for him, but I feel there\u2019s a lot of people that won\u2019t be able to bring themself to.
