The best what work for me is watching a survival world review. Or something like that, It doesn\u2019t matter. You can even watch anime, and pick the building ideas from there. It\u2019s your choice.",

While I like everyone have at times run afoul of the rules for the various reddits and I know it doesn't feel good, when I come to r/Minecraftbuilds I am really coming to \"see something built\", so the empty screenshots bugged me. Also, I never felt I could give real good advice because I can decide what I would build there, but everybody needs to be themselves.",
