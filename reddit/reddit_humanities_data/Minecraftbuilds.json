It looks great, it\u2019s just the right size for the build on top of it, and the greenery is well done. \n\nThe building itself I\u2019d probably give a 7/10. The white with the orange roofs looks great. The leaves look a little messy, but they aren\u2019t bad. My main detractor is all the random colors splattered throughout.
