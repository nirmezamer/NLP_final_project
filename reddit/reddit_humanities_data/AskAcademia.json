            "Is being an academic worth it? And by worth it, I mean fulfilling? Also, how does maintaining work life balance work? And is the salary enough to provide for a family? Honestly, I'm still deciding what to pursue kind of because I currently have three majors: math, cs, physics. I figured I'd need math regardless for cs or physics. And cs and physics both interest me. Believe me I'm no math genius, far from it. I'm willing to put in the work to better myself in math as a whole so there's that. I am interested in the subjects like I stated prior. I've taken cs courses but have yet to take any physics course. I have roughly 2-3 semesters for my associates in CS. Feel like I'm all over the place since I don't have a clear path of what I'd like to do. Teaching has always been of interest of me, and also a profession/career I respect. What in your opinion makes the career fulfilling? And what are the pros and cons? Currently 27 have no family of my own yet and live alone, working my way through school just a grocery job, not ideal but it keeps the lights on. Currently have a 3.0 GPA so I have if to retake a few courses to improve my gpa to better my chances of getting into a grad school I will do so. Any insight will be greatly appreciated.",
            "They count as publications to the extent that they are published pieces of writing, but unless they were peer-reviewed (which is seldom the case), they do not count as peer-reviewed publications and are not worth that much (for example, for applying for academic positions or for tenure and promotion).",
            "You cite the work that you are actually using. If it is the English translation, then that is the one you cite. Depending on your discipline's conventions, it is possible to note parenthetically the original publication date after the date of the translation.",
            "Some people find academia fulfilling, but fewer and fewer do. Just take a gander at r/professors. I've been fortunate to secure tenure-track positions and tenure. However, even though it had been a dream of mine for much of my adult life to achieve these things, I have many regrets. Higher education is under attack like never before in the U.S., where I am based, and there are no signs it's going to let up. Quite the opposite, in fact. Being a professor is basically being a glorified babysitter and is typically compensated on a similar scale (no offense to babysitters). So I guess my answer is, \"No. It's not worth it.\"",

I will miss that security lol but I think my long term fulfillment and happiness are worth it. \n\nHowever, I know this isn\u2019t the industry I want to stay in (pharmaceuticals) and I want to go back go for graduate school, ideally in environmental engineering as it aligns with my interests in college and research I had done. I\u2019ve been trying to apply for research assistant jobs to get a foot in the door but haven\u2019t been receiving much luck. I also was planning on taking make-up courses in some higher lvl math and physics starting this fall but wanted general advice from anyone on this sub on breaking back into academia after a 3-year gap. \n\nI\u2019m not keen on going back for my masters because it\u2019s so expensive and my job education benefit isn\u2019t good at all (nor is it relevant to my day to day job). \nI had taken a couple grad courses during my undergrad years and was also considering maybe taking one again to prove I\u2019m capable of transitioning back into the coursework but I\u2019m not sure how much weight that would have. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice after taking a long break working in industry?

            "I got a Master\u2019s right after college but failed to complete the PhD, then had an 8 year gap, then started over on a second try for the PhD.

            "That\u2019s great! Congratulations! The programs I want to apply to have an optional GRE, do you think it would still be beneficial for me to take the relevant subject GREs due to my gap? Also, if you don\u2019t mind me asking, how did you get your scholarship?",
            "Take a practice GRE and see how you do. Note that it was the subject (physics), not general that made a difference in my field. \n\nIt was an internal scholarship at a mid-tier research university, with the intent of landing more competitive students than the school would usually get. The admissions committee submitted my name to the grad school dean when I applied, without ever telling me. They then told me that I was in the running for the scholarship when they offered me admissions, and it was confirmed by the time I accepted."

            "I would say both. I really can\u2019t choose one or the other. My PhD and postdoc approached similar questions but from completely different methodologies (to keep it vague, let\u2019s say one is 100% hands on experimental and the other is completely theoretical). I can see pros to both and I use both methods now - ideally having exposure to each strengthens my science under each methodology.

He referred me to two of his PhD students and they interviewed me almost two weeks ago.\n\nThe interview went great, they talked in detail about their projects and asked me about my skills, commitment, etc. Overall the vibe felt like they were on board for having me assist them with their projects because I already knew quite a bit about the topic, and we brought up how this experience would be enriching for the bioichem courses I'm taking. Plus, it's an independent outreach so it's not a competitive internship or anything.\n\nYet after the interview I've never heard back from them. After one week I sent them a follow-up email asking when I could start going to the lab, or if there's anything I can do in preparation for that. Still no response. I'm a bit confused now so I'm hoping to get some insight from the other side of the story. Is this normal or did I do anything wrong?
