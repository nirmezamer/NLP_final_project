Lived great life with good food upto that age while in wild he would have little chance to do that, no fighting to death for mate , no danger of poaching,etc.\n\n\nI find kumki elephant more robust and beautiful looking than malnourished wild elephants in india tbh. Like an elephant named Arjuna lived upto 60+ year and was used by forest guard for many wildlife capture and relocation mission, he also battled with many wild elephants and won everyone of them. Sadly he passed away because according to his mahout and an ill trained forest officials shot tranquiliser on his let instead of the wild elephant he was fighting.\n\n\nRip Elephant Arjuna, you saved lives of many wild elephants and people.",
            "No why are you lying lol. He went blind his one eye because someone injured him because of he wanted revenge on his mahout, why would a mahout damage his pet and money maker lol, like many of these elements also do work in various wildlife missions, and not having a eye would be disadvantage to his mahout and the elephant.",
