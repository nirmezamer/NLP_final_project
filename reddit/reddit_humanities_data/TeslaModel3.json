            "Tried FSD but its acceleration from red lights and stop signs are pretty aggressive, which is kind of annoying when it needs to aggressively slow down when I hit a red light. Is there a way to turn it down? \n\nIm already on the Chill mode setting for both my normal driving and the FSD profile.",
            "I was really looking forward to trying FSD, I planned to try it for a month when v12 came out. I already had EAP and I absolutely love it. It makes my commute a breeze and I hardly ever have any issues with it. Got my free month of FSD and the first day I tried it, it scraped a curb on a right turn. I should have disengaged and taken over, because I could tell it was taking the turn sharper than I would have liked, but I hesitated and payed the price only taking over after it already made impact. I also notice it rides the shoulder line like crazy. My EAP would keep me in the center of the lane at all times and worked flawlessly. My FSD has some weird favoritism to the right side of the road. All cameras are clear and I've cleaned them several times, but it keeps doing it. I also agree about the speeding up and slowing down. It seems to brake hard at red lights. Waiting until the last possible minute OR braking extremely early and then giving it some juice to get to the light instead of slowly rolling up to the stop. I've watched all the videos of people saying how human-like the experience is, but so far in my own use it hasn't felt that way yet.",
            "I first bought it for $6k and then bought it again for another car at $15k. I really hate driving without it. It's nice that it's getting better at city roads, but highway driving is where it is more useful. Do I want it to drive me around town? Maybe, but taking over a bit of the work on the highway is where it is truly valuable to me.\n\nIt makes driving significantly less mentally taxing. You may think driving isn't that taxing, but you never realize how much it takes out of you until you don't have to focus on maintaining the lane or the distance between you and the next car.  It makes roadtrips a breeze.",
            "Just tried it today. It immediately did something incredibly dangerous. On a long stretch of road that Im supposed to go straight, I see it go to the right turn lane, seeing its a right turn only lane (the signs showed up in the dash), went straight and tried to illegally merge left in the intersection while there were cars to my left. I immediately stopped it in its path and turned right like how Im supposed to. It couldve caused an accident.",
            "I'm really trying to like FSD. The problem I'm having is that it won't stay in the right lane on the interstate. It wants to be at least one lane over to the left, but when I'm doing three over the speed limit and so many other cars are doing 10 or 15 over the speed limit, it's just not safe. Plus it makes me feel like a total dickwad. So despite having it available for free right now, I'm finding myself turning FSD off so I can use regular autopilot most of the time. If Tesla just makes it so the car will stay in the slow lane to avoid pissing off faster traffic, it would be far better. I understand why they do this, because they don't want to deal with merging so much. But in real life I deal with merging traffic all the time, and that's better than being stuck in the middle of traffic that's going way faster than me.",
            "For those wondering not a single refresh (highland) model 3 has FSD yet. Still waiting for Tesla to enable it on these new cars.",
            "I am obsessed and will be purchasing a subscription. I had no idea that FSD worked so damn well!",
            "1. Accelerates too rapidly from stop signs/lights. Even in chill setting.\n2. Hugs centerline. Had to disengage multiple times, the car is just too far left. (Insert political joke here).\n3. Autopark works pretty well, with improvements to come.",
            "Ill go first, I havent received it yet to try.",
            "I think this makes sense for I tried it and liked it / didnt like it posts, but FSD damaged my car posts should be left as visible as possible."
