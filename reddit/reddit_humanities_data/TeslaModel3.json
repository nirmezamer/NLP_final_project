            "About two years ago, I tested the Full Self-Driving (FSD) feature on my Model 3 Performance (M3P) for the first time. At that point, it felt more like a novelty; I found it okay but not entirely trustworthy, as it was prone to errors and didn\u2019t seem very safe.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, my experience with FSD version 12 has been a complete turnaround. I've taken it on 8 to 12 drives, and it has performed exceptionally well in my case. Each journey required no intervention from me, except for a minor issue where it slightly missed my driveway upon returning home.\r  \n\r  \nI've been particularly impressed by its ability to handle complex scenarios, such as navigating around cars and trucks with trailers parked along unmarked roads. It also demonstrates advanced decision-making, like slowing down in the left lane to safely move behind a car when needing to make a right turn soon, among other notable maneuvers.\r  \n\r  \nThis progress excites me about the future of autonomous driving. I can envision a time in the next few years when human supervision might not be necessary, hoping that my 8-year-old will never need to learn to drive. The transition towards cars not being driven by humans promises a safer road environment for everyone.",
            "Tried FSD but its acceleration from red lights and stop signs are pretty aggressive, which is kind of annoying when it needs to aggressively slow down when I hit a red light. Is there a way to turn it down? \n\nI\u2019m already on the Chill mode setting for both my normal driving and the FSD profile.",
            "I was really looking forward to trying FSD, I planned to try it for a month when v12 came out. I already had EAP and I absolutely love it. It makes my commute a breeze and I hardly ever have any issues with it. Got my free month of FSD and the first day I tried it, it scraped a curb on a right turn. I should have disengaged and taken over, because I could tell it was taking the turn sharper than I would have liked, but I hesitated and payed the price only taking over after it already made impact. I also notice it rides the shoulder line like crazy. My EAP would keep me in the center of the lane at all times and worked flawlessly. My FSD has some weird favoritism to the right side of the road. All cameras are clear and I've cleaned them several times, but it keeps doing it. I also agree about the speeding up and slowing down. It seems to brake hard at red lights. Waiting until the last possible minute OR braking extremely early and then giving it some juice to get to the light instead of slowly rolling up to the stop. I've watched all the videos of people saying how human-like the experience is, but so far in my own use it hasn't felt that way yet.",
            "Am I the only one who thinks it\u2019s absolutely terrifying? I\u2019ve been using it for just a few days. Each time I\u2019ve used it, it\u2019s done something egregiously terrible.\n\n1. At roundabouts, it drives up to them at excessive speed, slams the brakes, then inches forward awkwardly. Then, it will enter the roundabout in the right lane but end up straddling the two lanes. In some cases, it will switch lanes midway so you exit in the wrong lane entirely.\n\n2. When in the right hand lane, in two different places in town, it signals right and starts moving into a merge lane that\u2019s ending in 100 meters or less.\n\n3. It accelerates with an odd vigour considering it\u2019s in chill mode.\n\n4. Approaching my house, which is on the left, it either signals right and goes into the right hand lane or it will stay in the same lane and blow past my place at full speed.\n\n5. On a few occasions, it has gotten extremely close to curbs.\n\n6. When the lane was ending on one of our bypass roads, it got right to the end and was not signalling or making any moves to the left so I had to take control. Not sure if it would have hit the guard rail or not.\n\n7. When turning left at an intersection with two left turn lanes, it always chooses to switch to the leftmost lane. Once it completes the turn, it ends up straddling the lanes instead of neatly putting itself in the leftmost lane.\n\nNow I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because winter is just ending here and our road lines are faded, or maybe it\u2019s just tuned to the layouts in certain big cities? I just don\u2019t understand how people can like this feature at all.",
            "Good experience so far with FSD on 2020 Model 3. My major gripes with it is all safety related such as being too hesitant at times to make the turn, stopping completely at stopsigns and having to press the accelerator bc it follows speed limits a lil too religiously. \n\nI will say I had 1 major error with FSD and it was when exiting a highway. Red steering wheel popped up telling me to take over and upon looking, the autosteer software rebooted itself due to a error, and the cameras also rebooted, causing FSD to fail. \n\nOverall, I really like the tech and excited to see FSD improve but i'm not spending $12k or $200/m for it... maybe $50/$100 a month for general use.",
            "Been trying it whenever I drive right now, and while it is impressive I would never pay for a feature this incomplete.\n\n1. It is absolutely terrible at left turns. It either refuses to go even when clear, or starts accelerating like it\u2019s going to jump out in front of a car that it definitely can\u2019t safely turn in front of. I just turn it off when making left turns now.\n2. It is terrible at any roundabout that has another car visible. It can handle single lane ones fine if they are empty, but it if any car is visible on the left at all then it just comes to a complete stop. I live next to the roundabout capital of the US, this is a constant problem.\n3. It is just barely more useful than regular Autopilot on the highway. I keep seeing defenders of FSD saying they NEED it for highway driving, but I have yet to see a scenario where it dramatically outperforms its free counterpart.\n\nIt\u2019s really cool. It\u2019s a neat party trick, and my kids think it\u2019s neat when I show them that the car is turning the wheel without mind. But I wouldn\u2019t pay $3k for it, much less $12k.",
            "I first bought it for $6k and then bought it again for another car at $15k. I really hate driving without it. It's nice that it's getting better at city roads, but highway driving is where it is more useful. Do I want it to drive me around town? Maybe, but taking over a bit of the work on the highway is where it is truly valuable to me.\n\nIt makes driving significantly less mentally taxing. You may think driving isn't that taxing, but you never realize how much it takes out of you until you don't have to focus on maintaining the lane or the distance between you and the next car.  It makes roadtrips a breeze.",
            "Gripes: Car accelerates too quickly from a stop, and brakes too hard when coming to a stop. On rural roads with a median area, the car hugs the left yellow line. It doesn't do this on the highway, however.\n\nOther than those couple of minor gripes, I am blown away with how well the car drives with FSD engaged. It took me to my destination 230 miles away with only a couple of interventions, which were mostly due to my lack of trust. It successfully navigated onto the Florida Turnpike, back off the Turnpike 200 miles later and onto another highway, back off the highway and through a construction zone with lanes marked only by cones, then drove the last 5 miles home on city streets before pulling up to the curb in front of my house.\n\nI've subscribed to FSD a couple of times in the past and was mostly terrified of the way it drove. The current FSD is so much better that I am almost more comfortable with it driving, even short distances, than I am with my own driving.",
            "Just tried it today. It immediately did something incredibly dangerous. On a long stretch of road that I\u2019m supposed to go straight, I see it go to the right turn lane, seeing it\u2019s a right turn only lane (the signs showed up in the dash), went straight and tried to illegally merge left in the intersection while there were cars to my left. I immediately stopped it in its path and turned right like how I\u2019m supposed to. It could\u2019ve caused an accident.",
            "I'm really trying to like FSD. The problem I'm having is that it won't stay in the right lane on the interstate. It wants to be at least one lane over to the left, but when I'm doing three over the speed limit and so many other cars are doing 10 or 15 over the speed limit, it's just not safe. Plus it makes me feel like a total dickwad. So despite having it available for free right now, I'm finding myself turning FSD off so I can use regular autopilot most of the time. If Tesla just makes it so the car will stay in the slow lane to avoid pissing off faster traffic, it would be far better. I understand why they do this, because they don't want to deal with merging so much. But in real life I deal with merging traffic all the time, and that's better than being stuck in the middle of traffic that's going way faster than me."
