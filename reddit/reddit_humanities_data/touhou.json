            "Someone must remaster KKHTA into a less gruesome and more action-heavy storyline with bigger scale than before.\n\nThis is the changes I'd like to see in a KKHTA remaster:\n\n- Meiling actually puts up a good fight before getting her throat slit by Koishi\n\n- Lunarian invasion of Gensokyo feels bigger than what we were shown in the original. Instead of flying saucers ripping people apart, they send it battalions of moon rabbits to do the dirty work.\n\n- The \"staring at the moon makes you insane\" thing is tweaked a bit. Yuyuko tortures Youmu similar to what Sanae did to Kogasa. Also, Mokou fights back against the moonies (whilst dealing with the insanity), Team 9-ball survives, while Byakuren and the gang became a third party faction.\n\n- Much of the story will be between different perspectives (most of which will come from the Watatsukis, Yukari, and Koishi)\n\n- Ran and Chen would have C4 strapped to their backs instead of inside their bodies. Rei'sen is just using the two to force Yukari to surrender.\n\n- Flandre and Remilia's part of the story is extended.\n\n- The 3 vs 1 at the Hakurei shrine is altered but ends in the same result. However, instead of the infamous Reisen bisection scene, she gets decapitated instead. Remilia and Kanako puts up a good fight before dying. Marisa would also get an injured Reimu out of the fight against Yorihime.\n\n- Koakuma imprisoned Patchouli (and never assaulted her.)\n\n- With Gensokyo under full Lunarian occupation, Yukari organized a resistance movement to fight back.\n\n- In the flashbacks, the Lunarians didn't show up to Earth just to make them think that the true enemy is Gensokyo. Instead, the Lunar War happens, but Earth lost. Since Earth is under the influence of the moonies, Yukari had no choice but to nuke the entire planet to deny the Lunarians their victory. Also, those giant Buddha statues (called Vijokas), are the pinnacle of Lunarian engineering.\n\n- The final battle to stop the Moonlight Descent Ceremony is divided between several perspectives (ex. Junko, Yuyuko, Okuu, and more...)\n\n- The final battle involved some outside world allies as well, in the form of the Scottish Black Watch (because old gap hag decided to end the world Battletech style) and some of the world's space agencies.\n\n- The ending is bittersweet. Yukari launches the entire world's nuclear arsenal, halting the MDC, at the cost of much of human civilization. Most of the main cast survives, but without a home to return to, they decided to settle in Germany for the time being.\n\nWhat do you think?",
