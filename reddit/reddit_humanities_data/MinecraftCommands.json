        "content": "I know you're here to get quick help with your command problems or to show off your cool work. Please read these few lines to get to know how to use this subreddit optimally:\n\n# Asking for help\n\n1. **FAQ?** Before you post, please check out the [common questions](https://minecraftcommands.github.io/wiki/questions) (including answers) that we have as a subreddit. These consist of the most common problems, and maybe your problem is already covered there in detail?\n2. **Titles:** Please put a summary/short version of your problem into the title of your post, don't just put \"I need help\" or \"help me plz\". Instead put for example \"how do I summon a zombie\" or \"unable to summon entity error\" and then provide more context on the post itself. This subreddit often shows up on google when people search for command related questions and we should really help them find the questions you might already have asked. Also, we likely know that you need help anyways, no need to put it in the title.\n3. **Flairs:** We have a wide array of flairs that you should attach to your post to make sure people know what the purpose of your thread is. It is *especially important* if you're asking for help, to flair your post with the appropriate minecraft version (for those who don't know: OG Minecraft is `Java` Version, everything else that has commands (Xbox, PE, PS4, Switch, Win10, etc) is `Bedrock`).\n4. **Version:** Whether you're helping or asking for help, *please pay attention to the stated version/state the version you're in!* You can do that through the previously mentioned Flairs, but also in addition can put it into the description of your post.\n5. **Search/Scroll down:** I know that reddit search is not the best one out there, but maybe someone else had a similar problem to yours in recent history. Try going to the new tab and scrolling down a bit or using the reddit search function to see if there might already be an answer to a question you have. *We're not going to close your thread for asking the same question someone else asked a year ago, we're not StackOverflow. But please at least take 30 seconds to look for it first.*\n6. **Upvote**: If you find an answer to a post helpful, please upvote it. This is less as a \"reward\" for the answering person but more as a way to automatically move the best answer to the top, for others that might have the same problem. Don't downvote an answer just because their attempts didn't work for you unless it's completely wrong or off topic / doesn't add anything to the conversation.\n\n# Creations\n\nPosting about your own creations is very much encouraged, but please remember the [10:1 guidelines of reddit](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).\n\n# Discord\n\nWe have a big Discord Server for our community with lots of channels, ranging from dedicated help chats over general command related chats to non-command related chats. So if you want to join an active community of command and mapmaking enthusiasts and/or want to get quick help where communication is less slow *(Sometimes the devs stop by as well ;))*, click on the link and join our community discord:  \n[https://discord.gg/9wNcfsH](https://discord.gg/9wNcfsH)  \nMake sure you read the #welcome channel for the rule of the discord.",

The common way I've seen it done is having whatever song you want to play broken up into a bunch of smaller and shorter sound files, and playing them one after the other, while updating the location. It's not a perfect solution for the obvious reasons of jank and lag, but it's the best one we have right now, as far as I'm aware.",

But you can use [Open Note Block Studio](https://opennbs.org/) to create music from note block sounds, and it also allows you to convert .midi files. And this program can create a datapack with MIDI music for you, and all you have to do is edit the datapack a little so that all players nearby can hear the music.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S.

So what I\u2019m trying to do is when a player joins my realm, they can press a button and it\u2019ll give them a shulker box full of various items. My intention is to structure load said gift box near said button. But only 1gift box per player.\n\n my first question is why can\u2019t my structure block see the shulker box I intend to copy. When I narrow it down, the box is invisible.\n\nMy second question will come into play when I fix the first. So I know I want to add a tag to a player when they first hit the button. Then the box generates. Then it takes away the first tag and adds another tag that basically says their box has already been received. But I am too new to this to figure out what the order is and how to use chain command blocks or impulse blocks. \n\nThank you guys for your help! \n\n ",

            "1.) just drop the box, use the following guide:\n\n1.    \u2060Give yourself a strcuture block using /give @s structure_block\n2.    \u2060Place down the structure block\n3.    \u2060Use it and set the size to: x1, y1, z1. Set the offset to: x0, y1, z0. This will set the size of the bounding box to 1 block that is above the structure block\n4.    Turn both \u201cInclude Entities\u201d and \u201cRemove Blocks\u201d to on.\n5.    \u2060Do whatever you need to do to the item\n6.    \u2060Throw the item into the bounding box.\n7.    \u2060Wait 3 or so seconds for faster pickup\n8.    \u2060Give the structure a name, then press save\n9.    \u2060You can load the item at the player by doing:\n\n/execute at <player> run structure load <name> ~~.125~\n\n2.) you don\u2019t need 2 tags, just tag them after loading the box only if they don\u2019t have a tag, ex:\n\n```\nIUNE0:\nexecute as @p unless entity @s[tag=hasKit] at @s run structure load <name> ~~.125~\n\nCUAA0:\ntag @p add hasKit",

            "So the reason I\u2019m doing multiple tags, is due to the command blocks being in a separate permanent ticking area, and to make sure if other people are on the player can still get their box. Would this effect any of the command blocks you have already provided?",
            "I think you are misunderstanding how tickingareas and tags work. I suggest you go read about them on the wiki\n\nBut for a short explanation: tickingareas are just loading specific areas as if they were within simulation distance of a player. Tags are just something we assign to a player, think of it as a name tag that you can detect and put multiple of.",

The player would only get the box if they press a button in a certain locationI thank you so much for helping me understand.
