I feel like  when I have the puck I don\u2019t have enough speed to blow past the defenders and always end up just trying to shoot it through the defenders or end up getting angled off by them along the boards and coughing up the puck. Any tips would get greatly appreciated! ",

            "Keep moving. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to be fast to be quick and if you\u2019re stopped you\u2019re kinda done. You\u2019ll see this at all levels. It\u2019s very hard to go from stopped to moving but if you keep getting into the right areas looking for passes anticipating the plays you\u2019ll be better off.\n\nReading the play will help you a lot too. Know what you want to do with the puck before it gets to you or you receive a pass.\n\nIts wild bc if you look at some of the better players in beer leagues they\u2019re typically not overly quick, good skaters sure, but they have a plan with the puck, are reading the play and are able to get a jump on things",
            "Get deep enough to be able to throw it back to the point and head for the net",
            "As soon as you enter the zone with the puck you can stop, hold it for a second, then hit a teammate with a pass across the ice or deeper in the zone",
            "Don\u2019t be the guy entering the zone. Take the pass along the boards and pass to your centre or other winger when they are in full stride.",
            "If you\u2019re last into the zone and on the rush, hang back as the trailer. You can find a soft area and be another option the puck carrier has or be in better situation if there\u2019s a turnover.",
            "First you should drill to get faster. Practice starts and stops with explosiveness at a stick and puck or open skate. In the gym do lunges, squats, box jumps, etc. Airplanes and monster walks with a band are really great for activating your core and hips, and will translate to explosiveness almost immediately. Build those muscles with compound exercises. In the meantime, you can stop up top when you cross and then pass. Talk to your center or wingers so they know to keep moving for the pass. Bonus is they\u2019ll draw coverage when trucking across the blue line and that will open a little more space for you.",
            "Pick up speed in the dzone or neutral zone before getting the puck. Youll probably have to start your breakout closer to your dman, making his first pass easier. A good dman on the opposing team will keep a great gap tho, watchout for that.",
            "Make a triangle with the other forwards. If someone is already at the net, be open for the pass. If no one is at the net, crash the net and try to block the goalies view of the action\u2026your goal will be to get a rebound or a tip in.  \n\nIf you can\u2019t carry the puck well, pass to someone who can. Make sure you\u2019re staying high on defense and able to get the puck out of the defensive zone. \n\nPositioning is critical if your speed isn\u2019t as fast as the others on the ice.  I am a slow winger and I\u2019m almost always the guy in front of the net.  When we first enter the zone, I\u2019m last to enter the zone so I make sure I\u2019m somewhere in the middle and open\u2026as the play continues, I usually put myself in front of the net while the faster forwards chase the play in the corners. Im also a larger player (mostly play womens) and people have a hard time pushing me out of the center so I love to screen the goalie and get trash goals.",
            "Pass the puck into an open space and create support in the slot.\n\nDon\u2019t carry the puck",
            "Pucks in deep. If the defense pinches you off along the boards or closes the gap in open ice, don't just cough it up to them. Look for an open teammate or dump the puck to the opposite corner so your linemates can hopefully retrieve it."

            "You\u2019re leaning/falling back away from the shot, lean into it instead. See how you\u2019re largely off balance and kinda flailing once the puck leaves your stick? That\u2019s making your shot weaker.",
            "In addition to the comment about you falling backwards you need to get your top hand out further at the beginning of your shot and then snap it back to add speed and power.\n\nCoach Jermey can explain it better. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/-mYr8T5-uR8?si=3qsFrAZ3upc6gzZY",
            "First thing I saw was how close to your body your top hand is.  You want it to go out as you're pressing down and then crank back in a lever-like action. \n\nAlso, I think your stick may be too flexy if you can get that kinda flex without much force.",
            "Besides what everyone else is saying\u2026your foot needs pointed at your target. Also you\u2019ve got a whole body & you\u2019re using mostly just your arms. Put that back, hips, thighs & shoulders into it!",
            "Said before, but your momentum isn't going fully forward during the weight transition. You can probably give your left hand more room away from your body to be able to pull back more as well imo.",
            "I\u2019m no pro by any means but you could benefit from loading more weight on your stick before release.  This will help \u201ctrap\u201d the puck a bit under your blade on the skating surface and keep it from fluttering on release, giving you more power and control on where it ends up.",
            "Im just a 49 year old beer league player but to me it looks like your doing to much with your bottom hand.",
            "You\u2019re trying to follow through to force something that isn\u2019t happening. You have a higher follow through than a slap shot. As others have said you\u2019re leaning into the puck not leaning towards the goal. \n\nYou can also see based off where you have the puck on the stick you\u2019re trying lift it. To hit top shelf you don\u2019t try to lift it. You need to have the puck closer to the heel. So when you shoot the puck uses the curve of the stick to roll up and going the air.\n\nNot that you can\u2019t put it in the air from the toe, but you need to learn the basics of it ripping up heel to toe first so it uses the natural blade dynamics.",
            "Lots of good advice here on positioning, loading, balance, etc., but it also looks like you\u2019re just shooting it directly off the toe. There are two types of shots you\u2019re trying to do, a wrist shot and a snap shot. You will never be able to effectively use a snap shot if you can\u2019t take a proper wrist shot. It is the foundational shot in hockey. Shooting is every bit art as it is science. As you progress and get better, you can figure out how to shoot quick snappers from the toe because you\u2019ll know what the \u201cright way\u201d to load your stick feels like. For now, you have to learn the basic mechanics of a wrist shot. Start at the 20 second mark of the video and let the great Doc Emrick explain: https://youtu.be/D5u5qGQ2JwI?si=-JEguQCeRXvwetTO",
