            "MAP EXPANSION. I want an airport so badly",
            "1. I liked it and look forward to more\n\n2. Kinda in between. I like the wrap but the body kit did not match Melissa's body kit from Underground\n\n3. Maybe some more of the wide body kits ported for other car such as the RX7, MX5 and other cars that appear in both games. It would be cool to see the Mantis kit make a return on the RX7 and MX5\n\n4. The blacklist with accurate body kits/car (if possible due to licensing)",

            "1 - Nice touch, Melissa's Eclipse is a tasteful addition. I was low-key hoping the \"player's\" R34 would get added too (the one from NFSU2).\n\n2 - More leaning towards \"hit\". \n\n3 - Player's R34 from NFSU2 (blue with yellow stripes), Samantha's Civic and the starter Integra \"Vortex\"\n\n4 - Don't really know. Maybe a \"boss\" police unit turning out to be Cross.",
            "#More singleplayer content",
            "I like the VOL 7 update but there are two issues with legends and drifting. \n\nLet's start with Legends, the cars are good and the tracks on the playlists are interesting, but at least tune up the cars a bit for the playlists with rented cars. \nI really like the idea that all players have the same cars, so driving skills will be very important. But it's hard to convey how slow and unpleasant these cars are to drive, they can\u2019t barely pull the last gear. Especially frustrating in playlists with Nissans Eddie and Rachel where we should have top cars like in Underground, but instead they are slow and badly turned. \nSo I hope in the future, cars for themed playlists will have minimal tuning so that the cars at least drive and handle.\n\nAnd a little bit about drifting, I'm obviously not the first to say about the animation of the front wheels, and the set of points. \nTo have the wheels turned in the direction of the turn, it doesn't matter how realistic or not it is, the main thing is that it looks nice in gameplay\nAnd I really would like to see a bonus for speed as in Carbon, so that those who drift fast have the opportunity to compete with those who drift at low speed from side to side.\n\nThanks for the update, hopefully the next VOL 8 will be just as interesting.",
            "1 - \ud83d\udfe2 What\u2019d you think of the NFS Legends content in Vol. 7? \n\nIt was alright. \n\nHonestly, it still hurts that 3 Legends are locked behind a DLC paywall, and 1 behind an EA subscription. I appreciate this was likely an EA decision, but these could've been free content additions.\n\n2 - \ud83d\udfe2 Was it \"hit\" or \"miss\"?\n\nDifficult to say. It was a good effort, but I don't think the theme hit hard enough.\n\n3 - \ud83d\udfe2 Is there any other NFS Legends content from NFS Underground 1 or 2 that you were hoping or expecting to see?\n\nThe Acura RSX, the Honda Civic Integra, and something from the Peugeot/Chrysler line-up (206, Neon, etc). \n\nIt'd have been cooler to see Underground 1 and 2-themed body kit parts, wraps, decals and so on. The addition of wheels was a nice touch, but you could've gone further with roof scoops (!), spoilers, hoods, Customs kits...\n\n4 - \ud83d\udfe2 What future NFS Legends content would you love to see most?\n\nBlacklist cars from Most Wanted, maybe Legend cars from the ProStreet series, and the Pagani Zonda from Hot Pursuit.\n\nI'd like to reiterate my request for single-player content in the future, also. An economy rebalance post-Story (desperately needed!), and the implementation of online additions into offline free roam would be HUGE.\n\nFinally, the support you're giving this game is very much appreciated. Thank you fir all your hard work thus far.",
            "* Big hit! Looking forward to the next update.  \n* I've found that lane switching in drag races is still a little buggy. Hoping it will be fixed some time.  \n* Any chance of bringing back some oldies from the NFSU days? (Golf MK4, Civic Si)",
            "1. I think it was good, I think it's great to see the NFS UG2 Cars to be playable, but I think this could be improved.\n\nSome people have a small issue with the fact there is only 1 car to choose from this playlist, but they suggest using their own in it.\n\nAs a compromise, if you're going to do a themed playlist that have some specific cars in them, why not give them 4 preset cars to choose from instead of 1 that fit the theme.\n\nFor example, if you have an UG2 themed playlist instead of just having Rachel's 350Z, why not also have a preset RSX, Honda Civic, and Foxbody Mustang to include as well with their own UG2 styled livery?\n\n2. I wouldn't say that it's a miss, but it's a little bit more of a hit that be improved.\n\n3. I was hoping for a small return of some UG2 styled liverys/brands that could've been added either in the speedpass or as challenges.\n\n4. For now, I don't have much of idea so I'll let you guys handle that."
