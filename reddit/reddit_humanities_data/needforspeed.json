            "Nice transparent communication regarding the PVP Door issues. As a dev myself, I know the frustration about not to be able to reproduce an issue. And then after finally cracking it, you still can't solve it due to external dependencies.\nThey will for sure fix this. Let them cook.",
            "I wonder and hope if that Drift Pro chain fix is what we were seeing about some cars being able to amass a huge single drift combo, while others would stop and start again after switching angles.",
            "Thank the heavens above for solo playlists now I might actually get into the multiplayer again",

            "Solo playlist?! Holy shit, yes! I didn\u2019t even think that this could be realized.",
            "Solo Playlist!? EPIC!\n\nThe only thing left for me to fully enjoy the multiplayer is ability to launch playlists with both AI and Players",
            "Solo Playlists is one of the biggest W\u2019s this game has pulled so far",

            "* Big hit! Looking forward to the next update.  \n* I've found that lane switching in drag races is still a little buggy. Hoping it will be fixed some time.  \n* Any chance of bringing back some oldies from the NFSU days? (Golf MK4, Civic Si)",
            "Give us singleplayer content, please",
            "Please, bigger garage if possible. Loved the update though! League races should have more variety and challenge to them though.",

            "We really need a single player expansion or at least get it up to date with the multiplayer",
            "I like everything so far, but I was hoping for some time attacks like in NFSU1",
            "Allow us to race the cars we built and tuned on all the new playlists.\n\nB, A, and A+ need more races available for players who want to race their own cars. We've been racing on the same handful for over a year, so it'll be a nice way to spice it up.",
            "Nice job with Melissa's Eclipse, but it somewhat fell short when you look back to the original NFSU model. The widebody kit is what gives her car presence. Her car without the widebody is nice but nothing special. Nice addition, nonetheless, though. More widebody kits is my feedback, i say this as a fan of your \"legendary customs\" idea. The wild kits are what make NFS, in the customisation department \n\nTl;dr, more widebody kits for more cars, please like 00s era gave us",
            "Great gud just dont lock the playlist to stock cars only give us a way to use our own cars cuz those are some amazing tracks \nOr or at least give the cars elite suspension and tires so they are not cringe to drive"
