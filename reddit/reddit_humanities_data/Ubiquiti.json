            "Never know if I should post in this topic, in the main forum, on in UNIFI.... but my issue is that with my Dream Machine, if we ever have a power outage, I cannot get internet back until I do a factory reset on the UDM.  I have no custom settings on the UDM at all, except for my WIFI name/password.  There are SO MANY topics about this across the interwebs, but I'm yet to find a solution that works for me (though most don't have solutions anyway).  Any ideas, or can I provide any more info to help troubleshoot?\n\nEDIT:  I'm also not an expert on this, so simple explanations are appreciated! <3",
            "WTF is going on with the Android Unifi app?\n\nFor the last several weeks, I've been unable to remotely access my Unifi Dream Router through the phone app.  It gives up and says it can't connect.\n\nMeanwhile, I have zero problems logging into the Unifi website and accessing remote management that way.\n\nBoth of these things on the same Android phone, using either away-from-home WiFi, or mobile data, with or without the use of a VPN.\n\nIf I'm at home (directly connected), the app works fine.\n\nHaven't changed a thing about my phone or UDR config recently.",
            "Well up until earlier this week I've had several months of UDR stability. Went on holidays on Sunday, and the UDR became unresponsive about 24 hours later without any warning. Confirmed with a neighbour there wasn't any power or broadband outage (I have UPS anyway), and they reported a red status light on one of my wireless unifi cams (signifying loss of network) . So I suspect the UDR locked up and of course took Unifi protect with it. So I'm away for another week with no working cams and no access to the Plex server. Nice job, dream router! Incredibly unimpressed. At least the motion sensor lights and alarm system still work because they're home assistant / zigbee based.",

            "I have the [Unifi Dream Router UDR (40W)](https://store.ui.com/us/en/pro/category/cloud-gateways-wifi-integrated/products/udr) and about every 2-3 weeks it freezes up and the only way to bring it back online is with a power cycle.  I've opened tickets in the past and they always send me some rooted version of the firmware but it never resolves the issue.  Anyone else been experiencing this issue recently?",
            "Here's the other problem I've been having with my UDR:\n\nhttps://community.ui.com/questions/Dream-Router-drops-internet-connection-under-load/f5e7fd0d-9f43-457e-b54f-5511ee22daee\n\nMy case is similar, in that the UDR will randomly drop connection to my ISP, requiring a restart.  Sometimes, twice a day.  I'll go as most 3-4 days before it drops the connection again.  The drop-outs do not seem to correlate to any particular activity pattern on my home network.   They happen equally often in the wee hours when everyone's asleep, or in the middle of the day or evening.\n\nThe UDR likes to blame my ISP/modem, but the ISP modem (Zyxel C3000Z) has been fine.  Haven't had to restart it once.  Solid green lights (indicating a healthy DSL link) at all times.\n\nI'd post about this on the ui.com forums, but I can't access them from my current location.  Thought I'd see if any other UDR users on Reddit are having this problem.  It started happening around 2 months ago.\n\nThe UDR's logs are no help.  All they say is that \"high latency\" or \"packet loss\" or both, are detected, shortly before the UDR decides it can no longer talk to my ISP.\n\nFWIW, I have the DSL modem in Transparent Bridge mode, with the UDR performing PPPoE sign-in.  I can get UDR software version if it matters, but it's whatever the latest version is as of this posting.\n\nFurther data point: My DSL service is ~140 MBit down/20 MBit up.  Even if I had maximum traffic going in both directions at all times - which I generally don't even approach - this should be well within the ability of the UDR to handle.\n\nDo I have a defective UDR?"
