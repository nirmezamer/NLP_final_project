            "I have been dealing with support for a few months about my new UXG-max having lag and speed issues (causing VPN issues and regular webtraffic issue). Support has been zeroing in on the VPN issues assuming that the VPN was being blocked in someway. They kept asking me to run TCP IP package captures (WAN AND LAN) and then stating that they cannot see any of my connection happening that I was saying were not working inside the VPN....... I had to tell them that they would never be able to see those connections inside the VPN tunnel because that is the purpose of a VPN. (Congratulations Ubiquiti Support! You have successfully discovered that VPNs block traffic from outside monitoring!)",

I am trying to connect two ends of house and I cant run wires and I need wired connections on both ends for different devices.  If I understand correctly two U6 Walls can be connected via wireless backplane, but can the U7?\n\nSince the U7 Pro Wall has just one ethernet connector, can I do following :   \nFIBREMODEM+POE->rj45->U7PROWALL <wireless backplane mesh> U7PROWALL->rj45->POE-SWITCH\n\nFinally I understand I dont necessarily need a Unifi contoller/gateway if I setup these devices with mobile app, would I lose anything critical not having one if I only (currently) plan to have these two Ubiquiti devices?",

            "I recently dumped Meraki when my latest rounds of subscriptions came up for renewal. It cost me less to move to a whole new generation of equipment on Ubiquiti than it was going to cost me to renew licenses on old Meraki gear. I'm glad that I made the switch."

        "content": "I switched over from a eufy camera system to UniFi Protect about two months ago, and have been enjoying the camera system immensely.  We finally gained the ability to customize the welcome screen on the doorbell, and I did so with a cartoon character that my kids are into.  I did it for their enjoyment, but have been enjoying watching the reactions of mail carriers who see it, too.\n\nToday the house was visited by someone in professional attire who *really* found it amusing.  Just for fun, I wanted to determine who this person was... and I couldn't.  I have my recording quality set to its maximum (and allow the system to choose between smoother motion or clearer stills - although this setting seems to have changed to represent smoother motion or better low-light performance) and I could not read their ID badge, nor the lettering on their shirt.  The HD resolution just couldn't cut it.  I have a second camera - a G5 Pro (4K resolution) - that watches the door's entryway, and through *that* camera's feed I was able to make out the lettering on their shirt.  The ID badge was just inaccessible to that camera, which was mounted farther away.\n\nUniFi really needs to update their doorbell cameras.  Make the regular doorbell 2K if they must, and then give us a Pro with 4K resolution and the AI features for facial recognition.  It's not that I care to see the pores on people's faces, but I want to read ID badges and even the labels on packages that are dropped off.\n\nWhile I'm at it, I know this issue has been posted before, but I'll repeat it: the package detection needs some work.  A package may be dropped off at noon and I'll receive practically one package notification per hour before I can get home to pick it up, even though there's no radical changes in lighting or shadows, nor is there any activity around the package.  This is the one thing I feel eufy did better than UniFi, as well: aside from only reporting that a package was delivered *once*, the eufy system also told me when the package was picked up (removed from the field of view), which was a nice bit of added security reassurance.  It would be nice if we could have that, too.  (Credit where it is due, though: occasionally the eufy doorbell would tell me that a pair of shoes I keep outside was a package; so far the UniFi doorbell has not given me an erroneous package detection.)\n\nNearly all of my UniFi cameras feel pretty perfect as they are, and I don't foresee replacing them until they fail and stop working.  The Doorbell is the one exception - this is one I'll be upgrading before it stops functioning.",
