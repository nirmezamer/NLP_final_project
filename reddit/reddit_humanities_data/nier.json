            "I just want another Yoko Taro experience with even better gameplay and QoL than Automata. Ill be extremely happy if its a NieR continuation but also I'd be pretty chill with a new IP as long as it has the same ability to make me question my own existence and tear me to shreds by the end.",
            "That made it the second most sold JRPG of the last generation,  just behind FFXV. Impressive.",
            "Funny coincidence i just bought Automata and Replicant remaster again on PC. I beat them on ps4 but it stopped working a while back, so i got em again",
            "Golden game gets what it deserves!",
            "The only game I've bought twice.",
            "But the picture says 800",
            "I'm surprised it's only 8 million. P5 is already at 10 million, though you could argue it's due to rereleases. But Nier Automata had had rereleases too I believe.\n\nI remember them going at it for GoTY and Iove both games.",
            "They really should remake Drakengard at this point \ud83d\ude02",
            "Wonder if the anime part 2 will be able to get more game sales.",
            "Maybe it\u2019s copium, but with everything that\u2019s happened around Nier and Yoko taro in the past couple of years since Automata released I think it wouldn\u2019t be crazy to expect square to invest a bit more heavily into Nier or stuff that Yoko taro wants to make. We got a remaster, a switch port, patch for pc, a mobile game, an anime and more. Yoko even got to collab with the FF team to make an actual raid. \n\nDude is well known in the industry now as well as the NieR IP. It would be a huge fumble for square to not continue the franchise in some way. I don\u2019t expect them to give him and his team FF level budget, but I would expect more than what they got for Automata given the success over the years. I just want Yoko to stop making mobile games lol."

            "I'm confused. They still don't have an exact date? The Japanese release is July 5, if I remember correctly... I can only assume the dub will be delayed as usual, but still it's kinda interesting that they're still being ambiguous with the release date. xD",

Kaine is my favorite character in Replicant and not only finding her home in automata, but knowing Emil made sure that it looks the same as the day he met Kaine is a refreshing breath of hope in the bleak game. It even has the picture Kaine drew of her grandmother! ",
