            "I just want another Yoko Taro experience with even better gameplay and QoL than Automata. Ill be extremely happy if its a NieR continuation but also I'd be pretty chill with a new IP as long as it has the same ability to make me question my own existence and tear me to shreds by the end.",

            "Proper sequel please.\n\n\nThe project that Yoko is revealing this year better not be a mobile game.",
