        "content": "I was trying to make a Harbinger of Star build which never run out of mana. I tried a lot of things and find that's impossible. \n\nThen I got an idea. If I transform into something else as a primalist then I don't need to worry about mana anymore. \n\nBut how to sustain rage? Ok we have a lot of passives and skill nodes provide rage on hit/cri, but there is a fundamental problem that the more hits/crits you do the more meteor you trigger and the more rage you spend.\n\nThen I find that the spriggan form has it's special method to generate rage by summoning vines. Actually there is a build guide on lastepochtools which utilize Harbinger of Star in spriggan form. Now the problem is that the best transform skill for casting meteor is werebear form because it can convert strength to spell damage, but you can only summon vines in spriggan form...wait, there is an unique boot called Eterra's Path can summon vines for you while moving, and it also works while rampaging in werebear form.\n\nNow with the rage sustain problem solved, the build works but it's still quite weak because werebear is lack of fast attack skills to trigger meteor. Actually the best skill for primalist to trigger meteor is tornado but only swarmblade can use tornado...Oh wait there is a pair of unique gloves called Rule of Simoon which can cast tornado on hit.\n\n[https://www.lastepochtools.com/planner/oXlN0dbo](https://www.lastepochtools.com/planner/oXlN0dbo) \n\nNow here is the final build. I've tested it in a modified offline save and it can rampage through 1000 corruption monolith at ease(with optimized gears of cause), summoning tornado and meteor everywhere.\n\nI've submitted a build guide on lastepochtools. It's not approved yet but I can't wait for sharing.",

            "I did a druid harbinger combo as well but I didn't care about mana at all as I was just getting enough CDR and transforming to human<->bear repeatedly. You refill mana on transform to bear (which happened every 8s or so).",
            "Cleaver solution+low life is a really easy path for primalist to become ultra tanky.  You get a lot of damage reduction and defenses to the point that the main issue is usually damage for these builds.  Strength is a miracle stat giving you armor, ward retention, and damage which scale extremely well with the defensive layers afforded to primalist.  That's why in the pre 1.0 patch, EQ beastmaster was regarded so highly, because it was ultra tanky, pretty fast, and most importantly, wasn't atrocious to play with good damage.  That being said, it looks like red ring+harbinger damage reduction is doing a lot of heavy lifting here since they're using the more traditional 2 exsang mod build rather than having last steps+gloves and should be around 5K stable ward which is a little under what I would want to push higher corruption.  \n\nAs for why they're using maelstrom+warcry instead of furyleap, it's because part of this idea has been explored for autobomber druid builds.  You definitely want maelstrom stacks if you can get them because storm bolts help you proc meteors and gain some rage on top of the other buffs maelstrom gives and warcry is a free way to get maelstrom stacks while also giving you a lot of extra survivability and vacuums so the meteors hit more things.  As a result, you end up without a slot for fury leap.  Also if you maul, you stop rampaging and have to wait for the animation, but for this kind of build, you want to rampage as much as possible.\n\nFWIW in the pre 1.0 patch I did mess around with a version of this build in ~200-250 corruption and usually my problems began when I got bounced out of werebear form or wasn't proccing meteor/critting enough which both should be solvable with better gear, so I could see this build being playable with BIS gear in higher corruption.",
            "Haha. This comment reminded me of poe vids that are like, \"dont worry, you dont need a HH or mage blood. I just found them while lvling so I used them\".",
            "I've tried maul. The problem for maul is that you have to spec in Fury Leap or Entangling Roots to summon vines. This build requires spec-ing at least 3 skills, Werebear form, Spriggan form and Tornado. So if you spec in Fury Leap or Entangling Roots, there will be only one skill slot left available, which means you give up the roar - maelstrom - storm bolt mechanism because that requires spec-ing 2 more skills, thus you lose a significant proportion of your DPS that you have no way to make up.\n\nWhy this build can survive 1000 corruption? Because you don't need to stop moving for more than 1 second. And the ward is not poor at all. With strength converted to intelligence, you have about 400% ward retention. Last Steps of the Living provides 11%-15% missing health gained as ward/s, you can use a tier 5-6 experimental affix on gloves to make up the loss from not using Last Steps of the Living. The ward of my test character is 5k+.\n\nI can make a video but I don't have a youtube account.",
            "LL ward bear builds largely still depend on higher than usual max health for LL builds plus aspect of the boar for their survivability.\n\nThis build has neither plus isn't even running the full 3 piece missing health gained as ward setup while dual wielding, it very much is not gonna have great EHP.",
            "Exactly what i was thinking\n\nAnd for damage i doubt meteor is enough for bossing at 1000corruption easily like OP says. I doubt it is achievable in a decent timing or maybe tornado  make it proc a lot more than i think (more than 10 time per second on mono target???)\n\nBecause meteor damage is good enough for echoes but definitely not high, you don't have any more multiplier of meteor tree and strength stacking is good but can't make up for it.\n\nI mean this build with all his very expensive stuff should works on 400c but not very much higher, not for boss.",
            "Decided to run the numbers on it with [gear a little optimised for survivability](https://www.lastepochtools.com/planner/AKxMMrvQ)\n\nActually turns out... okay on the ehp front. OP's setup is missing a lot of potential HP and it is intended to be basically a constantly moving ranged setup to the hit EHP isn't as important for mapping. Still pretty squishy to one shots tho."
