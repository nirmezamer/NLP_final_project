            "theres so much good stuff in here, the nemesis mechanic looks amazing, and the egg idea is really cool too",
            "Insanely common EHG W's all over this patch, im jacked to the fucking tits",
            "The boss ward system is a genius way to not punish players that are new to the genre or play super fun but sub optimal builds, compared to blasting content with overpowered builds. And they addressed the feelsbad aspects of a high dps character still feeling powerful but not oneshotting the boss so you actually interact with the mechanics at least. \n\nWill have to see how it plays out but on paper that sounds amazing.",
            "everything here looks really great! super excited.\n\none question i have: if we defeat a nemesis, and its rewards include an egg, are we able to portal out of the monolith, grab the unique we want to replace it with from our stash, and portal back in to use it without issue? i think it would feel really bad if that didn't work, like if the interface locked you there until you picked an option or something.",
            "this patch looks absolutely awesome, great job devs keep it up.",
            "Lots of this stuff looks super cool so far! Happy with the changes added to increase the monolith speed too. \n\nStill unsure what class/mastery I want to play, looking forward to some tuning notes. I didnt do any pre-1.0 play but I think I levelled like 10 different masteries and got them over 200 corruption to see how I liked the play style",
            "Looks great, though I'll probably still wait until around 1.3 or 1.4 to get back into it.\n\nMostly looking forward to monolith expansion which is 1.3+",
            "In a single cycle, EHG has shown a better understanding of how to improve its game and excite its players than Blizzard with D4 in 4 seasons. You can see the influence EHG takes from being players and fans of ARPGs and how they are trying to evolve the genre in the design of its systems. So cool!!",
            "Having a more deterministic way to farm LP Uniques is awesome. Great addition.",
            "Pretty significant content here. If we get three of these mega patches a year on top of an already-strong start this game will be tremendous in no time."

            "Very exciting. I hope for some cool balance changes.",
            "Looks great, I'll dip my toes back in. Biggest gripes that had me drop the game were performance on steam deck, QoL issues with the controller, and imbalance/nodes not working.",
            "This game was so fun but incredibly janky even at launch.  \nI hope its a lot better in this next cycle. Would love to come back!",

            "The best part of coming back to LE from D4.... Having an actual ingame trade system.",

            "NGL looks very hype, way more than I expected",
            "Haven't been following but is the main story going to continue? I recall the story just ending abruptly at launch."

It could as well have been a new base with melee dmg and void dmg as implicits. \n\nJust think of the bleed as a bonus, there are ways to deal bonus dmg to bleeding enemies so it might even be useful.",

        "content": "In warlock tree there are multiple nodes that give +spell damage for curses.\n\nFor some curses there is detailed description in tooltip on how they scale with flat damage (like torment).\n\nHowever, I found that some curses don't have details on scaling in tooltip.\n\nOne example is anguish, which even in the skill database I didn't find any specifics:\n\n[https://www.lastepochtools.com/ailments/anguish](https://www.lastepochtools.com/ailments/anguish)\n\nCan I assume that it scales with 100% damage effectiveness?\n\nFor example, if I have +65 flat spell damage from item, and +30 from passive tree, and base is 40, then it becomes 135 flat baseline damage?\n\nRegardless, I think it might be a good idea to add some info on scaling or base damage in the tooltip of passive tree. As currently it looks like it's the only source of anguish (with two specific nodes).",

            "Default added damage effectiveness is `base_damage * 5%`.  So I would assume anguish has 200% damage effectiveness, but would highly recommend testing before relying on that to see if it scales with added damage at all.",
            "For torment you have ingame information on damage scaling inside Cthonic Fissures tree.\n\nI press alt on some of the nodes that modify torment and I can see the info in the tooltip.\n\nBut not all the curses have this kind of info.",
            "Agree that it really needs to be in the tooltips and/or skill DB.\n\nUnfortunately, while the Maxroll Warlock preview had the added damage effectiveness for some of the curses, they don't list an added damage effectiveness for Anguish. That's the only source I know of for the added damage coefficient for Torment, which is not in the LastEpochTools DB.    I don't know whether Anguish and Penance don't have coefficients listed because EHG didn't tell Maxroll the numbers, or because they don't have coefficients at all.\n\nI could have sworn the original warlock preview news story had coefficients for all the curses, but they seem to have taken that page down.\n\nThe question was posted 4 months ago and got no answers: [https://www.reddit.com/r/LastEpoch/comments/1bbvyca/does\\_anguish\\_have\\_added\\_damage\\_effectiveness\\_if/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LastEpoch/comments/1bbvyca/does_anguish_have_added_damage_effectiveness_if/)\n\nHopefully one of the 1.1 QoL changes is better tooltips.",
            "Thanks for the reply, this one is a bit tricky to test as I have to either kill things or hit bosses to trigger the damage, so the training dummy is not working for this test.\n\nI found a mace that gives me 65 spell curse damage, and I noticed that my clear significantly improved, and so is my single target, before I had a generic 45 spell damage. So it could be that flat damage scaling is significant. But I had a mix of multiple curses and ailments. Hard to isolate.\n\nOnce I improve my tankiness I can try to equip harvest and test anguish in isolated conditions vs. a boss. Maybe next patch when dynamic DR is removed so numbers are consistent."
