            "Halloween 2010 to Easter 2024, been a good ride yall!",
            "So 2 things I have to say theorywise\n\n1.) I now think in DD, Carol told Daryl over the walkie that Michonne was back. Sounded way too calm for her to say Rick in that cutout, maybe she wants to surprise him.\n\n2.) I honestly dont know where we go from here on the macro level as a franchise. Sure there can be smaller stories through Tales or spinoffs. But now you have the Commonwealth which is huge and stable in Ohio, the CRC airlifting supplies everywhere, and Victor Strand\u2019s crew driving supplies all over the south. \nI guess a final stand against the walkers/variants or a search for a cure can be in play but tbh at the very least America seems to be in good shape, aside from NYC which as a native New Yorker, can say it\u2019s not that much different \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
            "Rick, you may wanted to have kept the prosthetic until AFTER you and Michonne escape.",
            "I enjoyed it but a single episode to totally destroy/reform the entire CRM after all of the buildup it had felt bizzare."

            "Rick and Daryl are by far the most closely bonded.\n\nDaryl feels, and literally is, responsible for Glenn's death.  His guilt drives most of his actions in s8 and s9.  Notably no one other than Daryl blames him, though he blames himself a lot.\n\nDaryl and Aaron are not really that close.",
            "Sorry, I seem not to be able to create posts with both tect and images... Help. :)\n\nHowever, here is the text I had written for the post:\n\nI know Daryl and Rick are seen like brothers (and they both even refer to one another as such) but I feel that Daryl and Glenn's friendship was the deepest.\n\nI get the feeling Daryl did not really confide in Rick or share openly with him, even though they bonded so much. It is true though that at a certain point >!Daryl mistrusted Rick and was willing to \"betray\" him in a sense!<.\n\nThen Daryl and Rick's and further on Daryl and Aaron's.\n\nWhich one do you think was the most meaningful?",
            "Daryl definitely had the deepest bond with Rick. They referred to and thought of each other as brothers. He will always feel guilty for what happened to Glen even though Negan is the one who killed him. Even Maggie doesn\u2019t blame Daryl. \nI didn\u2019t really notice Daryl and Aron being all that close but he knew Daryl could really appreciate that motorcycle and they did grow to trust each other. Although as someone else already mentioned, he didn\u2019t share his feelings/fears with any of the men, only Carol and Beth.",
            "I will say that even though they weren't emotionally close as others have pointed out, Daryl and Glenn's eventual friendship does mark an important change in Daryl. He starts out being a total asshole, telling Glenn he's got big balls for a Chinaman, making cracks about Asian flush when they were drinking, and driving like an Asian. So when they're in the woods and Merle calls Glenn 'that Chinese kid' and Daryl pops off on him about how Glenn is Korean, that's a special moment. Knowing Glenn and learning to respect him changed Daryl to such a degree that he stood up to his big brother, probably for the first time in his adult life.",
            "Aaron has him over for dinner to ask him to help find more people, and knows Daryl well enough to know what that motorcycle would do for Darryl. (I\u2019m sorry I can never remember if he has one or two r\u2019s in his name) Darryl responds to good people, and he has a great sense of knowing someone\u2019s character. That\u2019s why he likes Aaron so much.",
            "Daryl didn\u2019t confide in or share openly with any of these men, or men in general. He does that with Carol and Beth. \n\nDaryl never mistrusted Rick, and his \u201cbetrayal\u201d to kill Negan was no less than the betrayal to spare him.",
            "I see Daryl and Rick as the brothers who grew up with each other, bickering all the time. Glenn being that one sibling who was born 10 years after them and doesn\u2019t see his siblings much but when he does it\u2019s always a memorable moment. \n\nAnd at the end of the day if one of them gets hurt the other 2 would come together and fight for their brother.",
            "He likes Aaron, but they are not that close.  Aaron and Gabriel are much closer.  Though Aaron focuses most of himself on Gracie (after losing Eric).  It's unfortunate they did not explore Aaron and Jesus relationship further, they seemed to be very good friends as well as potentially very complimentary to each other as a couple."

            "All the same, except we would continue walking at a turtle speed, since walkers were slow enough for those two to have a tea party",
            "Go get back in the truck. Honk and drive around to get walkers to follow me away from fema trailer so Otis could get what they needed. Then double back pick up Otis and all the supplies from the trailers, and police cruisers.",
            "I don't know but I sure as fuck wouldn't shoot a poor guy in the leg to save myself.",
            "I think what doesn\u2019t get discussed  is that Shane was trying to sacrifice himself first. Otis was being all noble and refusing leave Shane behind. But he clearly wasn\u2019t going to make it out by himself. Someone had to get those supplies back to Carl.\n\nNOT  saying Shane was right or wrong here. But he wasn\u2019t trying to be a cold blooded killer, and the weight of his actions clearly pushed him over the (already fragile) edge.\n\nNobody was listening to him at that point. But even Lori seemed to soften towards him after someone told her that Shane killed Otis. She got why he did it. I don\u2019t think she hated him for it either. \n\nI kind of even think that\u2019s why Lori whispered In Rick\u2019s ear about Shane being dangerous. The look on her face when Rick told her what happened- I think it could be interpreted as disappointment, that she didn\u2019t count on Rick coming out on top of that fight.",
            "They absolutely, without a doubt could\u2019ve both made it back to the car. They spend like a full minute tussling on the ground before the walkers catch up, they could\u2019ve just kept walking, made it back to the car and fucked off\n\nSeason 2 was full of stupid bullshit like that",
            "I\u2019d leave him behind, most likely, but I wouldn\u2019t intentionally fuck him by shooting his foot.",
            "Definitely wouldn\u2019t have shot Otis unless it was a mercy shot and he was already too far gone. My morals would have me dying trying instead of using him as bait.",
            "I'm not a Shane apologist or defender, but....\n\nIn Shane's defense for this one choice, he genuinely didn't see a way that guaranteed Carl got the medicine that didn't involve one of them sacrificing themselves. He knew that he was the one with a compromised ankle, and he suggested a plan to Otis where Otis would get the supplies to Carl while he stayed behind. Otis turned this down, and Shane thought they would both die, and Carl wouldn't get the help he needed.\n\nI don't believe Shane sacrificed Otis as a way to save himself. He did it to get the supplies to Carl, and he was ready to die if it meant saving Carl.\n\nLater on in the season, we will Shane slip more and more into self survival motives, but at this point, I believe this was done 100% with Carl in mind.",
            "I don\u2019t remember the scene exactly but if the situation is so fucked then I\u2019d kill Otis. Not shooting his ankle but headshot so he wouldn\u2019t have to suffer.",
            "Anything but not shooting a man in the leg and leaving him behind to die. Worst thing I'm willing to do is leave Otis behind to fend for himself while I escape."
