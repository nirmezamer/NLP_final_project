            "Halloween 2010 to Easter 2024, been a good ride yall!",
            "Rick, you may wanted to have kept the prosthetic until AFTER you and Michonne escape.",
            "I enjoyed it but a single episode to totally destroy/reform the entire CRM after all of the buildup it had felt bizzare.",
            "As far as I'm concerned, this is the true ending of the whole franchise. Rick and Michonne, having gone through hell, fire, and brimstone to see their children again (Rick meeting RJ for the first time), is all that we need to bring their tale to a fitting closure. Rick started this whole story looking for his family, and ended it finding his family. No need for a second series for \"The Ones Who Live\"; I'm satisfied as a viewer."
