        "content": "Sorry I don\u2019t know if this is the right place to post this but I\u2019m at a loss. Our neighbors across the street have an aggressive, territorial Doberman that is almost always in their backyard, and barks like crazy any time anyone walks by. It barks its face off at 3am sometimes for no reason. Other neighbors have confronted them, some even went to the HOA. Nothing has changed. It\u2019s been 2 years of this. This morning I was on a walk, and as I walked by the front of their house (across the street, not directly in front), I heard it barking. It normally isn\u2019t on that side of the house so I was immediately surprised. I looked and saw their gate open, and the dog came charging out and ran across the street to me, stopped about 5 ft from me and was barking a ton and the hair on the back of its neck was standing straight up (it might be a Doberman mix, I\u2019m really not sure). My first instinct was to run, but I\u2019m a small woman, not as fast as I once was, and I\u2019m rehabbing a torn meniscus. I said as calmly as possible \u201chi, hi there, good dog, hi\u201d she kept barking so I called my husband and he talked me through it to keep me calm. The dog eventually walked away after I stayed frozen in the middle of the street for a few minutes. Now\u2026 I grew up with a dog (half lab, half German shepherd Rottweiler mix) and I\u2019ve always been a dog person, but this was terrifying. As I was walking into my house I heard the dog start barking again, and saw an older neighbor walking her very small dog. The older neighbor scooped up her dog and darted around one of our trees in front of our house to get out of the other dog\u2019s eyesight. I\u2019m mad as hell. We called the neighbors and texted them to tell them what happened. No apology, just \u201coh I don\u2019t know how that happened, she\u2019s inside now.\u201d I have two small children and I don\u2019t know what I would have done if they were with me. What do I do? Talk to them more about it? Obnoxiously go to the HOA or just escalate it to animal control? ",

            "Animal Control needs to be called ASAP. They need to know that they have to be responsible and close their damn gates, make sure they know where their aggressive dog is at all times. Call Animal Control again every time that dog is ever outside the bounds of it's secured fence. \"I don't know what happened, she's inside now\" doesn't help anyone if their small dog, small child, or elderly neighbor has been mauled.",
            "Keep reporting it and escalate to police or city. Dobermans are smart dogs that can be trained and integrated into people's lives but they're about as scary as a breed can get if they're in a bad mood.",
            "Something similar happened to us with a German shepherd. It ended up biting one of my kids on the hand as they walked into the house to play with a neighbor friend so animal control and the police were called. They made the owners quarantine the dog for 3 weeks, it wasn't allowed out of the house except to relieve itself and it had to be on leash. They also had to take the dog to a class to be observed by a trainer and signed off on that it could be rehabilitated. \n\nI was actually really impressed on how the city handled it.",
            "Call Animal Control. Carry any device legal to carry in your area with which to defend yourself. Know how, and when, to use said device. Pet Corrector, wasp spray, walking stick, super soaker are all non-lethal means to protect yourself. I highly recommend using koolaid in the super soaker if you go that route.",
            "I got a 5-figure payout from a dog that bit me, so, if anything happens, get their homeowners insurance info and file a police/insurance claim",
            "Defend yourself. Pepper spray it. Shoot it if you feel it's going to actively attack you.\n\nMost of us love dogs. But at the end of the day they're property that the owners are refusing to control. Big dogs are big responsibility.",
            "Not obnoxious at all. It sounds like youd be doing your other neighbors a service to report the 3 AM barking.",
            "You call the police. Im a dog person. But what if you were a 6 year old child? The police should get you in touch the correct department",
            "Weve got neighbors like this. Their rescue habitually hops their fence and its aggressive. One day it went after my wife in our own driveway. The neighbors wife apologized but they did nothing to prevent it from happening again. The next day I put up ultrasonic pest deterrents. The neighbor begged us to take them down saying her precious dog couldnt hear them but she could. The dog didnt come near the fence on our side of the property any longer, let alone jump the fence so I considered it mission accomplished and left them on.",
