        "content": "Hi, i\u2019m not too sure how to start this, but for context i\u2019m living with my boyfriend in an apartment complex, second floor, and i think someone\u2019s been stalking me or trying to get in. \nSince we\u2019ve moved in i\u2019m usually alone here, my bf works long hours and gets home around sunset, and i\u2019m usually taking care of the house. this is our first place together and it\u2019s been amazing but i feel like i\u2019m paranoid.\ni keep hearing stuff or noticing stuff has been moved, turned on, or shut off, and so has my partner. recently i heard and saw someone trying to pick my lock and get in, but i think they heard me so they ran off.\nit looked like the guy that watched me move in that refused to talk to my dad when he asked what he wanted.\nsame guy was following me around and standing outside my livingroom window listening to me and my bfs conversations.\nbut last night we got home late, locked the door and went to bed after we changed, we heard keys and stuff being moved in the night but we thought it was our neighbors.\nwhen we woke up our tv was completely gone, and a pair of my underwear and keys.\nhow did they get in\nThis is getting so much worse by the day, i\u2019m really scared. My bf is a pretty big guy, 6\u20194 230lbs but i\u2019m 5\u20194 100 pounds flat and 17.\nI changed the locks this morning but i\u2019m still scared. \nwhat do i do?\n\nAs for weapons, this is the best i can do i think\n (https://imgur.com/a/o3SnD0o)\n\nPolice have been contacted, checking the buildings cameras and what not, moving as soon as possible\n\nThanks for all the advice, will be using it, i don\u2019t care if you don\u2019t believe me or not, safety is my only concern right now\n\nupdate: i think that person just tried to use the keys they took for the door, i ran to the door and just saw them running out of the complex, definitely a man, and i\u2019m not spending another night here.\nme and my bf came back 2 am last night, locked our door, ate and nothing was moved at all, so we went to bed, fan on, door closed, i woke up to the door wide open, front door unlocked, stuff gone, and dirt all over the floor and then called the police.\n\nLeft again today and shut all the lights off and locked the door, left the apartment as it is to go to my parents, came back to grab stuff and the lights were all on and doors were opened but the lock was still locked. i\u2019m so confused \n\nwe\u2019re installing a little trail cam we found at our parents house, hopefully will catch something.\n\nstaying somewhere else for the night, update in the morning.",

Also OP says they live in an apartment but posted in homeowners sub. I'm getting troll vibes.\n\nEdit: they've changed their post at least three times to vary weird details. If they were really afraid to stay there they wouldn't. They said their dad helped them move in so they have somewhere to go and won't. How is someone getting in if they changed the locks? Why did they come in one time and steal almost nothing and come back and take everything, both times OP and her boyfriend are sound asleep in the same apartment?  Nah.

I tried to open and just got a small water stream.\n\nToday stuff arrived for the 3rd bath, because we havent really used it and tried to open th shower, and got nothing... i thought why this wasn't caught on the inspection?, then I calmed myself and tried to figure it out, the previous owner changed the shower head and it looked a bit used (minor hard water buildup) so this should work.\n\nIn the end the shower fixture needed to be pulled to be able to get the water going, went to the other bathroom and was the same \ud83e\udd72 im glad i didn't call a plumber it would have been a really embarrassing and expensive way to figure out how to use our showers \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude05",

My neighbor essentially created a dam with their addition, so now water backs up and floods between our homes and into the back of my yard. Then it has copious standing water for several days when it rains. Thankfully, my home itself is built on slightly higher ground, but sometimes the water rising quickly (been as high as 5-8+ inches deep before with normal rain), makes me incredibly nervous. We bought a cut lot, not built on fill, which is nowhere near a flood zone to avoid water issues.
