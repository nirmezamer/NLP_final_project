What a heavy piece of shit.  the viewing angle was like 4 goddamn degrees but my dads cheap ass just refused to get rid of it as long as it worked lol.\n\nI remember the last time I helped him move that thing he'd gone into a third floor walk up and when we got it up to his level, me thinking my heart was literally going to explode any second, he made some bitchy comment about me \"being too rough with it\" and I tell you, I came seriously close to pushing that fucking thing back down the stairs and him along with it.\n\nGod what stupid goddamn things those were.\n\nI kept my word, though.  Never did help him move it again.  He spent months trying to give that fucking thing away before he finally found some tweaker duo to come in and move it in exchange for getting to keep it lol",
