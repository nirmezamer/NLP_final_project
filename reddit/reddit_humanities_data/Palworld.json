        "content": "Just discovered this and thought some people might benefit from it.\n\nI built a base near the alpha Anubis to periodically kill it for large pal souls each day and to keep . But there's an added benefit that I didn't even think about. I had left my game running over night for egg farming, but when I woke up, I found a ton of new material in the chest.\n\nIf you AFK in the base, you will regularly get raided by Pal Alliance guys, who drop medium and large souls. Make sure you fill your base up with some heavy hitters and they will just mow the invaders down. They also dropped rockets, assault rifle ammo, training books, money, and polymers. The best part is you can come back from being AFK, and immediately go and defeat the Anubis for more pal souls.\n\nIf you have a strong Katress, send it out in your party so you can increase the drop rates too. Pretty sure the humans are all neutral, so I imagine they should increase drop rates. Will study this and report back when I know for sure. I was told Vaelet would work for Anubis farming, and I'm training one of those up now for that, so I imagine Katress should work for the Pal Alliance dudes.\n\nCoordinates are: -152, -177\n\nOh, and it also has a sulfur node and an egg. Pretty much just give them beds, baths, and salads, and they're good. You can also build it up quite nicely for farming Bellanoir, which is how I have mine set up.",
