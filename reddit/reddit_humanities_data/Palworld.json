The first 30 levels were fun, 30 to 40 felt okay but 40 - 50 sucked all fun out of the game with HOW MUCH GRINDING you have to do to reach level 50. And now they increased the limit to 55 and i don't have numbers for those levels - but i think it's even worse.\n\nThe curve from 40 to 50 is so steep you feel like your hitting a brick wall head one. If you caught all low-level pals on earlier levels for XP you're stuck with an incredible slow grind of crafting legendary balls and praying those level 40+ pals stay in their balls to get the up to 12 catch bonus.\n\n  \nI'd say it doesn't really matter, but most of the good stuff is locked behind level 50+ now and holy cow i'm unsure if i'm even willing to continue when i finally reached level 50 after 120 hours.",

            "Idk I took a break when I got to 46, when I returned last week it only took a couple days to get to 50, just go catch all those pals. Filling out the paldex and running all the snow biome dungeons gave me plenty of XP and I play at 1.0 rates",
            "Are you catching 10 of each and every pal you run across? Because it gives a TON exp and I'm pretty sure it stacks with each 10. I found I was stalling on levels at 25ish, but I wasnt catching all the pals I should have and doing that slung me up level 40 in a short time.",
            "Just have fun with the game. You don't have to hit the max level if you don't want to. I'm over 200 hours in and level 48. I just beat that level 55 rocklem, so it's not like you miss anything by not getting to max level",
            "It's pretty fast if you focus on catching stuff. They even added 2 to the exp max so you can catch 12 for full exp bonus. With the ore pits the pal metal isn't even a big deal, anymore. You can just catch or breed some astegons to mine and they're even nocturnal for the ore and stone pits. Kelpseas produce a lot of pal fluid for cement and just buy bones from merchants with money from butchering alphas and treasure chests.\n\nNow. If you're talking about pals... yes. They level ridiculously slow after 50. A training pen that you can stick like 5 pals in to level would be great. Just give the mining animation to them all and have them whack some stuffed dumuds and mossandas.",

            "Hello,\n\nFirst time posting here, but my friend encouraged me to share. For my main base I had made a pyramid, which was obviously easy to make. Ever since that, though, I became obssessed with making a sphere in Palworld. As should have been obvious, making a sphere out of squares isn't so easy. I worked on this for a few hours a day for weeks, and ended up with an egg shape. Because I hadn't noticed that while the foundation and roof pieces are squares, the walls are rectangles. So I had to do some calculations and build an actual sphere around the egg. I worked on that a few days a week about every other week for months, until I read about the Sakurajima patch a few weeks ago, and then finally got the motivation to finish it. Just a few hours before the patch dropped I finished it, and here are the results. It can be seen from all over the game world, which I think is pretty neat. Holding my breath that the patch wouldn't make the sphere explode because I had used a mod to allow foundations in the air, and luckily the sphere was still there when logging in after the updates! So now I'm posting here while I wait while resources gather to make more Plasteel.\n\nThank you for your time",

            "Hey umm.. wheres the oil rig?",
            "I did a HALO drop (took a Jetragon really high and then glided in) cos I don't believe the lasers target you when you're off a mount. I landed on the tower from there",
            "Can only be acquired with a flying mount, tower doesn't let you grapple onto or climb up it for whatever reason.",
            "To the right and below marsh island.  Coordinates are \\~ 544, -423. Be careful though because once you start approaching, it it shoots long range lazers that will kill you very fast. You have to fly there slowly then once the lazers charge up fly straight up and towards the rig on your swift legend jetragon and then jump off and glide to the bottom once his stamina runs out.",
            "So you need to disable all of the laser towers? Or just be fast",
            "Jormuntide is another mount option for getting there. The lasers won't aim at you while you're in the water, but they will activate once you get onto the rig.",
            "Yes. There is only a small chest up there. The big chest won't spawn up there. There is a ladder but you can't climb it. You can only get up there with a flying pal, so all the laser towers need to be disabled first.\n\nThere are enemies on each level but you can kill them with rockets before you approach.",
            "Laser towers don't seem to activate when you're on the rig itself. Enemies are strong enough to gun down your mount very quickly though, especially because it'll get stunned from taking too much damage too quickly. Safest to ride your mount way higher, glide down with a galeclaw and shoot the guy at the top of the tower with a rocket before he starts firing. If your mount is killed getting away from the oil rig is a pain, so always bring a homeward thundercloud.",
            "Big chest can be in one of four locations (could be more), labelled A B C and D. Smaller chests 1-12 are static. All respawn every in-game day, not at daybreak but seemingly 24 hours after starting the alarm or opening the big chest, unsure of which. It is possible for enemies to despawn/respawn while you are there, alongside the chests. \n\nSmall chests are worth opening, they can contain 5-20 oil or 15-20 dog coins, small lotuses or rarely giving schematics. Big chests can have 50-150 oil, large lotuses and appear to be the only source of legendary schematics for some of the new weapons as well as the base schematic for the quad missile launcher. They are oilrig_01 and 02 on this list respectively https://paldb.cc/en/Treasure_Box"
