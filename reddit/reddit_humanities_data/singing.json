Don't hold back). \n\nI started to join a karaoke party in my town, because they have a real stage and I want to get a feeling for being on a stage. I know karaoke is meant to be a fun thing and that the fun is, that not everyone is a good singer (and don't necessarily want to be one). But I try to practice two songs for each evening (this party is once a month, sometimes longer spans) and it's kinda frustrating. Without the karaokemelodies I think, that it's okay what I'm doing. Of course not incredible, but i can feel and hear some progress. \nAs soon as I practice with karafun in the back, everything sounds dissonant. I don't know If I got a problem with singing to musical accompaniment in general, or if I'm horrible with choosing the songs, or if I'm just horrible at singing at all? \nOr is karaoke just not for everyone? \n\nWhat do you think?",

            "I'm not sure why you'd practice without the backing track.  I think the best method is to make your practice as close to the performance as you can.   That means using the backing tracks and making them loud enough that your hearing them during practice. \n\nI believe that singers that practice acapela tend to shift keys to something that feels better to them, maybe even shifting keys within the performance.   Without the backing, this may feel OK to the singer but might be noticeable to the listener.   Also, you're allowing yourself to go off the original key.   Then, you get up at karaoke, the backing track comes in, on key, something seems of to you, then that's the added stress of having an audience and your unable to stay in the right key.   Or maybe you can start off in the right key but you'll have a tendency to want to go to the key you practiced in.   It's all just a guess though without hearing an example of both, your practice and performance.",
            "If I'm getting you right what you're experience is a symptom of bad pitch. With melody present in the backing track it's just more apparent. I had similar experience with karaoke versions of instrumentals. The meody was so distracting I couldn't concentrate on singing. But my pitch got better and now I actually see the melody as helpful.",
            "Whether youre good or bad now, singing is a skill you can work on. I turned my laptop into a karaoke machine! Get a usb mic and headphones, then open GarageBand and YouTube at the same time. That way you can hear both yourself and the track in the headphones. Practice singing along with the original artist first. Listen to them closely, analyze what they do and see if you can match them. Then practice with just the backing track. Repeat until you like your sound. Also, dont forget to warm up, do exercises etc before learning songs. There are a ton of resources on YouTube for this.",
            "No one is a \"bad\" singer, not even in karaoke. But like with pretty much any skill, singing takes practice. Sing when you can, and you'll find improvement in no time.",
            "When you sing without music, its harder to know when youre off of pitch. With music you can hear it better. So practice with music.",
            "I learnt from my coach that no matter how bad the sound is, the mic or the surroundings, if the song is mastered acappella, youll sing it perfectly with the instrumental track. If you cant, you need to go back and fix it acappella.",
            "I find that some karaoke songs are way out of tune to the original. Ill choose a song I know well and I cant sing it in tune with the backing track. I have started to learn to tune it out and sing the way I would sing the song, but it can be difficult and discouraging.",
            "I used to practice by singing along with the artist, and then went full karaoke and recorded myself (just a backing track). That was a shocker. Eventually I started to practice with the instrumental only. I especially had to work on my tuning. \n\nLuckily with the Internet, there's pretty legit ways to get backing tracks from the likes of Amazon MP3 and Karafun.",
            "Yes! Recording yourself is such a great way to learn",
            "I think I heard somewhere that Hayley Williams could not sing her own songs in karaoke. According to her she did a bad job and couldnt sing on pitch.\n\nHaving said that, it is a skill to be able to sing in a key you might not be familiar with. Most karaoke places have bad sound which may cause you to approach singing differently than you normally would. It helps to find the tonal center and hum it before you actually start singing.\n\nI might have misunderstood part of your details but it sounds like youre talking about distance?\nAs soon as I practice karafun in the back everything sounds dissonant. \n\nIf youre listening to things from a distance, pitches tend to get distorted and sound a little different than from the source. \n\nPitch is a frequency and if you have a tuner it can help you feel what is the correct sound and help you memorize it/get you trained to hear it on your own.\n\nIt may be musicianship and not necessarily technique that is the problem. For example: pitch, finding the correct key, etc. \n\nPlay around with the tuner to see if its pitch, and if not you can try to diagnose by paying attention to technique."
