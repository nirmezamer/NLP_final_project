        "content": "With today's stream and in light of other revelations, such as OKBuddy time driving Voosh into alcoholism by being painfully unfunny, it is clear that the sewer of the main sub has overflowed into our once beautiful boulevards. Due to these circumstances the council has discussed making some changes to the subreddit. A street cleaning so to speak. These **possible** changes include a more active pruning of the community for liberals and other such undesirables as well as a stronger curation of the types of memes allowed. Additionally we may retire long dead running gags to avoid a Joe Biden situation. We may ultimately decide that no action is required. We wish to stress that **nothing** has been decided yet, as we wanted to include the community in the decision making process. Please feel free to add your 2 cents on whether you believe the above would help or to offer up your own suggestions on how to improve the quality of the subreddit. Together we will make OKBV great again.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ama125egqe9d1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e2eb80c7d6bec1f847aafd2569ad91252c4efe0",
