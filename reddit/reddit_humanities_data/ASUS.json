        "content": "my laptop model is Rog G513QM, \n\na couple of weeks ago, my laptop won't boot into windows and the screen was showing no display, so i brought it to a local laptop repairshop. a week pass, they said they have tried everything but it still wont boot, they said they'll try for another week,  then they tried to change the BIOS model (without me knowing) into a G713QR model BIOS, and the laptop was able to boot but it still had no display and has to connect to an external display, but because it has the wrong bios, the rtx 3060 was not detected in the system device manager and so was the display, so i told the repairshop to turn the BIOS back into the original BIOS. A week later they said that they cant revert it back to G513QM BIOS, they have tried flashing it, but the laptop won't let it flash the bios and they said they have tried the same method they used to change the bios to G713QR to turn it back to G513QM but it still wont work, so now im stuck here and they have surrendered in repairing it, \n\n\nI just bought this laptop secondhand about a month before it wont boot to help with my college, and i need it to help render buildings for my project\n\nhow can i go about this, or what should i do, or can i even change back the bios, does changing the bios chip will work?\n\n\n",
