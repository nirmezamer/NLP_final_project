I'm doing about 15k miles mostly country roads probably average speed 30-40mph. Looking for an auto, can spend up to 20k. I think electric is off the cards due to my housing situation.",
            "In North Essex, near the Suffolk border.  Price range is up to 8k, might be able to stretch to 10k, depending on what I get for my 2005 Zafira.  I'll be buying outright.  \n\nMust be automatic, must have 7 seats.  I probably do around 5000 miles a year, once a week to the office but I need space to get 4 kids in.  Very rarely make long journeys, doesn't have to be ULEZ compliant, but preferably would.  Also, ideally petrol or petrol hybrid.",

            "BMW 330d/335d.\n\nWhy do you think you need to replace the Focus? I drive more than you, and the GTI probably has worse mpg if not around the same. Hasn't been too bad. If it's the comfort aspect and just want a good cruiser, then the 330d should do the job",
            "V60 s r rlly reliable",
            "Thanks for the in depth reply! So if I switch to a 60mpg car Ill be saving about 600 a year on fuel. I know owning two cars isnt really practical unfortunately I financed my civic and now really regretting it after certain things happened in life (hindsight). The fuel is killing me and thats why I was thinking of just getting a cheap shit box thats reliable and save some mileage on the civic",
            "Thanks! I didnt realise they were AWD. The boot looks really small though Or is there a specific model?",
            "Haha I have unfortunately realised this about minis after a bit of research over the past few days. Thanks for the reccs, will have a deeper look into. I've been considering a Suzuki swift actually",
            "Sorry, I missed the SUV bit. Model S which is bigger than model 3 also will be in your budget. Model Y which is more close to SUV is costly. I think Teslas are comfortable as most of autonomous features take away stress of driving. But if you are looking specifically for SUV , then check out ioniq 5.",
            "Thanks! I looked into Y but it was out of budget. Ill check out S and the ioniq! Thanks again"

        "content": "I have been looking for a sub 10k hot hatch for a while now and I came across the Kia Ceed/Proceed GT 1.6 T-GDI. \n\nYou can get a semi-low mileage, well looked after example for 7-8k. A comparative Golf GTI is at least double the price. I know its not as premium or as fast, but you get so much for the price. The only other hot hatch that comes close to these in terms of price is a Fiesta ST but given their reputation I would like to avoid those.\n\nSo my question is how are they so cheap, is there something really wrong with them that I should be wary of?",

        "comments": [
            "Going against the grain here but I owned an 18 plate Kia proceed gt and I was actually quite fond of it. They come highly specced, heated seats, reverse camera, apple car play, heated steering wheels. They are not the fastest car in the world but they do feel quick when youre putting your foot down. I would say the reason they are now so cheap for the years you are looking at will be the warranty has expired. Its a massive selling point for owning a Kia so when it expires, prices dip. That was the only reason I sold mine. It never had an issue during my 3 years of ownership.",
            "Maybe because Kia/Hyundai reputation for oil consumption during those years?",
            "The GT Kias arent that quick (well theyre quick but not enough to be compared to a GTI) and that GDI engine is troublesome. \n\nI honestly think the best hot hatch under 10K is a Mini Cooper S gen 3 (F56/F55)",
            "Uk journos were pretty negative about them when they were new and Id imagine that would have affected their demand. \n\nMy understanding is theyre fairly well regarded by the Aussies.",
            "Brand. Its completely down to branding and the name. My car is a Fiesta underneath but was 5k cheaper from new because its got a Mazda badge. Same with my old Seat, it was a VW lupo.\n\nEdit to add: A Golf GTI and a Fiesta ST are two of the most inflated because of how they are branded as hot hatches, the equivalent Seat or Mazda will cost considerably less, have a higher trim level and you don't pay for the badge.",
            "Because GT is about trim, not performance",
            "2013 5cly V40 is the way",
            "I don't think they're quite \"hot hatch\" material. They're warm at best. \n\nYou get what you pay for at the end of the day. I know which is choose between the Ceed and a Golf.",
            "They're not very good, that's why.",
            "I have a 2016 Kia Ceed (non GT, 1.4 SR7), had since 2018, and while it lacks a little oomph, it's been faultless. Doesn't drink oil, good equipment level even in the basic form, and 7 year warranty. What's not to like!"

(Unless they see this post) \n\nIt\u2019s likely been ragged about, it had some \u201cmust fix before next MOT\u201d when it went in for a major service around Feb time, so either those have been fixed as well as any damage as I was informed it was used to knock someone off their bike (motorbike or bicycle I don\u2019t know) as part of a robbery, or ignored and again the next owner will be none the wiser and soon enough end up with a hefty bill. \n",

If they then recover the vehicle and deem it to be repairable why shouldnt they repair it and sell it on?\n\nIf it had been recovered earlier before your payout and repaired and returned to you would you be telling the dealer it had been stolen and recovered when you were putting it in for part exchange?
