            "Looking to buy my first \"nice\" watch. I normally wear an Apple Watch every day, but I'd like to get a nice automatic watch to wear for client visits (I work in tech and would wear with a blazer) and weddings (would wear with a suit). I tried watches on in a few different boutiques recently (Tudor, Tag, Breitling) and really liked the look and feel of the Tag Heuer Carrera Date in black/rose gold (WBN2113.BA0639). I especially liked the simplicity of the look with minimal complications. Could that watch serve my purpose? I don't have a specific budget in mind, but I'm seeing that model on Chrono24 and eBay for under $3k, which I'm comfortable with. Reading through the buying guides, I'm a bit overwhelmed with the amount of options. I'd also like to get a black leather strap for it but am not sure of the best place to do so.",
            "How idiotic will I look if I wear a smart watch on one wrist and a Rolex on the other?",
            "Looking for recommendations for my wife\u2019s first real watch. She likes the bead of rice bracelets, likes a two tone or steel. Leaning towards the omega de ville or a ref 160 seamaster, Longines La Grande. \n\nAny other suggestions? Trying to keep around 1200, open towards quartz.",
            "I would like to find an automatic vintage pre-1969 Hamilton watch that would have been made in Lancaster, Pennsylvania to use as an heirloom piece. Where is the best place to look?",
            "I'm looking for my first nice watch, and landed on the YEMA Navygraf Marine Nationale GMT as one of my options. From what I've seen, Yema has had pretty bad QC from a year or 2 ago. Is this still the case? Would the Yema be worth the risk of bad quality?",
            "Can anyone recommend a company that makes quality straps?  My Omega AT has 16mm between lugs and the official Omega straps have only a few options.",
            "Hey all,\n\nJust curious, I want a hand-winding (not automatic) watch with a glass case back. My price range is up to $2000. Open to suggestions, preferably a field watch but really anything.\n\nThank you!",
            "Is Chrono24 legit?",
            "Can anyone recommend-\u00a0\nLightweight watch with metal bracelet. An everyday wear watch. Automatic. Max size 40. Green (or steel blue) face with date.\u00a0\u00a0Up to $1200 budget.\u00a0",
            "Ok, I worry this isn't going to go over well, but I have no choice. I recently saw a watch I loved on the subway, but I couldn't read the brand from where I was. I'm going to describe everything I can about the watch, and you tell me if you have ANY IDEA what it might be. \n\nIt was a round steel-colored case on a blue rubber-looking strap. The face was flat white, and the only Arabic numerals were 3, 6, 9, and 12, in a modern-looking font. Other than that the face was pretty plain - it didn't look like it had a lot going on, but there was definitely a spot of red that might have been part of the logo and might not. The second hand was red. Overall size I would guess 30-40MM.\n\nI know, it's not a lot to work with. But any ideas?"

        "content": "I randomly stumbled upon this 1/184 Boutique Edition H08 2 weeks ago and immediately fell in love. The squircle case shape, strikingly simple dial and unique typeface comes together so perfectly. To me it\u2019s almost a modern take on a classic field watch.\n\nAfter digging into this more, I found out that it actually has an in-house movement that is manufactured by the famous Vaucher Manufacture Fleurier that makes movements for AP, Richard Mille, and many more. The H08 is MUCH more than just another fashion watch.\n\nHerm\u00e8s actually acquired a 25% stake in Vaucher years ago which absolutely sealed the deal for me and I had to pick up an H08. Herm\u00e8s is in it for the long run and this is their first men\u2019s sports watch which I believe will be a future classic.\n\nReally enjoying this piece! Let me know what you guys think!",

I don\u2019t like square watches, I don\u2019t like the seconds hand, I don\u2019t like everything in the middle of the dial, I don\u2019t like the date window. Put it all together and it\u2019s pretty perfect. I want one, I want that chrono they have in the pipeline.",
