I don't necessarily like the big arrow hands or the colorful dial. $200 is about right, maybe up to 300.\n\nCan you recommend anything with similar features and styling?",
            "\n\nIs there any watch with an interval timer(like a tabata or an HIIT timer which beeps every few minutes) which vibrates instead of making a sound at each interval?",

Most watches seem to be in the 11-13mm thickness but also a lot of places don't list that info. Even brand rec's would be appreciated.\n\nEdit: looking in the $500-1000 range, and definitely want quality over flash.",

If sports watches are your thing, you\u2019re probably going to be hard pressed to do better than an Explorer and I\u2019d say the JLC borrows a fair amount from the Explorer to begin with",
            "Who are you trading with? I think the opportunity here is that the other party knows they can make $$ selling your Explorer. Look at JLC gray market asking prices and see how this compares to what you're paying, which is the current gray value of the explorer and cash. I seriously doubt this works out in your favor from a dollars and cents perspective. \n\nBut if you like the JLC and want brand variety to go with your Sub, then go for it. The JLC is a great watch.",

            "No, imo the Explorer is the perfect watch.",
            "Bro I know people will be like but it's a rolexxxx and talk a bunch of crap about invesemt holding value and whatnot... But if I had to wake up everyday and put something on ky wrist I'm gonna be looking at the whole day, the Polaris is dramatically more interesting to look at than the rolex. Like, it's not even in the same ballpark of interesting to look at.",
