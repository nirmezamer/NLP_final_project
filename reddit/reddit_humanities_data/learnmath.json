        "content": "Hi r/learnmath redditeers,\n\nI\u2019m a 36 year old biologist (got my PhD back in 2014) who switched careers to software development ten years ago (first for lab software, then entirely different businesses) and has spent most of his professional time analyzing, building and testing complex (cell-)biological and software systems.\n\nI was never one of the \u201egood\u201c math students both in school and in university but I managed to get through.. although, back then, it felt like a time-pressured \u201eget it done, pass the test\u201c-thing, and I really did not like the subject too much. Appreciating the beauty of it was out of the question and a deep understanding impossible. Just passing the tests and moving on to the next thing. \u00a0At the beginning of our undergraduate studies we were even (literally!) told that \u201emath is not a core competence of a biologist\u201c and that we just had to \u201eget though it\u201c. Well\u2026 talk about implanting desctructive mental patterns into students minds!\n\nThis attitude shaped a lot of my understanding of the necessity of learning math and it did not do me a favor. Mix that with toxic math teachers in school before and you get someone afraid of mathematics although extremely curious about STEM topics.\n\nThen a lot of time passed.\n\nAfter reading one of Ian Stewarts popular science math books in 2023, 17 years after my last mathematics lecture, I struggled to understand many of the deeper concepts described in there. And that made me feel angry. Very, very angry. After all, I was a Scientist, wasn\u2019t I?\n\nI want to spare my kids the pain of having no support in terms of a mathematical education (by being a competent help when they reach the age of learning algebra, precalculus and calculus) and also rediscover this field for myself within a much less pressured environment. Because\u2026 in the end it\u2019s one of the dialects the universe speaks and it is, honestly, really beautiful \u2013 if not taught by idiots. (Don\u2019t get me wrong. There ARE good math teachers out there. But they are not as common in my experience.)\n\n**Coming to the problem and question:** My ego very often tries to get me on a track where I doubt that re-learning and even reaching higher levels of math than before is a futile attempt of making up for lost educational opportunities and that I should pursue other intellectual endeavours in my spare time. Most prominently: Game Development, which I did for a few years on the side before I became a father and like very much.\n\nBut... I swing forth and back.. and forth and back\u2026 never able to decide, because since my spare time is quite limited (job, small kids, etc.), I will have to decide for one endeavour \u2013 can\u2019t have both of it, because the \u201ereal life\u201c is making understandable demands, too, and besides that physical exercise is a vital part of my life and costs time as well.\n\nAny advice on this? Did anyone else spiral down such an indecision-rabbithole?",

An even function is one where f(-x)=f(x). f(x)=x is odd. f(x)=x^2 is even.\n\nThese are two different concepts that use the same words. Does that help?
