So awesome that he still has that magic after all those years!\n\nAlso been liking last couple of singles by The Buoys, as well as the new tracks by Clairo and Amyl & the Sniffers.",
            "The new sophie song and the charli song with yung lean along with black balloon for me over the past week and preceding that was think of you by becca hatch, effy an mall grab with iluv and also sideshow by carla wehbe. I dig run and curious/furious by willow smith too",
            "Favourite - Allday Miss you still",
            "Loving U should not be doing that -amyl and the sniffers.\n\nNice to hear a rock song with a bit of attitude that hits hard.",
            "Million Dollar Baby will be on the hottest 100. Also loved Best Bits from King Stingray!",
            "Reason Why has been on loop, that song makes me feel at peace. Also a lot of Brat, really good album to have on loop. Hope those can get on the Hottest 100 this year.",
            "Baby, We\u2019re Ascending - HAAi",
            "Favourite song has to be Houdini by Eminem. Probably my vote for the Hottest 100.",
            "All 3 singles from Jamie xx have been top tier.",
            "Loving \n\nDisclosure - She's Gone, Dance On\n\nFred Again. - places to be \n\nCharli xcx - The girl, so confusing with Lorde (obsessed and has to be my favourite of the year, incredible album)\n\nRufus Du Sol - Music is Better (it has really grown on me over the past week) \n\n1300 - Levitate \n\nAyesha Madon - Eulogy \n\nNot loving as such \n\nGlass Animals - A Tear in Space (I'm a fan of them but I haven't been able to get around this and the new releases)"

            "I am still bemused and perplexed as to who thought it was a great idea to have G Flip as a subheadliner for Australia's biggest alternative multi day festival.\n\nIf that was the option that won out, I'm somewhat curious to know what the alternatives were that got rejected.",
            "Meanwhile the heavy music industry is thriving in Australia\u2026",
            "This meme isn't necessarily meant to be a blanket statement on the general state of how all Australian festivals are doing at the moment - from what I've been seeing Good Things, Laneway and Knotfest have actually been doing pretty well lately - but I've been watching clips of this year's Glastonbury and I can't help but feel a bit jealous",
            "Most big festivals in Australia now are more like carnival tours. Good Things, Red Hot Summer, Fridays Live etc.\n\nAnd those locked in single location ones like Splendor in the Grass are the ones that really look to be struggling imo.",
            "Flip had the most entries in a single Hottest 100 of any artist ever, one of which was second place. It\u2019s pretty reasonable to think they would\u2019ve been a draw card.",
            "Pretty much explains why Knotfest and Good Things are still doing well. Genre-specific festivals seem to have weathered the post-pandemic storm the best, it seems.",
            "And country music, CMC kicked ass.",
            "Please don\u2019t talk about Glastonbury..We had our Glastonbury! but then whoever decided Lizzo and Kylie and Mumford Arcade Firesons etc would be enough to charge 3 day festival prices for a 2 day festival that\u2019s who took our Coachella",
            "G Flip was a 4pm Field Day/Wildlands artist as recently as this January. They tour Australia quite frequently and most likely will be on another festival lineup within the next year or so with perhaps another tour lined up.\n\nNot to discredit the success because their tour did well and that H100 record is impressive so they are a drawcard. I don't think that justifies them a second headliner slot for a festival attempting to charge $600 for ticket and camping especially this day and age when money is everything for everyone.",
            "Same as edm/techno/house whatever the fuck you wanna call it. Lost, BTV, and pitch are all pretty niche with dance bookings and they sell the fuck out"
