            "Been really loving \u201cBaddy On The Floor\u201d by Jamie xx! I recently re-discovered Jamie\u2019s 2015 album *In Colour* and fell in love with it all over again. So awesome that he still has that magic after all those years!\n\nAlso been liking last couple of singles by The Buoys, as well as the new tracks by Clairo and Amyl & the Sniffers.",
            "Loving \n\nDisclosure - She's Gone, Dance On\n\nFred Again. - places to be \n\nCharli xcx - The girl, so confusing with Lorde (obsessed and has to be my favourite of the year, incredible album)\n\nRufus Du Sol - Music is Better (it has really grown on me over the past week) \n\n1300 - Levitate \n\nAyesha Madon - Eulogy \n\nNot loving as such \n\nGlass Animals - A Tear in Space (I'm a fan of them but I haven't been able to get around this and the new releases)",
            "The new sophie song and the charli song with yung lean along with black balloon for me over the past week and preceding that was think of you by becca hatch, effy an mall grab with iluv and also sideshow by carla wehbe. I dig run and curious/furious by willow smith too",
            "I, like pretty much everyone on the internet, have been rinsing \"brat\", but \"The girl, so confusing version with lorde\" just elevated not only that track, but the whole project to another level for me.\u00a0\n\n\nAlso loved Pond's new album, with \"Last Elvis\" and \"Fell From Grace With The Sea\" probably the two non-single standouts, but \"Black Lung\" would be a recommendation for all the old Pond fans.\n\n\n\"VOLCA\" from SBTRKT is hella cool.\n\n\nSpeaking of dance music, it's been an incredible year so far and Jamie xx's \"Life\" and \"Treat Each Other Right\" are right up there along with \"I CAN'T LOSE YOU\" by Confidence Man.\n\n\nFinally, because they're two of my favourite artists, was surprised and delighted to see Maggie Rogers and L'Imp\u00e9ratrice team up on \"Any Way\".",

            "Million Dollar Baby will be on the hottest 100. Also loved Best Bits from King Stingray!",
            "Reason Why has been on loop, that song makes me feel at peace. Also a lot of Brat, really good album to have on loop. Hope those can get on the Hottest 100 this year.",
            "Baby, We\u2019re Ascending - HAAi",
            "Favourite song has to be Houdini by Eminem. Probably my vote for the Hottest 100."

            "I reckon it's the difference in dedication. Because it's not as mainstream anymore, people who listen to heavy metal or the harderstyles want to see it live more and are more dedicated to each scene. With pop and even indie music, you can hear that everywhere."

            "[deleted]",
            "Looking at the charts is often not the best way to determine what will end up in the Hottest 100. The music Triple J plays is skewed towards more Australian and indie artists and typically avoids some of the mainstream pop that appears on the charts.\n\nI would be very surprised if those Taylor Swift, Benson Boone or Morgan Wallen songs made it into countdown. In fact Taylor Swift is sort of blacklisted from appearing in the countdown at all.\n\nTake a look at the 50 most played songs on Triple J (https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/most-played) and you\u2019ll struggle to recognise any artists from the charts there. The only one currently in the most played Triple J charts and the ARIA charts is Billie Eilish. That most played chart will give you a better idea of who to expect in the Hottest 100",
            "Lunch, I had Some Help, Good Luck Babe, Texas Hold Them - will definitely chart",
            "None of those songs you've listed are making it bar Kendrick",
            "Billy eilish lunch wins this year",
            "That's not quite right. Yes, popular songs do make it on, but it's popular songs that also resonate with the triple j listenership, which is different to that of commercial stations.  \n(So Taylor Swift and Morgan Wallen are not making it.)\n\nHow it works is that triple j provides a shortlist of songs, and the option for write in submissions, and you can vote for up to 10 songs.  \n\n(Edit: Also, people will say Taylor Swift is banned from the countdown. That's complete misinformation based on one incident where the voting rules were broken.)",
            "Billie eilish, Charlie xcx, Chapell roans \u201cgood luck babe\u201d single I feel will all make pretty high up spots!",
            "I am thinking either Chappell Roan (Good Luck, Babe!), Kendrick Lamar (Not Like Us), G Flip (Cruel Summer LAV) or Royel Otis (Murder on the Dancefloor LAV) wins. It should be Chappell Roan though.\n\nCXLOE's Good Luck, Babe! LAV gets in the top 10 too and places higher than Texas Hold 'Em.\n\nalso in regards to OP's list, 3 of the songs are in reliable (Cruel Summer came out in 2019, Stick Season in 2022 and Last Night in 2023)."
