We are both completely stumped, but he says he has no idea where it came from.\n\nIt threads pretty tight, and I\u2019m assuming it seals. Doesn\u2019t weigh much and the cavity seems to be too small to hold much of anything. \n\nAny help or ideas would be much appreciated. \n\nThanks in advance.  ",

If the teen says they dont know where it's from I think I would be inclined to err on the side of not worrying about it. If in fact you were worried, usually with 'what's this thing I found in my teens bag/room/clothes' type posts there's an element of suspicion. And rightly so, teens are prone to test boundaries. But maybe that's not the case here and you are just curious. In any event, it's pretty cool. When I was a kid I was obsessed with little containers.",
