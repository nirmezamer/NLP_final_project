            "i have curly hair (wavy-curly) that is low porosity, my hair is beautiful and shiny in some strands but i have a few strands that are completely destroyed and tangled and frizzy and hard, but the rest of my hair is great except for maybe the front part which always looks like i brushed my curly hair (if you know you know) I've tried all sorts of oils, my hair responds except for those strands! I don't want to purchase any hair masks and/or shea/mango butter, i have alo but why is those strands like that? please help! haha!\n\noh yeah:\n\nI do scrunch my hair and only brush when its wet\n\nMy hair is neither thick/thin its in the middle\n\nI have wavy-curly hair\n\nI've only straightened it once, sometimes put lemon to lighten it\n\ni wash my hair 3 times a week\n\nalmost waist length\n\nhave also tried rosemarry oil for hair growth and it is very hard to find split ends because of my curls\n\nI use pantene, aussie curls, ogx oils, and super nature conditioner, sometimes do masks like honey",
            "I bought Olaplex No.8 Bond Intense Moisture Mask for my bleached hair. I have naturally black hair so I have to bleach it in stages to achieve a light enough shade of blond to dye it a bright colour. Between these bleachings, I use hair masks, including now the No.8.\n\nHowever, the instructions are bit unclear. They say to use on damp clean hair. But do I use it before conditioner? After conditioner? In place of conditioner? I've found official instructions online that says that it can be used in conjunction with their own Olaplex conditioner, so I assume I should it before conditioner and then condition my hair afterwards?",
            "i just recently rebleached my hair and tried using k18 leave in mask last night for the first time.

It\u2019s soft but not like it usually is and I followed the K18 mask with Amika The Kure conditioner in the shower, out of the shower I always use Redkin Acidic Bonding Leave in conditioner and Olaplex Bond Repair Oil while damp then blow dry and straighten and seal with Kerastase Elixr. This is my usual routine besides the K18 so could it be that product causing this feeling in my hair and will it go away? I read it\u2019s ok to use for 4-6 washes in the beginning and then every few weeks from there. Will it always make my hair feel like this and should I discontinue using it or does it actually improve overtime?\n\nHair type: Medium, Fine Hair texture: Wavy History of chemical processing: Bleach Blonde, Heat Styled often Hygiene Regime: Hair wash x2 a week Style: Shoulder Length Long Layers\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mwkjztxtpx8d1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e1d2631898c92663626835878733d7545900f912\n\nignore my double chin thx",

This time, I believe it\u2019s due to the fact that I went swimming in a local lake on Saturday. I took a shower and washed my hair after the swim, but my hair felt incredibly greasy. I\u2019ve washed it every day since with my usual shampoo (i usually wash every other day), but it\u2019s still greasy at the scalp and almost dry/crunchy at the bottom. Any ideas?

If id have known that i never\nwould have cut my hair I don't use any heat on my\nhair, I only use scrunchies when I pull my hair up, I wear\na silk bonnet to bed, I even use sulphate free shampoo\nand put oil on my hair after, I use detangling spray, and\nhave even tried taking prenatals to give the extra vit and\nminerals, i don't brush when it's wet, i dont scrub my\nhair with a towel (I wrap it for a few minutes to soak up\nsome and the rest air dries in like 20 minutes). Nothing\nchanges it. It also tangles VERY easy because the hair\nstrands are also extremely thin so I've tried brushing\nless, I've tried brushing more, I brush from bottom to top,\n*etc. I do dye it VERY RARELY only because after a LONG\ntime of not dying my hair it still didn't help; so I figured if\nit's going to look like that no matter what might as well\ndye it\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nThis pic was taken a while back so my hair is about 4ish inches longer now but the top layer is still where it's at in this photo (around armpit length) while the hair on the bottom is a LOT longer..so it looks pretty funny..the hair that grows on the bottom of my head will keep growing but the top is stuck at this length, send help!",

I\u2019m going on about 2 weeks of not shampooing my hair and it\u2019s getting pretty oily even with my hair being generally very dry + dry shampoo.

            "shampoo alternative? and dry ends..\n\nI have thin/medium thickness and medium/high porosity straight hair and it goes down to my waist. I use Viori shampoo and conditioner bars and I feel they work wonderfully! However, I workout every day in the mornings and my hair feels fine throughout the day even though I sweat a good amount, but by the morning next day I look like I did a leave in oil treatment lol. im afraid shampooing my hair everyday will dry it out, especially the ends. I looked into the [Raw Sugar Rosemary Hair Rinse](https://rawsugarliving.com/products/vinegar-hair-rinse-rosemary-mint-6-oz) ... would it really be any difference to just shampooing? Is this a solution that prevents my ends from feeling like tumbleweeds?",

Use shampoo only when you need it. I use it every three days. That's all there is to say.",
            "It's way more likely for your hair to be damaged by using the sea salt daily than the rinsing. It's usually not recommended as an everyday product because salt draws moisture out of the hair and swells the cuticle of the hair (generally things that open/rough up the cuticle are a source of hair damage). So I'd be way more worried about that than the rinsing. Generally rinsing is fine, but with that said, hair is in its most vulnerable state when wet, it's more prone to stretching and stuff like that. So if you've got long hair, that's more of a problem than if you've got short hair where it's likely to not cause an issue unless you're somehow being rough on your hair while it's wet even though it's short",

And occasionally, use a clarifying shampoo since that hair paste can build up.  \n\nBut as of now, you don\u2019t wash your hair daily.  You wash it 1-2 times a week.
