            "Hard to play when ur fill team leaves when they get eliminated",
            "It's fun. My only issue is that it's only squads... would love a duo mode.\u00a0",
            "This mode should be a permanent mode.   With duo and trio\u2019s options too!!  Fun and refreshing",
            "Either i suck or others are just the best players in the game.",
            "It shouldn\u2019t be squads only",
            "Have to say the performance is insanely good. Probably the smaller map with also the more simple graphics but it's butter smooth compared to the normal BR",
            "Jesus christ it's so sweaty lmao",
            "I fucking LOVE the map/loot pool/etc. etc., but the actual Reload concept gets so sweaty/tiring for me fast. This is like normal BR on steroids.",
            "Reload is the most fun I\u2019ve had all season and possibly all chapter. I enjoyed ch5 season 1 and 2, but man does this feel so much more Fortnite. \n\nI have a few criticisms but they\u2019ve very minor and I would not mind they changed nothing. i do think not spawning with a shotgun is silly as your game depends on having one, I think there should be cozy campfires and bouncers (+maybe launch pads but don\u2019t wanna have too much movement), trap items add variety to builds, fit the OG theme and just allow us to carry more stuff, and finally I think solos, duos and trios should be added.",
            "Would love a duos option added to the game mode."
