Kustard, and Alicja Da Lontano. Bonnie also  speaks conversational Japanese, and can understand a little French.\n\nBonnie is a Golden Retriever Airship Engineer with a Steampunk style,  complete with goggles, leather gloves, sturdy boots, large overalls and  various tools hanging from a belt. She also has short, orange hair with  white tips and a paw-print marking on one of her ears. \n\nBonnie loves to chat and free-talk with her viewers and collaborate  with other VTubers. She also enjoys doing Karaoke streams, cozy games  and  and playing old point-and-click adventure games from the 90's.  Bonnie is also a hobbyist illustrator and sometimes does art streams and  posts her work on twitter. She likes to draw herself or fan-art of  other VTubers. Bonnie's favourite streams are ones where she can push  the boundaries and be innovative and creative with assets and viewer  interactions.\n\nOn 17th April 2024, Bonnie was the first member of globie to reach  over 10,000 subscribers on Youtube, 2 days before her debut on the 19th.  She then reached 20,000 subscribers on 7th June 2024. Her debut stream  consisted of a short skit inspired by a cruise ship safety briefing  video, and a minigame in which chat had to use various tools to \"fix\"  the pipes and clear the room of steam, revealing her model. \n\n# Trivia\n\n* Bonnie is often teased on twitter for being \"old\" and some of her  most viral tweets have involved memes from the community joking about  \"refiring a dying star\". One of these memes even being featured in a  \"Know Your Meme\" entry. Her viewers also coined the terms \"Pupmaxxing\"  and \"Litterpilled\" in reference to her.\n* Bonnie revealed on her debut that she is a Golden Retriever and 4  in dog years, making her age approximately 28-32 years old in human  years. \n* Due to Bonnie's first ASMR stream being derailed by many  high-value donations from viewers, it is now a running joke in the  community that every Friday stream is called \"Findom Fridays\".\n* It's a common misconception in her lore that Bonnie is the  Captain of the airship, however she is actually just the Engineer and  often refers to a mysterious Captain figure who flies the ship. One of  her goals at debut was to be promoted to Captain.\n* Bonnie has stated that one of her biggest passions is travelling the world and has so far visited over 22 different countries.\n* When Bonnie began streaming, she had a small collection of 4 or 5  Hatsune Miku figurines. However, due to a large number of donations  from her viewers via Throne, she now has over 20 different figures.\n* Bonnie loves space and sci-fi movies like Interstellar,  Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy and Gravity, but her favourite movie of  all time is The Martian.\n* Bonnie's catchphrase at the start of her streams is \"BALLS OUT  FOR BONNIE! \ud83e\udd4e\", a reference to her first tweet and to how dogs are  commonly associated with tennis balls.\n\nLinks\n\n* [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@BonnieBarkswell) \n* [Twitter](https://x.com/BonnieBarkswell) \n* [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@bonnie.barkswell) \n* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bonniebarkswell/) \n* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Bonnie_Barkswell/) \n* [Throne](https://throne.com/bonniebarkswell) \n* [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/bonnie_barkswell)\n* [Streamlabs](https://streamlabs.com/bonniebarkswell/) \n* [Globie website](https://globie.net/) \n* [Globie twitter](https://x.com/globiesocial) \n* [Globie Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/globie_hub/) \n* [Globie Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@globieofficial) \n\n[ Goodest girl!\ud83d\udc36 art by  @Anzu\\_1026](https://preview.redd.it/hzfuypx1z47d1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f57678fd6570fbb17b46b0f1f218d70ef977c2b2)",
