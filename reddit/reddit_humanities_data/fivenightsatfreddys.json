            "I have a question. I haven't played TJOC on my own, but I've seen a good amount of it from playthroughs, and I thought it was very good, so why is it getting a remake? What kind of things are they changing or adding?",
            "I hope that they release the console versions of the game at the same time as the pc release",

            "I think it was going to be a re-imagining/remake of the later TJoC titles. The first game is not going to be included.",
            "Nikson was unsatisfied with the original TJoC games (the original demo, Reborn, Story Mode) and decided to rebuild the entire thing from the ground up, starting over from scratch. It'll have updated story mode levels as well as the free roam from TJoC:R. It'll have new mechanics, new characters, and a new story.",
            "it is a full re-imagining of Story Mode. every level will be expanded on greatly, with the exception of Bedroom. Bedroom is going to be entirely different than the original bedroom. the story will also be much, much different. now it is only one main character throughout all the levels, and that main character is not Scott anymore, but still is the creator of FNAF. there's a lot more depth in here that I could go into, but I don't want this reply to be very long. I recommend checking out Nikson's twitter (@Nikson_dev) to see gameplay footage and stuff from the game.",

While I must admit I\u2019m not crazy about her game counterpart because she was very overrated especially those who kept treating her better than William at the time when she\u2019s not. Her movie counterpart I actually had no issues while yes she\u2019s not my favorite my favorite character since January of 2015 has always been and always will be William afton nothing will change that. However she\u2019s not that distracting and her being a new character in the old timeline doesn\u2019t bug me and when me and my mom went to see it ( me and my mom goes to the movies together to hang out etc. it\u2019s just something we do maybe once a year if anything good is playing. ) my mom grew an attachment to Vanessa and she became her favorite out of the four main characters and when she got stabbed she kept hoping she\u2019ll be ok and when people are speculating about what the fnaf 2 tagline says \u201canyone can survive five nights but this time there won\u2019t be any second changes. Hinting at one of the characters is most likely going to die and people speculating about who it\u2019s going to be she hopes it\u2019s not Vanessa. ",

            "She is really well written but poorly portrayed (not the actresses fault)\n\nWhen you find out the truth about her, all of her behavior makes a lot more sense. You can understand exactly why she acts the way she does in each scene and why her personality seems so flippant. The book makes it even more clear how her sudden personality changes are supposed to make you feel confused and give you whiplash, but in the movie it kinda just feels like she didn't have a solid personality.\n\n I think that's why she gets a lot of hate, her changes in behavior are very nuanced but come off as just poor characterization on a surface level.",

            "Eh, not a fan.\n\nI find movie Vanessa kinda dull and she's mostly there to spout exposition for Mike and the audience, which ruins the mystery aspect of the film as a result.\n\nShe's a lot better than game Vanessa, but that's not really a high bar.",
