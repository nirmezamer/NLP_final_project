            "I have a question. I haven't played TJOC on my own, but I've seen a good amount of it from playthroughs, and I thought it was very good, so why is it getting a remake? What kind of things are they changing or adding?",
            "I hope that they release the console versions of the game at the same time as the pc release",

            "I think it was going to be a re-imagining/remake of the later TJoC titles. The first game is not going to be included.",
            "Nikson was unsatisfied with the original TJoC games (the original demo, Reborn, Story Mode) and decided to rebuild the entire thing from the ground up, starting over from scratch. It'll have updated story mode levels as well as the free roam from TJoC:R. It'll have new mechanics, new characters, and a new story.",
            "it is a full re-imagining of Story Mode. every level will be expanded on greatly, with the exception of Bedroom. Bedroom is going to be entirely different than the original bedroom. the story will also be much, much different. now it is only one main character throughout all the levels, and that main character is not Scott anymore, but still is the creator of FNAF. there's a lot more depth in here that I could go into, but I don't want this reply to be very long. I recommend checking out Nikson's twitter (@Nikson_dev) to see gameplay footage and stuff from the game.",
