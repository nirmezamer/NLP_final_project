The mod team strongly believes in the freedom of expression of all the voices that contribute and bring this wonderful hobby of ours together.\n\nHowever, there is a recent rise in drama-baiting using a specific topic of female space marines, which then in turn results in more flame wars and other drama.  **We believe that these posts contribute nothing (not even a laugh) and serves no purpose other than to stir up drama in this sub-reddit. And to be frank, this topic has been well discussed and the proverbial dead horse well and truly beaten.**\n\nDue to the above reasons, moving forward all female space marine posts (Specifically posts that reference female space marine, this does not include Femboy posts, transfem meme etc) **will be considered as Malicious trolling and removed as part of rule 7. Depending on the severity of the post the user can face a ban.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Grimdank Mod Team.",
