The mod team strongly believes in the freedom of expression of all the voices that contribute and bring this wonderful hobby of ours together.\n\nHowever, there is a recent rise in drama-baiting using a specific topic of female space marines, which then in turn results in more flame wars and other drama.  **We believe that these posts contribute nothing (not even a laugh) and serves no purpose other than to stir up drama in this sub-reddit. And to be frank, this topic has been well discussed and the proverbial dead horse well and truly beaten.**\n\nDue to the above reasons, moving forward all female space marine posts (Specifically posts that reference female space marine, this does not include Femboy posts, transfem meme etc) **will be considered as Malicious trolling and removed as part of rule 7. Depending on the severity of the post the user can face a ban.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Grimdank Mod Team.",

            "The updates to the Codex Astartes following Rowboat Girlyman\u2019s resurrection allow for multiple captains in the same company in certain situations. \n\nAdditionally, the First Company is implied to have had a pretty rough time on Oghram, so it\u2019s possible the captain deployed there was killed and replaced. \n\nIt\u2019s also possible that Mr. Roboto Gorrillaman simply gave one of his captains terminator armor as a reward for good service. \n\nAll of this is pointless conjecture, however. The true answer is that he is Alpharius. (This is a lie.)",
            "There can be only one 1st Company captain, but other Captains may have had Terminator honours from induction into the 1st prior to becoming Captains - and so can still requisition the armour.  \nOr the Ultramarines have loads of spare suits since the 1st company are professional redshirts.  \nOne or the other.",
            "It\u2019s the guy on the right obviously.\n\nGuilliman is blonde, Alpharius/Omegon are bald.\n\nIn the grim darkness of the 41st millennium, all bald guys are evil.",
            "If I\u2019m not mistaken Captains of any company can have Terminator Armour/Honours.",
            "The guy on the right is left handed.",

            "They\u2019re the same dude.\n\nThey both have versions of Captain Agemman\u2019s Red and white checkered heraldry.\n\nThey\u2019re two versions of the same person.",
            "Other companies can have Terminator armor, it's just that it's highly unlikely those other companies will reach the heroic feats required to earn it.",
            "my head canon is that captains can wear whatever armor they feel like, regardless of company, i assume that all captains have the right to wear terminator armor, it would be a bit weird if they didn't.\n\nhowever there have been well more then 10 ultramarine captains depicted since the introduction of primaris marines: 10 currently available (uriel ventris, primaris capt, gravis capt, gravis capt with bolt rifle, capt with relic shield, jump capt, phobos capt, pushfit termie capt, termie capt, company heroes capt), 1 in a blind bag (space marine heroes series 4 capt), 1 no longer available (dark imperium gravis capt), and two promotional (2017 store anniversary capt, imperium magazine capt). \n\nmeaning there have been 14 captains of the ultramarines since the indomitus crusade. which it seems totally reasonable that the ultramarines would have lost 4 captains considering how many conflicts they participate in.",
            "\"Only first company can have terminator armor\" is not a rule on the codex astartes, nor anywhere else. It's just that a chapter barely have enough terminator armor to outfit their first company with them, if even that. But of course a captain of another company who wants one gets one, they are among the most honored and skilled warriors of the chapter."
