            "Being apprehensive about an unknown, unrestrained dog is intelligent, not weird.  Next time, if you can, take a picture - of the dog, and the owner.  If the dog is off-leash that's probably illegal unless you are in a fenced dog park. If the owner seems reasonable, you can let them know it makes you uncomfortable and is against the law.  Since it sounds like the owner is being/has already been uncooperative or unfriendly, report them in real time - animal control should send a truck... or report them later.  You have just as much right to enjoy the park free of your reasonable fear as the dog owner has to walk their dog on a leash... and way more than they have the right to let the dog run loose.   \n  \nHoping others can advise about deterrent.",
            "Hey,  \ntoday I was walking in the park and I noticed a dog and I got nervous and stopped (I felt he seemed a bit dangerous), and just cos I stopped he ran up to me and started barking even though his owner was calling him. I screamed and he left me, but still it was really scary, and the owner didn't even say sorry or anything, instead she just said I was being \"weird\".  \nMe being weird is stiffining up and and stopping cos I get nervous of dogs and rightfully so.   \nWhat do people recommend next time that happens? Also should I get dog deterants/a whistle to stop them, and should I report the person next time this happens?",
            "Nice dogs, dumb owner.  I take my daughter to day care in a bike trailer. Twice now these dogs have chased me, caught up and honestly scared the crap out of me.   Had to kick their heads, thought I might get bitten.  The first time my daughter thought it was funny, this time I'm not so sure. She's 3. \n\nFound the house... dogs are friendly, wandering around in the yard (gates were open), didn't challenge me when I knocked on the door. No response, so I called the county to ask them to speak to the resident. \n\nIf anybody has advice for how to deal with dogs while on a bike (with priceless cargo in the bike trailer) please let me know.  Nothing against the dogs but I straight-up wanted to kill them in the heat of the moment."

I know that 12 years is a full life for a dog but 12 years is not enough. This just sucks and I wish I could be there but shes thousands of miles away. Im trying to find solace in the fact that she isnt going to be suffering anymore but this just hurts so damn bad. Her name is Sadie. She is a good girl.",
            "I Just had to put down my beautiful little man of 8 years at 2PM today. I am absolutely devastated. I bawled my eyes out for two days before I had to take him in, somehow managed to hold it together while the vet did it, and continued to bawl my eyes out after I got in the car.\n\nI feel like I have giant hole in my heart and my anxiety is really acting up. I am dreading being home by myself tomorrow night, for the first time in 8 years without my little dude. This is the first time I ever had to put a dog down and it is killing me. I'm in my early forties and have next to no friends so I don't really anybody to talk to it about besides by girlfriend (who is equally devastated). This is one of the hardest, most brutal things, I have had to live with in years.",

            "About the same age as you. I had to let go of my own beautiful boy of 11 years about 2 weeks ago. Held his big paw the whole time. I don't understand how I made it home, or have been waking up and working and living my life since then. It seems wrong that the world can keep going on without his little face following me around; it's not fair. It was very sudden, at least to me, and I don't know if we made the right choice. People will tell you it's going to be OK, but it's not. It'll never be the same. You don't ever have to stop grieving or missing him for anyone else's sake. My advice, beyond feeling how you feel, is not to think of it as a loss of an existing thing but merely a lack of new memories of something you really loved. Don't let him become a bad memory. Mine is a bulldog, and I try to think that he's breathing easy now. I've lost track of what I'm trying to express, but I'm here for you.",

        "content": "\\*\\*Introduction\\*\\*  \n  \n1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  \n  \n\\* I grew up with dogs but this will be my partner's first dog. However, she is very knowledgeable about animal training.  \n  \n2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \\[reputable breeder\\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  \n  \n\\* We have a cat, so we think it'd be easier to introduce a puppy rather than an adult dog. This means probably a breeder.  \n  \n3)Describe your ideal dog.  \n  \n\\* Medium/large breed, good with cats, minimal barking as we live in a condo. Okay with shorter walks (but lots of mental stimulation/training at home!)  \n  \n4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  \n  \n\\* We're pretty open to any breed that meets our requirements!  \n  \n5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  \n  \n\\* We love animal training. Our cat knows over 10 tricks! We'd like to do lots of tricks with our dog too.  \n  \n6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?  \n  \n\\* We don't want to compete.  \n  \n\\*\\*Care Commitments\\*\\*  \n  \n  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  \n  \n\\* A good amount of time. We are very big on mental stimulation through toys and training. We might like to do nose work or agility classes and training at home.  \n  \n8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    \n  \n\\* On weekdays, walking about 20 minutes twice a day. On weekends, walking maybe an hour. We would visit a dog park if our dog liked doing so.   \n  \n9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  \n  \n\\* Fine with brushing daily/regularly. We can trim hair, nails, and clean ears at home.  \n  \n\\*\\*Personal Preferences\\*\\*  \n  \n10)What size dog are you looking for?  \n  \n\\* We live in an area where cougars, coyotes, and bears are a common sight! For this reason, we're afraid a small dog would be too tasty of a target. This has happened in our neighbourhood before. We think a medium/large dog might be safer. We don't want an extra-large dog because the shorter life expectancy makes us sad.  \n  \n11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  \n  \n\\* Barking needs to be minimal because we live in a condo. We would prefer low/medium shedding and slobber.  \n  \n12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  \n  \n\\* Not at all  \n  \n\\*\\*Dog Personality and Behavior\\*\\*  \n  \n13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  \n  \n\\* Snuggly!  \n  \n14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that\u2019s more eager-to-please?  \n  \n\\* Definitely eager-to-please  \n  \n15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    \n  \n\\* No real preference  \n  \n16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  \n  \n\\* We would prefer not to  \n  \n17) Are there any other behaviors you can\u2019t deal with or want to avoid?  \n  \n\\* Aggression to cats, excessive barking  \n  \n\\*\\*Lifestyle\\*\\*  \n  \n18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  \n  \n\\* My partner works from home, so only on weekends for a few hours  \n  \n19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   \n  \n\\* Both my partner and myself want the same traits. We both will be equally involved. It's important that dog bonds with both of us.  \n  \n20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  \n  \n\\* We have an eight year-old cat. He's met dogs before and is pretty calm. I think he'd like a companion to snuggle and play with.  \n  \n21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  \n  \n\\* No  \n  \n22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  \n  \n\\* We own and have no breed/weight restrictions.  \n  \n23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  \n  \n\\* Canada, not aware of any specific restrictions  \n  \n24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  \n  \n\\* In the summer, anywhere between 20-30 degrees Celsius.

That said, our boxer mix is leaking bad habits from our super mutt (barking at passers by). You can also advise a good shelter of what you are looking for, and with some flexibility they can probably help you find the right puppy. Doesn't have to be from a breeder.",
            "As soon as I read that you like training standard poodles came to mind. Large size, second smartest dog breed so they love training and mental stimulation, non-shedding. From the right breeder and with solid training, barking and being around cats shouldnt be an issue. \n\nOther breeds you could look into: Rough Collies, Silken Windhounds, and Boston Terriers",
            "A show line Springer Spaniel might be a good match. They have that lovely spaniel temperament, moderate energy levels, and a lower prey drive than the hunting lines.",
            "Standard poodle only if you meet the parents and know their temperament. I have one poodle that doesn't bark at all and one that barks all the time unless you put her in a vest. \n\nOtherwise I'd suggest golden retriever but I'm not sure you have enough time to exercise it.",
            "Curious to see what responses you get. I have a Dalmatian who is good with my DOG SAVVY cat, but chases my skittish ones. \n\nDalmatians seem to be a breed that pretty much only alert barks (they are guard dogs) and not because they enjoy the sound of their own voice. Cannot be overstated how much I love the lack of shrieking after interacting with my parents yorkie. My dal is actually a very quiet dog - no whining/barking/yelling etc. unless she wants out to pee or someone at the door.",

I have a 7-year-old Ragdoll cat. Friends, relatives and neighbors also have cats, dogs and small children and I love to invite people to my home. I would like a moderately active dog.

Interaction: preferably every minute that I spend outside of work. I want to do my everyday chores while talking to my pets and interacting with them constantly.

What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  \n    \n    * I would like to walk around the neighborhood daily and play fetch with my dog in our yard. We will attend weekly dog school and I also plan occasional travels and hikes. I don't like high-intensity activities, so I don't want a very high-energy breed (running while we play is more than okay, but I don't want to sprint every time we leave the house for a walk).\n    \n    9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?\n    \n    * I don't mind.
