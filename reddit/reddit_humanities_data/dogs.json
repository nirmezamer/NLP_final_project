            "Less of a vent, but unsure if it needs its own thread either: \n\nAny suggestions for puppy boredom? I adopted a rescue from a friend about a month ago, upcoming vet visit next week for spay and a DNA test since we have no clue about her breed, and the friend who found her already took care of shots and puppy vaccinations. \n\nBut also she seems to want to chew on just about anything BUT her toys. she will gnaw on soft toys for a few minutes, I step into my office for a zoom call and come back out to find she\u2019s move on to something not a toy (shoes, couch pillows, the tv remote).  Shes doing great with crate training, sleeps through the night without any fuss, and I\u2019ve even seen her go in there on her own and just chill while I\u2019m doing whatever random house chore is happening. \n\nI work from home and have the ability to take walks throughout the day. Our schedule basically is \n\n- morning wake up, breakfast\n- walk to nearby park (1 mile)\n- morning game of fetch or rope tug of war until she gets tired\n- walk home (another mile)\n- lunch, shorter walk through the neighborhood\n- after work repeat morning park and play walk\n- get home, an hour or two of back yard play with neighbor\u2019s dogs while he and I decompress from our work days on the back porch, dinner, short pee and poop walk\n\nAll in all she gets lots of daily activity on a very consistent schedule since I wfh and have flexibility during the day, I also got some toys that claim to give doggies some mental stimulation, a maze food dish (to also help with her tendency to eat too fast and then puke) and one of those motorized weasel balls she can chase around while I\u2019m working. \n\nThey work for a few minutes, she\u2019ll get plenty of praise for playing with her toys, I step away for a 30 minute zoom call, come out and see she\u2019s somehow stealthily found something I tried to put out of reach and scattered it all about the apartment. \n\nOther than working our way through the puppy years, how else can I provide some positive reinforcement and mental stimulation so she\u2019s not so bored to ignore doggy toys and not tear up other things?",
            "Had to give up my new dog, having a hard time.\n\nMy family adopted a dog about a week ago. She was a stray rescue from the local humane society. She was a 1 year old German shepherd/husky mix.\n\nShe seemed to really attach to my dad and I, whenever one of us would leave she would whine. This got better after a few days having her, however she was still always slightly anxious.\n\nNow the problem, my family also has 4 cats living in the house. We set up a kennel and a fence to give the dog her own area. However, whenever the cats came near she would growl. We call local trainers and they said to put a curtain up so they can\u2019t see each other. We did this and it seemed to be working. We were setting up training classes and started clicker training her at home. But then we had a few close calls with the dog jumping over the fence and lunging at the cats. We had a couple close calls but there was one call that came too close for comfort. We decided we were going to try and put her in my room. However she wouldn\u2019t calm down, it seemed as if she was having panic attacks. All of the cats were terrified, the dog was stressed, my family was fighting over what to do with her.\n\nWe talked to another trainer and said that her breeds have very high prey drives and that while training could help control it, there\u2019s always a risk and that the cats may end up being hurt.\n\nIn the end we decided it would be best for all the animals if we gave her back and that she go to a home with no cats.\n\nWe talked with the humane society and they completely understood and agreed that she was not a good fit for our house. We made sure that she would not be getting put down and they even said now that they know this they can find a better match. \n\nI guess the part that bothers me the most is that I feel like I failed her, she trusted me and she doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening. I keep getting sick thinking about it. I just really hope we did the right thing for her because she is an incredible dog and deserves to live in a house stress free.\n\nAnyways, sorry for practically writing an essay but I just needed to get it out. \n\nTLDR: I had to give away my new dog because she was aggressive toward our cats and I\u2019m just having a hard time.",

            "Gosh I hate it when the other people blame my cute little dog just because they find cat poop in front of their doorsteps every single morning. I mean, my dog is scared going outside and wanna stay inside our room all day because of the aircon. And for some reason I find it so dumb that they can't even tell that it is Cat poop not dog.",
            "Sometimes I feel guilty when I have to do errands or go to work.  When I want to spend every second with my dog. \n \n[2016](https://i.imgur.com/jlDExDy.jpeg)\n\n[2024](https://i.imgur.com/OlD46Pc.jpeg)",
            "Trying to adopt a new puppy... OMG when did this become so hard. The rescues are all crazy. I have spent 1-2 hours filling our adoption forms for rescue and they say \"we will not contact you if you are not accepted\". If you are interested in multiple dogs you have to fill out MULTIPLE applications. Some of them want an application fee PER puppy you are interested in. Like what? 1 1/2 hours to fill your form out, pay you money and you won't even call me to tell me if I am chosen or not. \n\nI have EVERYTHING they want: Own my home, fully fenced yard on .66 acres, not one but 2 people work from home, experienced dog owner, former foster mom with a rescue, complete vet history... I am a complete package and I can't get the time of day from rescue. Who ARE they adopting to?\n\nThis is a huge issue: \n\n1. The lack of response from these rescues creates a situation where you have to use a shotgun approach to hope to get a dog. Apply to many dog rescue in hopes they will adopt one to you. \n\n2. Creates a sense of urgency leading to FOMO when you see a dog you like... Oh I better get an app in now... Leading to a less thoughtful approach. You are less likely to turn down a dog you might not be vibing with because you feel like you can't get anything else... \n\n3. It means that people who have the money may move to a \"Sure thing\" like purchasing rather than jump hoops without any feedback.\n\nI have adopted from and been a foster for a stringent rescue. I don't mind the hoops... but this process bothers me. In the past the rescues I worked with would contact you. It was \"you get approved, we help find you a dog\" When did we go to this \"our dogs are rock stars and only one lucky person will get a back stage pass\". You need to get past our security staff attitude? I am willing to wait if I know they will adopt to me when the right dogs comes... but doesn't this whole thing make it take longer? EACH dog they have to start the adopter pool at zero with home visits etc? \n\nAnyway... I now am going to a shelter adoption event tomorrow, where I better be in line early, in the hopes I can get a puppy from them.",
            "My dog is the same, she only tears into soft toys because they're easy to gnaw through and take the guts out of. She can tear through a soft toy in the length of a zoom call. I am looking for the answer to this question also... and I don't even work.",
            "This totally sucks, there is no getting around that. But kudos for recognizing and taking action to find a home that suits her better. I had a foster that I fully intended to keep but after a few months I realized he was too much for me to handle alone at that point in my life. I found the most amazing couple who gave him a life I could never had provided. We stayed in touch over the years and it was so heartwarming to see how he was meant to be their dog. I don't know if this is possible, but maybe see if your info can be given to the dog's new adopters, or have a letter that is passed along. It may not help in this particular moment but can help you be confident in your choice later on.",

            "Not sure how a megathread works, but here we go:\n\nFor context, my Dad and I went to a nearby shelter to adopt a puppy. We saw her picture on the website and thought she\u2019d be a good fit for the family. I was 15 years old when we brought her home. She was a black and white mixed breed and was with us for 14 years. Yesterday, we had to say goodbye. It happened so suddenly. She was her normal self and then by the evening, became extremely lethargic. I monitored her into the early mornings hours until she violently vomited and fell over. I woke my dad and told him we needed to take her to an emergency vet. After being checked over, turns out she had a spleen tumor that ruptured. She had internal bleeding (hemoabdomen) and either needed emergency surgery or had to be put down. The third temporary option was to give her a Chinese herbal supplement known to slow/stop internal bleeding. We decided to go that route because we needed time to process this heavy news. As the hours went by, she was bedridden, could not get up, and was breathing/panting extremely hard. We were hoping for a miraculous turn around, but at this point, we knew she was suffering. We believed she was too old and weak for surgery.\n\nI\u2019m 28 years old now and I moved back in with my parents because I lost my job. They are divorced and have been for most of my life. My dad never remarried, so this dog was everything to him. He soon retired after getting her, and spent most of his retirement with her by his side. They moved to three different states and she\u2019s been there through many phases of life. I loved her too and while I wasn\u2019t with her as much, I\u2019m grateful I had this past year to be with her under the same roof.\n\nMy heart hurts not only because I miss her, but for my dad. He struggles with depression and I\u2019m worried for his wellbeing after this tough loss. I guess the purpose of this winded post is for words of encouragement and positive vibes. We\u2019ve lost pets before, but he had such a strong connection to this one. It\u2019s the day after and the house feels so empty. It\u2019s the little reminders everywhere\ud83d\ude2a"

With the female we will do the same and she will often just look at you with this serious face lol. Both are retrievers. Amazing dogs and spoiled beyond belief. The funny thing is we will be doing the above eith our girl and she just sits there almost annoyed and then when we get out to the car, to the trails for a hike, etc she instantly starts \"smiling\" wagging her tail etc. Does anyone else have experience with this. We always say she is a brat. If we aren't doing what she wants to do she's very serious lol",

She wouldn\u2019t let me stop either and put the paw on my arm again and again. \n\nThen the dog crapped on the carpet. She was desperately trying to tell me she needed to go out.",

            "One is that she's 11 months old.  I've found that some teenage dogs have a \"Mooommmm, stop it!\" attitude about cuddles.  \n\nI had a smooth collie girl, Zeffie, and one of her nicknames was  \"Spock Collie\".  She was a serious dog but she showed her love very subtle ways.  Such as laying close to, but not touching, me.  If she didn't love me, she would have gone down into the basement where it was cooler. I was deeply moved by this show of affection.   \n\nZeffie also showed her tight bond with me by being incredibly reliable.  I showed her in obedience/agility/herding and she made me look good.   I also showed Dino and Pablo with less success.  They needed my clear headed, calm handling or they would mess up. Unfortunately they had me.  \n\nI'm a crappy handler and I would often get ring nerves.  Tension runs down the leash and if I was nervous, Dino or Pablo would fall aapart.  \n\nIf I my brain glitched and not likely to get back online, Zeffie would, figurative, look up, realize that \"Pablois4 has gone bye-bye\" and proceed to get the job done.  I called Zeffie my obedience guide dog.  I recall two judges - one said \"fantastic working dog, too bad about the hander\" and one looked at me directly and stated \"that dog saved your bacon.\"\n\nMy friends said that it was Zeffie was the one who needed to look at the agility course map.  I'm a worse handler in agility than obedience and that's saying something.  So in the agility ring, I'd  run in circles, waving my arms like a demented windmill and yell \"tunnel! I meant teeter! Left! The other left!\".   After one run, my instructor asked me what I was thinking.  That's the trouble, I wasn't.  \n\nZeffie, somehow,  was able to decipher my bug eyed babbling and a remarkable number of times, did the course correctly.  She even got placements. \n\nMy boy collies have been lovey, dovey sweethearts and never cared if I don't know what I'm doing half the time.  My girls looked at me with clear eyes, and even with all my faults and foibles, still loved me.  Or maybe they just accept that this was their lot in life and had to make the best of it.",
