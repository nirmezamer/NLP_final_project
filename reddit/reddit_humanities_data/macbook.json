            "This makes me sad when niche subs do this as it really stifles already limited conversation. This sub \"is what it is\" - a sub specifically about macbooks. Many niche subs do this and it baffles me. A mobile game I play just did this for questions on how to improve the characters. Before a mod manually deletes the \"illegal\" threads there's usually 5+ comments on how to actually improve, even if the thread is at an average of 0 votes. Once the person reposts in the mega thread they're basically living in a ghost town of such mega thread as only the most hardcore posters peep their heads in 'em.\n\nI took at look at the top posts from this week and they're all....broken screen related. If those were to get filtered as well then it gets to an OSX-related question that just happened ot happen on a macbook. \n\nWhat I'm typing is these \"what should I buy?\" threads are so minor...let them run free. Else, I already know what's going to happen; there will be less activity with further days between posts, and less personal conversation as again, *there's only so much you can chat about regarding a macbook*\n\n\"Oh yea look at my macbook that I'm still using from 2009.\"",
            "Hello, \n\nI'm a Computer Science student and I'm looking for a replacement for my old windows machine. I need something that portable (I need to bring it to classes) but also powerful enough for my workload. I don't need a big storage cause I keep my files on external storage either way. Recently, I'm interested in MacBook Air M2 8/256GB. I'm going to use the machine mostly for web development and maybe little bit of movies on my spare time.\n\nIf there's any web dev here, I would really appreciate any suggestions and recommendations. Thanks.",
            "I understand that the question is a buzzkill since it\u2019s asked often\u2026\n\nI\u2019m a soon-to-be graduate MA student studying online in Education. I\u2019m looking at a mixture of videoconferencing and asynchronous content, and the program is very writing heavy.\n\nShould I purchase a MBA specced with 16gb ram and standard storage, or is it overkill with greater memory in areas that aren\u2019t CS, STEM, or arts?",
            "I bought the iPad Pro M4 with gift cards. I don\u2019t know if I Should I sell it and get a MacBook Pro M3 or MacBook Air M3?\n\nI have the Apple Pencil Pro( still returnable to Apple) and I might get the Magic Keyboard for writing. Does it make sense to get a MacBook if the prices come out similar to a MacBook? Plus I want to get AppleCare\n\n\n\nI could sell it on eBay or Swappa\nWeb browsing \nListening to music\nXbox game pass\nPlayStation remote\nWriting",
            "I'm in desperate need of an upgrade to an Apple MacBook - it works within my ecosystem; I have an iPhone and iPad. I'm a graphic designer using Photoshop, illustrator, InDesign and I dabble in small projects on After Effects and basic blender; am looking for fast performance and ability to have multiple programmes at once.\n\nAfter a lot of research I am torn between M1 and M3. There doesn't seem to be massive difference but I wanted to ask this community with more insight then me. I'm leaning towards M1 but can't seem to find any in the UK that are not refurbished. I've never brought anything refurbished before so any advice on that would also be great!",
            "After using my old Macbook Pro for 4+ years, it\u2019s time for me to upgrade.\n\nI currently have the 2018 Macbook Pro with i7 and 16GB of RAM. Overall it\u2019s working decent, but recently I\u2019ve noticed it\u2019s having a bit more trouble to run smoothly with more demanding tasks, and the fan is making a lot of noise because of it.\n\nI use my laptop a lot (avg. around 9 hours a day) so I don\u2019t want to make any concessions on performance. But I don\u2019t want to unnecessarily overspend either.\n\nI use my laptop both for business and personal use.\n\n**Business:**\n\n* \u2018Regular\u2019 browsing. But I usually have 30-40 tabs open\n* Google Spreadsheets. Often bigger documents with 10,000-20,000+ rows, formulas, etc.\n* Facebook Ads Manager. This one seem to be quite demanding for my current laptop\n* HTML: I make landing pages in HTML editors. Never big documents though (mostly pretty basic landing pages)\n* Shopify\n* Image & video editing in Canva (browser version at the moment). If it\u2019s video, it\u2019s usually short videos, 1 minute or so\n* Email, calendar, Skype, Slack, WhatsApp, the usual stuff. I always have everything open\n\n**Personal use:**\n\n* I watch a lot of videos/series on my laptop\n* Regular browsing\n\nThe two options for me are the Macbook Air M3 15 inch (24GB, 512GB) or the Macbook Pro M3 16 inch (36GB, 512GB). Both have pros and cons for me.\n\n**Macbook Air:**  \n+ Lightweight/smaller, so easier to carry around/work from different places  \n+ Cheaper  \n- Smaller screen  \n- Less RAM, so maybe not as future proof?  \n- No active cooling (and thus less performance?)  \n  \n**Macbook Pro**  \n+ Bigger & better screen  \n+ Better performance  \n- Some people complain about eye strain with this particular screen?  \n- I\u2019ve read some issues with the SSD getting 13V and basically killing the whole machine (although I guess this is rare?)  \n- Expensive\n\nI guess the first and most important question is: will the Macbook Air run all my tasks without any issues for at least the next 4 years? If that\u2019s not the case, the Pro will probably be my best bet. If it will, I guess it comes down to weighing down the pros and cons for myself.",
            "Is it worth it to get a refurbished macbook before wwdc? I don't have a reason to get an M4 max or anything crazy - mainly asking for potential price drops on past models or trade in values. \n\nMy daily windows laptop is finally on the fritz and I'm hoping to get a macbook soon (been wanting to switch for years). Wondering if the timing's right.\n\nMostly debating between an M1, M2 or M3 right now",
            "Hey folks,\n\nNeed some quick advice. I am looking to get a Macbook 16 M3 Pro base model.\n\nCore intention being programming (Xcode, Flutter and maybe a little bit of Unity)\n\nIn my country (SG) Apple lists an M3 Pro 16\u201d for S$3632. I have two options right now:\nM3 Pro 16 for $3327 silver or $3427 (black l)\nM2 Pro 16 for $2900.\n\nThe M2 pro is almost a 20% discount vs apple. Any thoughts or advice? From what I\u2019m understanding, I\u2019m missing out on 2GB ram and minor efficiency upgrades. But the savings are pretty steep.",
            "Hey everyone!\n\nSo I'm gonna come across a bit of spare money and i kind of need to change my macbook air early 2015. It's been used almost 24/7, played games, got knocked over everywhere in his 9 years. He also mined some cpu based crypto for fun running at 98\u00b0C for weeks 24/7.\n\nHe still runs fine but so hot playing even football manager or just watching netflix on chrome. Battery cycle count is at 3000+\n\nI mainly need a macbook for day to day use (some excel, word, reddit, movies) but I also want to be able to play games (LoL, FM, etc...). It's mainly multimedia, but I sometimes need to use software to manage music library (8k+ tracks, using MusicBrainz) that can be heavy when analyzing all that.\n\nI think tops I would spend would be between 1400/1700e.\n\nWhat would you recommend ? Thanks!\n\nEDIT: I'm also going to upgrade my iPhone 12 Pro as it got wrecked almost a year ago and could break at any point as the chips on the back for some are visible (if you know of any deals where I could upgrade macbook + iphone 15 pro)",
            "Hi all! I\u2019m currently running my early 2015 MacBook Pro for all day telehealth video calls (google meet), multiple programs/windows, multiple tabs, etc etc. Because of my job the security updates ending is a problem, and the fan is working hard at times to keep things cool. We\u2019ve had a good run, but it\u2019s probably time to retire this laptop to occasional personal stuff. \n\nI currently have: MacBook Pro 13in early 2015 3.1 GHz dual core intel core i7 16GB 500GB flash storage. \n\nI was considering the M3 MacBook Pro or MacBook Air, both with \n\n8core CPU 10core GPU 16core neural engine 16GB 1TB \n\nA lot has changed since my current MacBook Pro. I feel like I might be in overkill territory with what I\u2019m looking at. What do you think?"

Y\u2019all are acting like you don\u2019t understand how businesses work. Do you refuse to buy from a supermarket because they pay \u00a31.50 for an item and sell it for \u00a33? No. You don\u2019t. This is how every business model works, so I don\u2019t understand why everyone is acting shocked.

After much research I went with the Air M3 16gb RAM 512SSD with a 13\u2019 display. I am beyond excited but also feel almost guilty? This is the most money I\u2019ve ever spent on something in my life and it hurts in a way. I plan to keep this for as long as possible and use it to maybe go back to school and also learn programming and even photoshop or video editing. I dont know how I haven\u2019t had a half decent computer once in my whole life but this is the first time ever to own something premium. I hope this sparks my interest to learn many new things and hopefully help me get a career in working with computers like software/IT/Computer science? I still haven\u2019t made up my mind but now I have the tools to learn. Also If need be I may get a windows computer as well but I hope this will suffice and I am excited to learn a whole new operating system! I went with the starlight color. Did I make a good choice? My mind is all over the place lol!",
