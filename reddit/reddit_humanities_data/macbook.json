            "I'm in desperate need of an upgrade to an Apple MacBook - it works within my ecosystem; I have an iPhone and iPad. I'm a graphic designer using Photoshop, illustrator, InDesign and I dabble in small projects on After Effects and basic blender; am looking for fast performance and ability to have multiple programmes at once.\n\nAfter a lot of research I am torn between M1 and M3. There doesn't seem to be massive difference but I wanted to ask this community with more insight then me. I'm leaning towards M1 but can't seem to find any in the UK that are not refurbished. I've never brought anything refurbished before so any advice on that would also be great!",
            "I'm looking for 60 **new Macbooks in box** suitable for giveaways for someone like Mr Beast. Any links or reply with quote. Probably M2 minimum.",
            "Looking into a macbook . I tended to like to go a bit overpowered so it last as useable . My uses are word processing web surfing and casual gaming (dont really need the highest end games ) I had ordered an air M3 8 core cpu, 10 core gpu , 16 nerural engine and 24 gb ram but was told they have heat issue and should go With a pro so I cancelled . I value a bigger screen and note that a 16 inch pro is more the pen 1k more then a maxed out air \n\nprimary goal get a good value mac book with a bit bigger screen",
            "Is $1700 for a refurbished M1 Max, 32-core GPU/32 GB/1 TB a good deal? Its primarily for music production but I am also looking at GPU intensive tasks.",
            "I just made the jump from an android phone to an Iphone. I'm in need a macbook to replace my chromebook. It would strictly be for web browsing and using google docs. Using iMessage from the browser is an absolute must. Text messaging from my chromebook, or any browser for that matter, is the number one feature I miss most from my android device. What's the absolute cheapest macbook I can get that would be the equivilant to a moderatly price chromebook? Thank you.",
            "I thought I saw a crazy like $600 promo going on for a macbook air but I cant find it anyone know what im talking about?",
            "Hey, I am completely new to Apple Products always having been skeptical of their business practices and the high price. I would however like to give them an honest try. I am looking for a cheap used macbook that I can buy that would allow me to take a sneak peak at the apple experience.   \n  \nMy intended uses for the device would be internet browsing, Streaming of 1080p Video content on YT/Twitch, and some light gaming.",
            "honestly, I don't think the ramp upgrade is that necessary unless you're editing long 4k video or coding and stuff like that\n\nI use my m3 512 8gb air for everything, photoshop, watching shows, web browsing, editing short videos, and it takes it all without a problem. as a test, I opened every app, editing software, and opened like 15 YouTube tabs and 10 reddit tabs. tried editing a video with all that open and it did it no problem, got slightly warm but it didn't throttle or slow down. I would recommend upgrading storage instead because the new 256 gb ssd that apple uses in their airs are slow, so upgrade to 512 and most people should be perfect with that",
            "# M3 15 inch 256 16 gb or 512 8gb ram?\n\nI'm a software developer.",
            "Hi all! I am trying to figure out which MacBook to get. I am a software engineer and am interested in learning some 3D modeling with blender, and also working in VR/AR development with Xcode and Unity. I would be doing some of the work on this laptop, but I have another laptop with a better graphics card and more of want something to travel with as my other laptop is pretty clunky. Would a MacBook work for this? If so, would an M3 air w/ 16 gb ram & 512 gb storage be good enough?"

            "I dont understand why everyone is acting all righteous in this comment section. There is absolutely nothing wrong with what this person is doing. Youre telling me that if you were in need of a cash boost and saw some deals on macs that would make you money you wouldnt resell for more? Yall are acting like you dont understand how businesses work. Do you refuse to buy from a supermarket because they pay 1.50 for an item and sell it for 3? No. You dont. This is how every business model works, so I dont understand why everyone is acting shocked. Do you think the pawnshop OP bought one of these from paid the previous owner $750 and then sold it to OP for $750? No.",

            "So you manage to find those macbooks for a good price regularly? You have a constant source for that or you just look for them in different places?",
            "How did you steal all of those without getting caught?? Do you just run out of the caf or you sleep with them and run out with their Macs? Just curious. Thanks in advance!",
            "Damn homie, nice finds! Those are truly beautiful",
            "Nice job lad, you saw an opportunity and you grabbed it... if I got this same chance I'll do the same and ensure I watch out for more next time... cheers man...",

        "content": "Hello Apple family! I just purchased my first ever apple computer and also the first computer ive had in over 10 years! After much research I went with the Air M3 16gb RAM 512SSD with a 13\u2019 display. I am beyond excited but also feel almost guilty? This is the most money I\u2019ve ever spent on something in my life and it hurts in a way. I plan to keep this for as long as possible and use it to maybe go back to school and also learn programming and even photoshop or video editing. I dont know how I haven\u2019t had a half decent computer once in my whole life but this is the first time ever to own something premium. I hope this sparks my interest to learn many new things and hopefully help me get a career in working with computers like software/IT/Computer science? I still haven\u2019t made up my mind but now I have the tools to learn. Also If need be I may get a windows computer as well but I hope this will suffice and I am excited to learn a whole new operating system! I went with the starlight color. Did I make a good choice? My mind is all over the place lol!",

            "Suboptimal design in my opinion. The screen is thick and the overall MacBook is also quite thick and heavy. It's not possible to open the lid with just one hand like earlier models. I bought it because it doesn't have a Touch Bar, but that's a trade-off. However, I'm satisfied with the performance thanks to the 16GB of RAM and don't regret the purchase.",
            "Thats awesome! My good friend got the same Pro as you and loves his, he is part of the reason I got a Mac, seeing how much he loves his and his last Mac lasted him 10 years and still works well!",

            "Apple has some products that we all know shouldnt be priced that high. Just look at the magic cloth as well, you get a piece of cloth for $20 to clean your macbook display. Apple does this for the company meaning of royalty, granted they are way more affordable than what they were 15+ years ago. But items like these are psychologically/PR boosts because if you are extremely wealthy and know Apple only makes quality then you are more likely to buy it.",

I called apple support and they asked me to update my OS. \n\nDays after, after doing my quiz, it continuously restarts and when I try to log in I am stuck on the log in window. I called apple again and we did the 3 basic software rebooting but still not working. So, I was advised to get the hardware checked.\n\nI went to the nearest apple repair center, and they ran a diagnostic, and the report shows that there\u2019s no issue in the hardware. But there\u2019s an issue with the software.\n\nNow, the engr. advised that it would cost 40,000 PHP minimum estimate (approx 684 USD) for a repair.\n\nI\u2019m confused and frustrated at the same time. Since I know that @apple has an on-going issues regarding the touch bar. \n\nIf the diagnostic test showed issues regarding the software, why should I pay almost half the cost of the new one?\n\nI\u2019m in college right now, and I only use it mostly for home-works and zoom. It\u2019s 512GB and I\u2019ve only used less 150GB. My daily usage average to 2 hours only and I do not bring it to school as I have my iPad. \n\nPlease help tech geeks out there.",
