            "Okay so this may be a lengthy post and may not be articulate but need to get this off my chest.\n\nI am 33 this year, always been employed since I was 18, never any gaps, never been sacked either. Unfortunately I have always been resigned to jobs that are low end that other people refuse to do thus have been treated with a total lack of decency and respect. \n\nI was with my previous employer since 2012 until 2022 at a supermarket, unfortunately I never did anything other than working the tills and trolley collection which wont look very good on my CV and as a referree. I left my job to go to a new place thinking I would start fresh and maybe have a better time where I could improve but nope as usual, the curse that has followed me around all my life has happened again.\n\nI work for a medium sized catering company and despite knowing how to operate different machinery and know how to work their till systems im mostly stuck up unloading deliveries and dish washing which I might add nobody else does and outright refuses to do when asked by manager. Anyway im constantly being singled out, I think the problem is one of two things, im placid and kind of quiet and tend to just get on with stuff, on the other hand there are a few work colleagues who dont like me and think im worthless and they dictate to the manager who is to do the undesirable jobs.\n\nOkay so I am aware whoever reads this may think I have some faults which I do as many others do but Im confident in my ability to do other things and I have , the problem is nobody seems to take me serious. I get passed over and underhanded a lot and also when I raise these concerns I get told things will improve but they never do and now im at the point of either going off due to stress or just straight up quitting. \n\nThere are two new employees who have started off working with me but now they have been assigned to different things and I am left doing the work of two people on my own because nobody seems to want to work with me. I have experience and im capable of a lot more than my employer/colleagues are letting on. I am feeling completely alienated and defeated in how I have been and currently being treated, seems Im always going to be resigned to pick up the shit that nobody else wants to do and I am at the end of my tether with it.\n\nHow the hell to deal with and get out of this messed up situation?",

Like if you've worked at small stores in the past, but they weren't large high street brands? I don't really have any metrics, didn't really have things like customer satisfaction surveys, health inspection scores, error rates or even yearly evaluations. So what do I do there?\n\nI'm looking to get into a retail position at a larger high street store, so I wanna write the best CV possible. Can anyone give me any advice on this when it comes to 'metrics'? Or maybe share a good example of a CV that got you a retail position at one of these stores?

Haven't worked since 2019 as I was essentially kept home by abusive family as a carer for an ill relative. A lovely kind friend offered me a place to stay in Cardiff so have got out, moved here and am now looking for work. The issue is that the gap in my CV is huge and all the people who I would have used as a reference have moved on (my last employer actually doesn't exist anymore). No degree, only admin work experience (2 x private healthcare, 1 x telecomms). \n\nI am desperate to get back into full time admin work.

            "This is my current CV design:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/ooSxYiq\n\nI have some worries about it, and about how it might change in the future:\n\n**1. Most impressive job being made less prominent by more recent low-level jobs?**\n\nI have had one job that I would call at all senior or technical. I was at a big international company (let's call them... South American Rainforest River Online) from 2012, initially in the warehouse. Then in 2015 I was promoted into a newly-formed office department. This job started off as what they call \"Tier III\", but at one point everyone in the department was promoted to Tier IV (without any change in duties or responsibilities) to better represent the seniority involved.\n\nOn my CV, I have devoted plenty of space on the first page to it: both those job titles (and their dates), a few lines at the start to explain the department's overall duties, then more bullet-points explaining what the job involved (things like: making quick decisions by assessing data on changing situations; remote communication; understanding how in-house tools interacted with back-end systems). Plus one thing that I think I can list as a personal achievement beyond the core duties (\"Initiated the creation of the department's Intranet Wiki pages, including the incorporation of internal tools\").\n\nThe problem is that this is likely to be the best-paid, highest-responsibility, most-technical job I will have for the foreseeable future. I am unlikely to be going into that field again, so I need to devote space to explaining what the job involved because it's not obvious from the title. It taught me a lot about what I definitely *don't* want to do in a job, and killed my confidence in things that I'm weak at (\"multitasking\", \"prioritising competing demands\" and \"time management under pressure\" - which, unfortunately, are all phrases that appear in a lot of job adverts).\n\nSo, I'm worried about future, less-impressive jobs that I might have reducing the space available for this section. Already, I only have space to add a line or two before the Tier I warehouse job title will get pushed onto page 2, and I don't want my employment at one company to be spread over two pages like that. (I worry that my time at that company is already potentially confusing enough - listing different job titles and their dates, within my overall 2012-2019 time at that company - without making it more confusing by splitting it over two pages!)\n\nIs this something to be concerned about, or am I worrying about nothing?\n\n**2. Prominence of objective experience vs subjective skills**\n\nThe other problem is that I had a real sense of impostor syndrome during my time there. I feel that I was hired there by luck (hearing the news about the new department's formation through being in the right place at the right time), and that I was only kept there so long because I was one of the first hired, and while they were expanding rapidly they needed all the staff they could get. When things had settled down and processes were standardised etc, I was put on a performance improvement plan and was ultimately unsuccessful, and fired.\n\nSo I have this horrible combination of wanting to show off the objective duties of the job, because they sound impressive - but doing so in a way that doesn't lie about me actually being any good at them! I'm comfortable listing the duties that I've done in my job history, and my degree and school grades; but I'm very insecure about moving subjective skills right to the top of my CV, into the personal statement. So the things that I consider subjective or generic are kept on the second page, in a \"Skills and Experience\" section.\n\nThis is exactly the issue that happened when I recently contacted the National Careers Service, who edited my CV and sent me this revised version ( https://imgur.com/a/JTacF4g ) that made all the changes that I'm uncomfortable with:\n\n* They expanded the personal statement at the top with subjective/generic things from the \"Skills and Experience\" section, that I'm kind of ashamed of having to put on my CV at all (\"Excellent literacy and numeracy, and a reliable communicator of information. A dedicated and responsible worker with a systematic and objective approach to problem-solving.\")\n* Moved the \"Skills and Experience\" section to the top, above my job history. I don't like this because I don't think stuff like \"Familiar with MS World and Excel\", and a note about MATLAB and HTML/CSS that I haven't used in nearly 20 years, are impressive enough to go at the top!\n* These changes pushed the 2012-2019 employer down the page, splitting it across two pages.\n\nThey also minimised the top and bottom margins, which helps fit more on the first page, but it means that some text might now be in the printer-unsafe region.\n\nHow would you recommend balancing what I'm comfortable with, with the things that the National Careers Service recommend?",
            "Metrics only matter if they're relevant. Are you applying for retail positions? If so, previous retail is enough, whatever the scale."

I\u2019ve got to the point where I\u2019m not either willing, in the right frame of mind or just plain exhausted to be sitting in front of a screen doing hours of training so I\u2019ve asked at work if I can have time allocated to do this training while at work. The answer was a maybe if it\u2019s quiet, which given staffing levels it rarely is. Now, my opinion on this is that if this training is compulsory to the role, shouldn\u2019t they be providing in work training time to complete this, or at the very least provide financial compensation if you do it in your own time? Personally I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an unreasonable request as pretty much every previous job I\u2019ve had all compulsory training was done in the workplace.

It\u2019s also a good one as it gives you the chance to tailor what you\u2019re saying to suit your strengths and experiences, rather than only going off the questions they ask you.\n\nGive it some thought, but if you decide you\u2019re not able to do this be aware it will probably stop you getting a large chunk of jobs. \n\nAlso how do you cope in the workplace if you can\u2019t present at all?",
            "2 days is loads of time to put together a presentation and it's a pretty standard thing to do at an interview and in a job.\n\nYou should probably just drop out of this application.",
            "Then you arn\u2019t the person to work for that firm.\n\nThey have a set of skills they are looking for to fulfil that roll, you aren\u2019t willing to supply them.\n\nIt\u2019s the same as trying to put a square peg in a round hole",
            "Don\u2019t think of it as presenting, think of it as a chat about what you know. \n\nBut put it this way, if you pull out, you 100% won\u2019t get the job. That\u2019s not the case if you do the presentation. And it\u2019s practice. \n\nMy tip.. print and staple the slides for you and the panel. Technology might not work and it\u2019ll end up being a chat about a document.",
            "If you have nothing by to lose but experience to gain do it. The people will be nervous to.",
            "Haven't given one in a few years haha. So I'm nervous",
            "Thanks for being kind. I suffer from anxiety and had a freak out this morning"
