            "I feel like at this point Adobe engineers have read this thread, and they'd be like \"yeah, we find ways to stop new users pirating the apps.\" Their program gets better at detecting unusual inputs/changes that's why I see some comments saying they fail cracked it recently or found new alerts or stuff alike. \n\nThere is a reason why Adobe CC is 100 bucks per month -- to pay those insanely smart engineers so they can outsmart those \"pirate\" programmers, then those engineers who know how to write pirating programs need to level up with the new updates from Adobe engineers. \n\nThe cycle doesn't end. I guess, people who can successfully pirate Adobe CC needs to keep learning and updating stuff. Who can easily do that? programmers. For regular people (not tech savvy), it might take some time to invest in those things, and most people don't want that coz it can be a lot of effort. \n\nAdobe is weirdly greedy as well. I cant blame them or those pirating programmers.",
