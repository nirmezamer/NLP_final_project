Just received my report card for DP1 and I am wondering if I should even keep going! \n\nI\u2019m in IB certificates because I thought it would help with the stress levels but boy was I wrong! \n\nI want to major in Biology, then going forwards to doing my Master\u2019s or PhD in Astrobiology. \n\nHere are my grades:\n\nBiology HL - Semester grade: 7 , Mock exam grade: 7 \n\nChemistry HL - Semester grade: 3, Mock exam: 3 (I was 1 point away from passing fml)\n\nPsychology HL - Semester grade: 5, Mock exam: N/A (teacher was absent last 2 months of school, taking it in September) \n\nEnglish Lang and Lit SL - Semester grade: 4, Mock exam: 6 (I don\u2019t understand why she would give me a 4 when the latest grades I got were 5 and 6) \n\nMath AA SL - Semester grade: 4, Mock exam: 3\n\nSince I got a 3 in chem, I have to resit it in September, yippee! Im sorry if this post was hard to understand\u2026\n\nPlease let me know if I\u2019ll have any luck getting into a good university with these grades. \n\nEdit: I should\u2019ve mentioned that I haven\u2019t been in school for the past 3 months due to medical reasons. I will definitely do better next school year and my effort or studying habits aren\u2019t really the core issue. I\u2019ve just been at home without any guidance or support from my school, resulting in crappy grades. I just wanna know if im cooked even if I do a lot better next year. ",

            "I understand the struggle totally about getting low grades for chemistry (dw I was like that back in DP1). But I recommend getting a personalised tutor that can target your strengths and weaknesses. Same with mathematics and do lotta ppqs to improve ur approach in exams.\n\nAlso I recommend watching Richard Thornley and MSJChem for additional guidance for chemistry. Hope this helps and congrats on Biology, 7 in HL is super impressive . Dont worry abt if youre cooked next year, dont give up!",
