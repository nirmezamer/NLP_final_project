            "Not sure what to make of the leaks. If they end up cancelling the TZ2 exams (which I believe are the only ones that got leaked), I hope they do it sooner rather than later so I don't spend my time cramming for 4 exams over the weekend. Even if they give us our predicted grades as our final IB grades, I feel like it would be wasted effort (although my predicteds are 100% better than what I'm doing on the exams atp). But if they don't cancel the exams, the grade boundaries are gonna be taller than the Burj Khalifa, and my grades are gonna be shit on a shingle on the ground floor. \n\nThe absolute WORST case scenario though, is they ask for screenshots of our internet history to prove we're innocent, and the IB will be aware of all of our preferences in adult-oriented content, as well as the time I googled 'how to get rid of back acne'.\n\nGood luck, guys. I'm gonna watch a hitler documentary and go to bed.",

But how can they expect that leaking would be welcome by the general ib community? Are they really idiots? Don't they understand that such a violation is a catastrophe for the students themselves?"

            "I try to take advantage of the time I have at school. I'm a lot like you where I just cannot focus when studying at home, especially if I'm studying in my room, so I do most of my studying at school during lunch breaks, study halls, etc. I also try my best to not slack of when I'm given work periods during class and I just overall try to fit as much studying as possible during school hours. If that's not possible, going to a library, moving to a different room, or changing your environment in other ways can help get you in the zone when studying.\n\nAlso, remember to take breaks when studying! I've studied for hours with no breaks before and by the end all I've achieved is burning myself out and I haven't retained any of the information. The [pomodoro method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique#Description) could be useful for this, but I haven't tried it myself so I can't say if it actually works or not. Of course, what you do during your breaks is also important. I usually just walk away from the table and get a snack or walk around in circles in my room for about 5 minutes before getting back to work. Whatever you do, it's probably best to avoid things like social media or video games when studying.\n\nOne last thing to keep in mind is that you're going to have days where you don't want to study. I find that studying when I'm burned out only drains me even more and I end up getting less work done than if I had just studied later when I have more motivation. Of course, if you constantly feel burned out then it might be good to change something about your routine, but it's perfectly fine and normal to have a day every once in a while where you just don't want to do work.\n\n(P.S. all of this comes from my own experiences and it's possible that something that worked for me isn't going to work for you, so please try to find your own techniques as well)\n\nHopefully some of this can help you with your studying habits!",
