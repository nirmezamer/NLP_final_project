        "content": "Had two separate games today where I played Wraith King safelane into a pos 3 Enigma. The eidolons do so, so much damage and when the wave inevitably gets shoved under my tower and eidolons are tower diving me I had to back and miss the wave or else die.\n\n\nIn both games I jungled/rotated as soon as I got phase boots and ended up winning both games, but I still lost my lane both times. I don\u2019t have too much experience with enigma - is there a way to deal with this while laning? It feels sooo strong and hard to play against in the very early laning stage.\n\n\nDivine 3 btw",

            "You would need a lot of wave clear to consistently deal with eidolons. I think other than Sven or Zeus, perhaps with a Rubick supp, that's very hard. Even those should have a hard time early levels.",
            "You\u2019re not dealing with eidolons as a wk in lane. That\u2019s something for your support to do, either way getting out of lane as early you can to farm jungle is still the probably the best play you can do",
            "as a enigma player melee cores cant really do anything vs eidolons, if you try ill just micro them back and use stun, so unless you have a support with aoe stun like lion its pretty mutch impossible lane. best tip is probably leave lane as soon as possible its not worth it cus i will deny every single creep at lvl 3 and forward"

            "I play a lot of LD, the answer is, you need a gank. otherwise it's gg",
            "By picking the correct Facet. Lvl 4 wolves severely lower the atk speed of the bear. Together with Helm of Dom and Lycan Ult, you should be able to overpower LD who did not keep a skill point to be added unto Ult or Savage Roar for scenarios where he is ganked on, or to dispel the bear (by levelling up the bear).\n\nAlso, just ignore LD and gank other lanes. Some heroes just have a better power spike if left unchecked in the lane, and you shouldn't just be stubborn about it to stick around to hope something will change, unless you have useful teammates that want to gank to change that.",
            "U cant do much as lycan. It\u2019s essentially 2 universal heroes last hitting against 1. There are easier laning matchups like lina who can hit the bear for free and secure cs with nukes, but lycan pretty much has to gank other lanes with his 6.",

        "content": "In my games we finally win a team fight, the entire team decides to either split up and try to push tower in different lanes or back to jungle farm. In both cases we don\u2019t end up getting a tower because the enemy still has 1 or 2 heroes up and us splitting makes things so much harder. I\u2019m wondering why do people want to split up all the time? Is it the right move and I\u2019m just the idiot who thinks staying together we are stronger and can actually push. Whereas if we split we are prone to be picked off and weaker? ",

            "It depends. There are some timings where you have enough firepower to kill all of them, but not enough to siege high ground. For example, your carry may have identified an enemy who could be a potential threat and he has worked out an item that will eliminate that threat in advance (e.g. an enemy necro who hasn\u2019t gotten big yet but your carry wants to get nullifier or skadi in advance). In that case, you might have to let him farm for it before attempting high ground. However, there are some players who just want to be 5-slotted at least before pushing. So, it really boils down to good communication and one-ness in goals and your \u2018road\u2019 to achieving that goal.",
            "Sometimes I make my way to ancient while 1 or 2 are still farming, then throw the game and they get so pissed lol. Some people avoid fighting and at the end glorify themselves on higher gold or low deaths, like thats what matters.",
            "Ideally you want to do a bit of both. Splitting up allows you as a team to get more gold and exp out of the map but as you say it leaves people exposed to being picked off. However If you always stay together  you will fall behind in exp and gold compared to a team that it all farming separately (unless your opponents are dumb enough to keep walking into you) as youll be sharing exp and contesting each others farm all the time. So yea its all about finding a balance.\n\nId say in generally you want to split up to push the lanes out when you know where the enemy is and come together when you either don't know where they are or when you do and are ready to make a smoke play or something.",
            "Nice answer thanks, especially the part with gem, is rarely use it except when invis hero on enemy team",
            "I think the hardest reason to keep a status que in game state that is in your favor is simply the attention span and thirst for engagements of most players (most notably your own team). Most players have a \"I want to win NOW\" mentality even though the better play could be to just split the map, farm, and keep the enemy in their base. Some people literally choose to never play this way even though it is often times the best play.",
            "Onlyfans",
            "In theory if you control more of the map than your opponent, you are getting more gold than them. If your opponent is stuck in their triangle while you farm both jungles, then the onus is on *them* to move out, not necessarily for you to move in. The status quo benefits you, and you don\u2019t always need to rock the boat. It might be more beneficial for you to let your carry spend two minutes farming for their BKB and then pick up aegis before taking more towers.\n\nWith that said, this can be difficult to actually apply in games. Smoke of deceit gives teams an opportunity to break out of this position and it can sometimes be difficult to maintain the defensive vision you want for this.\u00a0\n\nWhen I find myself in this position where my cores want to get stronger while we have an advantage, I focus on vision. I pick up a gem to choke out the wards on the map to make it more difficult for the other team to leave their base safely. I set up a line of observer wards so that the opposing team has to either smoke out or pass through a ward to get to a camp. And I keep myself nearby an aggressively farming core in case the enemy is trying to make a move.",
            "Except for T1 towers that you can push fast, the rest is not worth it if you have no much push potential (let's say your carry died during fight). So better push your advantage after the team fight by pushing other lanes and finding easy farms while heroes are still dead. You farm while they can't cuz they're dead.\n\nLet's say you took t1 mid and team wiped while side lanes are pushed in. You surely used your biggest spells to win fight so they are all in cool down and you spam ping to push t2 while you have no push potential and they gonna glyph it anyway + enemy team respawning. While your carry and mid could have tped to side lanes to farm 2 waves + x jungle camps safely (enemies dead). \n\nAt the end pushing a t2 with 1st aegis and t3 with 2nd aegis and ultis available are the safest way but it's not even automatic. How many times you see team going hg with 1st aegis and getting wiped and now game is even. And of course supports blaming carry if they tp to farm after getting aegis while it was actually the right decision."
