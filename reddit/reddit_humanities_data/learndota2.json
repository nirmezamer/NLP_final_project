        "content": "Was playing against a mid LD and got absolutely bodied by the bear tanking the tower whilst LD was comfy hitting me from the middle of the lane. \n\nAbout 8 minutes into the game, the writing was on the wall (guy who picked pos1 def didn\u2019t help), but what could I have done here? I was playing lycan with spirit wolves",

            "I play a lot of LD, the answer is, you need a gank. otherwise it's gg",
            "Y\n\n>playing lycan with spirit wolves\n\nYou played Lycan against LD at mid?",
            "If you can't win lane, just gank other lane, Lycan's mobility should be better than LD.",
            "By picking the correct Facet. Lvl 4 wolves severely lower the atk speed of the bear. Together with Helm of Dom and Lycan Ult, you should be able to overpower LD who did not keep a skill point to be added unto Ult or Savage Roar for scenarios where he is ganked on, or to dispel the bear (by levelling up the bear).\n\nAlso, just ignore LD and gank other lanes. Some heroes just have a better power spike if left unchecked in the lane, and you shouldn't just be stubborn about it to stick around to hope something will change, unless you have useful teammates that want to gank to change that.",
            "First mistake here is picking Lycan mid",
            "U cant do much as lycan. It\u2019s essentially 2 universal heroes last hitting against 1. There are easier laning matchups like lina who can hit the bear for free and secure cs with nukes, but lycan pretty much has to gank other lanes with his 6.",
            "One of the big secrets against lone druid is that his pet bear if he chooses the facet that just transforms him, his pet bear is actually very killable until it gets AC and Skadi or something.\n\nIf you have a solid right clicker, SF for instance. Just kill the pet bear every time it shows. If you kill it twice his hero kind stops working for a few minutes which is way worse than even the main hero dying for lone druid.\n\nThe 300 gold is nothing to scoff at. The main hero in many ways is a 'distraction' It's designed in a way to try to make you ignore the pet bear and waste your time on sometihng with 4k hp and 30 armour. When the bear is runing around with MoM Deso, Diffusal with like 5 armour and 2.5k hp. Ignore the hero, just torture the pet bear every single time and focus it and his hero will suddenly feel super shit to the point where he put all his items on the bear but he's afraid to even sent it out anymore.\n\nIt's easier on a ranged hero that can harass the bear when it goes to last hit and can bait the bear into the tower if he tries to send the bear at you, while he tries to last hit.",
            "The hero that I have the best winrate against is LD. ~4k dota\n76.5% with sniper - 17 games\n87.5% with windranger - 8 games\n\nPick a hero that can hit either the bear or syllabear and not just get bodied or pushed.",
            "Harass the bear it wont agro their creeps",
            "Lycan is a horrible matchup vs LD. The answer is to ignore him and lane. Go jungle and hope your side lanes are useful."

            "It was very highly contested last patch with voodoo festeration, it was first picked or banned pretty much every game.\n\n\nTo answer your real question, playing around ult/shard is simply not as good in pro play. Pros are a lot better about playing around those skills, baiting them out without committing and not grouping for cask. WD is a skill test for enemies more than a strong character.\n\n\nEvery time it sees pro play, which it has a few times in the last 2 years including the most recent patch, it's because voodoo restoration is strong and that's what pros play around. The ult and shard are still parts of his kit that are useful in pro play but not strong enough by themselves.",

            "No. Until the previous patch that buffed his W to stupid levels, the hero was hot garbage in high mmr games because his q/e/r are extremely easy to play around, leaving him with only his W as a reliably impactful spell.\n\nOn top of that his base stats have been terrible for a long time, leaving him with a really bad laning phase.\n\nLastly, he was seeing the ocassional odd pick before 7.35, but 7.35 making his W not deal damage anymore by default just cemented him as completely unpickable.",
            "Because they ruined WD, like almost everything since new map and new facets; it\u2018s heaven for content creators and hell for players. There are not more players, there are more smurfs and account buyers then ever before. \nSomeone know why Grubby quit? Was it because of toxic community? Now it\u2019s toxic like 2014 again.

        "content": "In my games we finally win a team fight, the entire team decides to either split up and try to push tower in different lanes or back to jungle farm. In both cases we don\u2019t end up getting a tower because the enemy still has 1 or 2 heroes up and us splitting makes things so much harder. I\u2019m wondering why do people want to split up all the time? Is it the right move and I\u2019m just the idiot who thinks staying together we are stronger and can actually push. Whereas if we split we are prone to be picked off and weaker? ",

            "In theory if you control more of the map than your opponent, you are getting more gold than them. If your opponent is stuck in their triangle while you farm both jungles, then the onus is on *them* to move out, not necessarily for you to move in. The status quo benefits you, and you don\u2019t always need to rock the boat. It might be more beneficial for you to let your carry spend two minutes farming for their BKB and then pick up aegis before taking more towers.\n\nWith that said, this can be difficult to actually apply in games. Smoke of deceit gives teams an opportunity to break out of this position and it can sometimes be difficult to maintain the defensive vision you want for this.\u00a0\n\nWhen I find myself in this position where my cores want to get stronger while we have an advantage, I focus on vision. I pick up a gem to choke out the wards on the map to make it more difficult for the other team to leave their base safely. I set up a line of observer wards so that the opposing team has to either smoke out or pass through a ward to get to a camp. And I keep myself nearby an aggressively farming core in case the enemy is trying to make a move."
