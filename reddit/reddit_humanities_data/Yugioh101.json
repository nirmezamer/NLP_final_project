        "content": "Welcome to /r/Yugioh101! By making a post here, you can ask for any help with Yugioh you would like. If you have any suggestions for improving the subreddit in some way, you can [send us a message here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FYugioh101). \n\nHere are the rules that everyone should follow while on this subreddit.\n\n### 1. Be Respectful  \n\nThis subreddit is intended to be a friendly and welcoming environment for our new players. Please do your best to make it so.\n\n* Above all else, treat every other user with respect.   \n* If you see an extremely basic question, or someone not understanding something simple, that's okay. That's what Yugioh101 is for.  \n* You can recommend that someone read [The Rulebook](https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/rulebook/) or Google something as part of your response. However, your response should not just be _\"Read the rulebook\"_, _\"Read the card\"_, or _\"Google it\"_.  \n* If you have a disagreement with someone, respond politely.  \n* If you see someone being rude, don't try to start an argument with them. Instead, please let us moderators know by clicking the report button on their comment or post. \n\n### 2. Posts must be for getting help, or helping others\n\nFor example: \n\n* Don't start general discussions about Yugioh, like \n_\"What do you think of <insert deck/card here>?\"_\n* Don't try to promote your YouTube channel. \n* Don't post just to tell us about something you're excited about. You should have some question you're asking. \n* Don't post to ask how much your cards are worth. \n\n\n### 3. Do not give misinformation, or use jargon\n\n* If you're unsure of the answer, please don't respond to the question. Leave it to someone else who properly understands the topic. Even though you're trying to be helpful, attempting to explain something you don't fully understand will cause more harm than good.  \n* [_A Guide to the Rules Behind the Jargon_](https://redd.it/k4ky6f): Responses using jargon listed in this post will typically be removed. Please see the introduction of this post for an explanation of why.  \n* If you see something which you think contains misinformation, please click the report button on it. We moderators need your help in bringing these cases to our attention.  \n* If you realize that a comment you made had a mistake, edit it to fix it. Comments with mistakes will be removed, even if you acknowledge in another comment that you were wrong. \n\n### Helpful Resources:\n\nCheck the Sidebar or \"About\" section for a more complete list of resources. Here are just a few:\n\n* [Get me caught up with the game](https://redd.it/edjjit) \n* [The Rulebook](https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/rulebook/index.html)  \n* [Terms and concepts new players should know](https://redd.it/ef46uk)   \n* [Budget Decks](https://www.reddit.com/r/Yugioh101/wiki/budget_deck_archive)",

If it has been a few months since this date, some information in here may now be unreliable.\n\n***\n\n####**Table of Contents:**\n\n* Section 1: Learning the Rules\n\n* Section 2: Changes to the Game\n\n* Section 3: Where to Play Yu-Gi-Oh! \n\n* Section 4: Making a Deck\n\n* Section 5: Forbidden Cards \n\n* Section 6: What You Need For Playing in Person\n\n* Section 7: Terms and Concepts New Players Should Know\n\n* Section 8: Staple Cards\n\n# Section 1: Learning the Rules\n\n[**Official Rulebook**](https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/rulebook/). Read this first! It's enough to get started without being overwhelming. \n\n**Read these after you start playing:**\n\n* [Problem Solving Card Text (PSCT)](https://www.yugioh-card.com/eu/play/understanding-card-text/). Konami's articles explaining the meaning of words and phrases on cards.\n\n* [Fast Effect Timing Flowchart](https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/play/fast-effect-timing/). You are constantly moving through a flowchart while playing Yu-Gi-Oh!. Understanding this flowchart is crucial to figuring out the order in which things happen. \n\n* [Demystifying Rulings (Parts 1-10)](https://ygorganization.com/tag/demystifying-rulings/). YGOrganization's articles explaining various parts of the rules. Parts 11-13 are also worth reading, but are more advanced.\n\nIf you know everything linked in this section, you will know enough to play the game comfortably. If you want to learn even more, check out our [full list of Rules Resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/Yugioh101/wiki/judge_resources).\n\n**Places to ask questions:**\n\n* [r/Yugioh's Discord Server](https://discordapp.com/invite/yugioh). Use the *\"Rulings_and_Policy\"* channel or the *\"Beginner_Returning_Chat\"* channel.\n\n* r/Yugioh101. Make a post on this subreddit. \n\n***\n\n# Section 2: Changes to the Game \n\n**2008 - Synchro Monsters**\n\n* [Rulebook pages 20-21](https://i.imgur.com/FDbpDtg.png)\n\n**2011 - Xyz Monsters**\n\n* [Rulebook pages 18-19](https://i.imgur.com/RMTsrTW.png)\n\n**2014 - Pendulum Monsters**\n\n* [Official tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gs08XuC62LU)\n* [Rulebook pages 16-17](https://i.imgur.com/AIWPnMg.png)    \n* Both players can now control a Field Spell at the same time.  \n* The player who goes first does not draw at the start of their first turn. \n\n**2017 - Link Monsters & The Extra Monster Zone**    \n\n* [Official tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jqRznO0NdU)\n* [Rulebook pages 4-5](https://i.imgur.com/xFFfxBS.png)  \n* [Rulebook pages 12-13](https://i.imgur.com/j5rTaCb.png)  \n* [Rulebook pages 14-15](https://i.imgur.com/h2nAw8a.png)  \n* [Link Monster Terms](https://yugiohblog.konami.com/articles/?p=8318)\n\n**2020 - Update for Fusion, Synchro, & Xyz Monsters**\n\n* Fusion, Synchro, and Xyz Monsters can now be summoned from the Extra Deck to any Monster Zone. Previously when summoning them from the Extra Deck, you could only place them in the Extra Monster Zone, or a Main Monster Zone a Link Monster points to. This restriction still applies when summoning Link and Pendulum Monsters.\n\nIf you're returning after many years, you will find that the game is more complex than when you left. Most cards have multiple effects, and many things happen each turn. It can be daunting for new and returning players, but through playing the game you will get the hang of it. \n\n***\n\n# Section 3: Where to Play Yu-Gi-Oh!\n\n**Real Life - Find a store near you which runs local events**\n\n* [Konami's Locator - North and South America](https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/events/ots-locations/).\n\n* [Konami's Locator - Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Cyprus, and South Africa](https://www.yugioh-card.com/eu/play/store-locator/).\n\n* Search on Facebook for Yu-Gi-Oh! groups from your area.\n\n**Online**\n\n* [Master Duel](https://www.konami.com/yugioh/masterduel/en/) is the official online Yu-Gi-Oh! game. \n\n* [Project Ignis: EDOPro](https://discordapp.com/invite/ygopro-percy). This is a downloadable program. The download link is in their Discord Server. The rules of the game are programmed in. \n\n* [Dueling Book](https://www.duelingbook.com/). This is a website. The rules of the game are not programmed in, so you move cards around manually. \n\n***\n\n# Section 4: Making a Deck\n\nWhen making your first deck you should copy a deck list you find online. Building decks yourself is difficult. You need to learn to ride a bike long before you can learn how to *build* a bike. You may need to edit the deck due to budget concerns, and that's okay. \n\n**Master Duel Deck Lists**\n\n* [Master Duel Meta](https://www.masterduelmeta.com/top-decks#dateRange=Current%20format): Use this for Master Duel deck lists. The recommendations below are for the in-person Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG. \n\n**Physical TCG Deck Lists**\n\n* Building a deck from three copies of a recent Structure Deck is an easy and cheap method to jump into the game. The current best options are \"Structure Deck: Fire Kings\" or \"Structure Deck: Beware of Traptrix\". Search for YouTube videos for guides on these.\n\n* [YGOPRODECK](https://ygoprodeck.com/tournaments/top-archetypes/) and [TCG Player](https://infinite.tcgplayer.com/yugioh/decks/format/advanced) have many deck lists that did well in tournaments. The decks with many recent deck lists will be the best ones. Most of these will probably be quite expensive.\n\n* YouTube is a great resource for finding deck lists. Search for *\"<Deck Name> Deck Profile\"* and you will find many deck lists for any deck.\n\n**Where to Buy Physical Cards**\n\n* If you can afford it, please consider buying from your local game store to support them. Game stores are often not the most profitable businesses. Buying from them helps them to stay open, and gives you a locals to play at.\n\n* Buying the individual cards you need is typically the cheapest way to build a deck. Your local card shop may have single cards for sale, but otherwise you can shop online. [TCG Player](https://www.tcgplayer.com/) is the most popular site for North America, and [Cardmarket](https://www.cardmarket.com/en/YuGiOh) is the most popular for Europe. \n\n* You should only buy Booster packs for the fun of it. They are not good value if you're trying to build a deck. You may get lucky and get some valuable cards, but you likely won't. \n\n**Getting Help With Your Deck**\n\n* [Deck Discord Servers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vSSiBkEp7VGyVOko013K9q-sRsAhu6ZA3Tl2C75LVaE_tNlCo53Yd3xjz3qMUQklFTPER5klJr81Qk_/pubhtml) - Many decks have Discord servers dedicated to them. This is a collection of over three hundred of them. These are great places to discuss a deck with people who play it. \n\n***\n\n# Section 5: Banned Cards\n\n[The Forbidden & Limited List](https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/limited/) \n\nThe Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG has a list of cards which are forbidden from being played. There are also *\"Limited\"* cards which you can only play one copy of in a Deck, and *\"Semi-Limited\"* cards which you can only play two copies of. This list is updated once every few months. Updates often drastically change which decks are good. Be aware of it when looking at recommendations for decks to play. If there has been an update since, things may have changed.\n\n***\n\n# Section 6: What You Need For Playing in Person\n\n**Card Sleeves** \n\nThese are protectors you put your cards into. They are an absolute necessity. If you play without them, your cards will get damaged. They are typically sold at your local shop in packs of 50-100, at around \u20ac4-8 per pack. Make sure you're buying the right size! Yu-Gi-Oh! sleeves are usually referred to as *\"Japanese Size\"* or *\"Small Size\"*. Sleeves for Magic: The Gathering are usually called *\"Standard Size\"*, and these do NOT fit Yu-Gi-Oh! cards.\n\n**Deck Box**\n\nA box to store your deck. This is also a necessity. You can buy a cheap plastic one at your local shop for around \u20ac3. Those are fine for starting off. You can get nicer ones which last for years for around \u20ac10-20. \n\n**Playmat**\n\nThese are rubber mats you lay on the table to play your cards on. They are not a necessity, but most people will decide to get one soon after starting. They help to prevent damage to your sleeves, and they're much nicer to play on than a table. Your local shop will probably sell these for around \u20ac20.\n\n**Binder**\n\nThese are like books with pages of plastic pockets to put your cards into. You don't need these for playing, they're mostly used for trading. They're convenient for people browsing your cards. You can get a small cheap one for \u20ac5-10. Standard ones are around \u20ac15-20. \n\n**Pen and paper**\n\nYou should keep track of life points by writing them down as you go. Some people use a mobile app while playing casually, but using pen and paper is required for official tournaments. \n\n**Dice**\n\nMost players roll dice to choose who goes first. You also often need to choose cards randomly, and rolling dice is the most fair way. Having dice with you is not strictly necessary, but most players will bring one. Your local shop might sell them for around \u20ac1. \n\n***\n\n# Section 7: Terms and Concepts New Players Should Know\n\n[This post](https://redd.it/ef46uk) explains common terms that new players may not yet know. \n\n***\n\n# Section 8: Staple Cards\n\n**Last updated 27th April 2024**\n\nStaples are cards which are played by multiple different decks. You can't just include any of these in any deck, but they are cards you should at least consider. \n\nSome of these cards are much more popular than others. This list is put together by going through data on [YGOPRODECK](https://ygoprodeck.com/). To be included on this list, the card must have been in a deck which \"topped\" an event with 200 or more players in the past 6 months. It must also have been in multiple different \"topping\" decks.  \n\n## Link 1 Monsters\n\n* Gravity Controller\n* Linguriboh\n* Link Spider\n* Relinquished Anima\n* Salamangreat Almiraj  \n* Secure Gardna\n\n## Link 2 Monsters\n\n* Barricadeborg Blocker  \n* Cross-Sheep\n* Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy\n* Donner, Dagger Fur Hire\n* Hiita the Fire Charmer, Ablaze\n* I:P Masquerena\n* Knightmare Cerberus\n* Knightmare Phoenix\n* Lyna the Light Charmer, Lustrous\n* Muckraker From the Underworld\n* Pitknight Earlie\n* Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf\n* Splash Mage\n* S:P Little Knight\n* Unchained Soul Lord of Yama\n\n\n## Link 3 Monsters\n\n* Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos\n* Decode Talker Heatsoul\n* Hraesvelgr, the Desperate Doom Eagle\n* Knightmare Unicorn\n* Promethean Princess, Bestower of Flames\n* Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians\n* Topologic Trisbaena\n* Unchained Soul of Anguish\n\n## Link 4 Monsters\n\n* Accesscode Talker\n* Amphibious Swarmship Amblowhale\n* Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess\n* Borrelsword Dragon\n* Knightmare Gryphon\n* Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax\n* Salamangreat Raging Phoenix\n* Saryuja Skull Dread\n* Topologic Bomber Dragon\n* Unchained Abomination\n* Worldsea Dragon Zealantis\n\n## Link 5 Monsters\n\n* Underworld Goddess of the Closed World\n\n## Xyz Monsters\n\nFlexible:\n\n* Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder\n* Dark Armed, the Dragon of Annihilation\n* Downerd Magician\n* Super Starslayer TY-PHON - Sky Crisis\n\nRank 1:\n\n* Kikinagashi Fucho\n\nRank 2:\n\n* Number 29: Mannequin Cat\n* Onibimaru Soul Sweeper\n* Toadally Awesome\n\nRank 3:\n\n* The Phantom Knights of Break Sword\n\nRank 4\n\n* Abyss Dweller\n* Evilswarm Exciton Knight  \n* Evilswarm Nightmare\n* Gagaga Cowboy\n* Infernal Flame Banshee\n* Number 60: Dugares the Timeless\n* Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir  \n* Time Thief Redoer\n* Tornado Dragon\n\nRank 6\n\n* Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal\n* Wollow, Founder of the Drudge Dragons\n\nRank 7:\n\n* Number 11: Big Eye\n* Number 76: Harmonizer Gradielle\n\nRank 8: \n\n* Coach King Giantrainer\n* Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy\n* Number 68: Sanaphond the Sky Prison\n* The Zombie Vampire\n\nRank 9:\n\n* Mereologic Aggregator\n\n\n## Fusion Monsters\n\n* Berfomet the Mythical King of Phantom Beasts\n* Chimera the King of Phantom Beasts\n* Elder Entity N'tss\n* Guardian Chimera\n\n**Summon with Super Polymerization:**\n\n* Earth Golem @Ignister\n* Garura, Wings of Resonant Life\n* Starving Venom Fusion Dragon\n* Predaplant Dragostapelia \n* Mudragon of the Swamp \n\n**Summon with Instant Fusion:**\n\n* Millennium-Eyes Restrict\n\n## Synchro Monsters\n\n* Accel Synchro Stardust Dragon\n* Bystial Dis Pater\n* Chaos Angel \n* Coral Dragon\n* Crimson Dragon\n* Enigmaster Packbit\n* F.A.

            "As someone who played back when the game was first released and quick about 15yrs ago and at the national level, it seems to me this game has really lost it's way. It's way too overcomplicated, the cards are far too wordy, and the 15card combos are stupid and the power creep is insane. Games end in a couple of turns due to combos, and the sheer number of new rules and card mechanics make this game now almost impossible to pick up unless you've been with it since near the beginning. To me it seems this game as gone the way of magic the gathering, where it would take half a life time of playing the game just grasp what's all in it and how to strategize within it. It's just a steep hill to climb when every card has like 3 effects built into. I have to read cards 5x before I finally memorize what it does.",

            "so coming from MTG background, im helping a friend by being a person he can play again. \n\nWhat are some deck types that are like, tax/stax in MTG (taxes the opponent for playing cards, attack, playing spells, ect)  Or weenies (spamming the board with dudes)",

            "\u2018the 15 card\u2019 combos are the worst thing that happened to this game. Early on you had decks that relied heavily on combos and decks that simply responded to whatever your opponent was doing at the time (chess like), but nowadays it\u2019s all about playing your own game mostly while disregarding whatever the hell your opponent does and racing to your win condition before he does.\n\nit\u2019s sad because there is a huge potential for having a various approaches to winning but meta is not about that and instead forces you to play a certain way or...never win.",

The only way to really learn modern strategy and theory is to watch people play the game *a lot* where they explain their reasoning as to why they do each individual thing they do, either actual play or deckbuilding or whatever. Also you might want to find a somewhat easy deck to stick with for a short while to get a feel for how you have to interact with opponents\u00b4 strategies that you\u00b4re unfamiliar with.",

            "Start with Masterduel. It's the official game free almost any platform. Go through solo mode and collect gems and cards, don't open any packs though. It's a gacha game but very F2P, but you should still be smart on how you spend your gems.\n\nWatch Dkayed on youtube, he's like the main person that covers everything about this game, from leaks, to tutorials, to gameplay, to combo guides, to beginner guides, everything. And his website MasterduelMeta.com.\n\nIf you want to succeed in this game or even in TCG, if you plan on playing in locals or tournaments, accept the fact that OG Yugioh is trash. None of the decks are good, and you're gonna get destroyed within the first turn. This isn't: set up with a monster and set a trap, and turn 5 I summon Dark Magician to destroy Blue Eyes.\nThis game is: I summon 23 times and I have three 3000 atk monsters that can negate your card effects 3 times and I'll recover it all next turn, that is if there is a next turn. That's what this game has become. I'm of course exaggerating, but for new players, that's how its gonna feel at times and you're gonna have to accept that to have fun, learn combos, learn how to play through disruptions etc.\n\nIf you cant do that, look for friends, even at your local game store that would play older formats, and can just build casual decks like DM or BE. \n\nI like Purrely.",
            "With time and great difficulty. Yugioh is exceedingly complex, so it's important to not allow yourself to be overwhelmed. Pretty much everybody starts where you are. The important thing is to build a very solid foundation of basic knowledge. There's lots of useful links in the sidebar. Beyond the absolute basics (phase changing, drawing for turn, normal summon once etc...) Key topics include, [Fast Effect Timing](https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/play/fast-effect-timing/), [Simultaneous Effects](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Simultaneous_Effects), [Problem Solving Card Text](https://yugiohblog.konami.com/articles/?tag=problem-solving-card-text) and the [Official Rulebook](https://img.yugioh-card.com/en/downloads/rulebook/SD_RuleBook_EN_10.pdf). Other than that, just start playing in a Simulator like YGO Omega or Master Duel and see what you can do. They are quite hand holdy with directing you what you can do at any given time."

Then you do your rematch and forget to look through your deck and it shows up.  Do you restart the match?  Do you win because your opponent didn't take their card back (and could be argued as being the reason for the bad game situation?). \n\nDo you just remove it from play and act like it was never there and the opponent has to accept that they're down one parasite?  Do they lose automatically for having 39 cards in their deck?  Is it a tie because you also lose automatically for having a card in your deck that you didn't add to your official deck list (I know some games require you to tell the tournament organizers what you're playing with)?\n\n",

            "> I don't play in tourneys, but I assume before you fight a new person, a judge looks through your deck to make sure you have 40 cards and not too many duplicates or banned cards and so on. \n\nYou submit a deck list prior to the tournament and that is the deck you will be using for every match. I assume they check your deck at check-in, but after that it is up to you to make sure it is correct.\n\nIf your main deck is different from your submitted deck list in any way at the start of the game, whether that's because you changed it, you forgot to restore your deck after siding or because you accidentally kept your opponent's Parasite, then that is against the rules. In the case you mentioned both you and your opponent would have the wrong deck, so you'd both be in violation of the rules.\n\nIf the mistake is caught before the game starts then I'm fairly sure you just correct the decks, get a warning (DE Minor, i.e. Deck Error) and proceed. If it's the middle of the game, which is any point after you've asked your opponent to cut basically, then that would be a loss for you that game (DE Major). If you are both using the wrong decks and neither of you catch it before the game starts, I assume it will be counted as a game loss for both of you.",

            "Your Deck is not checked at check-in. That would take far, far too long. \n\nIn the past, at larger events, your Deck List would sometimes be checked, to make sure that what you have written down is at least legal. It would not be compared to your actual Deck, that takes far too long.\n\nMost big tournaments these days have Deck List submission through Neuron. Neuron will not let you submit an illegal deck list, so that check doesn't need to be done any more."
