        "content": "Welcome to /r/Yugioh101! By making a post here, you can ask for any help with Yugioh you would like. If you have any suggestions for improving the subreddit in some way, you can [send us a message here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FYugioh101). \n\nHere are the rules that everyone should follow while on this subreddit.\n\n### 1. Be Respectful  \n\nThis subreddit is intended to be a friendly and welcoming environment for our new players. Please do your best to make it so.\n\n* Above all else, treat every other user with respect.   \n* If you see an extremely basic question, or someone not understanding something simple, that's okay. That's what Yugioh101 is for.  \n* You can recommend that someone read [The Rulebook](https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/rulebook/) or Google something as part of your response. However, your response should not just be _\"Read the rulebook\"_, _\"Read the card\"_, or _\"Google it\"_.  \n* If you have a disagreement with someone, respond politely.  \n* If you see someone being rude, don't try to start an argument with them. Instead, please let us moderators know by clicking the report button on their comment or post. \n\n### 2. Posts must be for getting help, or helping others\n\nFor example: \n\n* Don't start general discussions about Yugioh, like \n_\"What do you think of <insert deck/card here>?\"_\n* Don't try to promote your YouTube channel. \n* Don't post just to tell us about something you're excited about. You should have some question you're asking. \n* Don't post to ask how much your cards are worth. \n\n\n### 3. Do not give misinformation, or use jargon\n\n* If you're unsure of the answer, please don't respond to the question. Leave it to someone else who properly understands the topic. Even though you're trying to be helpful, attempting to explain something you don't fully understand will cause more harm than good.  \n* [_A Guide to the Rules Behind the Jargon_](https://redd.it/k4ky6f): Responses using jargon listed in this post will typically be removed. Please see the introduction of this post for an explanation of why.  \n* If you see something which you think contains misinformation, please click the report button on it. We moderators need your help in bringing these cases to our attention.  \n* If you realize that a comment you made had a mistake, edit it to fix it. Comments with mistakes will be removed, even if you acknowledge in another comment that you were wrong. \n\n### Helpful Resources:\n\nCheck the Sidebar or \"About\" section for a more complete list of resources. Here are just a few:\n\n* [Get me caught up with the game](https://redd.it/edjjit) \n* [The Rulebook](https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/rulebook/index.html)  \n* [Terms and concepts new players should know](https://redd.it/ef46uk)   \n* [Budget Decks](https://www.reddit.com/r/Yugioh101/wiki/budget_deck_archive)",

If it has been a few months since this date, some information in here may now be unreliable.\n\n***\n\n####**Table of Contents:**\n\n* Section 1: Learning the Rules\n\n* Section 2: Changes to the Game\n\n* Section 3: Where to Play Yu-Gi-Oh! \n\n* Section 4: Making a Deck\n\n* Section 5: Forbidden Cards \n\n* Section 6: What You Need For Playing in Person\n\n* Section 7: Terms and Concepts New Players Should Know\n\n* Section 8: Staple Cards\n\n# Section 1: Learning the Rules\n\n[**Official Rulebook**](https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/rulebook/). Read this first! It's enough to get started without being overwhelming. \n\n**Read these after you start playing:**\n\n* [Problem Solving Card Text (PSCT)](https://www.yugioh-card.com/eu/play/understanding-card-text/). Konami's articles explaining the meaning of words and phrases on cards.\n\n* [Fast Effect Timing Flowchart](https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/play/fast-effect-timing/). You are constantly moving through a flowchart while playing Yu-Gi-Oh!. Understanding this flowchart is crucial to figuring out the order in which things happen. \n\n* [Demystifying Rulings (Parts 1-10)](https://ygorganization.com/tag/demystifying-rulings/). YGOrganization's articles explaining various parts of the rules. Parts 11-13 are also worth reading, but are more advanced.\n\nIf you know everything linked in this section, you will know enough to play the game comfortably. If you want to learn even more, check out our [full list of Rules Resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/Yugioh101/wiki/judge_resources).\n\n**Places to ask questions:**\n\n* [r/Yugioh's Discord Server](https://discordapp.com/invite/yugioh). Use the *\"Rulings_and_Policy\"* channel or the *\"Beginner_Returning_Chat\"* channel.\n\n* r/Yugioh101. Make a post on this subreddit. \n\n***\n\n# Section 2: Changes to the Game \n\n**2008 - Synchro Monsters**\n\n* [Rulebook pages 20-21](https://i.imgur.com/FDbpDtg.png)\n\n**2011 - Xyz Monsters**\n\n* [Rulebook pages 18-19](https://i.imgur.com/RMTsrTW.png)\n\n**2014 - Pendulum Monsters**\n\n* [Official tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gs08XuC62LU)\n* [Rulebook pages 16-17](https://i.imgur.com/AIWPnMg.png)    \n* Both players can now control a Field Spell at the same time.  \n* The player who goes first does not draw at the start of their first turn. \n\n**2017 - Link Monsters & The Extra Monster Zone**    \n\n* [Official tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jqRznO0NdU)\n* [Rulebook pages 4-5](https://i.imgur.com/xFFfxBS.png)  \n* [Rulebook pages 12-13](https://i.imgur.com/j5rTaCb.png)  \n* [Rulebook pages 14-15](https://i.imgur.com/h2nAw8a.png)  \n* [Link Monster Terms](https://yugiohblog.konami.com/articles/?p=8318)\n\n**2020 - Update for Fusion, Synchro, & Xyz Monsters**\n\n* Fusion, Synchro, and Xyz Monsters can now be summoned from the Extra Deck to any Monster Zone. Previously when summoning them from the Extra Deck, you could only place them in the Extra Monster Zone, or a Main Monster Zone a Link Monster points to. This restriction still applies when summoning Link and Pendulum Monsters.\n\nIf you're returning after many years, you will find that the game is more complex than when you left. Most cards have multiple effects, and many things happen each turn. It can be daunting for new and returning players, but through playing the game you will get the hang of it. \n\n***\n\n# Section 3: Where to Play Yu-Gi-Oh!\n\n**Real Life - Find a store near you which runs local events**\n\n* [Konami's Locator - North and South America](https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/events/ots-locations/).\n\n* [Konami's Locator - Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Cyprus, and South Africa](https://www.yugioh-card.com/eu/play/store-locator/).\n\n* Search on Facebook for Yu-Gi-Oh! groups from your area.\n\n**Online**\n\n* [Master Duel](https://www.konami.com/yugioh/masterduel/en/) is the official online Yu-Gi-Oh! game. \n\n* [Project Ignis: EDOPro](https://discordapp.com/invite/ygopro-percy). This is a downloadable program. The download link is in their Discord Server. The rules of the game are programmed in. \n\n* [Dueling Book](https://www.duelingbook.com/). This is a website. The rules of the game are not programmed in, so you move cards around manually. \n\n***\n\n# Section 4: Making a Deck\n\nWhen making your first deck you should copy a deck list you find online. Building decks yourself is difficult. You need to learn to ride a bike long before you can learn how to *build* a bike. You may need to edit the deck due to budget concerns, and that's okay. \n\n**Master Duel Deck Lists**\n\n* [Master Duel Meta](https://www.masterduelmeta.com/top-decks#dateRange=Current%20format): Use this for Master Duel deck lists. The recommendations below are for the in-person Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG. \n\n**Physical TCG Deck Lists**\n\n* Building a deck from three copies of a recent Structure Deck is an easy and cheap method to jump into the game. The current best options are \"Structure Deck: Fire Kings\" or \"Structure Deck: Beware of Traptrix\". Search for YouTube videos for guides on these.\n\n* [YGOPRODECK](https://ygoprodeck.com/tournaments/top-archetypes/) and [TCG Player](https://infinite.tcgplayer.com/yugioh/decks/format/advanced) have many deck lists that did well in tournaments. The decks with many recent deck lists will be the best ones. Most of these will probably be quite expensive.\n\n* YouTube is a great resource for finding deck lists. Search for *\"<Deck Name> Deck Profile\"* and you will find many deck lists for any deck.\n\n**Where to Buy Physical Cards**\n\n* If you can afford it, please consider buying from your local game store to support them. Game stores are often not the most profitable businesses. Buying from them helps them to stay open, and gives you a locals to play at.\n\n* Buying the individual cards you need is typically the cheapest way to build a deck. Your local card shop may have single cards for sale, but otherwise you can shop online. [TCG Player](https://www.tcgplayer.com/) is the most popular site for North America, and [Cardmarket](https://www.cardmarket.com/en/YuGiOh) is the most popular for Europe. \n\n* You should only buy Booster packs for the fun of it. They are not good value if you're trying to build a deck. You may get lucky and get some valuable cards, but you likely won't. \n\n**Getting Help With Your Deck**\n\n* [Deck Discord Servers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vSSiBkEp7VGyVOko013K9q-sRsAhu6ZA3Tl2C75LVaE_tNlCo53Yd3xjz3qMUQklFTPER5klJr81Qk_/pubhtml) - Many decks have Discord servers dedicated to them. This is a collection of over three hundred of them. These are great places to discuss a deck with people who play it. \n\n***\n\n# Section 5: Banned Cards\n\n[The Forbidden & Limited List](https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/limited/) \n\nThe Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG has a list of cards which are forbidden from being played. There are also *\"Limited\"* cards which you can only play one copy of in a Deck, and *\"Semi-Limited\"* cards which you can only play two copies of. This list is updated once every few months. Updates often drastically change which decks are good. Be aware of it when looking at recommendations for decks to play. If there has been an update since, things may have changed.\n\n***\n\n# Section 6: What You Need For Playing in Person\n\n**Card Sleeves** \n\nThese are protectors you put your cards into. They are an absolute necessity. If you play without them, your cards will get damaged. They are typically sold at your local shop in packs of 50-100, at around \u20ac4-8 per pack. Make sure you're buying the right size! Yu-Gi-Oh! sleeves are usually referred to as *\"Japanese Size\"* or *\"Small Size\"*. Sleeves for Magic: The Gathering are usually called *\"Standard Size\"*, and these do NOT fit Yu-Gi-Oh! cards.\n\n**Deck Box**\n\nA box to store your deck. This is also a necessity. You can buy a cheap plastic one at your local shop for around \u20ac3. Those are fine for starting off. You can get nicer ones which last for years for around \u20ac10-20. \n\n**Playmat**\n\nThese are rubber mats you lay on the table to play your cards on. They are not a necessity, but most people will decide to get one soon after starting. They help to prevent damage to your sleeves, and they're much nicer to play on than a table. Your local shop will probably sell these for around \u20ac20.\n\n**Binder**\n\nThese are like books with pages of plastic pockets to put your cards into. You don't need these for playing, they're mostly used for trading. They're convenient for people browsing your cards. You can get a small cheap one for \u20ac5-10. Standard ones are around \u20ac15-20. \n\n**Pen and paper**\n\nYou should keep track of life points by writing them down as you go. Some people use a mobile app while playing casually, but using pen and paper is required for official tournaments. \n\n**Dice**\n\nMost players roll dice to choose who goes first. You also often need to choose cards randomly, and rolling dice is the most fair way. Having dice with you is not strictly necessary, but most players will bring one. Your local shop might sell them for around \u20ac1. \n\n***\n\n# Section 7: Terms and Concepts New Players Should Know\n\n[This post](https://redd.it/ef46uk) explains common terms that new players may not yet know. \n\n***\n\n# Section 8: Staple Cards\n\n**Last updated 27th April 2024**\n\nStaples are cards which are played by multiple different decks. You can't just include any of these in any deck, but they are cards you should at least consider. \n\nSome of these cards are much more popular than others. This list is put together by going through data on [YGOPRODECK](https://ygoprodeck.com/). To be included on this list, the card must have been in a deck which \"topped\" an event with 200 or more players in the past 6 months. It must also have been in multiple different \"topping\" decks.  \n\n## Link 1 Monsters\n\n* Gravity Controller\n* Linguriboh\n* Link Spider\n* Relinquished Anima\n* Salamangreat Almiraj  \n* Secure Gardna\n\n## Link 2 Monsters\n\n* Barricadeborg Blocker  \n* Cross-Sheep\n* Dharc the Dark Charmer, Gloomy\n* Donner, Dagger Fur Hire\n* Hiita the Fire Charmer, Ablaze\n* I:P Masquerena\n* Knightmare Cerberus\n* Knightmare Phoenix\n* Lyna the Light Charmer, Lustrous\n* Muckraker From the Underworld\n* Pitknight Earlie\n* Salamangreat Sunlight Wolf\n* Splash Mage\n* S:P Little Knight\n* Unchained Soul Lord of Yama\n\n\n## Link 3 Monsters\n\n* Black Luster Soldier - Soldier of Chaos\n* Decode Talker Heatsoul\n* Hraesvelgr, the Desperate Doom Eagle\n* Knightmare Unicorn\n* Promethean Princess, Bestower of Flames\n* Selene, Queen of the Master Magicians\n* Topologic Trisbaena\n* Unchained Soul of Anguish\n\n## Link 4 Monsters\n\n* Accesscode Talker\n* Amphibious Swarmship Amblowhale\n* Apollousa, Bow of the Goddess\n* Borrelsword Dragon\n* Knightmare Gryphon\n* Mekk-Knight Crusadia Avramax\n* Salamangreat Raging Phoenix\n* Saryuja Skull Dread\n* Topologic Bomber Dragon\n* Unchained Abomination\n* Worldsea Dragon Zealantis\n\n## Link 5 Monsters\n\n* Underworld Goddess of the Closed World\n\n## Xyz Monsters\n\nFlexible:\n\n* Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder\n* Dark Armed, the Dragon of Annihilation\n* Downerd Magician\n* Super Starslayer TY-PHON - Sky Crisis\n\nRank 1:\n\n* Kikinagashi Fucho\n\nRank 2:\n\n* Number 29: Mannequin Cat\n* Onibimaru Soul Sweeper\n* Toadally Awesome\n\nRank 3:\n\n* The Phantom Knights of Break Sword\n\nRank 4\n\n* Abyss Dweller\n* Evilswarm Exciton Knight  \n* Evilswarm Nightmare\n* Gagaga Cowboy\n* Infernal Flame Banshee\n* Number 60: Dugares the Timeless\n* Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir  \n* Time Thief Redoer\n* Tornado Dragon\n\nRank 6\n\n* Beatrice, Lady of the Eternal\n* Wollow, Founder of the Drudge Dragons\n\nRank 7:\n\n* Number 11: Big Eye\n* Number 76: Harmonizer Gradielle\n\nRank 8: \n\n* Coach King Giantrainer\n* Number 38: Hope Harbinger Dragon Titanic Galaxy\n* Number 68: Sanaphond the Sky Prison\n* The Zombie Vampire\n\nRank 9:\n\n* Mereologic Aggregator\n\n\n## Fusion Monsters\n\n* Berfomet the Mythical King of Phantom Beasts\n* Chimera the King of Phantom Beasts\n* Elder Entity N'tss\n* Guardian Chimera\n\n**Summon with Super Polymerization:**\n\n* Earth Golem @Ignister\n* Garura, Wings of Resonant Life\n* Starving Venom Fusion Dragon\n* Predaplant Dragostapelia \n* Mudragon of the Swamp \n\n**Summon with Instant Fusion:**\n\n* Millennium-Eyes Restrict\n\n## Synchro Monsters\n\n* Accel Synchro Stardust Dragon\n* Bystial Dis Pater\n* Chaos Angel \n* Coral Dragon\n* Crimson Dragon\n* Enigmaster Packbit\n* F.A.

            "As someone who played back when the game was first released and quick about 15yrs ago and at the national level, it seems to me this game has really lost it's way. It's way too overcomplicated, the cards are far too wordy, and the 15card combos are stupid and the power creep is insane. Games end in a couple of turns due to combos, and the sheer number of new rules and card mechanics make this game now almost impossible to pick up unless you've been with it since near the beginning. To me it seems this game as gone the way of magic the gathering, where it would take half a life time of playing the game just grasp what's all in it and how to strategize within it. It's just a steep hill to climb when every card has like 3 effects built into. I have to read cards 5x before I finally memorize what it does.",

            "After the rule change on April 1st:\n\n* If you summon a Link or Pendulum from your Extra Deck, it must be summoned to the Extra Monster Zone, or a Main Monster Zone that a Link Monster points to. \n\n* If you summon a Fusion, Synchro, or Xyz Monster from your Extra Deck, you can summon it in any Monster Zone.\n\n* If a Monster is not being summoned from the Extra Deck, it must be placed in a Main Monster Zone."

        "content": "Lots of too decks I see running 3 talents but no thrust. Why wouldnt I play 2-3 thrust and at least one talents? I can search it with thrust or maybe pivot to a board breaker(duster,DRNM, etc). Doesn't seem like droll is being used that much now but does anyone have any other explanations? Thank you!",

            "If you get your only starter card Ash'd you can Talents to draw 2 and maybe extend.\n\nIf you only have Thrust you can set an Imperm from your deck and weep.\n\nYou could run generically good going first traps (Daruma, D-Barrier, DD Ground, Black Goat), but they don't do anything if you lose the die roll and should probably be sided.\n\nIf we enter an(other) Bystial format, Thrust might be played more often.",
            "Thrust is worse going first, realistically only searching and setting an Imperm for a lot of decks. Talents is better going first, and pretty high up the rankings of what you'd search with Thrust going second anyway (outside of going-second-only cards like DRNM or Evenly), so why not cut out the middle man?",
            "Sometimes you don\u2019t want to get burned if you get another handtrap on you like veiler and they ash thrust. Then your really in a pickle. \n\nIts also just player preference. If you run talents your plays are live as soon as you use it, no risk of it being ashed besides the draw and in a blind game 1 you just use the hand rip effect. \n\nBetter question is what deck are you running? A deck that commonly plays thrust over talents is branded currently due to the vast amount of search targets.",
            "Talents is a draw 2 or a hand rip going first, then can become a steal going second. \n\nThrust is always just a search for a normal s/t, rrquiring a good target to be run in conjunction with it. \n\nBasically talents does more by itself",
            "Could be as simple as the fact that Thrust is considerably more expensive than Talent. Just going by TCGPlayer market prices, I could get two playsets of the cheapest listing of Talent for the cost of 1 of the cheapest listing of Thrust.",
            "It literally depends entirely on what deck you are playing and if it has enough thrust targets or 1 you want badly enough.\n\nMost decks only naturally have like 1 thrust target so they play talents instead.",
            "Talents can be used going first by the majority of decks while Thrust can only set Imperm going first by most decks.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nSo decks need to either be going second decks where Thrust can shine more like Sky Striker or have either very busted Normal Traps they can either use right away going first or to stop the opponent on turn 2, Unchained was the former you can set an Unchained trap pop it and still use the GY effect that way and continue comboinf, something like Floo would be the latter by being able to set Feather Storm or Unexplored Winds.",
            "I played one of each when Thrust was new, but eventually cut Thrust for a second Talent. Talent's just better.",
            "It really depends on the deck. If you have a lot of normal spell or trap cards you can play mlre thrust, but most meta decks don't, and talents then become objectively better. It helps you extent with draw 2, or the hand rip can really hurt",
            "Talents is great in most decks, Thust is incredible in some decks."
