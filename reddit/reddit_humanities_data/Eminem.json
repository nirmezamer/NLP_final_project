        "content": "[](/r/Eminem)\n\nWelcome everybody to the third and very last SotW of June! We're closing out the month with another 'Recovery' track. We're returning to the album after making a really small detour of just a few weeks. The track that we will be listening to for the next seven days, is 'On Fire'. \n\nSeguing into the mix right after the end of previous track \u2018Talkin\u2019 2 Myself\u2019, \u2018On Fire\u2019 is led by a hypnotizing boom-bap beat produced by Mr Porter, also known to many fans as Kon Artis from D12, which very much stays the same throughout the whole track albeit with some pauses and removal of elements to allow Eminem's voice to take more of the spotlight for brief moments. \n\nEm flat out states that this track is no more than 'a bullshit hook in between two long ass verses'. It sort of sounds like he\u2019s making fun of the listener for putting any emotional investment into this track, which he\u2019s no stranger to doing. But looking deeper into the lyrics, there\u2019s nothing much that you really have to latch onto. Em is just flowing and rhyming really effortlessly. \n\nHe references Flo Rida and Brooke Hogan, throws a shout-out to the track\u2019s producer, and makes a witty remark about Michael Jackson, who at the point of the album\u2019s release had only been dead for just under a year. The whole track is just Em reminding us that he\u2019s very good at what he does, culminating in the hooks where he tells us he\u2019s on fire the way he\u2019s able to rap so well.\n\nEvery week there will be a new song that gets featured at the top of the subreddit. Users can leave a comment and the song that gets the most votes might be the new Song of the Week. Suggestions for improving the next post are encouraged.\n\n**This week's Nominator:** [RedHood11006](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eminem/comments/1dia59d/song_of_the_week_576_drug_ballad/l92jm6q/)\n\n**The Song:** [On Fire](https://play.spotify.com/track/6HLZaECJKDjNE0jiGBeqxz) - [iTunes](https://music.apple.com/nl/album/on-fire/1440759247?i=1440759526)\n\n**In-App link(s):** spotify:track:6HLZaECJKDjNE0jiGBeqxz\n\n**Featuring Artist(s):** None\n\n**Length:** 3:33\n\n**Recorded:** 2009 - 2010\n\n**Release:** June 18, 2010\n\n**Album(s):** [Recovery](https://play.spotify.com/album/3PogVmhNucYNfyywZvTd7F) - [iTunes](https://music.apple.com/nl/album/recovery/1440759247)\n\n**In-App link(s):** spotify:album:3PogVmhNucYNfyywZvTd7F\n\n**Sample(s):** [Peace and Love \\(Amani Na Mapenzi\\): Movement IV \\(Encounter\\) - Mandrill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXCcPAk2NBY)    \n\n**Media:** Album: [Cover](http://i.imgur.com/nEnmIUJ.jpg) / [Alternative](http://i.imgur.com/Fetlz20.png) - [Back](http://i.imgur.com/Fo7s39m.jpg)\n\n**Label(s):** [Shady Records](http://shadyrecords.com/), [Aftermath](http://www.aftermathmusic.com/), [Interscope](http://www.interscope.com/)\n\n**Format:** Digital, Disc, Vinyl\n\n**Producer(s):** Mr. Porter\n\n**Extra:** [Lyrics ](https://genius.com/Eminem-on-fire-lyrics) | Video: [Official Audio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmqSuMX5fyM) - [Lyric Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DQispWoIyA) | Full header image\n\n**Live Performances:** [Red Bull EmSee Freestyle Battle Event 2010](https://youtu.be/caaHdG5RJo8?t=176)\n\nThis is an open thread for you to share your thoughts on the current SotW or to nominate a new song.

            "Might be a corny answer but I\u2019ve always admired him for being a great father. He gave his daughter the life he never had. I also think it\u2019s such a wholesome thing that he adopted his other 2 daughters, he got them both out of bad living situations and one of them is the child of his ex wife\u2019s lover, lots of men couldn\u2019t look past that. I think Marshall is a great person deep down despite what he wants us to think.",
            "I feel like he\u2019s a rare example of honest and successful recovery. He remembers what he\u2019s been through and where he came from, but he\u2019s always been generous with his friends and given a lot to charity. He keeps going despite failures, and while I\u2019m not a Stan, I find him to be quite inspiring.",
            "He has given done a lot of work with charities, donated huge sums, started the Marshall Mathers Foundation which focuses primarily on at risk youth in the Detroit area and we can't forget Mom's spaghetti and the many less fortunate that he feeds through the restaurant. He has also helped lesser known artists and often shouts out his musical influences which helps to introduce them to new audiences. Em has also used his platform to speak on political issues and especially issues that affect the black community, which Em credits with saving his life. But if you ask Em the best thing he has done it would probably be raising 3 daughters who don't seem like your usual rich brats.",
