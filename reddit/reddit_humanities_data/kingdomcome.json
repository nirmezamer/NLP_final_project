        "content": "Edit: I am trying to update this as comments come along :)\n\nSo many people are buying KCD nowadays and the least we can do is help them out and make sure we get some momentum rolling towards the release of the new game. I suggest that we make a sticky thread about this for all newcomers to see, and try to answer issues below that thread. Reddit's searching algorithm isn't the best, and there is a chance a player will read only a couple of tips before they give up on their search.\n\nHere are some tips from me :) Combat is at the bottom.\n\n* **Henry: You are a lowborn peasant who can barely fistfight, can't use a sword and can't read.** Your performance in this game is heavily tied to Henry's skills. You can't take on 2 Bandits with a sword if your sword level is 1. There is nothing more natural than trying something again later or running away from a fight. You are a 16 year old manchild whose first scene is oversleeping and slacking off from work. Embrace that, and you will become Henry.\n* **Prologue: Not spoiling anything, the prologue is a tad long.** As a new player you might not notice when it actually ends. Let the game railroad you for a little while. Afterwards the game will ask you to go to a town relatively far from your area, that's when the game slowly starts to open up.\n* **Saving: You need to drink \"Schnapps\" to save the game.** You can brew it, steal it or buy it. If you have money, spend it on Schanpps and Bandages in the early game.\n   * u/baksteen-13\\*\\*: **You can sleep in owned Beds to save the game!\\*\\***\n   * u/DraefilkToo: **Map of all save & sleep slots in the game:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/kingdomcome/comments/11ti14q/i\\_mapped\\_out\\_all\\_the\\_sleep\\_save\\_spots\\_i\\_know\\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/kingdomcome/comments/11ti14q/i_mapped_out_all_the_sleep_save_spots_i_know_of/)\n   * u/mark_from_ca\\*\\*: **Use \u201cSave&Exit\u201d as you get a free save slot.** Be sure to click \u201cResume\u201d when reentering the game as it won\u2019t appear in the Load Save list.\n* **Alchemy: Potion-brewing is an immersive minigame and opens up a great variety of buffs.** \n   * u/shrekisloveAO : **A****lchemy really lets you make a lot of mistakes.** For example, when making saviour schnapps, you can completely skip the boiling and grinding, so it goes like this: add wine, add 1 nettle and 2 belladona, finish potion\n* **Eating: You can eat from any cooking pot that other people use for free.**\n   * u/Greeklibertarian27\\*\\*: **Don\u2019t overeat.** Due to my experience with previous games such as stalker anomaly and FNV I always carried copious amounts of food that I had to consume so as to not go stale. However, this constant eating ate both of my stamina and my inventory space.\u00a0\n* **Training: Captain Bernard can be used for training, just outside Rattay's east gate.** It is crucial that you spend some time training with him. Wake up, train, eat something, train, go to bed. Try to gain a couple of levels with your favored weapon before getting into action.\n   * u/Nast33 **-** **Train with Bernard until you learn Master Strike.** It's the most important technique and that's when you know training is basically over and you've learned everything you need for the whole game. \\[To which I would say, as u/Jinglemisk : \"Come on mate let the guy have some fun!\"\\]\n* **Reading: You will get a quest to learn how to read**. Do it, and steal as many books as you can. Read books while sitting on benches (select them from Inventory). You will gain a lot of skills by doing this.\n* **Clothes and Hygiene: Clothing affects your Charisma, people will treat you as a Knight if you are wearing expensive Armor or noblemen's clothing.** As you travel and fight your clothing will get muddy. Your Charisma checks will be affected negatively by dirt. Wash your clothes and take a bath every now and then.\n* **Looting: Be smart with your inventory capacity.**\n   * u/pouziboy **- For the love of god, don't take everything** (...) I was looting everything and even without any stealing and thieving shenanigans ended up with enough money for life in the middle of the game because I was hauling every single piece of equipment to the shops to sell. Think about the weight to price ratio. That hauberk might seem valuable with price of 700 groschen but it also weighs 20 lbs? Leave it be. I found it's enough to loot things with 100 groschen per 1 lb of weight. Got an item that weighs 3 lbs but only costs 220 groschen? Leave it right there, not worth the hassle. Don't let your greedy lizard brain turn the game into Kingdom Come: Pawnshop Crap Hauling Simulator as I did. As I always do. And will do so with the next game for sure as well.\n* **Bow: Bow is hard to use at first, but very powerful and rewarding.**\n   * u/Noriadin\\*\\*:\\*\\*\u00a0**If you're really struggling with upping your bow skill and want exp cheese for it (or if you're roleplaying a Henry who would do this), go kill as many livestock in the fields as you can.** Easy to get hits and also a good way to practice your aim. You will also get a pretty small increase in hunting exp from cows and pigs.\n* **Hunting:\u00a0It is magical to admire the deers, but even better to hunt them.**\n   * u/pouziboy **- Need money? Go shoot some game and then sell the meat**. You can fill your inventory and horse inventory with a few dead animals and then sell all the meat in one or two goes. Much better way of earning than selling every singular dirty piece of underpants you were able to get from dead bandits.\n* **Crime: Use a torch at night, it is a crime not to carry one at night.** People will hear you if you are walking around in Mail Boots. People will see you if you are wearing an orange overcoat. Wear simple shoes and a black shirt when sneaking and stealing. Bribing guards is easier if you have better quality clothing (see above). You can go to jail in this game. People will remember your crimes if you yeet someone and run away.\n* **Stealth (Pickpocketing and Lockpicking): Two great minigames (or one great minigame and ehhhh minigame on consoles) that combine your skill and Henry\u2019s.**\n   * u/frankfooter18 **- Even though you may not want to make your Henry into a thief like character but it will help with certain missions.** Under the inventory menu you can see Henry\u2019s stats which will show you how loud or how visible your clothes are on your character. After the long intro of the game, you will learn stealth from Miller Peshek and he will teach you lock picking and pickpocketing. Lock picking may be very loud if not done correctly so for beginners try a chest that\u2019s in the woods (investigation points, accidents, camps) or at Miller Peshek mill. Try pickpocketing on sleeping NPC but be careful not to get caught in towns by guards. Best if you try it in camps like lock picking chest. When you reach level 5 in stealth, pick the perk that makes you stealth kill enemies and buy a dagger or get one in a chest or pickpocketing. This perk will also help with certain missions as well as getting ride of enemy camps.\u00a0\n   * u/EvanMcc18 **- Lockpicking has two options Original and Simplified.** This is more for the Console Players. I myself played it on PlayStation before PC. Lockpicking on console is very hard. I would recommend Simplified it still gives a challenge but you won't be getting frustrated breaking Ten Lockpicks on Easy Chests. For PC Lockpicking is basically the same on either simplified or Original.\n* **Maintaining Your Weapons: Use dirt-cheap bandit weapons to practice sharpening your sword at the blacksmith's grindstone.** There is also a chance that doing it wrong will reduce its durability, so use an irrelevant sword and sell it later. If you have the time, sharpen the weapons you have before selling them.\n* **Haggling: After you fill your \"shopping basket\", you will have a chance to Haggle.** You can negotiate for lower buy / higher sell prices. Don't overdo it or they will get pissed off.\n* **Horses: You are given a horse, but you can buy new ones.** You don't keep horses you steal, you have to \"own\" them. After owning a horse, you can dump your Inventory for extra space. Buy horseshoes and tacks to increase its speed. Lower quality horses will get scared in combat.\n* **Travel: You can fast travel between certain locations.** When fast travelling you will encounter people on roads: Travellers, Beggars, or bandit ambushes. A faster horse allows you to run. If you fail escaping the encounter, you can \"manually\" run by them. Do that in the first couple of levels.\n* **Farkle: Learn Farkle, it is extremely easy compared to games like Caravan or Gwent**. It is fun and the perfect way to pass time and earn some extra bucks.\n* **Combat: Combat in this game is half tactics, half equipment; there is nothing more noble and masculine than running away from a fight**.\u00a0 You can kill 3 Knights if you are tactical. You will get beaten to death by starving peasants if your equipment sucks. If there are at least two enemies, run backwards while engaging them. Getting flanked is brutal in the game because someone you can't see is slamming your back with a hammer. Don't turn around and run, they can tackle you and push you to the ground if you are not fast enough.\n* **Hardcore: Hardcore is the single greatest way to play KCD, but no first-time player should (IMO) be using it.** Hardcore removes the HUD, applies some debuffs, and removes the player\u2019s map marker (so it is impossible to tell where you are just by looking at the map)\n   * u/EvanMcc18 - **Previous experience and Knowledge of Game Mechanics and the World Map really helps with Hardcore Mode.** Without it you can be frustrated very quickly but entirely up to the player.\n* **Maps: Kingdom Come as heavenly cartography.** Learning the map is 10x more important in Hardcore, but rest assured that both the Wiki and interactive maps online will help you out if you are stuck.\n   * u/DraefilkToo - Interactive Map [https://kingdomcomemap.github.io/#2/2048.0/2048.0](https://kingdomcomemap.github.io/#2/2048.0/2048.0)\n* **DLCs: They are fantastic additions and cheaper than pizza.**\u00a0\n   * u/EvanMcc18 - **(on DLCs). DLC quest options in dialogue are usually coloured blue and marked with an icon.**\n* **Jesus Christ be praised: Audibly say this whenever you walk up to a store, mount your horse, dismount your horse, eating something, anything.**",

            "This is probably a really small thing and Im not sure if its worth adding to something like this, but when pickpocketing, do not steal keys as they are not marked as stolen goods. When I stopped stealing keys, all my problems with random stops and searches disappeared.",

One last thing, like it was mentioned above wear dark clothes, no armor, light fabric clothes etc. when doing stealth.  Under the inventory menu you can see Henrys stats which will show you how loud or how visible your clothes are on your character.  Hope this helps because it helped me and even helping me while replaying the game again!",

            "Don't like brewing for the schnapps or anything else? I feel you. Gotta do it anyway. You might be surprised how fun the rhythm is, but just get to level 10, get \"Routine\", and you are set my son.\n\n(it's a perk that lets you skip the process for any recipe you've successfully brewed a potion for.)",
            ">Use Save&Exit as you get a free save slot.** Be sure to click Resume when reentering the game as it wont appear in the Load Save list.\n\nIt does appear in the Load Save list, as long as you are in the main menu. It's just hidden while inside a save (i.e. actually playing the game)."
