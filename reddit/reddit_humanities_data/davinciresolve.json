            "Is there a way to do a dynamic pan using the cut page?  \nI'm pretty sure I once saw it on a video, but I forgot and can't find how",
            "Open the inspector and you can use dynamic zoom. You can use the tools to map the zoom start and end. Make the green and red boxes and equal size and it turns into a pan tool essentially.",
            "If I understand you correctly...I think what you're looking for can be done with a compound clip. I've had edits where the transition gets glitchy or just unevenly represented when trying to add the transition to the end of clips on multiple tracks at once. \n\nI've gotten around this by selecting the two clips and turning them into a compound clip and then applying the transition to that new clip (that is now on only 1 track)...hope that helps!",
            "Ended up figuring this out yesterday and it worked great, thank you!",
            "Ah - sure, no worries. Glad to hear you got it!",
            "Is there a way to essentially combine two tracks (say, footage below and a PNG overlay above) and have them combine for a transition to another track on the base level? Like having the source of the transition be both tracks flattened into each other? Whenever I try and do a crossfade to an end title, I get mixing issues (the stuff that the PNG is intended to cover becomes visible during the crossfade).\n\nI'd love a way to kind of collapse multiple tracks together for the purpose of transitioning into a single clip, I run into this problem a lot with motion graphics.\n\nI'm guessing I should be doing a nested timeline for clips with overlayed graphics instead?",
            "Thanks for your reply!\n\nI knew this, but I wanted the preset that was somewhere, idk where.  \nTurn out, if you go to the cut page and select \"Tools\" at the bottom left side of the preview window, you can activate the dynamic zoom from there. But it also has a \"Pan Preset\" which zooms both green and red windows a little, and puts them left and right, so it truly is a dynamic zoom.\n\nThe only problems with this, is that it doesn't have a top-bottom one, and you can resize both of them at the same time, so one might be slightly bigger if you were to resize them"

        "content": "Waqas Qazi has already been widely panned by the industry, yet he continues to shamelessly lure gullible students into his fraudulent \"Freelance Colorist Masterclass\".\n\nFraudulent for two key reasons:\n\n1. The course itself (1000 bucks, often discounted to 500+) offers a comprehensive intro to the basics. And that's it. Beyond those basic processes, the snake-oil scam unfolds in the form of a flurry of \"secret sauces\" that represent anything but professional grading approaches. Most of them are extremely out-dated and out-of-context rip-offs from various other YouTube tutorials. His look-building structure and process is erratic, badly or not at all explained and riddled with problems. To top it up, Qazi clearly does not even understand storytelling and the creative side of color-grading.\n2. His so-called Facebook \"FCM Competition\" is not really a competition, but a scheme for Qazi - and his new partner and moderator Marieta Farfarova (a small-time Insta/YouTube colorist) - to learn from his students. Imagine that. Paying students are eager to make it in the industry, they are avid learners who constantly acquire new knowledge, tricks and hacks from other reputable YouTube tutorials, to then naturally apply them to Qazi's weekly competition projects. He requires participants to share what they do in every single node, with screenshots, etc. but then doesn't review them in the required constructive ways. Instead, Qazi simply uses them to pick up new tricks/approaches and then instantly creates his next \"secret sauce!\" video, posts it on his own social media sales channels and as marketing and sales support for his \"masterclass\". Giving credit to anyone? Sharing revenue? You know the answer...\n\nWhat a beautifully fraudulent business model, one that is decidedly useless to anyone serious about upping their color grading skills.\n\nSpend your money on courses by real professionals and mentors, for instance Dado Valentic, Darren Mostyn, Cullen Kelly, Daria Fissoun, Walter Volpatto...or spend 90 bucks on a range of short courses on Lowepost.\n\nJust stay away from those scammers Waqas Qazi and his partner Marieta Farfarova.",
