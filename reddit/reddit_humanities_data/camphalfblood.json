I love True Crime, Crime Procedural dramas (like Criminal Minds), reading (mostly YA fantasy), aesthetics and fashion, learning about the uses of plants in different cultures, and Kpop. My general aesthetic is something like dollette with a lot of pastel colors, bows, light pink, and lace. I\u2019m autistic, ADHD, and OCD so that\u2019s fun. I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m a daughter of Aphrodite.",

        "content": "I heard a few times in reviews and stuff that the budget for the TV show (120 million) was one of the biggest budgets for an 8 episode series outside of massive long standing shows. \nBut it doesn't really have much in the way of episode scenes, there have been a lot of shows that did much better from an editing/effects stand point then the show did. \nDoes anyone know how thet split up the budget and why there wasn't more 'epic' stuff like there was in the books?",

            "They haven't said how much they spent on what, but the LED volume stage can cost $100k a day just to rent (not including the costs of generating artwork and set dressing), so that's 25% of the budget for each episode already. They built an enormous set and filled it with water for Episode 5's Thrill Ride O'Love, and actually built the big wheel and some of the rollercoaster for Waterland. That can't have come cheap.",
            "I don\u2019t know how much this cost. But they decided to make Grover wear shorts. It looked neat, but I am guessing it also used some of the budget to make his legs.",
            "It's kind of surprising that it was more expensive than Arcane, despite having one episode less.",
            "I'm honestly starting to questioning if you're all talking about the same show I've watched, because it'd be only way your complains would make sense",
            "Yeah I definitely understand some of the other comments explaining where some of the budget would have gone (I.e more shooting days because you're working with kids and locations) but I still found the show to not look great. And I understand cutting some things to reduce budget (ie. hellhound at camp, Argus) but it seemed that many of the actions scenes were so short. And yes they are pretty short in the book, but that's what a visual medium is for, you can expand on things that may be tedious to read in a book. It just seemed like many scenes were cut short like the Fury at the museum and on the bus and one of the worst examples at Waterland when it cuts to black and Annabeth just says \"you just used your powers\", like that would've been nice to see.\n\n I know this show isn't supposed to be prestige TV but I just found that it looked flat and largely filmed in a boring way. But that's a problem with a fair amount of recent shows and movies, especially Disney, big budgets that don't really seem to show on screen.",
            "That is very interesting actually. I don't mean to be critical of the show it was mostly I heard a lot that 120 million for an 8 episode series is a rare thing yet it still seemed kinda average so was unsure",
            "they built an entire ferris wheel but couldnt find locations to film on?",
            "Its just Disney is actually dogshit at using the money wisely.\n\nLike why are they using the extremely expensive volume screen for the Ares fight??? Just go to a beach??? They do this with all their shows. Like they spent 230M+ on Secret Invasion???",
            "That makes a lot of sense, thank you. \nI didn't hate the first series but I felt it has a lot of room to improve and from some of the reviews I watched the budget kept getting  brought up so I was curious. Thank for for explaining :)",
