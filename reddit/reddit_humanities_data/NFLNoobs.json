            "[https://operations.nfl.com/media/gsaaatbb/2023-rulebook.pdf](https://operations.nfl.com/media/gsaaatbb/2023-rulebook.pdf)\n\nThis is the rulebook.\n\nDon't be afraid to ask a question that can be answered by reading that, but you can figure out lots of stuff on your own and I have gotten lots of understanding by seeing something in a game, then trying to understand how or why by seeing the exact rules.\n\nStarting on page 86 of the pdf, there is over 100 pages of examples of game situations and what the correct ruling is.\n\nWhat happens if the return man on a punt muffs the ball on their 5 yard line and then recovers it in the end zone?\n\nIt's a touchback. Instead of getting lost in the section of the rulebook about impetus and scrimmage kicks and touchbacks, you can just see the exact example\n\n>A.R. 9.11 BOUNCES INTO END ZONE WHERE TEAM B RECOVERS  \nFourth-and-10 on A40. The punt is muffed by B2 on the B5. It bounces into the end zone, where B2 recovers.  \nRuling: B\u2019s ball, first-and-10 on B20. Touchback.",
            ">What are the positions and what do they do?\n\n# Offense\n\n* Quarterback (QB): Mostly throws, sometimes runs.  They are the player most in charge of the offense.  They are the first player given the ball, and their job is to get it to their team's playmakers\n* Runningback (RB): Mostly runs, sometimes catches, sometimes blocks.  Their job is to be handed or sometimes thrown the ball and for them to try to get yards.  Sometimes, they will be used on passing plays as an extra blocker. \n* Wide Receiver (WR): Mostly catches.  Their job is to try to get open, then catch the ball.  Sometimes they will be handed the ball to run, or try to make blocks for the runningback\n* Tight End (TE): Mostly Catches or Blocks.  They are halfway between an offensive lineman and a wide receiver.  Sometimes they are asked to get open and catch passes, and sometimes they are used as an extra blocker.  Depending on the player and team, they might do mostly one or the other, or both.\n* Fullback (FB): Mostly blocks, sometimes runs.  Most teams don\u2019t have one anymore, but their job is mostly to run in front of the running back and block for them.  Sometimes they are given the ball themselves.  \n* Offensive Line (OL): Only Blocks. Made up of in order from left to right a Left Tackle, Left Guard, Center, Right Guard, Right Tackle.  Their job is to block, and they are not allowed to be handed the ball or catch it.  \n\n# Defense\n\n* Edge Rushers (EDGE): They line up on the ends of the defensive line, and their main job is to rush the QB.  Depending on the team, they might be Defensive Ends(DE) or Outside Linebackers (OLB)\n* Interior Defensive Linemen (IDL): They line up between the Edge Rushers.  They tend to be bigger, and their job is to rush the QB and close gaps so the RBs can\u2019t run through them\n* Linebackers (LB): They line up behind the defensive line, and do a little of everything.  \n* Cornerbacks (CB): Their job is to follow the wide receivers and make sure they don\u2019t get open and don\u2019t catch the ball.  If the team has more than 2 CBs playing, the 3rd is a Nickleback, and the 4th is a Dimeback.  \n* Safeties (S): They are typically the last line of defense and line up all the way in the back.  They make sure nothing gets past the other guys.  They can be a Full Safety and a Strong Safety",
            ">What's the best way to learn about football or the NFL?\n\nIf you have someone who knows already, watching the game and asking questions is the best way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlaying Madden, the official NFL video game is another great way to learn the basics and some popular players.  It\u2019s not perfect, but it will give you the basic ideas.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor learning players, and maintaining interest, fantasy football is great.  It\u2019s best to join a league before the regular season starts, but you should be able to find a league at any point in the year.  I recommend r/NarFFL which is the Reddit based league.",
            ">What kind of posts are allowed, frowned upon, or not allowed? For those not allowed, where would be a better place for them?\n\nWe try to be a welcoming community for new fans, so the bar for what constitutes a question worth asking is pretty low and we can still try to be flexible with people askign honest questions in good faith. There are a few things that don't really tend to fit, though:\n\n* Anything explicitly covered in the FAQ; that's why it's there.\n* Questions about your fantasy football team/league. There are dedicated subreddits for that like /r/fantasyfootball and /r/findaleague \n* Opinion-based questions like, \"What are everyone's thoughts on Joe Burrow?\" or \"Which coach do you think will get fired first this season?\" Those kind of open-ended questions are better suited for r/nfl, if not as their own post then as something in the daily free talk threads\n* Promotion of outside works. If you have a podcast or blog or Youtube channel, that's cool. But this isn't the place to advertise it.",
            ">What is the purpose of this sub?\n\nThis is a subreddit for people who want to learn more about NFL and for people who want to help others in learning more about the NFL.  There are no \u201cStupid Questions\u201d here.\n\nAny question about American football is basically acceptable, but most fans and most posters here are primarily familiar with the NFL.",
            ">Why don't players play multiple positions, or both offense and defense?\n\nThree main reasons.\n\nFirst is football is a tiring and demanding sport.  If you\u2019re playing more exhausted than you need to be, you\u2019re not playing at your best.  Teams are allowed to substitute players as often as they want, so why not make use of it?\n\nSecond is any time you\u2019re practicing one thing, you could be practicing another thing.  If you\u2019re spending half your time learning a different position, that means you\u2019re not as practiced as you could be at your original position.\n\nThe third reason is talent.  Because you can substitute players as often as you want, it means you need to be more talented at your second position than someone else who\u2019s first position.  If you\u2019re a WR, you\u2019d need to also be a better lets say corner, than someone who\u2019s made it into the NFL training their whole life to be a corner.\n\nSome teams also go the other way too.  Instead of one \u201cworkhorse\u201d RB, you might have a guy who\u2019s big and strong and good in short yardage situations.  You might have a small shifty guy who\u2019s good at catching for long yardage situations.  Each guy is better at their respective role, than most RBs are at every role.",
            ">How much do teams have to spend on players, and what is cap space?\n\nThe NFL has a limit on how much each team can spend, which is called the Salary Cap.  It changes every year, based on how much money the NFL makes as a whole.  [You can find this year, and previous year's here.](https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/cba/) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[You can find each individual team's cap space here.](https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/cap/)",
            ">What are the Rules/Guidelines?\n\n1. Don't be a jerk. That includes insulting other people for team allegiance, or giving knowingly wrong answers based on team rivalries or memes or whatever. Everyone has a right to ask questions and learn.\n2. Any question about American football is basically acceptable, but most fans and most posters here are primarily familiar with the NFL.\n3. This isn't really a place to try and argue an opinion. For example, it would be fair to ask, \"why do people seem to hold Player A in higher regard than Player B, even though I looked them up and they have similar numbers?\" but something like, \"Player B is better than Player A, change my mind\" probably won't stick around.\n4. Self-promotion of your website or blog or YouTube channel is frowned upon and those posts are typically removed. OC isn't automatically banned, but the point of this subreddit is for people to ask questions about football, not to advertise your football-related works.\n5. Posts about illegally streaming NFL games will be removed. Reddit has cracked down on subs that traffic in illegal streams of sporting events, and we'd much prefer to keep this one open.\n6. There are no stupid questions here.",
            ">I want to play, or am playing football. How do I learn, get better, or what position should I play?\n\nThese questions are best answered by your coach, and depends on your area, and team.\n\nThey are there to help, and I\u2019m sure would love to answer your questions, and see you are putting a lot of effort and thought into it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can also try /r/footballstrategy, they have a lot of regulars with real coaching experience at lower levels.",
            ">Are the NFL's overtime rules unfair?\n\nYes, a little, but not nearly as much as it seems.\n\nThe winner of the coin flip in the regular season has a 86(win 53%)-67(loss 41%)-10(tie 6%) record.\n\nThe current rules are designed to shorten games, which means decrease the chance of injuries, which go up as players are exhausted.  The NFL dosen\u2019t believe it\u2019s worth the added risk to try to make overtime more fair"

And I love that for a very long time, this place was made up of people with the same mindset, and we could have a very positive, relaxing community with a lot of good will.\n\nIn the past year, the number of subscribers here has doubled. Total pageviews are up by **six million** over last year. Growth has been explosive. And on the one hand, that's great! More people discovering and learning about this sport is what we're all here for. But on the other hand, it means we need to define the rules a little bit more to keep this place clean. When I log in and see any thread with more than 100 comments, I'm certain that nothing good is happening there. This is a question-and-answer type of subreddit, and there's really no question about football that couldn't be answered in less than 20 comments.\n\nSo where are we going with this? I'm not interested in being a content dictator, just keeping the place clean. Those of you who are in here answering legitimate questions all the time, I see you, and I value your input. What do you guys think about rules that should be added/changed? I'll start putting some individual ideas in separate comments here and we can talk about where we want to go with them.

            "**What team should I support?**\n\nThese posts are annoying, because there have been ten million of them and OP didn't bother to do the bare minimum to research.\n\nThat said, these questions are at least coming from someone new who's looking to get into the game, which is exactly in the spirit of the sub. They're guilty of being lazy, but these aren't malicious. I'm a lot more patient with this question, but we're going to reach a point where I'll probably need to set up Automod to answer them.",
            "**What's everyone's opinions on X?**\n\nIt's not a general discussion subreddit. Just sharing opinions, either OP's or anyone else's, isn't the ask-a-question, get-an-answer style that I think we should try to maintain. Plus, they almost always devolve into arguments in the comments.",
            "Oooh I thought of another one:\n\n**Is the NFL rigged?**\n\nNo, it isn't, and people who insist that it is are the worst. I kind of want to make an explicit rule to ban conspiracy theorists because this is a subreddit where people should be able to learn about the game, and conspiracy nuts are intentionally spreading false information to mislead others.\n\nObviously I'm very personally annoyed by this but I'm open to hearing how anyone else thinks it should be handled.",
            "**[Question about buying merchandise]?**\n\nAll right, sure. It's not quite what we usually talk about here, but it's usually a fair question for a new fan to ask if jerseys run large or if a website looks trustworthy, etc.",

If you google \"what does the [X coach] do?\" a lot of the results will be threads from this very sub.\n\nWhat I really wish was that we could have an auto-moderator that was smart enough to pick up on those redundant questions, immediately remove them, and send the OP a link (or all the links) to past threads answering the question, or just giving them an answer automatically.",
