And I love that for a very long time, this place was made up of people with the same mindset, and we could have a very positive, relaxing community with a lot of good will.\n\nIn the past year, the number of subscribers here has doubled. Total pageviews are up by **six million** over last year. Growth has been explosive. And on the one hand, that's great! More people discovering and learning about this sport is what we're all here for. But on the other hand, it means we need to define the rules a little bit more to keep this place clean. When I log in and see any thread with more than 100 comments, I'm certain that nothing good is happening there. This is a question-and-answer type of subreddit, and there's really no question about football that couldn't be answered in less than 20 comments.\n\nSo where are we going with this? I'm not interested in being a content dictator, just keeping the place clean. Those of you who are in here answering legitimate questions all the time, I see you, and I value your input. What do you guys think about rules that should be added/changed? I'll start putting some individual ideas in separate comments here and we can talk about where we want to go with them.

            "**What's everyone's opinions on X?**\n\nIt's not a general discussion subreddit. Just sharing opinions, either OP's or anyone else's, isn't the ask-a-question, get-an-answer style that I think we should try to maintain. Plus, they almost always devolve into arguments in the comments.",
            "**[Question about buying merchandise]?**\n\nAll right, sure. It's not quite what we usually talk about here, but it's usually a fair question for a new fan to ask if jerseys run large or if a website looks trustworthy, etc.",

If you google \"what does the [X coach] do?\" a lot of the results will be threads from this very sub.\n\nWhat I really wish was that we could have an auto-moderator that was smart enough to pick up on those redundant questions, immediately remove them, and send the OP a link (or all the links) to past threads answering the question, or just giving them an answer automatically.",
            "**Is there a reason why [incredibly minute detailed thing about football like why they use chains to measure downs or how wide the field is or what people do when it rains or something]?**\n\nI don't mind these. If it's weird but still football-related, cool I guess. Where else are you going to ask? If it's something that can be answered in one comment... great! Answer achieved, job done!",

Ofc, watching the games can kind of make u realize which linemen are better than others, based on speed, and blocking, but how do I look at a lineman\u2019s stats?

Unless the Steelers are playing or there's only one game on, or something epic is happening, I will avoid watching a single game.\n\nThat being said, something happened. There was this one year where the networks went crazy with commercials. I mean it felt like every other play there was a commercial. Since then, when I do watch a game on a network, it seems like they've haven't gone haywire like that.",
            "They do this. If you pay attention to when the commercials are aired, the bulk of them are early. All the commercial time outs (where the game stops because the broadcast is in commercial) all happen in the first half.
