            "Can I suggest that you make this a wiki page, instead of a post? That way, it doesn't have someone's name on it.\n\nObviously, you've given credit to /u/weeklyrob and you're not trying to steal their work. But they wrote 98% of this in their own post. You tweaked it a bit, but it's weird to see it under your name as a post, where you get karma for it and people thanking you.",

LaRousse has been mentioned a few times in threads I saw, but there may be others.",
            "I thought about it, and the only reason I didn't do just that is that I'm worried the visibility of the page would drop drastically. We *really* want people to see the FAQ easily, so that users don't spend time writing posts that we'll reluctantly have to remove. Common reposts aren't pleasant for anyone, be it the OPs, the active readers, or us mods who have to remove good-faith questions.\n\nThat being said, I share your concern, and I'll see what we can do to make this smarter. Thanks for bringing this up with me! I sure hope people don't see it as karma-farming in the meantime. I originally wanted to keep weeklyrob's FAQ, but there were outdated bits and new entries we wanted to add. Asking him to make all future changes wasn't a viable option.",

And it is not correct.\n\nBelle journ\u00e9e or Belle soir\u00e9e are always used with \"C'est une\".

            "Not sure if this is entirely correct, maybe a native speaker could chip in on this but if you add the -\u00e9e to words like this, they not only become female, but also their use is now different. \n\n\nAdding an -\u00e9e refers to a time span (maybe in your head you can ask yourself if you can do something \u201cover the course of\u201d in the sentence you wanna express). For example:\n\n\nBonsoir = Good evening (technically just refers to the evening as good)\n\nBonne soir\u00e9e (short form of passez une bonne soir\u00e9e and therefore used as goodbye) = spend the remainder of your evening well \n\n\nUn jour, je vais jouer du piano = one day, I will play the piano\n\nJe vais jouer au piano toute la journ\u00e9e = I will play the piano all day\n\n\n\u00c7a fait trois ans, j\u2019ai fini mes \u00e9tudes = I finished my studies three years ago\n\nL\u2019ann\u00e9e prochaine, je vais commencer mes \u00e9tudes = (over the course of the) next year, I will begin my studies"
