            "Can I suggest that you make this a wiki page, instead of a post? That way, it doesn't have someone's name on it.\n\nObviously, you've given credit to /u/weeklyrob and you're not trying to steal their work. But they wrote 98% of this in their own post. You tweaked it a bit, but it's weird to see it under your name as a post, where you get karma for it and people thanking you.",

There are some sporadic threads looking for these, but I think they are resources that deserve a section here. For more advanced learners, may also help with immersion. LaRousse has been mentioned a few times in threads I saw, but there may be others.",
            "I thought about it, and the only reason I didn't do just that is that I'm worried the visibility of the page would drop drastically. We *really* want people to see the FAQ easily, so that users don't spend time writing posts that we'll reluctantly have to remove. Common reposts aren't pleasant for anyone, be it the OPs, the active readers, or us mods who have to remove good-faith questions.\n\nThat being said, I share your concern, and I'll see what we can do to make this smarter. Thanks for bringing this up with me! I sure hope people don't see it as karma-farming in the meantime. I originally wanted to keep weeklyrob's FAQ, but there were outdated bits and new entries we wanted to add. Asking him to make all future changes wasn't a viable option.",

            "It's done, I've just moved the FAQ to a wiki page and this page is now a shortcut to both the FAQ and Resources. I've actually kept only the link to this page in the links at the top of the sub, since you can get to both from here. Fewer things to look at for the user. How is it looking, and what do you think?",
            "Sure, looks good. The FAQ also links to both, so you could just link there if you're trying to save people clicks.\n\nBut I might be overthinking it.",
