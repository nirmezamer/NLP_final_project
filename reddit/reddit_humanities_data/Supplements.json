        "content": "Hello, everyone. \n\nOne of our main goals for this sub is to keep the discussions as honest and informative as possible. In the spirit of transparency, we have to inform you that we get messaged semi-daily with companies requesting permission to advertise and market on /r/supplements. There are also far more companies that will skip this and just directly go into the sub and link to their products in the comments. In many cases they will also create new threads that are pure and unapologetic advertising and self-promotion. \n\nWe want to make it clear that **marketing and advertising is unacceptable in /r/supplements**. We want to keep the discussion by users, for users. If we'd allow companies in, the sub would be ruined very quickly.\n\n**What to avoid:**\n\n- A Reddit username that is also a brand name\n\n- Obvious or subtle marketing, self-promotion, and/or advertising\n\n- Customer research\n\n- Linking to your website which sells supplements\n\nThese rules are in-line with the [Reddit anti-spam policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/submit):\n\n> If your contribution to Reddit consists primarily of submitting links to a business that you run, own or otherwise benefit from, tread carefully. Additionally, if you do not participate in other discussions or reply to comments and questions, you may be considered a spammer and banned from Reddit.\n\nDoing any of the aforementioned things will in all likelihood lead to a permanent ban. Appeals may be accepted in some cases if the user is a long-term contributor to the sub and only made an innocent mistake. There will be no appeal for companies that create new accounts with brand names and come directly to /r/supplements with the intent of marketing, doing customer research, and advertising.\n\n**What we accept:**\n\n- Links to blogs or websites that discuss, compare, or review supplements in a neutral/scientific fashion (examples: examine.com, labdoor.com, personal blogs, etc.). However, if we suspect that the link in question is subtle advertising, we will remove it. There's also different ways to link to blogs/articles. For example, the best way would be to create a text post and summarize the article you want to link to. At the end of the post you simply link the article as a [source](www.placelinkhere.com). This is perfectly fine and it shows us that your main focus is to spread good information and not to self-promote. Direct links to well-known websites like examine or labdoor are fine as well.\n\n- Links to research, news, or anything else relevant to supplements. Though the rules about advertising and marketing still apply\n\n- Discussing brands and their quality: Feel free to share your opinion on brand quality. If we suspect you're doing undercover marketing you might be warned and/or banned (i.e. if you say: \"I really liked x supplement it gave me a lot of energy! You can buy it *here*, *here*, and *here*. And *here's* a discount code you can use). \n\nFeel free to share your thoughts below :)\n\n~ The mod team",

Nothing too deep, luckily, but I have at least two a year.

Specifically for probiotics.\n\nI take D3 & K2, B12 & Folate, and C & Iron. I also often chew xylitol gum throughout the day.",
