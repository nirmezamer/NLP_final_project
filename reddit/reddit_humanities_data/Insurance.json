        "content": "This post is designed for people posting here for the first time, for the people that have been volunteering to help here for years and everyone in between.  The stated goal is to foster a friendlier attitude throughout the sub.\n\nIf you are new here, please realize that none of us have any stake in your claim or coverage.  We are not here to sell you anything or to save some company money. Treating responders poorly because you don't like the answer is going to attract a lot of negative attention.\n\nWe get the same questions over and over, and maybe this is the answer that you need:\n\n* *How much will my insurance go up after a ticket/accident/lapse in coverage?*  We don't know unless your state has a statutory requirement for your very specific situation.\n* *My premium went up $X.  How do I fight this?* You can't.  The only thing you can do is shop for new coverage, which we can't do for you.\n* *How much does everyone else pay for coverage?* Unless you're lucky enough to get someone in your exact demographic in your exact part of the world, the answers you're going to get are useless.\n* *How much is my claim worth?* We don't know. (note: if you're asking a more complex question about your claim, that could be very different)\n* *How long will my claim take to close?* We don't know (again: a more complicated question might have different answers)\n* *Why is this person trying to sell me something?* Report that post/comment/chat/private message to the moderators and let them handle that.\n* *Will you help me commit fraud or otherwise break the law?*  No.  Absolutely not.  And we may ban anyone that does try to do that.\n\nUltimately, we are here to help you.  This is a community of volunteers that wants to help navigate a complex system that is one of the lubricants of the financial world.  Lots of lives are impacted by insurance directly and indirectly, and it can be a complicated system.  Here are some things that make a good post where you can get help:\n\n* Location (Country and state/province at a minimum)\n* Type of insurance involved (Auto, Homeowners/Renters, Commercial, Health, something else)\n* A brief description of the problem and any advice you've gotten so far\n\nFinally, here are some definitions of common terms that could help you get taken more seriously:\n\n* Adjuster - the person that handles your claim, makes coverage determinations and processes payments\n* Agent - the person that sells a policy.  Some agents get involved in some claims, although that is the exception to the rule.\n* Underwriter - the person that decides how much a specific policy will cost for a specific risk.\n* Rate - this is the way your final price is calculated and is usually used synonymously with \"premium\", \"cost\" and \"price\".\n* ~~Full coverage~~ \\- don't use this term.  There's no agreed definition, even among the regular posters here.  People asking otherwise good questions or posting good answers that use this term often find themselves down voted to oblivion for including it.\n* No Fault - there are 18 states that, at least to some extent, make automobile bodily injury claims be paid by your own policy first instead of someone that caused your injury.  There is only one state (Michigan) that makes damage to your vehicle No Fault.  All Canadian provinces have some sort of No Fault provision for injuries, which is one reason why we need to know where you are when you're asking questions.\n* Collision coverage - this fixes your car when it collides with something else or another car hits it.\n* Comprehensive coverage (also known as Other Than Collision) - this covers your car for almost everything else, including floods, fires, tree branches and lightening strikes. Usually animal strikes are covered here, but not always. \n* Deductible - this is the amount that you agreed to pay in case of any claim.  Your payment comes before any insurance payment.  Deductibles are occasionally waived, but that's the exception, not the rule.\n\nThis is a community of volunteers that generally understands the insurance system. When we get things wrong, it is usually through lack of information to get a precise answer.  Hopefully this guide will help you get good results.  ",

A new management company took over and made changes. one of them being saying they no longer provide the insurance and we will need to get our own otherwise they will charge us more money to be in compliance. I have a welcome letter that says renters insurance is included. Can they (the management company) change my lease agreement like that? I need an answer before tomorrow otherwise they are going to charge me."

        "content": "It's time for a new reminder about the rules of this sub.  There is *never* any reason to offer to contact another poster privately, especially if that poster has a question about placing coverage or a claim.  Here is the rule:\n\n> The only rule of [r/Insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/) is that solicitation is prohibited. This means asking people to PM for any reason, offering to quote coverages for visitors, or soliciting agents and/or buyers to use your particular carrier. [r/Insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/) should be a place where people come to exchange information and ask questions without worrying about solicitation from agents. This includes adjusters, underwriters and brokers since we do not vet anyone. \n\nYou also received a version of this if you subscribed to the sub.  \n\nIf you think that this doesn't apply to you, please think again.  There are no exceptions in this, including \"but *I* asked *them* to message me!\"  This sub is a safe space for people to ask questions about insurance.  It is not here for anyone to try to profit from it, whether they're an agent, public adjuster, software vendor, personal injury attorney, headhunter, diminished value expert or anyone else that is not here to offer free help with no expectation of remuneration.  \n\nIf you receive a message from someone offering you any sort of business proposition, whether a quote for insurance, legal representation (yes, there are lawyers unethical enough to solicit people on Reddit), damage reports or anything else, please let the moderators know via mod mail or in this thread.  You should also report that message to the admins (we don't see that report, though).  We take things like that seriously.  \n\nWe really don't like banning people.  Seriously, it's the exact opposite of why any of the moderators volunteered for the role.  But we don't vet people before they post, and if people that break the rule find out that we enforce it whenever we see it broken.  \n\nAnd with that in mind, we have a very healthy community of posters that are here not only to help but to make sure that those who can't follow the rules have the damage that they're doing limited.  Thank you to all of you for volunteering to help not only those confused by the insurance process but help keep those that want to think that they're special at bay.",
