        "content": "This post is designed for people posting here for the first time, for the people that have been volunteering to help here for years and everyone in between.  The stated goal is to foster a friendlier attitude throughout the sub.\n\nIf you are new here, please realize that none of us have any stake in your claim or coverage.  We are not here to sell you anything or to save some company money. Treating responders poorly because you don't like the answer is going to attract a lot of negative attention.\n\nWe get the same questions over and over, and maybe this is the answer that you need:\n\n* *How much will my insurance go up after a ticket/accident/lapse in coverage?*  We don't know unless your state has a statutory requirement for your very specific situation.\n* *My premium went up $X.  How do I fight this?* You can't.  The only thing you can do is shop for new coverage, which we can't do for you.\n* *How much does everyone else pay for coverage?* Unless you're lucky enough to get someone in your exact demographic in your exact part of the world, the answers you're going to get are useless.\n* *How much is my claim worth?* We don't know. (note: if you're asking a more complex question about your claim, that could be very different)\n* *How long will my claim take to close?* We don't know (again: a more complicated question might have different answers)\n* *Why is this person trying to sell me something?* Report that post/comment/chat/private message to the moderators and let them handle that.\n* *Will you help me commit fraud or otherwise break the law?*  No.  Absolutely not.  And we may ban anyone that does try to do that.\n\nUltimately, we are here to help you.  This is a community of volunteers that wants to help navigate a complex system that is one of the lubricants of the financial world.  Lots of lives are impacted by insurance directly and indirectly, and it can be a complicated system.  Here are some things that make a good post where you can get help:\n\n* Location (Country and state/province at a minimum)\n* Type of insurance involved (Auto, Homeowners/Renters, Commercial, Health, something else)\n* A brief description of the problem and any advice you've gotten so far\n\nFinally, here are some definitions of common terms that could help you get taken more seriously:\n\n* Adjuster - the person that handles your claim, makes coverage determinations and processes payments\n* Agent - the person that sells a policy.  Some agents get involved in some claims, although that is the exception to the rule.\n* Underwriter - the person that decides how much a specific policy will cost for a specific risk.\n* Rate - this is the way your final price is calculated and is usually used synonymously with \"premium\", \"cost\" and \"price\".\n* ~~Full coverage~~ \\- don't use this term.  There's no agreed definition, even among the regular posters here.  People asking otherwise good questions or posting good answers that use this term often find themselves down voted to oblivion for including it.\n* No Fault - there are 18 states that, at least to some extent, make automobile bodily injury claims be paid by your own policy first instead of someone that caused your injury.  There is only one state (Michigan) that makes damage to your vehicle No Fault.  All Canadian provinces have some sort of No Fault provision for injuries, which is one reason why we need to know where you are when you're asking questions.\n* Collision coverage - this fixes your car when it collides with something else or another car hits it.\n* Comprehensive coverage (also known as Other Than Collision) - this covers your car for almost everything else, including floods, fires, tree branches and lightening strikes. Usually animal strikes are covered here, but not always. \n* Deductible - this is the amount that you agreed to pay in case of any claim.  Your payment comes before any insurance payment.  Deductibles are occasionally waived, but that's the exception, not the rule.\n\nThis is a community of volunteers that generally understands the insurance system. When we get things wrong, it is usually through lack of information to get a precise answer.  Hopefully this guide will help you get good results.  ",

            "i do see quite a lot of repeated questions and i would add a few more for auto claims:\n\n1. Disputed total loss: For first party: Most insurance companies use a market survey to find the market rate of your vehicle. If you disagree, make sure all the options and conditions are correct on your vehicle. If that doesn't work, you can usually submit your own comparables (vehicles that are similar to yours). Your ultimate recourse would be the appraisal clause where you hire an independent appraiser and the insurance company hires an independent appraiser. they then agree upon the value of the vehicle and this will be your settlement amount. For third party, your options are far limited. You can either mitigate through your own collision coverage or pursue the other party in court.\n\n2. Liability disputes. Each insurance company determines the fault of an accident. They may agree or disagree. Police reports do not determine liability. A lot of word vs word disputes are finalized with neither carrier accepting fault for the loss. Options would be to use your collision coverage or sue the other party. \n\n3. I cannot reach my adjuster/my adjuster doesn't return my calls. Very frustrating for sure. A lot of times they'll leave a supervisor's number on their voicemail so try them. You can try also pressing \"0\" and that can sometimes transfer you to a live person in the claims department. Lastly, most companies have a complaint main number. That's a good way to light a fire as usually those complaint calls go up the chain of management. \n\n4. Issues with estimates: When an adjuster writes an estimate, we can only write for what we can see is damaged. When a shop writes for an estimate, they write for what they assume is damaged. This leads to a lot of variances between a field estimate vs shop estimate. Once the vehicle is at a shop and torndown, a reinspection can be done to resolve any missed damaged items. Or get an agreed price with shop.",
            "It might be helpful to make this an automod reply to all posts. Sometimes subreddits even require an acronym be added to posts to allow them to stay up ... [irtr] - I read the rules.",
            "one thing id like to specifically add about auto insurance - an estimate is just an educated guess whats damaged. unless you can physically see the part thats broken, and its proven, its still a guess. \n\nonce the car is taken apart the price only goes up",
            "Depending on the company, sometimes the underwriter just determines if a risk is acceptable or not. The actuary does the pricing. But, great post. \n\nAlso- some of the folks who comment here honestly just hate their jobs, and wanna use this as an outlet to be dicks. Those people suck. That's all I have to add.",

        "content": "It's time for a new reminder about the rules of this sub.  There is *never* any reason to offer to contact another poster privately, especially if that poster has a question about placing coverage or a claim.  Here is the rule:\n\n> The only rule of [r/Insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/) is that solicitation is prohibited. This means asking people to PM for any reason, offering to quote coverages for visitors, or soliciting agents and/or buyers to use your particular carrier. [r/Insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/) should be a place where people come to exchange information and ask questions without worrying about solicitation from agents. This includes adjusters, underwriters and brokers since we do not vet anyone. \n\nYou also received a version of this if you subscribed to the sub.  \n\nIf you think that this doesn't apply to you, please think again.  There are no exceptions in this, including \"but *I* asked *them* to message me!\"  This sub is a safe space for people to ask questions about insurance.  It is not here for anyone to try to profit from it, whether they're an agent, public adjuster, software vendor, personal injury attorney, headhunter, diminished value expert or anyone else that is not here to offer free help with no expectation of remuneration.  \n\nIf you receive a message from someone offering you any sort of business proposition, whether a quote for insurance, legal representation (yes, there are lawyers unethical enough to solicit people on Reddit), damage reports or anything else, please let the moderators know via mod mail or in this thread.  You should also report that message to the admins (we don't see that report, though).  We take things like that seriously.  \n\nWe really don't like banning people.  Seriously, it's the exact opposite of why any of the moderators volunteered for the role.  But we don't vet people before they post, and if people that break the rule find out that we enforce it whenever we see it broken.  \n\nAnd with that in mind, we have a very healthy community of posters that are here not only to help but to make sure that those who can't follow the rules have the damage that they're doing limited.  Thank you to all of you for volunteering to help not only those confused by the insurance process but help keep those that want to think that they're special at bay.",
