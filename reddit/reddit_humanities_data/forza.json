        "content": "Hey everyone-\n\nI'm the Community & Comms Director for Forza, and while I've been around here popping in and out of threads for a while now, we thought it might be helpful to get a general FAQ thread together that the mods can pin. There are *a lot* of us from Turn 10 and Playground Games that read this subreddit every day, so please know that we're taking in your comments and grateful for your support.\n\nHere's some links that might be helpful for topics that we see come up frequently - I'll continue to add to this over time so feel free to check back for more topics that have been added!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTopic: ***I found a glitch/broken thing in the game!***\n\nBasically, if you find bugs or anything that is not working the way you'd expect it to, and it's not a crash, head on over to our [Troubleshooting Hub](https://forums.forza.net/c/troubleshooting/247). You can either upvote threads for existing issues or submit a new issue thread for something someone else has not reported. Getting all the reports of broken stuff here is super helpful for us, as we use the number of upvotes to help us understand how widespread a problem might be in the community and triage which ones we fix accordingly. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTopic: ***Someone was ramming people all over the place during a race - Turn 10 should do something about it.***\n\nYes, we would like to! We want people to be able to have fun, fair, and clean races, so please help us identify people who aren't keeping it fun for everyone and respecting the [Code of Conduct](https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/articles/360035563914-Forza-Code-of-Conduct) by filing a ticket to [Report a Player](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.forzamotorsport.net%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Frequests%2Fnew%3Fticket_form_id%3D360004177714&data=05%7C01%7Caunorris%40microsoft.com%7C652e641371d242de160608da4ff4cb0b%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637910210052939662%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=okIKxhyPc5xUiaNUJ3pxTXT0DXHdERIPjGdTGgwsRYA%3D&reserved=0). It's important to note that in order to take action on your report, we need you to also send us a video of the race showing what happened or a replay. There's more information on how to grab these things to send to us [here](https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/articles/4409070620819-How-to-report-a-player). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTopic: ***I wish this feature in the game was different than the way it is now / I wish this feature was in the game.***\n\nIt's really helpful for us to hear your feedback on what you'd like to see us do differently in our games, so we made the [Suggestions Hub](https://forums.forza.net/c/suggestions/155) for you to give us all your feature requests and suggestions to tweak what's already there. Like the Troubleshooting Hub, our team literally uses this forum every day to understand how much demand there is for all kinds of features and plan out our work. This doesn't mean we'll do everything that's submitted, but we try to respond to threads to let you know when we're moving forward with implementing something, or when we've decided that it's not a fit for the games. \n\n  \n\nTopic: ***I was unfairly banned from the game. Can you reverse it?***\n\nIf you feel that you received a ban that was in error, send us a [ban appeal ticket](https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=4416893002771). We\u2019ll have a different human look at the evidence that went along with your ban for a second opinion and let you know whether it\u2019ll be overturned.\n\n&#x200B;",
