        "content": "Hey everyone-\n\nI'm the Community & Comms Director for Forza, and while I've been around here popping in and out of threads for a while now, we thought it might be helpful to get a general FAQ thread together that the mods can pin. There are *a lot* of us from Turn 10 and Playground Games that read this subreddit every day, so please know that we're taking in your comments and grateful for your support.\n\nHere's some links that might be helpful for topics that we see come up frequently - I'll continue to add to this over time so feel free to check back for more topics that have been added!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTopic: ***I found a glitch/broken thing in the game!***\n\nBasically, if you find bugs or anything that is not working the way you'd expect it to, and it's not a crash, head on over to our [Troubleshooting Hub](https://forums.forza.net/c/troubleshooting/247). You can either upvote threads for existing issues or submit a new issue thread for something someone else has not reported. Getting all the reports of broken stuff here is super helpful for us, as we use the number of upvotes to help us understand how widespread a problem might be in the community and triage which ones we fix accordingly. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTopic: ***Someone was ramming people all over the place during a race - Turn 10 should do something about it.***\n\nYes, we would like to! We want people to be able to have fun, fair, and clean races, so please help us identify people who aren't keeping it fun for everyone and respecting the [Code of Conduct](https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/articles/360035563914-Forza-Code-of-Conduct) by filing a ticket to [Report a Player](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.forzamotorsport.net%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Frequests%2Fnew%3Fticket_form_id%3D360004177714&data=05%7C01%7Caunorris%40microsoft.com%7C652e641371d242de160608da4ff4cb0b%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637910210052939662%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=okIKxhyPc5xUiaNUJ3pxTXT0DXHdERIPjGdTGgwsRYA%3D&reserved=0). It's important to note that in order to take action on your report, we need you to also send us a video of the race showing what happened or a replay. There's more information on how to grab these things to send to us [here](https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/articles/4409070620819-How-to-report-a-player). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTopic: ***I wish this feature in the game was different than the way it is now / I wish this feature was in the game.***\n\nIt's really helpful for us to hear your feedback on what you'd like to see us do differently in our games, so we made the [Suggestions Hub](https://forums.forza.net/c/suggestions/155) for you to give us all your feature requests and suggestions to tweak what's already there. Like the Troubleshooting Hub, our team literally uses this forum every day to understand how much demand there is for all kinds of features and plan out our work. This doesn't mean we'll do everything that's submitted, but we try to respond to threads to let you know when we're moving forward with implementing something, or when we've decided that it's not a fit for the games. \n\n  \n\nTopic: ***I was unfairly banned from the game. Can you reverse it?***\n\nIf you feel that you received a ban that was in error, send us a [ban appeal ticket](https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=4416893002771). We\u2019ll have a different human look at the evidence that went along with your ban for a second opinion and let you know whether it\u2019ll be overturned.\n\n&#x200B;",

Having a designated FAQ thread will surely help streamline the process for reporting issues and providing feedback. It's clear that the team values the input of players and is actively working to improve the overall gaming experience.

It genuinely is impossible to believe that this game was released by the same studio.\n\nHow about not releasing Forza Motorsport in what is very clearly pre-pre-alpha state.\n\nGive it a rest with the FOMO games as a service rubbish and actually add permanent events to the career mode, as that mode is quite frankly absolutely pathetic. Apparently races in a racing game is too much to ask.\n\nActually do a lot of quality control, it's blatantly obvious that none at all was never done for this game.\n\nFix the useless AI, I'm so sick of them blatantly ignoring me on the track, continuously taking me and themselves out and being not even remotely fun to race against, they can't even do rolling starts right.\n\nThe penalty system, don't think I need to say more than that.\n\nThey is much, much more I could mention that is blatantly wrong with the game, but I'll leave it there for now.\n\nAs a fan of this series since the first game on the original Xbox, I won't be buying anything from this studio again. The Xbox one games weren't that good, but this game is quite frankly a complete and utter disgrace and embarrassment to the series, the Xbox, the fanbase and coding as a concept. Why anyone thought this \"built from the ground up\" disaster of a game was in any fit state to be released should simply never be allowed to be in charge of anything again.",

Check out more of their photos in-game!\n\n**All feedback on tunes is appreciated - good or bad. Specially when tunes are bad.** At the end of the day I am just the mechanic and you guys are the racers. Do not hesitate irrespective of your tuning knowledge or racing skills!\n\n**Tuning method:**\n1. **Stock look - stock wheel rims and size, no aero (unless absolutely necessary for handling and stability)**\n2. Tuned for automatic/manual players by not skipping clutch+gearbox upgrades\n3. Max performance with max handling possible\n4. All cars **tuned vs. Unbeatable AI**, tracks/weather conditions are now unknown since time travel no longer works. Since release AI has been inconsistent between many car types and weather conditions, not every car will win 10/10 races vs Unbeatable AI without rewind/restart abuse\n5.
