Rule 3 now bans ALL low effort fanart reposting including, but not limited to, both softcore porn and the firefly posts. I know i should've dealt with this sooner but I've been busy and wasn't even aware it was a problem till very recently. I will try to enforce it properly but I may have difficulties with that on my own since I can't always be online, so if any of you would be interested in becoming mod to help us out and improve the subreddit, feel free to contact me in modmail or DMs about it.",

            "Also, since people seem to *still* be complaining about the whole huohuo, cunny whatever thing, I'll add about that here too: You are absolutely allowed to post whatever unhinged stuff you want about huohuo and any other questionably child characters. The rule after the updates was basically to cover gaps in the old rule 3, so we didn't end up with people just posting art of huohuo or clara getting railed and calling it a joke. But whatever actual unhinged shitposts you have about your love for cunny? Go right ahead, as long as it's not something against this updated rule 3 (also still no nsfw or suggestive images of any kind of bailu or hook because those ones *will* get us banned).",

        "content": "It's me, your favorite buddy :) /s\n\n\nI have been too occupied these last few days ~~playing \ud83d\udc74\ud83d\udc8d~~, but I'm finally back to oppress the minorities and BANISH THE UNFUNNY!\n\n\nModerating sometimes may be way more stressful than it looks like, so to make my job easier, I will be making a little list to help myself. This way things will be less subjective and more fair and I won't have to have that thought in my mind all the time: \"Shouldn't I have left that post there?\". My only intent is to keep the sub clean and not full of random unfunny posts.\n\n\n\n1- Remember the ~~cunny~~ funny;\n\n\nThis is a shitposting sub, so keep in mind that your post must, well... Surprise, surprise! Contain humor. \n\n\nAlso, to help keeping a good coexistence with your fellow buddies, take everything someone says as a joke/sarcasm/irony unless stated otherwise (Little fact \u261d\ufe0f\ud83e\udd13: this is what things are in IRL justice: you are innocent unless proven otherwise (at least it was supposed to be like this, but you must know by now how things really work in the ~~Twitter~~ internet. See? You are even learning new things. Who said r/okbuddytrailblazer isn't a place for knowledge (I'm sure Dr. Ratio would be proud)?\n\n\n2- What would be considered an appropriate post?\n\n\nWell, humor is subjective and this is what make things harder for me.\n\n\nThe post are going to be considered by its intent. I don't want to have to ponder everytime I see some random shit if it is appropriate for a shitposting sub or not. So, as I studied \u261d\ufe0f\ud83e\udd13 other similar subs, I came with some points:\n\n\n\n2.1- The post must have humor as its purpose;\n\n\nI don't think I need to explain this, it's a shitposting sub after all.\n\n\n\n2.2- Fanfics and OC are allowed;\n\n\nI have always thought that buddies' talents must be encouraged and I still agree, so these are exceptions (This is not a sub for self-promotion tho, so please, don't abuse). Don't forget to tag OC as OC.\n\n\n\n2.3- Tag Copypastas as such;\n\n\nI created a tag just for them. This way people will know it is a copypasta and not just a random image.\n\n\n\n2.4- Fanarts/Porn are allowed as long they are part of the meme;\n\n\nNo, just the title won't classify them as such, or the old \"Is (s)he stupid?\" would make its comeback.\n\n*Vietnam war flashbacks* AAAAAAAAAAA\n\n\nIf you want to post some fanart/softporn, at least make a shitty edit and we can pretend it's a meme.\n\n\n\n2.4.1- The joke is porn!\n\n\nThe punchline may be porn, but the post shouldn't be only porn and that's it (Go to a hentai sub, you bratty buddy \ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20\ud83d\udca2\ud83d\udca2)\n\n\n2.4.2- If the post is not composed by a fanart or porn, the title is enough to classify it as a meme (if it is part of the humor, I mean).\n\n\n\n2.5- Outbuddied?\n\n\nNo, guys, we didn't get outbuddied just because someone in the main sub posted softporn. Wake me up when someone there post some cunny or balde racism. \n\n\n\n3- Cunny is now banned;\n\n\nJk lol (I wanna breed Yunli so fucking hard and make her the mother of my 10 children so fucking much it's unreal frfr \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I'm gonna go insane. Damn Yunli \ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20\ud83d\udca2\ud83d\udca2 seducing me. I'm gonna...)\n\n\n\n4- Off-Topic;\n\n\nPosts from other Hoyo games are allowed, but Star Rail is still the focus (Wuthering Waves is ok too).\n\n\n\n5- No drama!\n\n\nSome other \"buddy\" subreddit said we are a bad sub? So what? Just ignore and let they self-affirmate themselves by saying to each other how they are superior. Don't bring it here. We are degenerates, but peaceful degenerates who just want to impregnate fictional characters \ud83d\ude07 \n\n\nSomeone on Twitter said some shit and created some drama? Bruh, nothing new. Let the Twitter brainrot on Twitter.\n\n\nThat's it. These are the points I'm gonna use when moderating and I wanted to be sure everybody would be aware of them. This way people will know why their post got removed and I won't have to be worried about being unfair (I feel bad and worry about being unfair, ok? I'm not a monster or a fat guy living in their mother's basement (I''m skinny and I live in my comfy bedroom)).\n\n\nI am, of course, open to ideas and suggestions, specially about tierlists and other spammy things.\n\n\nWhat about those posts that needs the comments to be funny (\"What [character] is [word]? Wrong answers only\" and similar) and not the post itself? And those humorous \"comics\"? Should they be allowed even being some kind of \"repost\" just because they are kinda funny?\n\n\nANSWER THIS IN THE COMMENTS, I NEED SUGGESTIONS ABOUT THEM. Future updates are going to be in the fixed comment (I can't edit the post after sending).\n\n\nAnd as a wise man using a BDSM helmet once told me:\n\n\n\"Marika's tits, you must be 'ungry\".\n\n\n(If you know who says this, I love you \u2665\ufe0f)",
