        "content": "Almost every subreddit has rules, and we do too. We used to get lots of posts about politics, LGBT, what if, and just basic trolling, all prohibited by our rules. We don't allow discussion of race here, because those discussions usually end up with comments that could get our community removed from Reddit. Also, the Rules didn't match the Removal Reasons, but now they do. We added a \"Moderator discretion\" rule, because it's impossible to create rules to cover every contingency. r/stupidquestions can be a fun and interesting place to hang out, but we had trouble with people trolling us with rule violations. For example, here are some of the topics that we removed:\n\n* Do you think that if I could shoot laser beams out of my peepee, I could scare bullies with it?\n* Do you think it would be safe to build my child a drone so I can save on plane fare\n* Should I crash my car into a concrete barrier going 90mph without a seatbelt?\n* Is it a good idea to hold a flame up to a 5 gallon can of gasoline?\n* Why does my butt smell like ass?\n\nWe would ban the offenders, but they would create new accounts and return right away. So a couple of the users suggested putting in a minimum Reddit account age limit and a minimum karma limit to post. That has made things much nicer for the community. Karma is sort of an artificial number, but it tends to indicate that the owner interacts with Redditors in a positive way, and they appreciate him. What you want is to create posts or comments that Redditors appreciate so much that they give you a few upvotes.\n\nHere's [Reddit's FAQ page about karma](https://www.reddit.com/r/karma/wiki/index/faq/), and here's [more information about karma](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/wiki/faq/#wiki_voting_and_karma). If you are new to Reddit and would like more information about how to use it, please visit r/NewToReddit.\n\nWe don't reveal the age or karma numbers required to post. They are not very high, though. If you have a post removed due to your age or karma numbers, please understand that you didn't do anything wrong and we are not targeting you. This is just one of the ways that we are protecting our community. All of the blame for this goes on the trolls. New Redditors should be able to interact with the community, but it's too easy for someone to be banned, create a new account in two minutes, and return to trolling again. So we took precautions to make it more difficult for them. It's too bad that it also makes it more difficult for new members who aren't trolls.\n\nThanks. Now go forth and have fun!",

            "Doing accents for humor(or really any reason) isn't automatically racist. It can be if you're mocking somebody whose ethnicity comes from the geographical region the accent is associated with but accents in and of themselves can just be fun if there's no malicious intent which is always easy to tell. It's natural to find interest in the fact that humans speak differently based on the geographical region they came from and it should be ok to have a little fun with it by way of joking or just doing an impression.\n\nIf a white baby is adopted by an Indian family and raised in India the baby would grow up to have an Indian accent so would the baby automatically be racist? Same question applies for a black baby raised in China or a Mexican raised in Japan. Accents have nothing to do with skin just geography.\n\nWhenever I'm in Japan my accent is made fun of but it should be. Growing up in America means my accent when speaking Japanese is interesting to people who grew up in Japan.",
