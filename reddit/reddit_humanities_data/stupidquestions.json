        "content": "Almost every subreddit has rules, and we do too. We used to get lots of posts about politics, LGBT, what if, and just basic trolling, all prohibited by our rules. We don't allow discussion of race here, because those discussions usually end up with comments that could get our community removed from Reddit. Also, the Rules didn't match the Removal Reasons, but now they do. We added a \"Moderator discretion\" rule, because it's impossible to create rules to cover every contingency. r/stupidquestions can be a fun and interesting place to hang out, but we had trouble with people trolling us with rule violations. For example, here are some of the topics that we removed:\n\n* Do you think that if I could shoot laser beams out of my peepee, I could scare bullies with it?\n* Do you think it would be safe to build my child a drone so I can save on plane fare\n* Should I crash my car into a concrete barrier going 90mph without a seatbelt?\n* Is it a good idea to hold a flame up to a 5 gallon can of gasoline?\n* Why does my butt smell like ass?\n\nWe would ban the offenders, but they would create new accounts and return right away. So a couple of the users suggested putting in a minimum Reddit account age limit and a minimum karma limit to post. That has made things much nicer for the community. Karma is sort of an artificial number, but it tends to indicate that the owner interacts with Redditors in a positive way, and they appreciate him. What you want is to create posts or comments that Redditors appreciate so much that they give you a few upvotes.\n\nHere's [Reddit's FAQ page about karma](https://www.reddit.com/r/karma/wiki/index/faq/), and here's [more information about karma](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/wiki/faq/#wiki_voting_and_karma). If you are new to Reddit and would like more information about how to use it, please visit r/NewToReddit.\n\nWe don't reveal the age or karma numbers required to post. They are not very high, though. If you have a post removed due to your age or karma numbers, please understand that you didn't do anything wrong and we are not targeting you. This is just one of the ways that we are protecting our community. All of the blame for this goes on the trolls. New Redditors should be able to interact with the community, but it's too easy for someone to be banned, create a new account in two minutes, and return to trolling again. So we took precautions to make it more difficult for them. It's too bad that it also makes it more difficult for new members who aren't trolls.\n\nThanks. Now go forth and have fun!",

            "Your proposition that people start taking drugs because their life is bad is just not correct.

Ive known a lot of people whose parents got them hooked as children before they knew what it was. A lot of people just experiment recreationally for fun and end up being prone to addiction.

The head chef came up and screamed at her to get out of the kitchen then was screaming at my friend, about why he doesn't he get any respect? My friend was stirring some sauce in a skillet, and in the calmest voice ever without ever stopping making the food, he simply replied, \"Well maybe, if you weren't such a wiener.\" The head chefs' hands flew high over his head, and at the top of his lungs he screamed \"I AM NOT A WIENER!!!!!!\" I doubled over headfirst into my pot sink and just about died laughing.

            "Went skiing with some friends in Big Bear when I was 19 with friends in the Navy. I and a few others had never skied before and had been drinking and even took a bottle of whiskey with us. It started off with me on the ski lift having an in-depth conversation with the stranger sitting next to. When it came my time to get off, I noticed a few of my friends had crashed into the ground trying to exit the lift and were getting dragged out the way by employees of the resort. I thought, wow, what idiots but when it came my time to exit, I said bye the stranger, and exited the lift and immediately crashed hard onto my face and was quickly pulled away by someone. That incident alone caused me to laugh uncontrollably for a while, but after we gathered ourselves and headed down the mountain, it was just 6 dudes crashing and falling down that mountain in the most hilarious fashion. I myself could get going really fast, but I wasn't able to direct myself, and eventually, my skies would cross, and I'd go head over heals, tumbling and 25 to 50 yards down the mountain. We would all gather frequently to take a hit from the bottle. At one point, a group of snow boards whizzed by and jumped over one friend who was barely able to stand up on his skies. I fell and laughed hysterically all the way down the entire mountain. Probably wiped put 20 times. Especially the last 100-yard stretch - down to the resort where 100's of people were gathered, where I tumbeld over so hard both skies flee off and I came to a crashing halt at the edge of the crowd who had collectively gasped at my atrocious wipe out.",
