            "Everyone should be trained or by simply using and abusing software will anyone \"get\" the nuances sufficient to be a professional.\n\nI don't know how anyone edits without instant response to commands.  That's the reason I use AVID.   When I want to do something it responds in kind.  Effects or details be damned. Hell rendering be damned.\n\nI am editing. I have an intrinsic understanding of framerates and can pinpoint a frame where I want a cut in realtime.   Extend edit and move on.  It's such a chore to select, add edit and delete things out of the timeline when I just want them to do the thing I want them to which is roll the cut to the emotionally significant point I chose.\n\nFighting one fits all software wastes more of my time than the cool shit Premiere can do.\n\nAnd no. Don't tell me how to Premiere. It is inferior from a pure editing standpoint. I don't need to know all the other shit. I just want to edit without waiting for the program to take a half second to catch up.\n\nI should be able to make a trim and then playback as fast as I can hit L as if nothing ever happened. That is not true in Premiere by a long shot. I can't count because it's in the thousands of times I wanted to make a cut and review it quickly, iterate on it and review again. Such a damn chore to wait or play it 3 times so I can know that what I intended was correct.\n\nLike I said in a different thread. Editing in Premiere is like playing Megaman with latency.",

This version includes clarifications and additional examples/definitions that I found particularly useful.\n\nYou can find the full TOU document here: [https://www.adobe.com/legal/terms.html](https://www.adobe.com/legal/terms.html)\n\nHere's a post on the Adobe subreddit that has some additional FAQs with very clear language/definitions: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Adobe/comments/1diwirh/updated\\_adobe\\_terms\\_of\\_use/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adobe/comments/1diwirh/updated_adobe_terms_of_use/)\n\nAnd if you want a quick video summary of some of the most commonly-encountered questions, you can view my video about this here (3mins): [https://youtu.be/rxEl5b0m\\_cg](https://youtu.be/rxEl5b0m_cg)\n\nAs always, I sincerely welcome your feedback. I truly hope this update provides the much-needed clarity on the terms (it did for me), and if you have additional questions, please ask them here.",

            "Your video is about semantics. The TOS apparently use some words that people find intrusive but according to your explanation they are simply the words that are necessary to describe normal user directed functions.\n\n\nI think a lot of people hear a corporation say \"we don't do these bad things\" and interpret it as \"we say we don't do bad things but we probably do some bad things anyway.\" The people who write the TOS probably look more like Patrick Bateman than you!",
            "So prior to this TOU update, Adobe was doing all of this stuff anyway - creating copies on Cloud Server, allowing publication and sharing, compressing images to use as thumbnails, publishing on Behance, etc.\n\nThe license permission is - as far as I can tell - new to the TOU.\n\nAdobe was doing all of this without explicit user permission before. For years.\n\nWhat changed?",
            "I feel like a lot of damage control could have been avoided by releasing this video a week prior when people were canceling memberships (allegedly) across all forms of social media. \nI do appreciate a short video, that gets straight to the point that addresses the concerns of users, i did not utilize any software nor cancel my services during the limbo of TOS clarification. As something that is too good to be true, it probably is, this seemed too bad to be true, so although i had to kick the can on two projects, premier pro is the software i want to use, and im glad i held on. \n\nThanks again for the direct no bs clarification. Its what the people crave.",

            "Awesome thanks for the answer now can you ask the Premiere team to un-fuck the default label colors on the timeline? I've taken a poll and not one person likes them.\n\n(You're polling very well though. Keep up the good work.)",
            "The team has definitely seen the feedback around the label colors (and I've reported internally to extended teams). Did you trying using the 'default' label color preset? I know it's not quite the same, but it's close-ish. Not what you want, I know, but if you haven't given it a go, it'll at least put you back to similar <softer, muted> label colors unlike the really vibrant ones that are the new default. I'll keep you posted if I have more to share around that. Thanks SB."
