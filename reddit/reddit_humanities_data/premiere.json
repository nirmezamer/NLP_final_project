            "So you normally use AVID? Have you tried Resolve or FCPX?",
            "Omg! I'm not too fond of Premiere Pro and Adobe in general. Always outdated and behind. Effects and colors graded are way behind compared to Davincii's resolve. Not to mention that mobile editing is way behind compared to capcut, which Adobe illustrates is hard to compare with Procreate. Adobe Express is so bad and has much fewer template options and functions compared to Canvas. I wish colleges and universities would stop partnering with Adobe by teaching young students with Adobe outdated programs, so they students wont regret it like myself. Now I realize I can use other software and do it 10 times quicker and faster than adobe."

            "This is why I've started doing the audio once my cuts are final. I'll take the full voiceover, nest it into one long audio track and then ill enhance, compress, deess, eq, all that good stuff. \n\nIf you want to do that and see that the Nest option is grayed out when you select your audio. Drop an adjustment layer overtop your entire video, select it AND the audio you want to nest. Right click, hit nest. It wont change immediately but you can drag that newly created  sequence in, unlink the 'video' part and delete it and now you have one long track. Started doing that when they first came out with Auto Match.",
