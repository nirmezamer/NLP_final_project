        "content": "Hey everyone.\n\nEver since the dawn of Era 3, Reddit has split into two: **Old & New.**\n\nIt's been difficult keeping these two sides running at the same time as we have over 10 years of code on Old Reddit, so our old flair systems have been broken awhile now.\n\nAs of today, **36 flairs have been added!** Your flairs will be visible on both versions of Reddit, but will only be selectable on New.\n\nFollow along on [https://new.reddit.com/r/stevenuniverse/](https://new.reddit.com/r/stevenuniverse/) to snag some style!\n\n# A Guide on Gem Style\n\n**Step 1:** Head to the **Sidebar** and click on the **pencil \u270f\ufe0f icon.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2xzf8hi8uwza1.png?width=1359&format=png&auto=webp&s=04d88edbc04e315d1534273197d7a7db1b4a189e\n\n**Step 2:** Select the **pencil \u270f\ufe0f icon again!**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/58zewz8duwza1.png?width=1359&format=png&auto=webp&s=6efffaf0ffcab7d132a9ff13e7b9229cabb227f9\n\n**Step 3:** Enjoy **36 flairs** from some of your **favorite gems!**\n\n[We'd like to thank Nephrite for the Steven drawing provided on the last step.](https://preview.redd.it/yozwmfqeuwza1.png?width=1359&format=png&auto=webp&s=e95bdc1f74e4c3138de228c90cc028b0dca3aecb)\n\nTo select flairs on **mobile**, click the 3 dots on the upper-right corner and follow the same path.\n\nWe hope this tutorial was easy to follow! More flairs are also on the way. If you have any questions, send us a message!\n\nBingo Bongo,/r/stevenuniverse **Mod Team** \u2756",

        "content": "i was just wondering if frame from the movie might be a reference to the diamonds with steven being pink (obviously), peridot being yellow, lapis being blue and bismuth being white (because of the collective colours of a rainbow creating white). if it is a reference it could hint at bismuth's belonging to white diamond. (did white diamond even have her own gems??)",

            "I wonder why people are downvoting the post, its actually a cool theory !!!!!",
            "That last part definitely makes sense considering White's whole thing as a villain was assuming she's flawless.",
            "Its a fun theory, but we need to know who bismuth belonged to. I don't remember if its stated in the show tho.",
            "The rainbow hair could explain that bismuth is whites.\n\nOther possibility is that shes yellows gem. Idk they just have similar sounding voices theres no evidence otherwise",
            "Fun fact: only gems white made were the pearls \n\n(But yea that actually makes alot of sense)",
            "I imagine white diamond considered all gems hers, though there are likely white/colorless gems that would be more definitively in her court",
            "I have a question, which diamond would bismuth gems primarily work under?",
            "Even if no gem in the show is EXPLICITELY stated to be made by white, in \"Your Mother And Mine\" it's shown that White has colonized planets for gem creation",
            "Thats not true, there are plenty of white gems in the show. Albite, White Topaz, Zebra Jasper, Etc. Even if white didnt show herself publicly, she still probably offered her own essence for gem production\n\nEdit : like the OP said, rainbow gems could also be considered white creation",
