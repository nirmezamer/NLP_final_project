Dunno what roads everyone else is driving on but I wish I could use yours instead. Also I only drive on dual carriageways to get around",

            "I encountered a lorry trying to overtake another lorry on a single carriageway today, ie they had to use the other lane. This was not on a road long and straight enough to actually see to judge that; I wouldn\u2019t overtake a bicycle on this road, let alone something I could only do 1 or 2mph more than. \n\nThankfully overtaking lorry abandoned that idea after the first tyres screeching, horns blaring encounter with oncoming traffic.",
            "[Elephant racing](https://germanyinusa.com/2018/02/02/word-of-the-week-elefantenrennen/)",
            "I do a lot of miles and the main thing that winds me up is when lorries think that they can just indicate then move lanes and cut you up, an indicator doesn't give you an automatic right.",
            "1 mph is 0.5m/s.\n\nAn artic is 16m-17m long, but you need space in front and after, so call it 20m.\n\nTherefore, it would take 40s to overtake. But there are other factors, such as weight and air resistance.\n\nWhen you're driving a lorry you want to drive as fast as you can, so you keep your foot flat to the floor. You rely on the limiter to keep your speed in check. If your limiter is 1 mph faster than the lorry in front, then you'll catch them slowly but surely. Once you do catch them, then you'd have to back off to stay behind, meaning you'd need to lift your foot or manage your speed limiter or overtake. Or, you can pull out and overtake.\n\nAs you close on the lorry in front, two factors come into play; the weight you're hauling and air resistance.\n\nIf you're empty, then you may weigh 20 tonnes, but the lorry you're catching may be carrying 20 tonnes and weigh in at 40 tonnes. When you hit an uphill section, you'll gain an extra few mph on them due solely to power to weight ratio. But going downhill they'll have an advantage as their weight will be an advantage.\n\nAir resistance kicks in about 10m behind the lorry in front, and gives you an extra 2-3mph. But, when you pull out to pass, that air hits you in the face, and you suddenly lose that bonus speed to end up with a paltry 1mph difference again. (It used to be worse in the 80s and 90s, as aerodynamics weren't factored in. Trucks used to just push air out of the way, which created a vacuum between the two trucks, pulling them together and matching their speeds. Now trucks have side splitters, pushing air down the side of the lorry, and stopping that vacuum forming.)\n\nFinally, if lorries couldn't overtake then we'd end up with just an inside lane full of trucks 5m apart. You wouldn't be able to get between them to take an exit, and motorways would be reduced to 2 lanes.",
            "In Denmark, a lot of motorways have lorry overtaking bans on 2 lane motorways from 6 am til 9 am, and again from 3 pm until 6 pm, Monday to Friday, I think this is a fair compromise, rush hour traffic flows a lot better. \n\nI have tried both sides of this, been a lgv driver for many years, and also had work commuting, in a car, during those \u2018peak\u2019 periods. \n\nI personally, as an lgv driver, had no problem with the overtaking ban, but I was paid hourly, had a fast route of around 450 kms give or take, mostly motorways, depending on drops and pick ups, and also knew I could finish my days driving within my hours. And the most important part for me, my vehicle was limited to 83 kmph, which meant I was the second slowest lorry on Danish motorways. The only other lorries I could overtake were Arla tankers, all governed to 80 kmph. \n\nI should point out that 80 kmph is the \u2018legal\u2019 max speed for lgv\u2019s.\n\nOn an aside, Holland has now introduced a maximum speed limit of 100 kmph on motorways, for cars, between the hours of 7 am until 7 pm (12 hours per day), normal speeds, 120 kmph at night. Having driven through Holland many, many times over the years, the first trip through Holland at the new speed went exceptionally well, in fact, we saved time, it was more relaxing, and for the first time ever, I would say it was a pleasure!!!\n\nSorry for the long post, thanks to those who made it to the end :-)",
            "Is it annoying? Yes. Does it literally take 2 minutes? Also, yes.\n\nI had it 3 times today on a 1 hour journey, and each time, the driver who over took did the 'thank you' signal with the indicators. \n\nI don't really mind because a lot of the time, these guys are also trying to get somewhere on time and are driving much longer distances.",
            "There are certain groups of road users that piss me off on a regular basis, but lorry drivers aren't one of them. They put the food on the shelves and all the other shit we take for granted. Literal heroes in my book, I couldn't do that job all day",
            "You could write to your MP and suggest that speed limiters are removed from lorries...",
            "1) It won't take 15 minutes for a truck to overtake another, maybe a couple minutes max  \n2) If 2/3 minutes \"stuck\" behind a truck makes you late for work, maybe you are the problem not leaving enough time to do the journey."
