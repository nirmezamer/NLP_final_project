            "Maybe that's it. It all looked like wood to me. It was annoying that I'd be in my Adobe base, wearing ghillie, and still needing to fill by base with AC to avoid heat death.",
            "Exactly. It's full adobe with the frontier skins from the Tall Tales DLC. The roof pieces and some foundations don't have any skin but for the rest I prefer the Wood skins",
            "Yeah it's really ridiculous in ASA. I saw someone saying just yesterday they actually found a bug whereby Fortitude makes you take MORE heat damage rather than less rofl. I haven't tested it myself but it'd almost make sense given how much issue people were having with it.\n\nBut yeah plain wood looks more raggedy. The DLC is actually lovely skins."

I have ASE from Xbox Gamepass ultimate but that outright crashes my whole PC after trying to load into The Island at low graphics. I would love a mod or just anything I can do to play either ASA or ASE on my laptop. I don't know the specs of my laptop but They're good enough to run most AAA games at low graphics. ",

            "If your entire computer is crashing, you have a broken computer. The game or any mods cant crash your PC by itself.\n\nSounds like you have it installing on an exceedingly slow or plain broken drive, to start. What exact hardware do you have?",
            "Because of crap optimization, certain mods in ASE can cause crashes when loading in.\n\n\nMy workaround is to play in a different map(Ragnarok, for example) disabling that mod and then quit. After that, load the map you want to play(The Island) with the mods you use.\n\n\nNote: You have to find which specific mod is causing that issues. In my case, disabling *Kraken's Better Dinos* allowed me to load the map without crashing."
