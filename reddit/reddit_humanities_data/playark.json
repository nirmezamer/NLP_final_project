        "content": "I've had the game for a while but haven't been able to play it because everytime I try to load into The Island or any other map with and without mods it either loads after a solid 10 minutes of loading or crashes outright. I have ASE from Xbox Gamepass ultimate but that outright crashes my whole PC after trying to load into The Island at low graphics. I would love a mod or just anything I can do to play either ASA or ASE on my laptop. I don't know the specs of my laptop but They're good enough to run most AAA games at low graphics. ",

            "Because of crap optimization, certain mods in ASE can cause crashes when loading in.\n\n\nMy workaround is to play in a different map(Ragnarok, for example) disabling that mod and then quit. After that, load the map you want to play(The Island) with the mods you use.\n\n\nNote: You have to find which specific mod is causing that issues. In my case, disabling *Kraken's Better Dinos* allowed me to load the map without crashing.",
            "If your entire computer is crashing, you have a broken computer. The game or any mods cant crash your PC by itself.\n\nSounds like you have it installing on an exceedingly slow or plain broken drive, to start. What exact hardware do you have?"
