            "There were a lot of theories about the identity of the people who saved Martha but I was expecting a regular westalis person who would show Martha their humanity and I'm glad it turned out to be this way. In my opinion, it doesn't make sense sometimes to go for a super shocking turn of events. Sometimes a simpler outcome is more meaningful.\n\nKind of unrelated but I feel the same way about the big reveal, I feel like all the theories are about some epic Twilight vs Thorn Princess showdown followed by an action-packed joined mission to save Anya from the lab people but personally, I get the impression Endo will go for a more complex and subdued approach.",

            "Ahhh Blackbell reference! Does Martha feel some debt of gratitude? It's ironic because they produce some of the weapons used in this war Henry despises so much, and one that I'm assuming Martha will also end up resenting. \n\nI know some of us are disappointed about it bring the 100th chapter but sometimes storylines can't be twisted and broken just to accommodate a simple milestone that, in the end, is only really important to us *right now* but when we reread 100 or more chapters in the future, we won't clock at all. \n\nI'm glad Endo is taking his time with this storyline, I'm enjoying it.",
            "Who would've *thunk* Endo would throw something like All Quiet on the Western Front for initial pages in new chapter. I never expected to see a clean headshot in this manga. And no this isn't one of those comical assasination from Yor or one of Loid's adversaries like earlier chaps. Martha and other women soldiers were just meat shield for rest.",
            "When everyone was expecting a more meaningful connection to the main plot, like the person who rescued Martha being a Blackbell or Yor or Loid's family, the person is a simple Westalis woman who also lost a lot because of the war but maintained her humanity.\n\nI kinda like how the focus of this arc is profoundly anti-war and that's it. That's one of the main themes of Spy x Family after all",
            "to not see the other side as monsters but as people too. war is not black and white... what a chapter. imagine reading spy family for cuteness and end up crying with an anti-war message (me rn\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/78q5uw9jac8d1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c98cfc159e1281d5bf05640eada15e595e8dbe89",
            "It's just like this manga to immediately follow up the Toddler Prom Arc with an All Quiet on the Western Front Arc lol.",
            "I loved this chapter so much, and I genuinely believe Endo's strong suit is writing these angsty, war-centric chapters. He knows how to drive the anti-war sentiment home in a way that focuses on its effects on *people* rather than the politics itself. When Martha made note of the same night sky between the two countries, I was taken aback! It really highlighted the vanity of war in the grand scheme of things. I never thought I'd come to love Martha as a character this much! I am not looking forward to when we see her reaction to Henry's marriage!",
            "I love Spy x Family the best when it leans into its darker elements. With all the fluff and Anya's usual shenanigans, it's easy to forget that this story is set against a cold war backdrop. That's why I don't get the people complaining about this arc being 'filler'. The entire point of Operation Strix is to prevent war. This arc does an immaculate job of driving home the anti-war narrative (and of course, adding to the worldbuilding)."
