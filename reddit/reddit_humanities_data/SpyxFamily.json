            "Who would've *thunk* Endo would throw something like All Quiet on the Western Front for initial pages in new chapter. I never expected to see a clean headshot in this manga. And no this isn't one of those comical assasination from Yor or one of Loid's adversaries like earlier chaps. Martha and other women soldiers were just meat shield for rest.",
            "When everyone was expecting a more meaningful connection to the main plot, like the person who rescued Martha being a Blackbell or Yor or Loid's family, the person is a simple Westalis woman who also lost a lot because of the war but maintained her humanity.\n\nI kinda like how the focus of this arc is profoundly anti-war and that's it. That's one of the main themes of Spy x Family after all",
            "It's just like this manga to immediately follow up the Toddler Prom Arc with an All Quiet on the Western Front Arc lol.",
            "I loved this chapter so much, and I genuinely believe Endo's strong suit is writing these angsty, war-centric chapters. He knows how to drive the anti-war sentiment home in a way that focuses on its effects on *people* rather than the politics itself. When Martha made note of the same night sky between the two countries, I was taken aback! It really highlighted the vanity of war in the grand scheme of things. I never thought I'd come to love Martha as a character this much! I am not looking forward to when we see her reaction to Henry's marriage!",
            "I love Spy x Family the best when it leans into its darker elements. With all the fluff and Anya's usual shenanigans, it's easy to forget that this story is set against a cold war backdrop. That's why I don't get the people complaining about this arc being 'filler'. The entire point of Operation Strix is to prevent war. This arc does an immaculate job of driving home the anti-war narrative (and of course, adding to the worldbuilding).",
            "Things to take from this chapter...Martha's all women 'Squadron', was essentially cannon fodder for the main line.  That made me really mad.  But she was saved, by a piece of artillery from Blackbell industries...a name she will be linked in the future.  But here, we get a nice boi, for chapter 100.  And we get another reminder of 'War is Hell.'  Now, she's gotta go back, and probably face the consequences of being behind enemy lines, and find out what happened with Mr. Henderson.  More tears and angst ahead, methinks.",
            "While some folks already seemed to agree Martha and Henrys backstory took place during WWI, this chapter outright confirms it with the presence of _landships_. Im not surprised if next chapter wed see the background characters mention mustard gas attacks. \n\nStill, _holy fuck_. Grim chapter all around.",
            "Holy shit that was dark, seeing the women cowering for their lives only to get shot by their OWN COMMANDER...glad that fucker died quickly.",
            "Its interesting that Martha and Henry got a longer backstory than Loid lol, especially considering the backstories focus on similar themes. I think the severed limbs is the most morbid imagery the series has had this far. Also interesting that this chapter breaks the framing of the past 3 chapters: No thought bubbles from Henry or Martha, we are seeing Martha in the moment. I wonder if we get 1 or 2 more chapters of this backstory before we return to modern times and see the reactions of the people listening to these old lovebirds. I hope they hang out more to show the capacity to live and love after trauma.",

            "One of my favourite Henderson moments is actually from one of the more recent chapters. >!When he swallowed his pride and pretended to take back what he had said about war so that he can continue teaching. Normally a shonen would have the character not swallowing their pride to defend their honour, even if it would be the smarter choice to just lie. Which is an inspirational message about self respect. Hendersons story does the opposite of that, because his mission is beyond his own pride. It doesnt matter what happens to him as long as he can make the future generation be better than the previous ones!<",
