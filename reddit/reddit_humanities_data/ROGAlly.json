I played today at my local dealer getting an oil change, I come home back to my PC and my search for a game is taking ages. Fearing the worst I check the support site and I'm hit with this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ua04s39bj66d1.png?width=1141&format=png&auto=webp&s=5020aedecd10a139002f6128a343564f2af58471\n\nNow, believe me or not, I have never touched a cheat. So I figured I'd come here to warn you guys if you still had your doubts, they are valid.\n\n  \n\\*Update 6/18/24 Just some closure for you guys, a lot of people were saying that's never happened to them, so I figured i'd upload the results of the shadowban: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/saftr9o36d7d1.png?width=1094&format=png&auto=webp&s=d73a877f22fc195a7a40a84f5505cbb40e730b54\n\nNeedless to say I won't be touching CoD on the Ally anymore.\n\n",

            "I don\u2019t even understand why any of you would continue playing a copy paste, full of toxic players, game. COD hasn\u2019t been good since the pre-ghost days and BO3. But hey that\u2019s just my opinion as someone who has owned all the CODS. Ain\u2019t nothing going to top COD3-MW2 era."
