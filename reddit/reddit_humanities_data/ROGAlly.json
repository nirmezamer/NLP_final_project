I played today at my local dealer getting an oil change, I come home back to my PC and my search for a game is taking ages. Fearing the worst I check the support site and I'm hit with this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ua04s39bj66d1.png?width=1141&format=png&auto=webp&s=5020aedecd10a139002f6128a343564f2af58471\n\nNow, believe me or not, I have never touched a cheat. So I figured I'd come here to warn you guys if you still had your doubts, they are valid.\n\n  \n\\*Update 6/18/24 Just some closure for you guys, a lot of people were saying that's never happened to them, so I figured i'd upload the results of the shadowban: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/saftr9o36d7d1.png?width=1094&format=png&auto=webp&s=d73a877f22fc195a7a40a84f5505cbb40e730b54\n\nNeedless to say I won't be touching CoD on the Ally anymore.\n\n",

            "This is the 3rd report of this in the past week. Im going to go ahead and pin this post to advise others as obviously there was a Ricochet update that is tripping over the Ally.\n\nSome tips that we do know is do **NOT** change the power mode including plugging and unplugging the Ally while the game is open, Ricochet is running as long as the game is open so changing the power modes still is not safe doing so in the main menu or pre game lobby. Close the game, make your changed and then start the game back up\n\nTry disabling any software that has a overlay, Some have suspected part of the reason Ricochet is banning is it sees the overlays from AC and thinks it could be a cheat software.\n\nIt can be one or the other or a combination of both on top of other data they use to determine a ban.\n\n*Doing these things does not guarantee a ban as you can see others have made these changes with no bans, Ricochet looks any many things including number or reports, accuracy etc so the changes mentioned above can be the icing on the cake to issue the ban.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs of right now this is just a Shadow Ban, your account should be good to go in 5-7 days, in the meantime do NOT try logging into another account on the Ally as any other account you log into has a good chance of also getting shadow banned and can even get a permaban issued over it (As it can be contributed of cheaters getting banned and then just loading up a fresh account to continue to cheat)\n\nI was one of the few last year that was issued a permaban over this, luckily after the Legion Go team reached out to Activision to work with them as the Legion was also being banned I was notified I was incorrectly banned and I got my account back it was almost a month later, I say this just to alert users that you can most definitely get your account permanently banned over this and you have ZERO way of contact Activision and the appeal process always seems to deny you instantly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Another thing I will add is after your Shadow Ban lifts, play super casual for the next 5-10 games. Normally when you come out of a ban you can considered yourself on a \"Probation\" your account takes less reports from other players to get banned and Ricochet seems to be more aggressive towards the account. If you are a really good player or toxic in a game you can very easily get banned again.",
            "Billion dollar company by the way. Activision is a joke",
            "If you pull up the quick menu for TDP while in game it will flag as a cheat menu.",
            "Anyone playing cod on their ally should just stop asap. The anti cheat is stupid as all hell and a lot of people have been getting banned. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth the risk. That\u2019s the one game I\u2019ll never download on ally.",
            "This is total bullshirt. \n\nCan you imagine a regular person that just wants to sit on the couch and play one of the most popular games in the world on their new computer and getting BANNED for it? \n\nThis is utter incompetence.",

            "\"Working as intended\" file for a refund since the product is no longer functioning as designed and stop buying games that have this level of Anti-cheat built into them. That is the only way for this to change.",
            "What was your power mode? You can\u2019t play COD on 15W or change modes while playing (that\u2019s what triggers the ban). You\u2019re safer on 25W or Turbo.",
            "I use warzone daily and whenever i have to pay for something i have to go to the command center and change it from gamepad to desktop in order to click the correct credit card and purchase anything. I have yet to be banned or shadow banned. Although I have not changed it from gamepad to desktop while playing Warzone/multiplayer, which I have seen other people in this get banned for.",
            "Once I plugged it into charge when playing mwz. I didn\u2019t get shadow ban. But my cpu time changed to 32ms and GPU time 32ms, because it switch to 15w. But as I heard about the shadow banning I didn\u2019t switch back so I experienced 30 fps zombies \ud83d\ude33"
