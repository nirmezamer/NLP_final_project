            "Apart from a small number of now redundant bugfix mods, my mods and game appear to have survived this update relatively intact, which is unusual. Of course there might be glitches I haven't noticed yet but the game loads up and appears to function.\n\nDX11 seems to have significantly worse performance for me. Especially when moving the camera while zoomed out there's noticeably more lag and stutters.",

Has the mod list come out yet?\n\nI dont mind patches but the piecemeal nature of them has gotten exhausting. Are they going to keep patching things for years to come?",
            "The 5/28/24 update is making my game bug out so bad. All my mods (which are just a couple) are updated but suddenly my game is so laggy and unfun. EA is driving me insane and I regret spending as much as I have on this game",
            "Anyone else having issues  with the game not moving past the loading screen after the update?",
            "Another custom content issue. They are disabled but I cannot re-enable them. I go into the game, get the warning, select to enable them in settings, exit the game start over.  Same note that they are disabled. Tried this FIVE times!!! Its not re-enabling mods/custom content.\n\nEDITED: I found the solution online. I had to disable my virus protection and then re-enable it. Then it worked!!",
            "Does anyone else have an issue with the game loading infinitely when trying to load previously made lots?\nBetter exceptions doesn't help to know what it's causing it and i don't have any of the known broken mods",
            "for the past week or so, my game hasnt worked AT AL :( when i try playing it, it doesnt open, even though it says its running on steam.  tried removing my entire mods folder and still, nothing happens :("

I currently recommend and use Jolibean, Serenity, Sentate, Caio, ImVikai, daylife sims, aharris00britney, greenllamas, Jius-Sims, dogsill (the best hairs ever), and Madlen. If you have any more recs I will gladly take them! I like well detailed but not alpha looking clothing, cute patterns and creative designs.

            "Hey, so last night I was looking for mods and came across one that changes the bear phase from parenthood into princess/pirate costumes. Unfortunately though, when I went to download the mod the mod website appears to now be an ad/scammy link encouraging people to buy the domain. Ive searched the web for similar mods without any luck. Im just wondering if there are any mods out there that add a bit more variety to the bear phase. Id rather not completely remove the phase via cheats or mods. I just think the bear itself gets kind of boring after a while and find it a bit unrealistic that every single child that goes through a costume phase only chooses to be a bear. I just think it would be cool to see other outfits like princesses/princes, pirates, mermaids/mermen, career costumes, aliens, or even just utilizing the preexisting raccoon or panda costumes from city living, or a few other costumes from other packs. Ik a lot of people fawn over how cute the bear costume is, but just imagine how cuter it would be if there was more variety?",
            "I keep asking for this but are there any updated mods to fix the random clothing atrocities when sims get added into the game? Like I feel like theres probably a lot of decent looking sims but you cant tell because their attire is so hideous",

(go to work, work from home, stay home) They are annoying since they happen too often and I would love just to stick one option (always go to work) and thats that.   \nTried googling, but anyone know mod for this?",
            "Looking for any clothing or accessories with Barney the Dinosaur, Nickelodeon shows, Disney, ect.",
            "I'm working on a massive save file in Sims 4 with lots of families, and I'm wondering if there's an efficient way to move specific family members to empty lots without manually loading each household due to my laggy laptop. I prefer creating everyone in CAS and setting relationships before moving them into houses. Any tips or mods that could streamline this process would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!"

Your sim gets a moodlet and you don't have to watch lol I love having my Sims woohoo on dates and this will make that easy and flirty. It'll be perfect for isms having an affair lol \n\nAnd having a sleep rabbit hole in town will be nice for homeless/rags to riches Sims!"
