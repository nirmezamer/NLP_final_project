            "I cant launch my game.\n\nIve tried repairing it, reinstalling it, clearing the EA apps cache, and restarting my PC. Nothing is working!!!  \nI uninstalled my mods already",
            "This latest update has done nothing but make my game unplayable and miserable beyond compare. I've tried playing with no mods, some mods, and ensuring those mods are updated when I play with them, but I keep running into errors while loading the game and simply playing. My build-buy mode is horrific, and I can't play for a whole 15 minutes before my game freezes doing basic game activities. \n\n  \nFor instance, Im running no mods at all (mod folder has been removed and is sitting on the desktop) and no tray files. I tried to have my sim take a puppy into the front yard, place them on the lawn and tell them to go potty and they froze in the middle of sitting the puppy down and now I have a white screen over top of the gameplay, asking if I want to wait for the game to load or close. Ive tried closing of course and that wont work, prompting me to have to use the task manager to force close the game.\n\nSorry for venting, just hope it's just not my game and a side effect of the latest update.",
            "Apart from a small number of now redundant bugfix mods, my mods and game appear to have survived this update relatively intact, which is unusual. Of course there might be glitches I haven't noticed yet but the game loads up and appears to function.\n\nDX11 seems to have significantly worse performance for me. Especially when moving the camera while zoomed out there's noticeably more lag and stutters.",

I can't click to get rid of it and its literally fully restricting me from using build mode. I've updated my mods and gotten rid of the broken ones, game was running fine last night but updated it today and I haven't been able to use build mode since.",
            "The world San Sequoia won't load properly. I'm stuck with a white screen. This issue occurred after I updated the game. I have tried repairing the game, and deleted the localthumbcache in the files.\n\nNo mods or anything either. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nEdit: I restarted my PC, and it's working fine now.

I have tried to find a game like sims that me and her can play together and like most I thought she would like either role playing games or simulation type or survival games but really could never find it. Then it hit me when she was telling me about her new sim. Sims is not a world building game it\u2019s a Story Telling game. Every sim every building, every murder sim that she didn\u2019t want apart of her story is my wife telling herself a story. She designs characters, makes there homes who there family will be or is, how the sims friends are or enemies. When it begins, and how it ends. I once thought how could she sit there for hours and play that sims game. \n\nNow I understand how someone who loves sims can put it down for months and then want to pick it back up again. Perhaps your last story wasn\u2019t your favorite, maybe or felling less creative or you feel your stories just have the same pop they once did. \n\nBut just a few months later life has happened and now you have more emotions and complexity in your relationships or job. Now you have more stories to tell and you remember why you loved the game. \n\nNow I see the different sims family and homes my wife is proud to show me, is her being proud of this complex story she has in mind for these characters.\n\nSo I have a new found awe of the creative minds who love sims.

            "My partner tried to understand my love of Sims by \"mastering\" the game in a few days, which to him meant making himself the perfect Sim that wants for nothing. He then stopped playing after a week because \"he did it all\" and \"it's too easy\". He clearly doesn't get it because I've been playing Sims for over 15 years and haven't run out of stories to tell myself. I guess if you're used to playing games with set goals, linear stories, and predetermined outcomes, playing a game you have to completely make up yourself might not be that appealing. \n\nThat said, I like to switch up stories with building and gameplay challenges to keep things interesting. I also like recreating apartments and houses from my favorite movies and TV shows. Sims is a sandbox and there's endless things to do if you are creative enough to build it!",

            "The way Will Wright (the creator of the first Sims game) describes it in his Masterclass, is a dollhouse. Just to play with life, and give people tools to tell stories. Goals and extra game play was added to help with story telling, but the intention was never to just turn into a standard videogame. Imagination should always come first. Yeah, the game can't do everything we want, but just like with dolls, we can always pretend it happened.",
            "It's like playing with dolls, where you can dress up the dolls AND build the doll houses. You can come up with your own storylines, and make family trees with the size and complexity of GRR Martin's fictional family trees, and with all the plot twists in the world.",
            "Sims is about playing life. Our lives are just one big story that we actively live out day to day. In sims, you control that story every day, down to the way your sims even walks",

I\u2019m also a writer so sometimes when I\u2019m in a creative block I put characters I\u2019m interested in creating into the game so I can develop better backstories! I\u2019m so glad you gave it a chance and I hope you find enjoyment from the game even if it\u2019s not something you pick up regularly. It can be a really great way to express creativity once you get used to a few quirks lol",
            "Sims 4 isn't a very good life sim; it's a much better doll house.  The way the game works kind of forces you to take a more active role in storytelling if you want anything interesting to happen.  And there's nothing inherently wrong with that, but it's also easy to understand why many fans of previous games don't like this one so much.",
