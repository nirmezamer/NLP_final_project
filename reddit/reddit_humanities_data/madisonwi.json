The description reads just like a scam fest that was sold to Green Bay two years ago and others around the country. Madison had a similar scam fest a few years back (anyone remember Madison Taco Fest?), and it was shut down before the event happened. Just putting a warning out because, if this even does happen, you are likely going to be very disappointed. Spend $13 at a local Mexican restaurant (we have quite a few to choose from!) and you\u2019ll be much happier. \n\nI don\u2019t know how City agencies keep falling for these. \n\n",
