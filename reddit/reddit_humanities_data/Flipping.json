            "I'm a woman and would never meet any of my buyers in person. Too risky. I don't know how the YouTube resellers constantly show their face and talk about their money. RIP to the guy, lost his life over jealousy.",
            "This was a hit job. Or someone who really hated resellers and wanted to do something extreme about it. The sneakerhead culture is toxic AF.",
            "Ive sold kicks in person, but this was before like 2015. When it exploded into major collabs, flips and cons and such. I couldnt do in person flips for shoes, phones in todays time. I dont mind EBay, Grailed, Stock X taking 10% or under 20% to not get slumped or robbed, or have to take someones life.",
            "If you are a flipper do not show off like those on YT (and sometimes on reddit)!  This was a hit out of jealousy according to the comments.  They left the money, car and all valuables at the scene",
            "Sneaker people are already bottomfeeders as it is. No way I'm meeting them in person even if I'm set to profit several hundred dollars",
            "Eh, sneaker customers are a different type than my regular clientele. I meet mainly nerds and parents getting stuff for their kids. I don't deal in phones, shoes, jewelry, or other high end clothing/electronics so that cuts out a lot of the market that gets preyed on in these news stories.",
