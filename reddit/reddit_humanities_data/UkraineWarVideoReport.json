Russians are ignorant because they aren't taught history if it doesn't somehow glorify Russia and in the current environment, they're taught only what they're spoon-fed.  I know because I'm married to a Russian.  Well, half-Ukrainian and half-Russian.  She's from Barnaul so I suspect her ancestors on her mother's side were forcibly relocated to Siberia by Stalin.  Simply generation after generation of wrongs perpetuated on non-Russians whether it be Soviet or Federation peoples.  Those who rule or have ruled Russia historically are just plain barbarians.   If you're in Russia's orbit and you're not Russian, you're fucking nobody unless you're a toady like Ramzan Kadyrov.  I will say, though, that the people I know in Russia I loved.  They were good to me and I won't indict all Russians for Putin's crimes.\n\n Frankly, I was amazed about how little my wife knew about history outside of any of Russia's place in it until after the Soviet state ceased to exist.  She didn't even know anything about the Berlin wall.  She's all in on Ukraine though.  She has nostalgia for her homeland and place of birth as most people would but she has absolutely zero desire to go back to that corrupt shithole.",
