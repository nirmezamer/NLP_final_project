            "I have a question about the intensity of partisan activity in Russian controlled areas. Are there any examples of Ukraine funding resources or weapons to resistance forces?",
            "I am constantly amazed at how Russia continues to fool the world into thinking they are a serious military power. They have 2 advantages. Their population and nuclear weapons. Putin said there were 700K soldiers currently deployed in Ukraine. So why are they not making no significant advances? They're using old weapons and equipment, which can't be replenished. Any helicopter or plane that is shot down cannot be replaced and the economy is slowly being paralyzed. It's Putin's utter disregard for his own people that keeps the country going, but they are nowhere near the military power they think they are. \n\nI'd give Zelensky everything he's asking for, and ten times more, and let Ukraine push them right back to the stone age.",

            "The other major Russian advantage is their insanely large USSR inheritance military stockpile. It is shrinking though, according to public satellite images from Covert Cabal on YouTube. They probably have two more years left where they can get a stream of weapons from this stockpile. Then it gets much more difficult for Putin. \n\nHopefully Ukraine can hold out, we need to give them everything they request."
