        "content": "Dear mildlyinterested reader,\n\nWe want to extend our heartfelt gratitude for your patience and unwavering support during the recent turbulence in our community. Our subreddit is a labour of love, and we've weathered this storm together.\n\nRecent events have been confusing for all of us, from the vote, sudden removal of moderators, to conflicting messages from Reddit. As your mod team, we feel it's essential to clarify the situation.\n\nOn June 19, [the poll results favoured partially reopening with changes](https://redd.it/14dmkw1). However, before implementing these changes, Reddit took sweeping actions, removing all 27 moderator accounts without warning. This left us baffled and concerned.\n\nHere's a brief timeline of the events:\n\n1. On June 19, the poll results favoured partially reopening with changes. We announced the vote results and planned changes to the sub, including marking it as NSFW due to the common posts of phallic objects (no explicit content allowed). [CLICK HERE TO VIEW THAT ANNOUNCEMENT WHICH HAS BEEN APPROVED AND LOCKED FOR POSTERITY](https://redd.it/14eox9x).\n\n2. A tug-of-war between the u/ModeratorCodeOfConduct account and the remaining moderators ensued, with the post repeatedly being removed and reinstated. Each mod involved was immediately locked out of Reddit. Subreddit settings were also unilaterally changed by the admin account.\n\n3. Eventually, all moderators were removed and suspended for 7 days, with the vote results deleted and the community set to \u201carchived.\u201d \n\n4. A lot of public outrage ensued, with details posted on r/ModCoord about what happened. At that point, no other subreddit had been targeted yet, leaving the situation uniquely unclear.\n\n5. Admin cited actions as an \"error\" and promised to work with us to solve the situation. For /r/mildlyinteresting posterity, this will henceforth be referred to as The Mistake\u2122.\n\n6. All our accounts were unsuspended and reinstated, but only with very limited permissions (modmail access only). For what it's worth, 'time moderated' for every moderator was reset (e.g. /u/RedSquaree moderated since 11 years ago, reset: currently showing moderated since \"1 day ago\").\n\n7. The awaited discussion never happened. Instead, the admins presented us with an ultimatum: reopen the subreddit and do not mark it as NSFW, or face potential removal again. The inconsistent and arbitrary application of Reddit's policies reveals a possible conflict of interest in maximizing ad revenue at the risk of user safety and community integrity.\n\n8. Finally, our moderation permissions were restored after we \"promised\" to comply with their conditions, but we kept the subreddit restricted while we ponder our next steps..\n\nProblems remain unresolved, and Reddit's approach to policies and communication have been troubling. We believe open communication and partnership between Reddit and its moderators are crucial for the platform's success.\n\nAs a team, we remain dedicated to protesting Reddit's careless policy changes. Removing ourselves or vandalizing the subreddit won\u2019t achieve our goals, but rather hinder our community. We're here to ensure r/mildlyinteresting isn't left unattended.\n\nWe call for the establishment of clear, structured, and reliable communication channels between Reddit admins and moderation teams. Teams should be informed and consulted on decisions affecting their communities to maintain trust and integrity on the platform. We shared this request with the Admin who promised to work with us, so far they have ignored it. \n\nUs mods are still deciding how exactly to reopen, not that we have been given much choice.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe r/mildlyinteresting mods",

            "Let's play a fun game called: remember all the other times Reddit refused to budge and insisted the users and mods were wrong until they eventually backtracked: \n\n\n\n* Banning r/Jailbait (it's exactly what you think it is) after literal years of user and moderator complaints, only once the media finally picked up on the story. Before this, Reddit had even given the creator of the subreddit a unique personalized award for his \"contributions to the website\"\n\n\n* Banning r/beatingwomen and r/picsofdeadkids only after the media picked up on a popular Reddit post from a user\n \n\n* Banning racist and Islamophobic subs because of organized actions from r/AgainstHateSubreddits and media coverage (r/European)\n\n* Reddit \"not knowing\" what to do with the sub r /ni***rs - no, the actual sub name was not censored and it was about exactly what you'd expect it to be about. Took user and media outcry over a period of months for Reddit to ban the sub. \n\n* Taking action against Covid misinformation (on all sides!) after moderator outcry and media coverage\n\n* Reddit CEO protecting r/The_Donald despite countless reports from moderators of politically themed subreddits of it being used for organized harassment and misinformation campaigns  - only reversing its stance after widespread media coverage. **Then**, u/Spez also messing with r/The_Donald by editing people's  comments to make it appear they were harassing the sub moderators instead of himself. Steve literally doesn't care about any of us, no matter our position.\n\n* Using Ellen Pao as a temporary CEO and blaming all unpopular decisions on her, when in reality it was co-founder Alex Ohanian who pushed for those changes aggressively. They then used her as a sacrificial goat for community outrage after which u/Spez was made CEO and presented as a savior. \n\nSources: \n\nhttps://www.dailydot.com/society/reddit-r-jailbait-shutdown-controversy/\n\nhttps://www.dailydot.com/society/reddit-r-jailbait-teen-pics-problem/\n\nhttps://www.dailydot.com/society/reddit-beatingwomen-misogyny-images/\n\nhttps://www.albawaba.com/loop/reddit-bans-racist-and-islamophobic-subreddits-1101936\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/07/does-anything-go-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-racist-corner-of-reddit/277585/\n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/reddit-page-calls-on-site-to-combat-covid-19-disinformation-2021-8?r=US&IR=T\n\nhttps://www.vice.com/en/article/n7jqbx/reddit-cant-quarantine-coronavirus-misinformation\n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-38088712\n\nhttps://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/29/reddit-bans-pro-trump-forum-in-crackdown-on-hate-speech-344698\n\nhttps://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/women-often-put-charge-failing-companies\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3dbwmb/cmv_ellen_pao_was_put_on_a_glass_cliff_by_reddit/",

            "I can't help but wondering if reddit used to be hands off wrt moderation (providing no small amount of legal cover wrt content), suddenly threatening to bring sites out of NSFW or unilaterally replacing moderators mean that they have basically assumed ownership (and therefore liability) for all content moderation.\n\nDoesn't this put them in potential legal jeopardy?
