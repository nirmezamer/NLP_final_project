            "Hey y'all. Like every game we've done here, if you are posting your submissions here in the comments or as a solo post on the subreddit, they won't be selected for the content. We are looking for stuff to show on stream that will be new. If you post it here, the reaction will be \"oh yeah, we saw this already\".\n\n---\n**Q&A time:**\n> Can we post vids or photos only?\n\nvids are okay as long as it is short and to the point. if you take a 30 minute video explaining everything, we don't have time for that. If its a nice 5 second spin around of your sleeve? sick, lets see it :) \n\nwhatever will make your tattoo look best!\n\n>When do submissions close?  \n\nASAP. [Friday 12:01am] lets say. We already have over 150 people that submitted, the sooner the better. :)\n\n> Can we show more than 1 tattoo?\n\nyes, please.",

            "Yeah, Project 2025 is actually terrifying.",
            "I'm far more afraid of the current state of the Republican Party, which Trump will enable, than necessarily Trump himself. And I am also more worried that any voter who hasn't made up their mind already won't see that distinction, and will see how horribly Biden did at portraying competence, and vote for Trump as a \"better of two old-guys\"\n\nBut also\n\nNo shot that any discussion here will be helpful and/or affect Wubby's views at all. He doesn't seem like someone swayed purely on appearances, and he isn't trying to sway his audience, so I don't think any of us should care at all",
            "I mean, even if we put politics aside Trump is the kind of dude who no one here would hang out with. He's the loud mouthed, braggart who lies constantly. Who has legit personality disorders. He's a failure, a loser and a criminally liable *rapist*. He raped a woman. AT LEAST one woman. Let's be real. \n\nThen he talked about fucking his daughter, he bragged about leering at teenage beauty queen contestants when they were getting dressed and hung out with *fucking Epstein*. He wants power and he wants to use that power to get retribution on his enemies and he loves bullies and assholes and has no qualms about being overtly racist and punching down. \n\nI mean, back before the whole President thing he called for the execution of the Central Park 5 when 5 black teens were *accused* of raping a woman. Then when it was found they were innocent HE STILL CALLED FOR THEIR EXECUTION! \n\nRemember when he called John McCain a loser for being a POW during the Vietnam war? \n\nLike, my fucking god. At every single turn, he is the worst person you would avoid at all costs.",
            "Project 2025 is a plan set made by Republican party members to take effect if Trump is elected again, they will immediately take all federal law enforcement agencies and make them report directly to the president and have to do anything the president wants to, the president could have them investigate anyone anywhere for any reason with the threat to produce results or be fired; political rivals he has already assured vengeance, judges, lawyers, someone who tweeted something mean, anyone. They will allow the president to circumvent Congress and the Senate to pass whatever he wants. There is so much more like the EPA would be directly responding to him, he could weaponize the weather, and it genuinely would be the end of the US as we know it. \n\nNot to mention Trump also said he talked to Putin about the invasion of Ukraine, and supported him in the endeavor because it was \"his dream\". His best friends are Putin, Xi, and Kim, the 3 biggest rivals of the US, he wants us to pull out of NATO and turn our backs on our oldest and strongest allies. He burned a huge number of US spies when he talked to Putin. Not to mention the insurrection, 34 felonies, hundreds of millions in judgements against him, his best friend Epstein who mysteriously died in jail, half his staff from his tenure as president being convicted of all kinds of illegal shit.\n\nJoe Biden has been a decent president, he's just a creepy old dude who should be retired but sadly is the best chance there is to beat Trump. He has by all accounts been a decent president, but like any has had his issues. He has solutions to problems, the biggest being a tax on the rich to solve a lot of issues. Lina Khan the current head of the FTC, is doing work and is basically our last hope of anyone bringing back a competitive economy so we are not facing the current situation of almost the entire economy being driven by 7 companies. She is likely the only chance we have to fix the economy for future generations.",
            "As someone who used to work in politics (on the Hill, both of Bernie's campaigns, the progressive policy team for Biden after Bernie dropped out, etc.), I appreciate you posting this. Trump is such a danger to the future of this country. The tragedy of the United States is that we have always had and still have such great potential that we need to stop Trump. If Trump gets a second term, we'll never reach that potential. We'll be set so far back that it'll somehow make Reagan look like nothing. Please vote this November.",

            "Guys. Can we not? Politics have spread everywhere. It sucks. It\u2019s depressing. It\u2019s fucked. Can we not infest this place with that shit too? Go to the other thousand subreddits bitching about this. Rightfully so but not here\u00a0",

            "I saw Keabz at a Panda Express in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn\u2019t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.\n\nHe said, \u201cOh, like you\u2019re doing now?\u201d\n\nI was taken aback, and all I could say was \u201cHuh?\u201d but he kept cutting me off and going \u201chuh? huh? huh?\u201d and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen bowls of noodles in his hands without paying.\n\n\nThe girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like \u201cSir, you need to pay for those first.\u201d At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.\n\n\nWhen she took one of the noodles and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually \u201cto prevent any electrical infetterence,\u201d and then turned around and winked at me. I don\u2019t even think that\u2019s a word. After she scanned each bowl and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.",
