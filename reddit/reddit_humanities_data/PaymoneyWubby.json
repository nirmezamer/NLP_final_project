            "As someone who used to work in politics (on the Hill, both of Bernie's campaigns, the progressive policy team for Biden after Bernie dropped out, etc.), I appreciate you posting this. Trump is such a danger to the future of this country. The tragedy of the United States is that we have always had and still have such great potential that we need to stop Trump. If Trump gets a second term, we'll never reach that potential. We'll be set so far back that it'll somehow make Reagan look like nothing. Please vote this November.",
            "Agreed. Project 2025 is horrible. Supreme Court giving out decisions this week like a precursor to come.",

            "Anyone else hear Trump possibly shit himself during the debate? (1:16:23) Not a motivated comment, I'm wondering if it was just me?",
            "I can understand wubby or anyone else abstaining from normal political topics, but when it comes down to one side making it known that they want to dismantle the government and give as much power to the president as possible, and you don't have the balls to speak up against that, then you're just as bad as someone who agrees with that plan imo.",
            "I\u2019ll tell you to pick a side. Donald Trump is an American traitor who will do everything in his power to reduce the freedoms and liberties of minorities and marginalized groups. Just as he did during his first term and just as he did as a dogshit businessman for the last several decades.",
            "Fucking cunts always blocking videos if you live outside the US",
            "On top of installing a fascist regime among many other heinous things, Project 2025 also effectively sentences trans individuals to death. I wrote up another comment earlier today going over this exact thing so if you want more info just go to my comments. It's fucking terrifying.",
