            "Happy Valentine's Day! Here's a little something to celebrate. We rewrote some things to make the guide more up-to-date. Just thought we might give attention to the fact that we do have a Good Posting Guide, something we've had since forever!\n\nDo note though that this is only a guide, not hard rules. We're only sharing it to give more clarity to the kind of content we accept here. And of course to help y'all out, regardless if you're an avid poster or a newcomer with a cute art to share.\n\nJust as important is the [**Post Flair Guide**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesomeyuri/wiki/flair) which we do in fact also have and now up-to-date! If you ever wondered what each flair *really* meant to be used for, it should all be there in the guide! Speaking of flairs, we are updating the flair colors in the next few days. They should look a bit nicer now.\n\nAlright, that's all for now.\n\n---\n\n**Edit: [New Post Flair colors are here!](https://i.imgur.com/iSI2BRV.jpg)**"
