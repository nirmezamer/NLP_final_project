            "My husband was denied a US tourist visa for us to go visit my family despite us both living in his home country, having jobs and assets and a dog and myriad ties to his country. The interview was over the minute they found out his spouse was American, and the officer said (paraphrased), \"don't even bother. You'll never get a tourist visa being married to an American because so many have illegally adjusted status, just apply for the spousal visa\". Is this true? Is the reviewer speaking out of his ass? Is there any way around this? Thanks for doing this :)",
            "Why does the system pardon tourists who have overstayed their visa intentionally but eventually married to USC, and even allow them to apply for AOS rather than Consular Processing? \n\nSeems like they are encouraging folks to use this route, rather than using the proper channels (K1/CR1)?",

Consequently , they also banned me for life from ever getting ESTA. \nThey said however that I was welcome to apply for B1 or B2. \nRealistically , I would like to know what are my chances to be granted a tourist visa if I applied for one ? \nI genuinely want to come back only to be able to go back to burning man",

My wife who is going to be my ex now came on K 1 visa. I have sent USCIS to withdraw her 129F and 1-864 for Adjustment of status. Her application is still pending and not approved yet.

Besides, let's not play all innocent here: if she was in fact using you for a green card then you probably wouldn't have had a chance with her to begin with and only got her because of the green card.\n\nI used to know of this middle aged guy with a US citizenship who on his own merits could never even get a 2nd date with a girl in the US of any nationality, but would go back to his home country that was falling apart with people desperate to get out and land himself the hottest girl in the village half his age and bring her here and then act shocked that they would leave him once they got their green card and didn't have to put up with him anymore.\n\nNobody is obligated to you just because you were able to get them a green card.

That\u2019s either true or not and if true, rationalizing that deception and betrayal by assuming its true but that OP is a scumbag is quite a leap\n\nYou can think there\u2019s more to it than he\u2019s said (though your particular leap makes no sense from what we know) without being an ass.

Don't let him scare you into thinking it will.\n\nYou have up until he gets a green card in his hands to pull the case. So do this yesterday. You don't even have to have filed for divorce yet. You can pull it at any time during the wait for the process. \n\nBut once he is issued a green card, you will be bound to the affidavit of support. \n\nStart contacting USCIS ...TODAY!...with all of your evidence and case numbers and letters requesting to withdraw.  \n\nAnd cut all communication from him because he will continue to feed you with BS like this to stop you from your RIGHTS.",

He sounds like a nut job and may want to try and frame you for domestic abuse which would allow him to adjust status without your support.\nMy order of events would be:\n- Withdraw I-130 and I-864 in writing\n- Quietly pack your stuff and leave\n- If necessary, block all communication (but surely never meet him alone so he can\u2019t frame you)\n- worry about filing for divorce whenever you feel like it",
