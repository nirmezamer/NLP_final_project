            "My husband was denied a US tourist visa for us to go visit my family despite us both living in his home country, having jobs and assets and a dog and myriad ties to his country. The interview was over the minute they found out his spouse was American, and the officer said (paraphrased), \"don't even bother. You'll never get a tourist visa being married to an American because so many have illegally adjusted status, just apply for the spousal visa\". Is this true? Is the reviewer speaking out of his ass? Is there any way around this? Thanks for doing this :)",

However, plan accordingly, as travelers without compliant documents are likely to be delayed at the border as U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers work to verify identity and citizenship. \n\n> CBP also has the discretion to make citizenship and entry determinations for minor children born in Canada to U.S. citizens.  \n\nI am wondering about the last point on minor children born in Canada to US citizens. Why is it only limited to minor children born in Canada as opposed to children born in other countries US citizen parents? Is Canada somehow special? \n\nSo suppose a man, woman, and a child show up at the border. Father is a US citizen. He has a passport. Mother isn't a citizen, but has a foreign passport with a visa. There's no father on the child's birth certificate. But he is the biological father. If he agrees in writing to support the child and acknowledged the child as his own, is CBP obligated to do a DNA test, that the dad agrees to pay, to confirm the child's citizenship?",

            "> Is Canada somehow special? \n\nYes, Canada has a number of special privileges in US immigration law. It's a country with deep ties to the US, similar levels of wealth reducing the motivation for immigration fraud, and is essentially impossible to enter illegally other than from the US. All of these factors have resulted in policy that is more favorable to Canadians.\n\n> is CBP obligated to do\n\nCBP isn't obligated to do anything. As the link you quoted says, CBP has the *discretion* to make citizenship determinations. If there is ambiguity they will refuse and tell you to go talk to the consulate."
