            "Like: very fun idea\n\nDislike: I can't tell if it's a \"weird to learn/weirder to master\" combat style or just clunky.",
            "Perfect post actually, I just finished S-ranking every mission in DMD and I'm currently doing the Hell and Hell playthrough as I'm typing this.   \n  \nV's entire gameplay in comparison to everyone else's, in my opinion, is extremely boring. It's an interesting take on how to play the game and is definitely unique, design wise he's interesting too. You can do some decent-ish combos with Shadow and Griffin and having Nightmare can make an area go boom which always makes me happy.\n\nBut V gets worse the higher difficulty you go, if you lose a familiar you're extremely vulnerable, less so if it's Griffin, more so if it's Shadow. But having to put yourself in danger to get half your power back isn't a fun way to play in my experience.  \n  \nYes, V can just side-dodge spam with Shadow and you're invulnerable but you're not actually doing any damage which leads to fights lasting for AGES and when you inevitably die due to mis-stepping you'll want to punch your monitor because the boss battle took ridiculously long. Griffon is arguably the weakest familiar you have access to as well and it's not even close, if you ever play as him in DMD or Hell and Hell and want to survive, ALWAYS choose Shadow over Griffon as a lot of his moves have quite a lot of end lag and lead to you either getting hit or him getting downed. Also Nightmare is VERY reliant on RNG, sometimes he'll spawn in and kill everything for you and other times he's just a walking bin bag.  \n  \nV's damage output is already quite bad in comparison to the other cast members, which is lore accurate but translates poorly into gameplay. Yes, Nightmare's beam can do an insane amount of damage and there are moves which Shadow and Griffin can do which are hard-hitting, but you're constantly having to balance making sure you don't get hit off screen with making sure your familiars don't die and that you have enough DT to escape a sticky situation. I personally don't enjoy that but I get why some people do.\n\nOn DMD and Hell and Hell, I audibly groan when I have to play his missions, but that's what happens when you have Nero, Dante and Vergil to play as in comparison.\n\nTLDR: Design wise and gameplay (in theory) is good, but practically he's really weak and sucks to play as in the higher difficulties.",
            "Love taunts. He has the best ones imo, and considering that his gameplay doesn't require you to move to hit they're also the most useful.\n\nHate. Contextual inputs. These are weird and cam be awkward to pull off as both your summons dart about",
            "The concept is nice, and what works in him REALLY works imo. His finishers are always so fking satisfying to do\n\nHowever, his limited movesets paired with 2 of the worst bosses in the game in his mission aint so good for him",
            "Everything, this type of character doesn't fit DMC gameplay, at least not in the way that they did it.\n\nTo V work in DMC gameplay, his gameplay shouldn't be standing still while his summons attack, imo, he should simply invoke them in each specific attack.\n\nShadow would act like Rebellion being his way of doing frontal attacks, sending the enemy flying, etc.\n\nGriffon would be like Vergil's summoned swords.\n\nNightmare doesn't need to be changed, he works well for dmc gameplay.",
            "To quote a wise man:\n\n# \"V doesn't fight anything.\"",
            "Like: His taunts, V deadass has the best taunts out of all the characters in the game.\n\nDislike: The fact that he doesn't have as much in terms of actual abilities compared to Nero and Dante",
            "V as a concept is fine. Like I said elsewhere, he's like DMC4 Nero. Meaning it's a good prototype but he's lacking. One of the issues is that V feels not engaged in the combat himself. For obvious reasons we know why but he has a feeling similar to just shooting guns in DMC2. Yes I do combos with him but I can't shake that feeling.  And Griffon/Shadow feel like playing Vergil but it's DMC3 Vergil(Force Edge/Yamato only)+sword formations.\n\nHe needs more variation. He feels like he would be perfect for a set up character. A dude with traps of all kinds. Either rework the summons to have more options or give him an extra summon. Maybe both. And I think he needs fast attacks. Summon attacks that send him and the summon towards the enemy similar to Stinger/Streak/Rapid Slash. And because it's V, upon hit he jumps off the summon and keeps his distance. He should be able to ride all his summons and do attacks like that. \n\nThat is why I don't like playing him. He just feels incomplete.  It's very similar to play Nero after playing Vergil/Dante but far worse. And it sucks that technically, he's dead. So he might never get improved upon. A summoner Devil Hunter is such a cool idea.",
            "Shadow never runs to where I want him to run",
            "The fact that he has to manually finish enemies with a specific move annoyed me. I have always played by using combos on any available enemies and moving on when they have had enough. I kinda forget to use the finishing move\n\nOtherwise, I like pretty much everything. His playstyle is weird, but really suited me well aside from the one complaint"
