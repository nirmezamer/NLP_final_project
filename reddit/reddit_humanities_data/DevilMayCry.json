He is already teaching Nero to maintain the distance, evade, and defend.\n\n\nHim saying \"You disappoint me\". He is just like any parent teaching a child, and said child is not listening what the parent is teaching. This goes back to maintaining the distance while fighting, evade, and defend.Vergil is also talking to the player via fourth wall breaking that its the player's fault that Nero lost. Vergil is talking to two children both Nero and the player to listen to him.\n\n\nThis is also similar to the Deadly Fortune novel that Dante is teaching Nero during their 2nd fight. The twins know how to cool down Nero. But the way of talking and fighting is different. Dante is more playful aggressive, while Vergil is just holding back.",
            "Just a correction \n\nIt's not actually \"within minutes\"\n\nI'm pretty sure that since V's acquaintance with Dante (May 3rd) and their first attack on Urizen (May 15) are almost weeks apart, V knows Nero for a week or even more too.",
            "I certainly caught that.\nI enjoyed those little moments\nIt's a shame it didn't come from Vergil directly and only one half of him. Though that fits Vergil well\n\nI am glad he thanked Nero for helping him become one again, though, even if Nero had no idea he was doing it.\n\nIt might be just me\nBut I HC that if Vergil had known about Nero earlier, he might have stayed to be a dad. \nDunno will agree, but hey, it's just my opinion"
