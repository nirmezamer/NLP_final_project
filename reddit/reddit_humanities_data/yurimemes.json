        "content": "Before things spiral even more out of control, we would like to address the recent controversy going on the sub.\n\nFirst of all, **we will not ban any posts or comments for simply containing or mentioning the series** ***Gushing Over Magical Girls*** **and other similar works containing similar themes.**\n\nSecond, we however would like to clarify what the extent of what rule 2 pertains to:\n\n1. **Any posts or comments showing explicitly suggestive depictions of child-like characters are not allowed.** As long as the content of the post or comment is safe, it is fine.\n2. **Posts or comments of you, a user, showing any sexual or romantic interests towards child-like characters are also not allowed.** You can compliment them or show appreciation to their designs, just not in a creepy way. Leave the attraction to be just between the characters.\n\nFurthermore, we want to remind everyone **not to harass each other.** You can criticize any works as long as it's civil and it's limited only to the work itself. Similarly, someone criticizing a work that you enjoy is not a personal attack on you. Making assumptions about each other and using that to harass each other is not a civil discussion and will not be tolerated. See rule 9.\n\nNext, we want to bring attention to the new spoiler tagging rules.\n\nThank you u/yrtemmySymmetry for a more detailed version of the rule:\n\n>Rule 4: Spoiler Policy  \n>  \n>4.1) Any posts relating to new chapters or episodes must be spoiler tagged for 2 weeks until their release. Manga content not covered in the a currently airing Anime adaptions must be spoiler tagged as well.  \n>  \n>4.2) Any twists and turns not relating to yuri relationships must be spoiler tagged unless the source material is older than 5 years.  \n>  \n>For example: \"Legend of Korra\" KorraSami content is okay, despite this development happening at the very end of the show.  \n>  \n>Spoiling the ending of \"Gundam: Witch from Mercury\", simply because it features a WxW couple is not allowed, and such posts require proper spoiler tags.  \n>  \n>4.3) Any spoiler tagged post needs to include what its spoiler refers to in the title.  \n>  \n>For example: \"\\[Owl House S2 Ep11\\] They're so cute together\". If you aren't certain of the exact episode or season, include the series name at the very least.\n\nAnother reminder, please provide the source in any part of your post: title, comment, description, etc. See rule 7.\n\nOne more thing, we are still working on the other rules' caveats and nuances. Look out for any changes that may occur.\n\nOnce again, ***\"Be good to each other\"***",

            "For the spoiler rule, how does that work with specific twists within the relationship? Like, should talking about >!the divorce!< in episode 17 of G Witch be spoilered, or is it fine?",

            "So just to be clear, screenshots of \"those\" scenes from either the manga or anime of GOMG violates rule 2 based on your first clarification, correct?",

            "The genshin shippers live off of delusions",
            "Mihoyo knows how players are, they rarely ever confirm any relationship and shippers get to have a field day with random interactions.\n\nAlthough mihoyo is a company known for doing many lesbian characters, the popularity from genshin probably got them on the sights of the Chinese government, forcing them into this style",
            "That ship is a crack ship that somehow took off. Its like if you shipped the Joker and Beast Boy from the Teen Titans",
            "Genshin is going to have very few canon relationships at all and no playable characters are likely to ever be confirmed to be involved with anyone. Some characters do have what I think could very easily be called ship teases but on the other hand there are some very popular ships that have very little to go on, ganqing and Arlefuri being prime examples of that. All of that said, this sort of thing is hardly unique to Genshin, shipping characters who look at each other once is probably as old as fandom.",
