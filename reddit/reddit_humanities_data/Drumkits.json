        "content": "Our community is under new moderation, u/OwenPi and myself are here to deliver a safe and cohesive sub-reddit in which you can peruse through for all of your drum kit needs, without worry of viruses, legal ramifications, scams, so on and so forth. The old rules made by the old mods are really outdated and don't cover a lot of ground, so here is a new and improved set of rules for your consideration.\n\n-No Copyright/Trademark Infringement or Piracy (This includes uploads from Splice)\n\n-Original content (No reposts)\n\n-Clear titles (Avoid excessive symbols/cluttered titles. Ideally label drum kits so users know what they're in store for style-wise)\n\n-Drum kits for use in digital audio workstations only. This sub isn't for anything related to physical drum kits.\n\n-Kits should be royalty free, you can ask for credit if you really want, but don't expect it.\n\n-Links to your Discord and Telegram are unacceptable, especially when they are disguised as drum kit downloads (it's fine to include them with an actual drum kit)\n\n-Post quality samples (Lo-fidelity is fine, but unusable samples will be removed)\n\n-No loop kits (Your drum kit can have loops, but should be secondary to the drums, but do not post a loop-only kit, there's other subs for that) [https://www.reddit.com/r/loopkits/](https://www.reddit.com/r/loopkits/)\n\n-No preset packs (again, there's other subs for that) (Can't find any that I can endorse in this capacity though as everyone I have found for whatever reason has pirated kits or otherwise)\n\n-No spam of any kind\n\n-No trading drum kits\n\n-Post free to download drum kits only (again, only drum-kits that you have the right to share, legally)\n\n-No inquiry posts (Looking for \\_\\_\\_ Drum kit, does anyone have \\_\\_\\_\\_, Where can I find the \\_\\_\\_\\_ kit, etc.)\n\n-Self promo within the confines of your kit is ok. Feel free to \\*include\\* a text file with links to your socials or storefront or whatever, but do not post these links on the sub itself.\n\n-I scan kits for viruses when I can, any malicious content, whether you were privvy to it or not will absolutely not be tolerated and will result in a permanent ban. If you are unsure, first ensure that you are allowed to share the drumkit, because that probably means you didn't make it yourself, then secondly run a scan to prevent this from happening.\n\nAny comments, questions, concerns, suggestions, so on and so forth will be answered promptly via mod-mail. (Although please refrain from asking the mods things like \"where is this kit from 3+ years ago\" I don't know, we aren't omniscient when it comes to drumkits, or in general for that matter.) You may reply directly to this thread if it doesn't get automatically locked. You may also message me (u/evilrari) directly if you so wish. This is a community with a lot of potential, and I do not want to see it go to waste. I am here to help however I can. I truly hope that you all enjoy your time spent on the sub, or at the very least, find what you are looking for as safely and efficiently as possible.\n\n(Side note, our Auto-Mod is seemingly pretty strict, a testament to how lazy the old mods were, I am constantly reversing removal decisions on the bot's part, but if something you post gets removed and you don't believe it to be in violation of the rules, please notify us immediately. If I can figure out how to get it to stop giving flat-out disrespectful replies I will also, but it will usually at least give you some sort of explanation as to why your post was removed, just something to keep in mind.)",

            "So if i cant find what im looking for, im not allowed to ask for help here?",
            "Can posters start uploading kits with a preview of the sound? Either scrolling through some or just a quick beat with some the sounds.",
            "Not really. The TL;DR is don't get us into legal trouble, don't scam anyone, and don't give anyone viruses. But if you have any suggestions, I'm happy to hear them.",
            "No it's not. Original kits only.",
            "Not entirely your fault xD but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't at least a little inspired by that, but it is also in reference to the people who use 100% of the 300 character limit of the title or the people who title their Drum Kits like a Lil B music video in 2011, doesn't give people a lot to work with yk? Nothing wrong with trying to have a theme and everything we're just trying to keep the sub as user-friendly as possible. It's all luv bro",
            "Still waiting to hear back from the other mod, but for now I'm going to make an executive decision on that.\n\nYou can include a preview within the confines of your kit. If your kit is pre-zipped you can upload a preview separately on Google Drive or similar file sharing services. I know on Google Drive at least you can listen to audio files like this without having to download the file. YouTube and Soundcloud links however are not allowed because that falls under self-promo.",
            "more than understandable kro all luv",
