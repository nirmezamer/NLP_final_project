This is a public subreddit, anyone can view and post here. Second, we have a three active mods for a subreddit of over 134,097 members as I write this. In case you don\u2019t know, here are a few facts about the mods:\n\n\n1. We don\u2019t get paid.\n\n\n2. We have lives outside Reddit.\n\n\n3. See #1.\n\n\nPlease continue to report problematic threads. Before you write some shitty little comment about the mods, though, take a minute and look at what you\u2019re saying to an unpaid volunteer who is doing their best to keep 134,097 people happy. \n\nWe\u2019re happy to take suggestions, we\u2019re happy to make improvements, but if you can\u2019t be civil to other members *and moderators,* we\u2019re happy for you to go somewhere else. \n\n",

            "I just wanted to tell everybody, that this sub keeps me sane. And I think the mods are doing a good job.",
            "I just want to tell you both good luck, we're all counting on you",

            "The best mods are those that go largely unnoticed.  This place is pretty chill, y'all are doing great.",
            "I would say the \"riding in back of truck\" thing is in line with rule 4 of this sub, as it does very well pertain to GenX, not only boomers. Some people can be so petty. \n\nAnyway...good job mods \ud83d\udc4d",
            "Please don\u2019t overmoderate. Light moderation is best. And Thank You for donating your time. \n\nAnd I was born in\u201973 and I definitely remember riding in the back of my Dad\u2019s truck as a kid and down to the football field with helmet and pads in high school in 1990.  So that can still be a GenX thing and not just a baby boomer thing.",
            "My dad's truck had a big tool rack on it and we used to ride in the back of the truck standing up, holding on to the rack.  This is totally a Gen X thing, but whining and narcing on people isn't.  I can't believe someone complained about that."
