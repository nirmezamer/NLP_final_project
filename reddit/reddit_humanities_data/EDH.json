        "content": "Hey all. While playing EDH and getting paired in a pod, I got put in with a guy with a Nadu deck. He claimed he hadn\u2019t looked at the deck in a while so he wasn\u2019t sure what it did (which was suspicious since Nadu is MH3, so we can leave that where it is). Anyway, I played like 4 games before I left. Every single time he\u2019d just deck out and play the card that said if he had no cards in his library he won. He\u2019d just tutor shuko and then scute swarm and draw cards until he won. \n\nI was able to stop his infinite one time with Gates of Madara, but I still ended up losing. I don\u2019t mind losing, that\u2019s part of the game. It\u2019s just frustrating to be playing against a cEDH deck. He said it was \u201cfast mana\u201d and not cEDH but he\u2019d win by like turn 3 or 4. \n\nAnyway I told him that I had nothing with me that could remotely compete with the deck he was playing, and he just kept playing it. \n\nThen at the end, he was like \u201cI think this needs work before it can be a cEDH deck I\u2019m like 90% there\u201d so he knew what he was doing. \n\nMy question is is there anything you can say to a person that\u2019s doing this without sounding like complaining that I\u2019m losing?\n\n\nEdit: here\u2019s my deck for reference. Full disclosure, Nadu is in the 99, but is not abused with 0 equips or anything like that. \n\nhttps://manabox.app/decks/e5uModgyTd2O0fpsaiHKWQ",

Salubrious Snail and The Trinket Mage on Youtube are increasingly well known, and many Star City Games articles have led me to making some fun decks. \n\n  \nI need more.

            "You mentioned Salubrious Snail, and he is hands down the best deckbuilding content creator on the platform, and he doesn\u2019t even make deck techs really.\n\nI\u2019m an experienced deckbuilder and brewer (of 12 years) who, even in sharing a lot of his insight, is still learning from him.\n\nHe just articulates things so well. Puts some of my instincts to words in a way I never could, and gets into the real intricacies and nuances of deckbuilding in a way very scarcely replicated on the platform. I think I do know a lot of the things he says already, but yeah it\u2019s just how he articulates it. Puts to words the things that like- it\u2019s hard to explain. Deckbuilding is intricate, with moving parts and nuance that get a little lost in the theory especially when you get used to it. \n\nHe lays it all out well.\n\nI think his content is still definitely a little more catered to a more involved player, like a very new beginner may have a bit of trouble following, but if you\u2019re anywhere from interested in deckbuilding to a seasoned brewer, you will get something from Salubrious Snail.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty amazing.",

There are some other commander videos on their page that are not precons but popular legendary creatures from the set. Those get full decks and deck techs. I've put together 2 or 3 of the budget upgrades, and they really pack quite the punch.",
