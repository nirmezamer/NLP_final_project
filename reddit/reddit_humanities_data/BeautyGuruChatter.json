        "content": "Did anyone else see Taylor Wynn's reel on her night out at the Magic Mike show? She was on a trip with her mum, grandma and grandma's friend. The friend of the Grandma behaved pretty inappropriately on stage, touching the guy's bum (he seems uncomfortable and tries to move her hands) and then touching him in front.\n\nI realise Taylor can't control her Grandma's friend, but to put the video up and be admiring it seems weird to me. Aren't there rules about touching the dancers?\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8ue\\_9mpgBx/](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8ue_9mpgBx/)",

            "Ok I watched it thinking it would be a quick shot in the background, maybe she didn\u2019t notice. But no, she puts \u201cWait for it\u201d right before it happens, like it\u2019s some funny moment. I even Googled to see if somehow it\u2019s OK at MM shows, and it says their \u201cwands\u201d are off-limits. So this was 100% sexual harassment that she clearly thinks is funny.",

        "content": "Just listened to the G spot podcast by Stefanie Giesinger (Marcus's ex) where they discuss their relationship and Stefanie brings up how Marcus was quite closed off and anti relationships when they met and had lost his ability to trust in relationships after his break-up with Niomi. This shocked me as Niomi portrays herself as this sweet innocent girl online and noone knows what actually happened in the relationship, but it sounds like she cheated on him. Marcus goes on to say that the relationship ended in a very unpleasant way (more so for him than her). This makes me sad bc he recieved alot of hate when their relationship ended and parallels the Jim and Tanya situation. ",

They do 4-5 free exchanges a year if you really don\u2019t like the scent AND each sample comes with its own case. And their premium-tiers for more expensive perfumes are easy to switch between and easy to cancel. Way better than Scentbird.",

Glad this is getting more attention.",
