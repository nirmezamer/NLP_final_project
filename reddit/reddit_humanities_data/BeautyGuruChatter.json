I don't always understand it but I'm finding it fun and somewhat informative to watch - a lot of it goes over my head. I especially liked the short video she did to find the right red lipstick shade for her skin - she put on a color that was NOT a red and then it turned red on her - she broke down how she did this so we could each find our own perfect red - I will try this! I want to learn more and hope she continues this series, maybe with people with other skin tones.",

This shocked me as Niomi portrays herself as this sweet innocent girl online and noone knows what actually happened in the relationship, but it sounds like she cheated on him. Marcus goes on to say that the relationship ended in a very unpleasant way (more so for him than her). This makes me sad bc he recieved alot of hate when their relationship ended and parallels the Jim and Tanya situation. ",
