            "Every type has both a feeling and a thinking function. Te vs. Fe can also be framed as Fi vs. Ti. A Te user will be seen by a Ti user as illogical and vice versa. An Fe user will be seen as out of touch with the emotion by an Fi user and vice versa. \n\nFor example, an Fe user will express emotions in line with the group situation. They will smile when they say they are happy and cry at a funeral. If the Fe is weak, they might be using Ti to create an internal system for when to smile or cry. An Fi user might understand this to be fake, because when they are happy, they might not smile unless it's really genuine happiness that occurs \"authentically\". A lower Fi user might, however, just simply inform others about their happiness using Te. \n\nIn that context, if you are thinking about factoring others' opinions and emotions in a internally consistent logical system, that is more in line with Fe-Ti. \"Feeling\" isn't only about people-pleasing and emotions, as you say, and I just use emotion as an easy example to talk about the other side of Te and Fe",
            "Ive been typed as INFJ for the longest time, but now I consistently test as an INTJ. To investigate, I decided to compare the cognitive function stacks of each types and came up with two areas of interest: Te and Fe.\n\nIts a common mistype, given that both INFJ and INTJ are Ni-doms, but the differences in Fe and Te are really fascinating. Ive always considered myself to factor in peoples opinions and values as one more slider scale in a classical Hedonist evaluation, in the sense that arising a bad reaction out of others while accomplishing an objective more effectively would still, of course, be the result of an illogical choice. It is often that the best interests of others would also be the best interest of the objective itself, so the separation of the two categories are often arbitrary and not explicable in every given circumstance. That being said, Im not totally convinced that efficiency and protecting the values of other people are that far removed  this is of course not a question about people-pleasing, but rather of the defining line between Fe and Te.\n\nSince you guys of the MBTI community may have more experience, I want to gather your thoughts on this. Whats your experience with Te and Fe like? I think Im missing concrete data thats needed to draw any conclusions about my own stack.\n\nThanks for reading this far, have a stellar rest of your day."

            "What would you like to do for work, and how do you fair when others are emotional around you?",
            "Im currently in college studying theme park and attraction management. I want to end up managing a zoo or a wildlife park",
            "thats very original, how has college been for you so far?",
            "Yeah, Ive always loved animals and am naturally good at managing things and business so it was a perfect fit. I love college so far. Im going into my junior year this fall, so now Ill be taking more classes geared towards my major. Up until this point it was mostly core general classes",
            "awesome man, good to see somebody chasing their dreams. cheers",
            "When I'm happy enough, people feel the way I choose them to feel. And also when I'm not. But making people laugh makes me feel more comfortable feeling things through everyone else's displays. But in the rare cases I can't, I just try to wait it out like I do with everything else. And if someone is unjustifiably upset with me, I'm screwed. Because I need people to mimic and I hardly ever find a crowd that can help me manage my empathy. Especially if I can't make new memories to draw from.\n\nIn all honesty, my anxiety just explodes inside and I try now to give off anything bad for people to mimic. And I don't feel comfortable ignoring anything that might need fixing or understanding. My first thought is always to fix what I can and ignore how I feel.\n\nI'm more afraid of letting my emotions take over.\n\n  \nI grew up with abusive parents and socially isolated, so I'd rather be around people with a gun to my head than be alone. Even if I'm scared of making things worse. And if I see people being emotional, my instinct is to try to help when and where I can. But I'm also scared of asking people I'm close to to help others. I'd rather not get lectured about how I should let everyone deal with their own problems.",
            "Super insightful! I work in marketing and have been remote since 2020  the flexibility is nice but my extroverted heart needs group fitness and friends after hours. \n\nMy husband is an INTP-T Logician too, but also tests quite high for ISTP Virtuoso. Hes a Millwright, Heavy Duty Mechanic, and Supervisor with an encyclopedic mind on anything history, biology, and cars. Super creative and good at cooking too. \n\nI find his Fe is stronger than his Fi, or at least for loved ones. If theyre not his inner circle he dgaf \n\nHe can struggle with how much of a dreamer I am, but I find we really balance each other out and play to each others strengths (I also test quite high for ENFP Campaigner and ESFP Entertainer)",
            "Glad you think so! I can definitely see how working from home despite its flexibility, would leave you wanting more socialization eventually, especially if you're an extrovert. For me the alone time is probably one of the biggest benefits, the coziness and peace of being at home is wonderful for me. I prefer to socialize in small doses, so something like going out with my family to see some friends during the weekend tends to be more than enough for me.\n\nThat description makes so much sense honestly. I think both INTPs and ISTPs tend to be like that. We care deeply for our loved ones, but tend to seem indifferent outside of that circle. We tend to be pretty private types in general, especially regarding emotions, so we tend to only show the more tender and caring side of our personalities to those we love and trust for the most part.\n\nIt's really nice to hear how well the two of you balance each other out! While I don't think MBTI compatibility theory is the determining factor of how well two people can work as a couple (there's many other factors that play a role too), curiously INTP x ENFJ is often said to be a very compatible pairing, for pretty much the same reasons you said. Both types balance each other out and play to each other's strengths. Not to mention, according to Socionics we often feel a kind of attraction towards partners that excel in our less preferred functions, and while it's not always true for everyone, I've found it true for me. I tend to feel really comfortable with strong Fe users, and I've found that spending time around them even helps me get more in touch with my own Fe. Meanwhile they in return seem to value my Ti. We balance each other out and even help each other grow.",

I'd be able to bring ideas to the table as well, collaborate with ENFJ to help make a great slideshow, and I think overall we'd all make a great team together. The xNTPs are a close second choice though.",

            "Yeah, sure.. the good thing about dating another INFP is that they easily understand you and you can cultivate a deep emotional bond with them. Communication styles would likely be similar. They are usually emotionally intelligent, less likely to dismiss my subjective emotions and most of our values would also match. INFP men sometimes tend to be a bit emotionally closed off but with some work, it can be fine. If hes a good person, has most of the traits that I look for in a partner and is worth it, then yes, Ill be happy to date another INFP. Without a doubt. \n\nIt is true that I tend to have preference for other types. I usually like introverted intuitive thinker (INTX) types better because they are similar (IN) but also very different and they balance me out. As a growth-oriented person, I enjoy challenges, working out our differences and growing stronger together. But at the end of the day, I ultimately want someone who will choose me, accept me, like me and love me for who I am. Thats more important to me. Someone who is going to be there with me through thick and thin. Someone who wont leave me or make me feel unloved. So it doesnt matter honestly, whether hes an INFP or not. I dont go by MBTI types anyway when I like someone. And I certainly dont want to miss out on a great guy just because Id rather not date his MBTI type.",

            "While I do get along with other INTPs in general, I don't really see myself dating an INTP. I think dating someone too similar to myself would not work out. Besides, I tend to find myself more naturally drawn towards types that complement my own, such as ENFJs for example.",
            "Not me, I can only really date women that are more straightforward and aggressive than me.\n\nINFP women dont turn me on and Im absolutely sure they dont like me that way either, just best friends imho.",
            "The one confirmed INTP I've been friends with is just amazing. Super healthy, loving, caring, a huge nerd like me, an artist and a gamer, and the only person to consistently battle me in chess and win repeatedly, but more important chess with him is fun af. IMO he's a genius. I may have had a tiny friend crush on him. More importantly, he knows his MBTI type but also does not like the false limitations of MBTI, something I always admired about him. \n\nSo, maybe. Because cognitive function stacks don't actually equate personality, or the presentation of a type 100% of the time.",
