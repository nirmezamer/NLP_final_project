Tolkien\n- Edited by Christina Scull and Wayne Hammond\n- Three-volume boxed set\n- 1620 pages and 240 poems, including 77 previously unpublished\n- 12 September 2024\n- ISBN 9780008628826\n\n[From the Press Release (via TCG)](https://www.tolkienguide.com/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?post_id=55644#forumpost55644):\n\n>HarperCollins has announced it is to publish The Collected Poems of J.R.R. Tolkien, edited by Christina Scull & Wayne G. Hammond, in September 2024.\n>\n>Poetry was the first way in which Tolkien expressed himself creatively and through it the seeds of his literary ambition would be sown. Out of one of his earliest poems, The Voyage of \u00c9arendel the Evening Star, begun in 1914, would appear the character, E\u00e4rendil, and from him would spring the world of \u2018the Silmarillion\u2019, and then The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, each of whose stories are enriched with poems both humorous and haunting, magical and moving.\n>\nThe world-renowned Tolkien scholars, Christina Scull & Wayne G. Hammond, provide the stories behind, and analysis of, each poem, as well as revealing the extraordinary amount of work that Tolkien devoted to every one, creating a landmark new publication which confirms that J.R.R. Tolkien was as fine a poet as he was a writer.\n>\n>Christina Scull & Wayne G. Hammond say: \u2018It has been an honour to prepare, at Christopher Tolkien\u2019s invitation, these volumes of his father\u2019s poems, putting into print many previously unpublished works and ensuring that Tolkien\u2019s talent for poetry becomes more widely known. Charged at first to review only his early poems, we soon saw the benefits of examining his entire poetic opus across six decades, vast though it is with hundreds of printed and manuscript sources, and of showing its evolution with comments in the manner of Christopher\u2019s magisterial History of Middle-earth series. Not long before his death, we were able to send Christopher a trial portion of the book, which he praised as \u201cremarkable and immensely desirable\u201d.\u2019\n>\n>Chris Smith, Publishing Director, says: \u2018Poetry runs like a vein of mithril through all the books that J.R.R. Tolkien wrote. He delighted in language and storytelling, and the almost 200 poems contained in this collection reveal him at his creative best in verse. Within this new three-volume set, there are worlds in miniature to be discovered and revelled in, populated with unforgettable characters and settings both familiar and full of wonder.\u2019\n\n\n[From the Amazon listing](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0008628823):\n\n>World first publication of the collected poems of J.R.R. Tolkien, spanning almost seven decades of the author\u2019s life and presented in an elegant three-volume hardback boxed set.\n>\n>J.R.R. Tolkien aspired to be a poet in the first instance, and poetry was part of his creative life no less than his prose, his languages, and his art. Although Tolkien\u2019s readers are aware that he wrote poetry, if only from verses in *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings*, its extent is not well known, and its qualities are underappreciated. Within his larger works of fiction, poems help to establish character and place as well as further the story; as individual works, they delight with words and rhyme. They express his love of nature and the seasons, of landscape and music, and of words. They convey his humour and his sense of wonder.\n>\n>The earliest work in this collection, written for his beloved, is dated to 1910, when Tolkien was eighteen. More poems would follow during his years at Oxford, some of them very elaborate and eccentric. Those he composed during the First World War, in which he served in France, tend to be concerned not with trenches and battle, but with life, loss, faith, and friendship, his longing for England, and the wife he left behind. Beginning in 1914, elements of his *legendarium*, \u2018The Silmarillion\u2019, began to appear, and the \u2018Matter of Middle-earth\u2019 would inspire much of Tolkien\u2019s verse for the rest of his life.\n\n[From Wayne and Christina](https://wayneandchristina.wordpress.com/2024/03/12/tolkiens-collected-poems/):\n\n> HarperCollins having announced today that The Collected Poems of J.R.R. Tolkien will be published this September, we\u2019re able to speak publicly about our next book for the first time since an edition of Tolkien\u2019s verse was suggested to us in HarperCollins\u2019 offices in April 2016. ...\n\n>...In the beginning, Christopher had no thought of publishing his father\u2019s entire vast, complex poetic opus. Instead, he focused on what he called the \u2018early poems\u2019, which we interpreted as those composed mostly before the 1930s. Many of those were, indeed, not yet published, some not even recorded in our Chronology. But we saw that there were also unpublished poems of note from later decades, as well as some which had been published but were now hard to find, and we knew that not a little of Tolkien\u2019s earlier poetry had evolved into later verse, for example in his 1962 Adventures of Tom Bombadil. Surely, no one can appreciate Tolkien as a poet fully without considering all of these works together.\n>\n>Discussions with Christopher about the book occurred at intervals; he himself was busy, preparing *The Fall of Gondolin*. At length, we proposed that it would be a lost opportunity not to collect as many of his father\u2019s poems as possible, regardless of their date of composition, language, or circumstance, and to model such a collection after Christopher\u2019s *History of Middle-earth*, combining original texts with editorial notes and commentary. For Tolkien\u2019s longer poems already published as separate books, such as *The Legend of Sigurd and Gudr\u00fan* and *The Fall of Arthur*, or in composite works such as *The Lays of Beleriand*, we suggested that brief, representative extracts be included, in order to show in full Tolkien\u2019s development as a poet and verse forms he did not use elsewhere; and in the same way, we would draw also from his translations of Old and Middle English poems, such as *Beowulf* and *Sir Gawain and the Green Knight*. In March 2019, in what would be the final message he sent to us, Christopher approved our concept and trial entries....\n\n>...A number of factors, namely economies of production, ruled out a *Complete Poems* by Tolkien. Nevertheless, the *Collected Poems* will include most of the verses Tolkien is known to have written, and for most of these, multiple versions which show their evolution. There are at least 240 discrete poems, depending on how one distinguishes titles and versions, presented in 195 entries and five appendices. When possible, we have used manuscripts and typescripts in the Bodleian Library, at Marquette University, and at the University of Leeds. We have chosen not to include all of the one hundred or so poems contained in The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, but have made a representative selection \u2013 surely, no one who reads the *Collected Poems* will not already have at least one copy of Tolkien\u2019s two most popular works. His longer poems, as we have said, will be presented as excerpts. The book will also include a long introduction to Tolkien as a poet, a brief chronology of his poetry, and a glossary of archaic, unusual, or unfamiliar words he used in his verse.\n>\n>HarperCollins have announced the *Collected Poems* as a three-volume boxed set. The Amazon UK description gives its extent as 1,368 pages, which is close to the number in our typescript; in fact, the printed text will run to more than 1,500 pages. There are currently no plans for a de luxe edition, but we\u2019re aiming for an elegant trade release. We have not yet heard about a U.S. edition.\n\n[From Wayne and Christina (via TCG)](https://www.tolkienguide.com/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?post_id=55668#forumpost55668):\n\n>The Amazon description, which we didn't see before it was posted, seems to be based on our initial report to Christopher in December 2016, ... We had guessed, way back when, that Tolkien wrote between 250 and 300 poems altogether, without knowing how many one would, or could, include in a collection, and that \"some 60\" poems among the scans we received were unpublished. We knew, however, of other unpublished poems not in that group of scans, which we had seen at the Bodleian, and later we learned of still more.\n>\n>We say in our blog post that the Collected Poems will include \"at least 240 discrete poems\". This does, as we also say, depend on one's definition. Some of the poems morph in their evolution so much that one could either count a work as a single entity in a variety of forms, or as a variety of separate poems that are closely related. Hence our vagueness about the number: we didn't want to overhype it.\n>\n>There's a similar issue with counting which poems have been published and which haven't. The best we can say is that among the poems we include, 77 have not been published before in any form, or only a few lines from them have appeared, e.g. in Carpenter's biography. But that is to leave out alternate, unpublished forms of some poems included in The History of Middle-earth, an extreme example of which is the sequence The Grimness of the Sea > The Tides > Sea Chant of an Elder Day > Sea-Song of an Elder Day > The Horns of Ulmo > The Horns of Ylmir. Christopher Tolkien included only the latter of these in full in The Shaping of Middle-earth, with notes on and snippets from some earlier versions, and by the time one reaches the text at the end of the evolution, only about one-half of one line of The Grimness of the Sea has survived! At any rate, there will be a lot that's new.",

Most weeks will cover one chapter. The exceptions being the final two sections of *The Silmarillion* will be grouped in one week and \"The Original Tale\", and \"The Last Version\" chapters of *The Fall of Gondolin* will be split up into three weeks each. Week 1 will begin Dec. 31, 2023.\n\nI have also decided to interject a special *Overlithe* (leap day on the Shire Calendar) discussion on Feb. 29, 2024.\n\nA year-long schedule means nobody has to feel rushed or stressed to keep up, but able to take a leisurely approach, savoring every chapter and page. Someone who comes in late, or has to give it up for a while, would have time to catch up. And those new to JRRT's great work would have plenty of time to discuss each chapter to their heart's content.\n\nI also look forward to people's comments concerning their particular edition of the book they are reading (or possess) including artwork, misprints, errors, interesting facts, etc. I would like the discussions to stay on-target with just the books (referencing other Tolkien-related books and materials is fine) but not various movies, TV productions and the like.\n\nMy personal primary texts used:\n\n*The Silmarillion*, 2nd ed.

Having read UT and the Galadriel stuff in it, there are obvious reasons why that material did not make the cut for example \n\nBut since I have not read HoME, I cant really judge if the omissions from there make sense. Heard especially Sauron defeated has been mostly left out. I have a rough understanding from hearsay that the Notion Club papers are time travel stories, so it seems likely that most of that material would be omitted due to being incompatible with canon.\n\nBut just for the little completionist in me (that still has to come around to HoME, being in the middle of FoN and Letters Extended right now): Are there any small or big omissions worth looking up while going through FoN that did not make the cut?\n\nI know that for some reason a paragraph was removed from the description of Numenor for example.\n\nThanks in advance for any hints! :) ",

            "I don't have my copy handy, but I don't remember anything being omitted. It was just more of a completed 2A package rather than it existing in bit-pieces all over the place in other publications.",
            "It's like a published Silmarillion of the second age.\n\nTrying to be consistent with LotR at the cost of not mentioning hundreds of pages with alternative versions.",
            "Thanks a lot, that is super helpful. Seems like I will be good with just FoN untilI get to HoME.\n\nAnd yeah, \"canon\" is a loaded word here. I mean it more in the sense of not having major contradictions.",
            "It does try to create a (more or less) internally-consistent view of the Second Age, but Sibley does underscore every omission that's made in the text and where one can go to seek out variant versions for further reading. I was quite happy with the work, and the omissions made sense to me, but Sibley doesn't hide the stuff he cuts.",
            "I do not have access to The Fall of N\u00famenor book. I only read the publicly available parts of it on the Harper Collins Website in the preview function, such as the table of contents and the introduction About this Book. I wonder if Sibley mentions that two wizards already came to Middle-earth during the Second Age, if and which names and colours of robes he describes and if he sticks to the text that J.R.R. Tolkien wrote in the chapter Last Writings - The Wizards in The Peoples of Middle-earth and at the end of Note on the delay of Gil-galad and the N\u00famen\u00f3reans in The Nature of Middle-earth or if he has made any editorial changes there.",
            "Appendix B of LOTR says in the introductory text for the section \"The Third Age\": \"When maybe a thousand years had passed, and the first shadow had fallen on Greenwood the Great, the Istari or Wizards appeared in Middle-earth. \\[...\\] The two highest of this order (of whom it is said there were five) were called by the Eldar Curun\u00edr, \u2018 the Man of Skill\u2019, and Mithrandir, \u2018 the Grey Pilgrim\u2019, but by Men in the North Saruman and Gandalf. \" It only says that \"the Istari\" came around T.A. 1000, but does not specify which Istari came at this time and only specifies  that it is said there were five in this order of wizards. Technically it does not say that all five wizards came around T,A. 1000, so the sentence does leave some wiggle room to intepret it, that \"the wizards\" could also just refer to three out of the five wizards of the order. It is noteworthy that in contrast  to the essay on the Istari in UT and in contrast to the chapter Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age in the Silmarillion Appendix B does not mention the sequence in which the wizards identified by their names or as others arrived in Middle-earth (there is a difference in the sequence between UT where Saruman comes first, then two clad in sea-blue who went into the East with Saruman and one in earthen brown and last came Gandalf, and The Silmarillion where Saruman came first, after him Gandalf and Radagast and then others of the Istari who went into the east of Middle-earth).",
            "In his last writings J.R.R. Tolkien puts the arrival of the two Wizards Morinehtar and R\u00f3mestamo who went into the east around the time of the beginning of the War of the Elves and Sauron in the Second Age, so is Sibley used this it must be somewhere after the forging of the One Ring when the Elves realised that they were in danger and could send prayers to Aman. The Nature of Middle-earth says that Sauron began gathering troops already in 1605, but his gathering of troops was opposed by the two wizards. So if Sibley used this he must have inserted it somewhere there chronologically.",
            ">\"When maybe a thousand years had passed, and the first shadow had fallen on Greenwood the Great, the Istari or Wizards appeared in Middle-earth.\n\nYes, I think Sibley is probably keeping FoN consistent with that.",
            "Canon is a complex concept in Tolkien. Everything written by him would be by definition 'canon,' yet he spent his whole life revising texts and not all versions of things or parts of it are compatible with each other, or chronologically consistent. Only The Hobbit and LOTR were published in his lifetime so that that 'canon' is fixed; everything else was in a lifelong state of revision. Christopher pulled together some of these materials into as readable, cohesive a form as was possible at the time, but acknowledged it was imperfect, and spent the rest of his life trying to provide the rest of the material and as much context as he could. That's what HoMe is.\n\nI'm not sure where FoN was promoted as \"the canon friendly 2nd age material.\" FoN is simply collected material available on the Second Age, collated into one volume for easy reference. In that sense, it can be read the same way one reads HoMe. It doesn't contain anything not found somewhere else, it's just a convenient collection.\n\nFor the most part, if something's not in FoN, it's because it's pertinent to the First or Third Age; for example, Sauron Defeated is about the end of the War of the Ring, which happens at the end of the Third Age. Obviously that wouldn't be part of a \"Fall of Numenor\" volume, as Numenor has by that time been under the waves for thousands of years.\n\nIf you're interested in reading HoMe, you can get by without FoN, since it contains nothing unique. But FoN was collated for those who aren't really interested in reading the entire HoMe, but do have a special interest in the Second Age. Hope this helps a bit!",
            "Not that I recall. And a quick skim does not show any.\n\nI think he keeps it consistent with LotR, which has the Istari arriving in the Third Age.\n\nI may be forgetting something, however."

        "content": "Basically, Tolkien was struggling with the issues of Orcs' origins and one idea of the Orcs was that they were corrupted by Melkor from Elves or Men (depending on which you believe in). The trouble is that they would need to be shown mercy whenever possible and there would be individuals or tribes that would be good despite what Melkor and Sauron did to them (due to Tolkien's beliefs that not one race would be wholly evil). Maybe a solution would to have those good orcs\\* and scenes of showing mercy to orcs be 'offscreen'\\*  both to not mess up the pacing of the books and to allow for more side stories while allowing for 'onscreen' depictions of orcs to be bad guys to kill if needed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(I actually came up with this concept originally when brainstorming concepts for a Command and Conquer fanfic universe where the Tiberium universe is not a splinter timeline of the Red Alert timeline but the far, far future of Arda (again branching off from Arda becoming our world) to bring in good orcs and explain where would they be during the events of the War of the Ring)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Tolkien actually wanted it in a draft of Lord of the Rings and Frodo would have met them. He canned it as he can't find a way to put it in the books...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Similar to ground based operations in the Freespace video game .

            "It is arguable that mercy was shown \"onscreen\" when after the war, Aragorn gives the land of Mordor to those dwelling there. Who lives in Mordor? A lot of freaking orcs. Many will say that it was given to just the human slaves of Sauron. But if that is true, what happened to all the orcs? There had to be workers, children, and mothers. That would imply that Aragorn committed genocide.",
            "I never really understood this call for mercy re: the orcs. First, I can\u2019t think of any situation where the Fellowship could\u2019ve shown greater mercy to the orcs without jeopardizing the Quest. Second, I don\u2019t think they show any less mercy to the orcs vs the men in service of Sauron or Saruman. Third, the theme of showing mercy to one\u2019s enemies is already explored beautifully in the story with Sm\u00e9agol. Fourth, even if you were to argue that the Free Peoples behaved unmercifully toward orcs during the story\u2026 that\u2019s fine? I think the story probably benefits from having heroes who mostly act in accordance with the values of their societies and their needs in the moment rather than to the author\u2019s moral principles.",
