            "The collectors edition is massively overpriced. I bought it, but I still know I payed way too much.",
            "From my understanding the CE is only available through Limited Run while the DE you can buy it at any retail store? I'm from EU and haven't found any store that's accepting pre-orders for Alan Wake 2 DE.",
            "Does anyone know how big is the expansion ? Like how many hours of content.",
            "Is that fucking Tim Breaker? Shit, finally, we can officially connect it with Quantum Break.",
            "I want the art book! Literally just the art book. Has anyone mentioned selling the art book separately?",
            "Fuck me for believing them when they said it was digital only I guess.\n\nI suppose in future I'll just never buy any \"digital only\" Remedy releases at launch when it would actually help their sales figures.",
            "Im really disappointed that theres no Collectors edition for PC.\nI really want to have a lamp, but I never had any console and wasting 200 bucks on a lamp seems like overkill.",
            "I remember getting down voted into oblivion on here for saying of course there will be a physical edition sooner or later, now it's 'amazing news' lol...",
            "Very disappointed that there's no CE for the PC. Is there a reason for that?"

            "AND MY MOTORCYCLE IS ALSO A WEREWOLF",
            "The whole DLC really is a gigantic love letter to the fans. Poking fun at the crazy and yet also thanking us for being loyal. \n\nRemedy have always been a favourite of mine, but they really have spent the last several years going above and beyond as a company, and I'm absolutely honoured that we have communities like this where we can enjoy all the fun.",
            "I just finished Time Breaker and I cannot believe what I just played. Absolutely insane stuff.",
            "I really enjoyed the dlc! I thought Number One Fan was probably the most fun out of the bunch, Northstar was kinda weak but still enjoyable and left me wanting to see more of whatever that ending was, Time Breaker was probably the best story wise. Gave some insight on Doors backstory and hopping from one reality to the next was great! The only thing I really wish we had gotten was an unlock for Alans old outfit. Seeing him wear it in two out of the three episodes was awesome!",
            "Playing as Rose was awesome, badass with that shotgun",
            "Does episode 3 have more than one ending?",
            "While I enjoyed all three,  I feel like 1 and 3 were significantly better than 2.",
            "Apparently with leaked content from datamining, there should have been 5 episodes. \n\nWith the passing of our dear James, it seems there was either a cut of content he was a part of or they toned down the stuff. Duno if this is true or not but it's what i've heard",
            "you can actually find the episodes in the dark place as alan wake. They are not just found in the menus",
            "I laughed out loud several times during the Rose story. Will play the rest when I get home tonight. Very funny and very cool."

            "It is my reading of the original painting that the viewer is placed in the position of a suitor to the farmer's daughter, hence the stern look on the man's face and the pitchfork in his hand.\n\nHere, it feels like we who are looking at the painting are cast in the role of the Dark Presence/Scratch, and Alan with his Angel Lamp in hand is set to protect Alice against our designs.",

            "I believe the answer is partially no. I at least partially remember if you shoot some enough even with the darkness they'd die eventually?",
            "Pretty much unless you start using arrows or something. It has a bit of a weird consistency troughout the games, as in AW:AN the crossbow pierces the darkness shield while in AW2 both the crossbow and upgraded hunting rifle manage to pierce it. I guess explosions would still kill them aswell, but it would make it a lot harder for our protagonists.",
            "In AW2 , Saga's hunting rifle can be upgraded to pierce through the darkness shield. In control AWE , Jesse's service weapon was powerful enough to destroy Hartman's darkness shield . So the answer to your question is they will be harder to take down but they won't be invincible , no one is.",
            "I don't believe all Taken are invincible but whoever serves as The Dark Presence's host is (Barbara Jagger, Scratch, ect), only being able to be stunned by light and fully killed by some sort of magical light (the clicker, a magical projector, the bullet of light)",
            "Don't forget Control where was Hartman immune to physical form of hit (when his \"Darkness\" shield protect him)",
            "I think it would depend on a narrative convention - and it *is* a convention.\n\nMaybe they will be invincible until our hero (Whoever that may be) finds a way to hurt them. Maybe they would have another obvious weakness. Maybe they wouldn't and it's more about stealth or running around like in Slenderman now.",
            "Its because each shot fired from your gun produces a quick flash of light, so they still take a little damage because of that    /s im just joking and dont think thats true at all",
