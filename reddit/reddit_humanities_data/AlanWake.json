            "I remember getting down voted into oblivion on here for saying of course there will be a physical edition sooner or later, now it's 'amazing news' lol...",
            "Very disappointed that there's no CE for the PC. Is there a reason for that?"

            "AND MY MOTORCYCLE IS ALSO A WEREWOLF",
            "The whole DLC really is a gigantic love letter to the fans. Poking fun at the crazy and yet also thanking us for being loyal. \n\nRemedy have always been a favourite of mine, but they really have spent the last several years going above and beyond as a company, and I'm absolutely honoured that we have communities like this where we can enjoy all the fun.",
            "Just finished! My thoughts:\n\n**Number One Fan**\n\nReally funny! Gameplay wasn't anything special (just fighting hordes of enemies) but the writing was good enough to keep it engaging. Loved Scratch's character. Probably the lightest episode of the three.\n\n**North Star**\n\nLoved this one! Great vibe, perfect mix of funny and creepy. Loved the parallels with Control.  Some fun (if easy) puzzles. \n\n**Time Breaker**\n\nDefinitely my favorite. Reality shifting in the Dark Place was my favorite part of the base game so I loved the use of that  here. Sam Lake's character was really funny and I loved the lore about Mr. Door. Appreciated how it was the most overtly story-focused of the three episodes. Only real complaint is that I wish the concept was expanded more. The handful of worlds we saw were super cool, but I would've loved to see more. \n\n\n---\n\nOverall, really liked it! Pretty short experience (took me about 3 hours) but I didn't think the length negatively impacted it too much (except maybe the last episode). Also really great soundtrack, noticed some bangers while playing.",

            "Episode 1: Super fun. It felt like a fever dream. ''My motorcylce is also a werewolf'' might be the dumbest and best line in the game\n\nEpisode 2: I was hyped about it because of jesse but beside the ending twist with Alan, it was kind of boring\n\nEpisode 3: By the far, the best. I did not understand everything but it was just bonkers. Retro-Arcarde style and then a text adventure, Multiverse jumping, and so on. Then you play as the actor and not the character, kind of. And at least Sam Lake is honest and calls himself ''crazy'', in the beginning of episode 3 lol",
            "I just finished Time Breaker and I cannot believe what I just played. Absolutely insane stuff.",
            "I really enjoyed the dlc! I thought Number One Fan was probably the most fun out of the bunch, Northstar was kinda weak but still enjoyable and left me wanting to see more of whatever that ending was, Time Breaker was probably the best story wise. Gave some insight on Door\u2019s backstory and hopping from one reality to the next was great! The only thing I really wish we had gotten was an unlock for Alan\u2019s old outfit. Seeing him wear it in two out of the three episodes was awesome!",
            "The Time Breaker was probably my favorite because it feels like the one that has actual lore implications going forward for the RCU. \n\nFor one, it\u2019s basically confirmed (as much as they legally can) that Tim and Jesse are variants of Jack and Beth.\n\nIt also implies another popular theory may be correct, that Thomas Zane is a variant of Alan. \n\nThe origin given for Mr. Door in the comic book matches exactly what Martin Hatch describes happening to him in Quantum Break \n\nThe ending monologue from Casey I\u2019m fairly certain is the monologue Alan was reciting on the radio that Darling hears in the Final Draft",
            "So many great lines in these. \n\n*\"LIFE IS NOT UNLIKE A HIGHWAY\"*\n\n*\"MY BROTHER IS A WEREWOLF IN CASE THAT WASN'T CLEAR!\"*\n\n*\"MY MOTORCYCLE IS ALSO A WEREWOLF!\"*\n\n*\"A NEW BLEND IS UPON US!\"*\n\n*\"YOU ARE NOT COFFEE. PERCOLATE. BREW. YOU ARE COFFEE.\"*\n\nEpisode 3 was just rad. That Night Springs disco song is a stone jam. I wish this was longer. I want to live in Remedy Games.",
            "I think that final audio clip after the credits of James McCaffrey talking about the murder cult kinda confirms that they decided to not go ahead with the Casey episode (and presumably the Estevez one too) due to his passing. I wonder what ideas they would've had for that\n\nAs for what we actually got:\n\n1) Rose's episode may have been the dumbest thing Remedy has ever done, and it was a lot of fun. I was surprised about how good the music was throughout, and just how wild they got with it. \"My motorcycle is ALSO a werewolf\" is top tier writing, I won't accept any counterarguments\n\nAlso it was just fun blasting Taken (sorry, Haters) without worrying about the flashlight or ammo for once\n\n2) Jesse's episode was... fine? It felt a little undercooked to be honest.\n\nWhat's up with the locked chests throughout? Where do you have to find the codes for those?\n\nThis one is honestly carried by its implications. With the dialogue resembling the opening bits and various other scenes of Control so closely, it kinda implies to me that this is essentially Alan writing an earlier draft of the \"Jesse finds the FBC\" story. But the FBC isn't defined yet, it's just a generic government agency. The Hiss isn't defined yet, it's just \"uhm, coffee seeps in your brain!\". \n\nAnd I guess this version failed because Alan being Jesse's brother is too convenient, so a proper sibling character, Dylan was introduced for Control. And Dylan is implied to be another version of Jesse/Beth/Lisa/etc in the next episode???\n\n3) Shawn's(?) episode is probably my favorite of the bunch, and makes my head run wild with theorizing immediately \ud83d\ude05\n\nSo Door/Hatch's backstory is seemingly kept the same as in Quantum Break, which is nice to see, and Sankarin Tango *was* related to QB as well :P\n\nI wonder though, with Alan being one of two Masters of Many Worlds... is the implication that he's a Creator figure in the multiverse (and all the versions of Jack/Beth that exist out there are essentially different drafts that were created during his time in the Dark Place?), whereas Door is a different type of divine figure, one who cam travel across, and possibly govern the multiverse but is not its creator? Something like that?\n\nAlso, what's up with \"Tim\" being stuck in a spiral, and having to fight shadowy copies of himself? Did Alan end up reusing these concepts for the drafts we see in AW2?\n\nAlso also I guess Zane *is* some sort of multiversal form of Alan based on that comic segment?\n\nAaahhhhhh too much stuff, my brain hurts from all this"
