So everything is where it should be, really, and things are mostly trucking along. \n\nI keep a close eye on my budget via Monarch and have historically always had a surplus, but these days things are uncomfortably tighter. I\u2019m overspending because I get boba at a whim, I get a snack at the gym last minute, decide to get a Barry\u2019s smoothie because they just opened their bar again, go get my nails done so I can look cute for a work trip, whatever. \n\nI guess what bothers me is the mental fortitude I used to have is not there anymore.

            "The reality is you can afford nice things, but you cannot afford everything to be nice.\n\nTo combat lifestyle creep, you need to be mindful about your spending and invest your dollars in the things that genuinely make you happy. Lifestyle creep is when you arbitrarily level up every aspect of your life as your income increases. Again, you can afford nice things, but you cannot afford everything to be nice. If you're spending more on clothes, housing, cars, dining, fitness, hobbies, etc., it adds up fast.\n\nFigure out what categories of spending actually make you happy and be frugal elsewhere. For example, my boyfriend and I share a 2020 Honda Civic, but I have no issues shelling out for expensive fitness classes. I know a nicer car won't make me happy (but it would make someone else happy) whereas the fitness classes genuinely make me happier. Spend a month writing down everything you spend money on, and more importantly, how that spending made you feel. Get your nails done so you could look cute for a work trip then feel meh about it? Pass on it next trip. Buy boba on a whim while you're running errands then feel good about it? Consider doing it next time.",
            "I just automate my savings and enjoy whatever is left.\n\n5,750 into my solo 401k every month\nX amount a week into my post tax brokerage\n\nSpend whatever else is left. \n\nI don\u2019t think you need to eat sacks of potatoes or not use the heat. \n\nYou\u2019re more than allowed to enjoy life while building wealth, encouraged even. \n\nJust make sure it makes sense.\n\nDiscipline is key to freedom. Not the other way around.",
            "Lifestyle creep isn't a moralistic issue i.e. bad or good. It's all based on context. And frankly, it's a slightly overloaded term.\n\nProblematic lifestyle creep is when you spend more without intention or real gain, or expect higher QoL when it isn't something you value. I'd argue that the real problem of the bad type of lifestyle creep is when it eats into other parts of your life (i.e. savings, retirement) in such a way that you experience a detriment. \n\nBut most forms of \"lifestyle creep,\" or rather just quality of life improvements, are what we should strive for. We work to build the life we want so we can account for a better quality of life not just for ourselves but those around us. I think finances are too moralized, often to our own detriment, but they are just a tool for how we want to live our lives. \n\nIf you are saving appropriately and staying on top your financial well being, spending more is perfectly fine. In fact, it's encouraged because at the end of the day, it's about drawing a balance between future you and today's you. The \"high earner\" privilege of all this is that for the most part, we can do both - something a lot of people can't effectively do. We can responsibly save (and crank up savings as we make more) all while responsibly spend (and crank up spending as we make more). At some point, $30 more saved won't change your life today or in the future whatsoever. But that $30 on a nice appetizer and drink might just make your day. That's worth it to me. But if that $30 is going to be a sizable portion of your retirement or saving in the future, then maybe that drink or appetizer is entering \"bad\" lifestyle creep levels and you should dial it back before you're too comfortable ordering it every time you go out.",
            "Lifestyle creep is GOOD if you\u2019re meeting your savings goals. \n\nAutomate what you wanna save, then spend the rest guilt free on whatever you want. \n\nThe mentality should be \u201cThis is my money to enjoy. I earned this\u201d",
            "Don't. A bit of lifestyle creep is totally fine. Why are you working harder at a more difficult job over time if your lifestyle isn't also going to get better?",
            "There are no victory points for NOT spending on something that makes you really happy AND you can clearly afford it (after making room for fixed costs and investments/savings).",
            "When I think of lifestyle creep I mostly think of large purchases (housing, cars, vacations). I\u2019ve had the issue where I\u2019ll get a raise and within a few months move into a nicer apartment or house. Few years go by and my mortgage has doubled. \n\nSince recognizing this, I told myself that following any raise (especially large ones like from a promotion or job change) I deliberately refuse any lifestyle change for at least a year. If you allow a year to settle into a new income, you will get used to saving more and will be less likely to make an unnecessary large purchase.",
            "It isn't weak to adjust your mental attitude about these items. You are doing all of the right things. Enjoy your nails, tea, trips, etc. I think it is absurd to think about \"lost gains\" on things like coffee and taking a fun trip. Lifestyle creep is more about spending yourself back into financial poverty. Enjoying life because you are able to is not lifestyle creep or weakness. You could be hit by a bus tomorrow. If life truly flashes before your eyes, I want that second to be filled with so many amazing memories that I never even feel the bus. I don't want that second to be filled with my Schwab account dashboard. Enjoy life within your means. You know what control is. You aren't losing anything.",
            "Put your purchases in terms of how many hours it took to obtain the good/service.  Helps me think if something is worth it or not.   \n\nAssume you make $100 after taxes per hour.\n\n$300 chef's knife took me 3 hours to pay for.  I really enjoy cooking and the knife will likely last decades potentially for my life.  Maybe reasonable?\n\n$10k for a week at a luxury hotel is 100 hours of my life to pay for.  Maybe look for a hotel that's nice but a little cheaper?  Maybe do it if it's your 10th wedding anniversary?",
            "Tbh $1500 a month to brokerage is low for your income and COL.\n\nI grew up very frugal. As I make more money, I learned to splurge on small things that make me happy (boba!) while continuing to be frugal in things that don't matter to me (fancy vacations, expensive clothes, fine dining).\n\nHHI around 350k post tax and saving more than half of it."
