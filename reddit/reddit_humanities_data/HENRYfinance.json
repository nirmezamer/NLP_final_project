I thought about setting up a Roth IRA, I thought about robinhood to buy companies with high dividend yield, and I also thought about blowing it on watches. Thanks in advance!",

            "When I think of lifestyle creep I mostly think of large purchases (housing, cars, vacations). Ive had the issue where Ill get a raise and within a few months move into a nicer apartment or house. Few years go by and my mortgage has doubled. \n\nSince recognizing this, I told myself that following any raise (especially large ones like from a promotion or job change) I deliberately refuse any lifestyle change for at least a year. If you allow a year to settle into a new income, you will get used to saving more and will be less likely to make an unnecessary large purchase.",

Enjoy your nails, tea, trips, etc. I think it is absurd to think about \"lost gains\" on things like coffee and taking a fun trip. Lifestyle creep is more about spending yourself back into financial poverty. Enjoying life because you are able to is not lifestyle creep or weakness. You could be hit by a bus tomorrow. If life truly flashes before your eyes, I want that second to be filled with so many amazing memories that I never even feel the bus. I don't want that second to be filled with my Schwab account dashboard. Enjoy life within your means. You know what control is. You aren't losing anything.",

Even the quality at the end was bad for what we paid.\n\nI've been beating myself about it. It was a one time expense and I spent maybe ~1% of our net worth so I know it shouldn't matter. But still feels bad to have made that mistake. I come from a very humble background and not getting value for money always hurts. And my biggest takeaway was to not hire friends, you don't know their professional competence. You need to shop around, look at reviews and be involved with the details if you want things done right and reasonably.\n\nSo was curious to hear stories of bad decisions and what you learned from it. :)",

Use your work for the discount. I am a little skeptical that NYL offered 40% on top of the 60%? Usually there is a target of 65 or 75% of gross earnings that carriers cant go above. They may have miscalculated what is covered by your group insurance (maybe they assumed base salary only?) Best carriers for execs right now are: UNUM, Standard, and Guardian. \n\nTake the employer sponsored program then layer in the fully underwritten contract ( in your example - NYL) for maximum coverage. Strip away layers as your assets grow and reliance on employment cash flow reduce."
