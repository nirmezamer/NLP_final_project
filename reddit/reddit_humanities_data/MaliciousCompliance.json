        "content": "[TLDR AT THE END]\n\nHello, this happened two months ago but I only thought of posting it now. (Warning it\u2019s a little long because I talk too much)\n\nFirst, a little context/backstory:\n\nI, a 19 y.old man, am a severely closeted trans man (ftm). I recently moved to the US from Africa (I will not specify where for safety reasons) to study abroad. \n\nIn reality, I moved in hopes of escaping the anti-lgbt laws and the sad reality of being queer in Africa. I hoped in America I could find a future where I could truly live as myself. Spoiler Alert, I didn\u2019t. \n\nNot only does it seem like America hates trans people as much as Africa, but also, my family here seems to be 10 times more strict, closed minded, and traditional than my family back home. \n\nFor those who don\u2019t know, being an international student is expensive as heck. My family is not poor, but we are not covered in wealth either. So, to be able to live here, I needed to move in with my family in America, at least for the time being.\n\nNow, to the actual story.\n\nA year ago, my cousin graduated from community college and was going to transfer to another University to complete their degree. We are all taking this route because it\u2019s cheaper. Naturally, we all had to attend said graduation. And people from immigrant families can probably relate, but my family insisted on being well dressed (overdressed) for the occasion. \n\nI hate dresses with all my heart. I have hated them for as long as I can remember, even long before I realized I was trans. I hate how I look, I hate how they make me feel, and it feels like im on the verge of a panic attack every time I\u2019m forced to wear one, especially in public.\n\nYou can probably tell where this is going. I was forced to wear one for the graduation. You cannot fight or talk back to your elders in my culture. No matter how old you are. I tried to protest as much as possible, but the decision was final. \n\nI genuinely wanted to *unalive myself* that day. \n\nAnyways, this year was my graduation. And I knew since last year that the same thing will proceed. My family will ask me what I have to wear for my graduation, and even if I had a perfectly nice suit that was appropriate for the occasion, they\u2019ll force me to go dress shopping and wear one to it.\n\nBut this year, I came prepared. \n\nI didn\u2019t mention it earlier, but for over a year and a half now I\u2019ve been on a weight loss and body building journey.\n\nIn fact, the whole incident last year has made me double down and workout even harder. \n\nLosing weight and building muscle has been a way to help me manage my body dsyphoria. Not only do I now look more masculine, but I look pretty cool with muscles too. \n\nLike said earlier, my family is very traditional. So, they live by certain gender expectations. And one thing they absolutely hate is masculine girls and feminine boys.  They hate muscular girls with a burning passion, saying it looks ugly or unatural. \n\nSo this year, when they brought up dress shopping for my graduation, I didn\u2019t even put up a fight. I went along like nothing was wrong.\n\nWhile dress shopping, I purposely picked the most tight fitting dresses, sleeveless ones and even unattractive ones.  \n\nI\u2019ve been able to hide my body progress this whole time by only wearing loose and baggy clothes around the house.\n\nSo, when it came time to try on the dresses, and I came out of the dressing room, the pure look of disgust on their faces is one I cannot describe. I had to try so hard to not burst out laughing in the moment. \n\nWhile I am not the most muscular person out there, I still looked pretty buff in those dresses. Simply put, I looked like a man in those dresses. And they hated that HAHAHAHA.\n\nThe worst part is that they could not even complain about my body, because my weight has always been an \u201cissue\u201d and talking point in my family. So, even though they hated how I looked, at least I lost weight, so they cannot complain.\n\nI was even considering lat spreading as I came out of the dressing room, but that might have pushed it too far.\n\nAnyway, long story short, they hated every single dress and allowed me to wear my suit (which I looked much better in). And now, even though I won, I constantly get comments about working out too much from them.\n\nOn the bright side, since I graduated, I am finally moving out after summer. Hopefully, with more freedom and less fear, things will be different this time :)\n\nTLDR: My traditional family forced me, a (closeted) trans man, to wear a dress for my graduation. But I became really buff over the year to look like a man in a dress. It worked and they hated it. \n\n\n\n",

            "Perfection. I'm sorry your family is like that. My son (16) is ftm trans, and I helped him pick out a nice suit to go to prom. He's still in the early stages of his transition due to his age, so he would have looked fine in a dress. But I loved seeing him so confident and handsome in his suit. There are plenty of areas that are trans-friendly, mostly big metro areas in blue states. Once you have your degree, maybe you can move to one of these places? We live in Portland, Oregon and it's very LGBTQ positive here. Good luck!"

As in, I wear prescription sunscreen to go outside for more than 5 minutes- but I genuinely don't ever sit in the sun. I wear huge sun hats and keep myself covered entirely now. \n\nUnfortunately this story takes place when I was about 12, hadn't yet learnt to care about my own safety, and the one time my parents were a bit lax on holiday. I put regular 50+ sunscreen on in the morning, but I went swimming at the beach then played around for another hour.\n\nBy the next day, the doctor said I had severe burns on my back and shoulders. Trust me, this never, ever happened to me again. I barely get a red nose anymore I'm so careful. Because it was flippin AGONY.\n\nAnyway, the rest of that holiday was pretty rough, but my parents bought me a lot of special clothes to get me through, one of which was a light full body swim costume, a long sleeve t shirt and shorts type, so I wouldn't have to worry about burning anymore. It was light enough it didn't hurt and it meant I didn't have to miss out on the water park. Which was always my favourite.\n\nSome of the water slides had a rule, no t shirts, but I assumed since mine was proper swimwear it would be ok. Most of the time it was, but one particular time the guy had a problem. \n\nGot to the top of the slide and the guy said no, you have to take the top off. No exceptions. Even though the slide was on an inflatable ring. \n\nSo hey, I'm not one to argue. I whipped the top off, to expose my lobster red, severely peeling back to the masses, stuffed the top down my shorts and enjoyed the ride.\n\nI went up a second time, started to take the top off and the lifeguard yelled 'no!'. Guess the rule wasn't so strict after all",

        "content": "I live in a very tenant-friendly area.  We have rent control, and landlords are not allowed to do things like demand security deposits, enter the property without proper written notice, or include no pet clauses in leases, which renew automatically every month after a fixed term ends. \n\nFor the last 11 years, my husband and I have had a great relationship with our landlord, Joe (fake name). We've been very lenient in regards to repairs, and Joe was very forgiving when my husband and I both lost our jobs at the same time in 2016 and fell a few months behind on rent.  We are now ahead on rent, but Joe is still very behind in maintenance and repairs. We have a whole laundry list of issues my landlord is aware of, but hasn't done anything about for years, but we didn't care because he left us alone and has been overall very kind to us.    \n  \nA few years ago our landlord allowed us to start storing stuff in an old, run-down, shed in behind our rented portion of the yard.  We never stored anything valuable out there, because it's falling apart, and squirrels have been using it to cache walnuts from the numerous walnut trees in our yard..  We had an old BBQ, lawnmower, ladders, and outside toys for my kids in there..... until recently.   \n  \nA few months ago, Joe shows up asking about the shed, wanting to know what we had stored out there. I told him \"just some old junk we'll probably throw out soon\".  He told us that the family next door has a mouse problem (we don't), and he wants us to clear out the shed to \"prevent issues\" and because \"I want it to look nice around here\".  I said, ok I'll talk to my husband and we'll get it cleared out whenever we get a chance.   I have an infant at home, so I can't go out back and clean it out myself unless someone else is here to watch the baby.  My husband had scheduled surgery, so he wasn't able to do any heavy lifting until after he recovered.  Admittedly, cleaning out the old shed was not a high priority. \n\nThen, Joe sent me a passive aggressive text.  \"I just wanted to remind you that tomorrow is garbage day (we know, garbage pick-up has always been on Monday), and we need to work together to keep the rental property nice for everyone to enjoy.\"  I replied asking him if he had plans to fix the shed, to remove his scrap pick up truck, or to remove his open compost piles and heaps of mixed concrete and scrap metal he has out by the shed he wants us to clean.   I also explained that my husband just had surgery and that we weren't planning on cleaning the shed that day.  Reddit, he did not like that. \n\nHe showed up unannounced, walked inside and proceeded to yell at us in front of our kids.  He complained about his personal finances and the economy (inflation, property taxes), swore at us about our \"fucking shit\", told us we can't use the shed anymore, and threatened to evict us because \"clearly you don't like living here, and I can get way more for this house than what you're paying now\".  We told him to leave, and that we will not communicate with him anymore unless in writing.  He said \"Fine, we'll do it all by the book from now on!\" and stormed out. The next day he put an eviction notice in our mailbox complaining that we have \"excessive garbage and waste in outbuildings\" that we \"refused to discuss this issue and corrective action with the landlord\" and even adding that he felt it was \"unreasonable\" given the fact that he didn't evict us for late rent back in 2016. The notice gives us 7 days to correct the issues, or else my landlord can file for an eviction hearing. \n\nThe next day, while I cleaned out everything belonging to us, sans the walnuts and squirrel poop, from the shed, my husband got busy contacting local bylaw and the rental housing enforcement agency (traffic cops for landlords). He was given information on how to file against the landlord for refusing to do repairs, illegal entry, loss of an amenity (the shed) and harassment.  After a surprise inspection that happened last week, we were given a report that said Joe was given 90 days to: fix the roof, plumbing, and weeping tile. He must demolish the shed and either erect a new shed or give us a rent reduction, because the shed was an assumed amenity.  According to my neighbors with the mice issue, the provincial government is also involved now because apparently he filled in a pond without a permit, and now the fire department doesn't have a nearby water source in case of a fire (no hydrants out here). The city (bylaw enforcement) threatened to fine him for every day that he leaves his large pile of broken concrete and rebar out back.   \n\n\nThe cherry on top happened yesterday. He sent me a text to tell me that him and the plumber were going to be there \"within the hour\". Normally, I'd be ok with short notice, despite the law saying he must provide 24 hour written notice. Not this time. I told him we need 24 hour notice.  He showed up, knocked on the door, and when I reminded him that I won't speak to him in person anymore, he called the police saying that I was being hostile towards him and he doesn't feel safe coming here.  He sat outside for 4 hours waiting for the police, who later called me instead of showing up.  The officer who called said that Joe was told to stop harassing us, and that he needs to provide 24 hours notice to enter the home. He wanted to make sure Joe left and gave proper notice, and asked me if I wanted an officer there tomorrow to \"keep the peace\".  \n\n\nIf Joe doesn't do the repairs he's supposed to, we plan to take him to court and file for a rent reduction, and for a lien to be put on the property so he can't just sell it.  We're just doing it \"by the book\" from now on, and just \"want it to look nice\".  \n\n\n\n",

He told us without a hint of irony that the only way students would respect us is if we were dressed professionally. Not even business casual was okay for him. Faculty wearing sneakers or blue jeans was a legitimate cause for termination under our contract.\n\nThe male staff dress code demanded that we wear a long sleeve button-up shirt with a tie, dress pants with a belt, and dress shoes or boots every day.\n\nThere was, however, a note in our contract stating that the dress code could be \u201creasonably relaxed\u201d if not possible due to a medical condition. No details were provided beyond that.\n\nWell, my wife and I moved apartments one weekend, and my feet hurt, so I made the executive decision that that was a medical condition and wore my sneakers to school on Monday. I figured I could just lay low and keep my feet hidden from any pesky administrators, and I knew that my students wouldn't care. (My students, and fact, thought it was awesome that part of my appearance was that of a real person lol.)\nWouldn't you know it, that was the day the superintendent and building administrators were coming around room by room to give the school board members a building tour! So of course I had to get up and greet them. Nobody said anything to me, but I did receive a nasty email from the assistant principal (with CC to the principal and superintendent) reminding me of the expectations set forth in the teacher dress code. No note in my file or anything, just a warning. Fair enough, I suppose, but it pissed me off that they didn't even ask why I decided to wear sneakers and just sent me a warning with no chance to defend myself. \n\nSo\u2026 cue the malicious compliance.\n\nIf you noticed from my post title, the dress code just said dress shoes and \u201cboots.\u201d Well, are you familiar with Demonia boots? I went ahead and bought the most over the top, bombastic pair of boots on their website. I'm talking black leather with 3-in platforms, chains, studs, zippers, and straps galore. They came about halfway up my shins, and of course I tucked my pants into them. My students thought they were amazing and there are pictures of my feet all over various social media sites. A few of my co-workers took it upon themselves to give me a stern warning, and some others gave me a high five. \n\nAfter 4 days of wearing these boots with no incident, the principal ended up behind me in the hallway. Rather quickly, he asked, \u201cWhat the hell are those?\u201d So I told him they were \u201cboots to ensure that I am in compliance with the dress code\u201d and kept walking. \n\nThat afternoon, I received an email from him stating that I was intentionally being unprofessional and this would be documented in my record and further dress code offenses could lead to disciplinary action or suspension. I immediately got in touch with my union who quickly dealt with that in my favor, since they were indeed boots. I also explained to the union that I only did this because of the nasty email I received for wearing sneakers with my sore feet. The union rep immediately smirked, told me she was unfamiliar with that rule, and told me to go ahead and wear whatever footwear I wanted and that if anybody had a problem, I could just claim I had sore feet. \n\nLong story short, I ended up wearing my sneakers every single day for the entire rest of the school year and never had another problem.\n\nMy favorite part of this is that I inspired a few other rebels, and by the time I left that school, there were a solid 10 of us that were just routinely wearing sneakers or other non-dress code compliant footwear in blatant disregard of the dress code every single day. Good times! Definitely a legacy that I left behind in that school :) \n\n",
