        "content": "This subreddit is for the cuspers, those born too late to fit in with Gen X but too early to fully identify with Millennials. We share some traits with both generations but the primary idea is that due to our analog childhood and digital young adulthood, we don't truly belong to either of them. While there is some debate on what years are accepted as Xennial, for the purpose of this subreddit, we will use the generally adopted range of birth years between 1977 and 1983.\n\nA few guidelines for the subreddit: Reposts and/or blogspam will be removed at moderator discretion. Please keep conversation civil, no hate speech or unnecessary rudeness.\n\n----\n\nA quick note about the subreddit...Why am I posting this now? Well, because the subreddit now has an active moderator! The subreddit creator and sole mod has been inactive for quite some time and as a longtime subscriber here, I noticed that as the sub has grown, there has been an uptick in blogspam and reposts. I decided to request the sub via /r/redditrequest and that request was granted this morning. I have no intentions of making any major changes here because I really enjoy this community, I just want to help keep it a bit more clean of spammy type posts and hopefully help it grow!\n\nEdit: I've just enabled user flairs! I added Xennial years plus a few others, or you can edit your own.",
