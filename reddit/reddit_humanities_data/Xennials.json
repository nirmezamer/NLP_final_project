        "content": "This subreddit is for the cuspers, those born too late to fit in with Gen X but too early to fully identify with Millennials. We share some traits with both generations but the primary idea is that due to our analog childhood and digital young adulthood, we don't truly belong to either of them. While there is some debate on what years are accepted as Xennial, for the purpose of this subreddit, we will use the generally adopted range of birth years between 1977 and 1983.\n\nA few guidelines for the subreddit: Reposts and/or blogspam will be removed at moderator discretion. Please keep conversation civil, no hate speech or unnecessary rudeness.\n\n----\n\nA quick note about the subreddit...Why am I posting this now? Well, because the subreddit now has an active moderator! The subreddit creator and sole mod has been inactive for quite some time and as a longtime subscriber here, I noticed that as the sub has grown, there has been an uptick in blogspam and reposts. I decided to request the sub via /r/redditrequest and that request was granted this morning. I have no intentions of making any major changes here because I really enjoy this community, I just want to help keep it a bit more clean of spammy type posts and hopefully help it grow!\n\nEdit: I've just enabled user flairs! I added Xennial years plus a few others, or you can edit your own.",

            "I quit smoking cold turkey in 2018. Smoked at least a pack a day starting around '97 when I was 16. It took a few tries to quit.  I never want to smoke cigarettes again.  I hate how they smell now.  I mainly miss the actual physical act of putting a cig in my mouth and the little thump in the back of my throat each inhale.  I noticably feel much better than I did back then, even 6 years later.",

It calmed me down and was the only thing I\u2019ve tried that helped me with my anxiety and ADD, but I have not smoked a cigarette since November 2, 2011.",
            "Yes, but the last couple I tried to smoke left me feeling like an elephant was sitting on my chest for days after. As much as I love that hit of nicotine, it's not worth it.",
            "I\u2019ve tried and honestly it tastes like shit and I feel like shit the next day.  But man I miss having a Bloody Mary at like 1:30 on a Sunday, sunny restaurant porch, and smoking a cig.  Now my taste buds have grown back and it\u2019s just disgusting.",
            "Yes. Closest I get is taking a big inhale on the rare occasion I walk past someone smoking.",
            "I don't want them anymore, but I did smoke age 16 to 36; I've had enough.  \n\nHowever, if I could smoke a cigarette and have it get me as crazy buzzed and euphoric as it did when I first had one at 14, I would."
