            "after the \"yo mama joke\" when one tie fighter crashed into them, and they ALL had no shields while going into battle, and they ALL chain reaction blew up at once. \n\n...Except that 1 bomber and the girl on her backside almost dropped the remote but there's a camera cut and suddenly somehow she was already laying on her chest, without rolling over, and caught the remote.\n\nRian Johnson intentionally designed his movie to troll people and it's kinda sad you could pause at any moment and it'd just feel like it's an impossible to digest contradictory mess...since RJ was trolling and JJ was just incompetent, I'm honestly confused by the people who defend the ST at all, their main defense seems to be attacking other movies like \"other movies you probably like are bad too\", kinda insane",
            "Theyre so damn slow, their supposed firepower equivalent of how many squadrons of Y-wing dont make up for it like at all. It also felt like the only way for them to be effective is if theyre up against a single frigate or if the enemy's cruiser/frigate/whatever have shit defenses and blind gunners."

            "Some stuff is not properly done but it\u2019s enjoyable.",
            "I still have to watch Andor and then Acolyte. Hopefully I like them.",
            "I am enjoying it and contrary to some of the others have particularly enjoyed seeing more exploration of how force users that *aren't* Jedi and Sith have a relationship with the force.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that the pacing is a little rough, and I think they really need to spend some time working on the balance between world-building, plot set up, and pay-off.\n\nIt feels like it was intended to be a bit of a noir style: a mystery, slowly revealed, including flashbacks and the full story delivered out of sequence leading up to a big pay off when all is revealed. But I don't think they have been entirely successful in the slow reveal - rather it feels like five episodes of questions without much in the way of answers.\n\nStill, I think it functions well as more of a mystery story set in the Star Wars universe than perhaps a traditional space fantasy story like the original trilogy and prequels. Similar to how Rogue One was more of a spy thriller than space fantasy, or how Mandalorian started as more of a heist-of-the-week. Some folks enjoy the different approach to story telling in the franchise, others really, really don't.",
            "The Sith Lord is the only best parts for me\n\nAlso the \"THE POWER OF MANNNNY\" one is still screw me up.\n\n5/10 btw.",
            "I don't enjoy the writing at all but I loved the light saber choreography in the latest episode",
            "I was torn on it through the first 4 episodes. Felt a little slow, and there were probably more characters than it needed. But episode 5 was fantastic, I cannot believe they had the balls to fairly graphically kill so many characters (and they're almost certainly actually dead!). Unless they fuck up in the remaining few, I think it's like a 7/10 for me.\n\nThe main character's acting is a little up and down; kinda lacks emotion imo, but that may be a directing thing. \n\nAt any rate, it's certainly better than the Obi-Wan series, and possibly Ahsoka and some of the more recent Mandalorian seasons which I have found very inconsistent in quality.",
            "I feel like the \u201creviews\u201d are 75% bad faith and 25% people with actual criticism that went in with an open mind. So it\u2019s not surprising you\u2019d gel that way",

            "I enjoy some stuff from Legends still to this day. I don't mind that others do too.\nBut I'm so tired of people who still can't get over the fact that new canon is new canon and things are working differently there. Same characters and conceps have different stories and \"properties\". Why do they keep whining every time something is just different from how it was in EU, even when it doesn't affect \"quality\" of the story?\nIt's been 12 years since acquisition of Lucasfilm, how much more time they need to finally understand that these are 2 different canons. Neither is terrible, neither is perfect.",

            "I could never get into the novels. To me Star Wars was so dependent on visuals that a nonvisual medium doesn't carry the impact. I did like the comics.",
            "While I absolutely love a lot of the \"Legends\" content (while also finding stuff like the Suncrusher moronic well beyond the Death Star Destroyer fleet from IX if I'm honest) they were never really *canon*. But, and this is the part I don't understand, *why is that necessarily a bad thing?*\n\nGiven that big chunks of the EU are either self contradictory or actively kinda bad, just explaining the stories as \"stories people have heard in universe\" as opposed to actual events is both fluffy to the idea that information doesn't disperse evenly across the galaxy and leaves room for ideas that don't fit cleanly to be explored.\n\nLook at the Courtship of Princess Leia. Over the course of that book Han Solo *wins Dathomir in a poker game*, semi kidnaps Leia for a romantic getaway there, gets into trouble before Luke comes and saves them riding a rancor with his new unwanted swamp wife. That story line sounds *insane* by itself, but when you add the layer of \"or so I heard\" to it it becomes a fun jaunt.\n\nThe EU was never going to be able to perfectly cleanly port to the Sequels, and cutting it clean before taking inspiration instead of trying to dictate what stories count or not is honestly a move I can understand.",
