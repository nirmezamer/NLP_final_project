            " I've been told that I'm a great listener and that I am nice to talk to by a friend, so I'll give you what I know. \n\nThe thing is, try to be genuinely interested in them. Don't just wait for them to stop talking so you can say what you want to. That's the problem most people have. They have something in mind already and they are just waiting to say it, so they don't listen to what the other person has to say\n\nSo when someone is talking, take an interest. And when you reply, try to reference something they said, would be preferable if it's some detail and not just a general statement. I do this a lot and people love it. People love it when you take interest and when it's clear that you listened to what they said. \n\nDon't be too caught up on what to say next. That's another thing people struggle with. I usually don't have much to say, but listening to the other person without stressing about that  inadvertently helped me continue the conversation anyway.",

            "Interesting. I sort of get this, but mostly with non-workout clothes or places out of that kind of context, although I live in a hot climate now so I think Ive gotten more used to it.\n\nWhen you work out, do you specifically wear workout clothes? Because to me, that matters. Theyre mentally designated as sweaty clothes intended for it. Other than that, I think if you can just try to convince yourself to actively try to sweat, like telling yourself sweating means the workout was successful that might help if you do it enough times. Maybe even try to Pavlov yourself with a small reward, haha.",
            "Hydrate first? Sweating is also healthy for you so I think if you just go into your next workout with the goal to work up a sweat you can do it.",
            "Get clothes that are specifically for working out and sweating only. Keep a hamper specifically for these clothes, and wash them separately from your daily clothes.",

            "Go to a sauna.\n\nOr do swimming as a workout.\n\n.\n\nBut on a deeper issue, this is a psychological thing. So you either just do it and you'll become desensitized to the idea of sweating. Or you talk to a therapist and try to get to the root why you're afraid.",
            "I think you need to be able to answer why you are worried about sweating in the first place. Sweating is a natural human function and reaction to becoming hot. Sweat in and of itself is simply water and some micronutrients. If the issue you have with sweat is the smell or the feeling of being wet and clammy\n\nTo address smell, invest in deodorant and antiperspirants. Dont wear synthetic fibers. Take a shower immediately after working out once you are done for the day.\n\nIf its being clammy and gross feeling, dont wear skin tight athleasure clothing. Wear as loose a set of clothing that you can. Dont work out without air circulating. Keep towels handy. \n\nIf you dont like the feeling of suddenly getting cold because of the need to sweat and air circulating, that is something you will need to acclimate yourself to. Your sweating is a form of protection. Its nothing to be ashamed of when youre doing something thats beneficial (exercise).",
