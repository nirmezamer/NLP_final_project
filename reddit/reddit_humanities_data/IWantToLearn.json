        "content": "I have a disability its not an excuse but I interrupt people without realizing it. I live with a gal and her husband. When he gets mad he yells you guys did this or that and I try to defend the situation. \nThe other issue I cry when I'm confronted. I am being yelled at I'm ruining their marriage. I don't know if I should find another host home. I know before I moved in with them she cheated on him, and a week ago for caught again. I'm not sure their anger is projected onto me. They say their entire world revolves around me. I stay home when they leave for vacations or weekend trips away. I don't understand. ",

            "Go to a sauna.\n\nOr do swimming as a workout.\n\n.\n\nBut on a deeper issue, this is a psychological thing. So you either just do it and you'll become desensitized to the idea of sweating. Or you talk to a therapist and try to get to the root why you're afraid.",
            "Interesting. I sort of get this, but mostly with non-workout clothes or places out of that kind of context, although I live in a hot climate now so I think I\u2019ve gotten more used to it.\n\nWhen you work out, do you specifically wear workout clothes? Because to me, that matters. They\u2019re mentally designated as \u201csweaty clothes\u201d intended for it. Other than that, I think if you can just try to convince yourself to actively try to sweat, like telling yourself sweating means the workout was \u201csuccessful\u201d that might help if you do it enough times. Maybe even try to Pavlov yourself with a small reward, haha.",
            "I think you need to be able to answer why you are worried about sweating in the first place. Sweating is a natural human function and reaction to becoming hot. Sweat in and of itself is simply water and some micronutrients. If the issue you have with sweat is the smell or the feeling of being wet and clammy\u2026\n\nTo address smell, invest in deodorant and antiperspirants. Don\u2019t wear synthetic fibers. Take a shower immediately after working out once you are done for the day.\n\nIf it\u2019s being clammy and gross feeling, don\u2019t wear skin tight athleasure clothing. Wear as loose a set of clothing that you can. Don\u2019t work out without air circulating. Keep towels handy. \n\nIf you don\u2019t like the feeling of suddenly getting cold because of the need to sweat and air circulating, that is something you will need to acclimate yourself to. Your sweating is a form of protection. It\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of when you\u2019re doing something that\u2019s beneficial (exercise).",
            "Hydrate first? Sweating is also healthy for you so I think if you just go into your next workout with the goal to work up a sweat you can do it.",
            "Get clothes that are specifically for working out and sweating only. Keep a hamper specifically for these clothes, and wash them separately from your daily clothes.",
            "Is it the sweat itself you don't like or the lead up to the sweating you don't like? For me, that feeling of overheating just before sweating makes me feel uncomfortable.",
            "i used to struggle with this and sometimes still do. even with pushing myself to do yoga, HIIT, crossfit, and powerlifting\u2014 sweating was NOT my thing and i would do anything to not sweat. ice water, multiple fans on me, cranked AC. then i finally got into heated yoga and bruh\u2026 i can be in down dog and still sweat! it\u2019s desensitized me lmao. mentally, other exercises feel TOTALLY different to me now because i have such a drastic decrease in anxiety, etc., around sweating.",
