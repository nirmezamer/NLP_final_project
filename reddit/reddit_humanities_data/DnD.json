            "Hey, I am looking to run a one shot with middle school aged kids. Are there any suggestions for ones that might be on the easier side for first time players and a first time DM?",
            "New to DnD, had a question from last night\u2019s play.\nA Druid is in wild shape (say as an Ape). Are their attack action choices between 1) multiattack 2) fist and 3) rock? Or is it just multiattack and rock? Thank you!",
            "I already posted this but I think having this as a question here would give some other options: I'm preparing for DMing my campaign which Is part of a bigger adventure that me and my group have been playing for a while and all of the playable characters are going t\u00f2 meet each other for the first time in-game but I don't know how t\u00f2 make this happen, can you suggest me some ways t\u00f2 do It? (they will meet because they all decided to take part in the same mission for one NPC)",
            "\\[5e\\]\n\nHey guys, I'm a first time DM and curious if anyone knows good resources or just how to make a leadership chart for the syndicate which will be a long term part of the campaign. The biggest comparison I can think of is something very similar to the chart for the Cult of Kosomos from Assassins Creed Odyssey; the party will be tracking down members of the syndicate as revenge for the death of their parents and I want to be able to reveal more members as they progress and gather intel on the members. It would be great if it was interactive or editable to some extent but if not that's okay too. I unfortunately have very little coding knowledge so anything that requires coding is off the table. Thank you all for your help :)",
            "[5e]\n\nI'm wondering if anyone has advice for helping a struggling player at our table in a diplomatic fashion. We have a bard in our party who is a first time player and doesn't seem to quite understand the role or abilities of her class. Bardic inspiration is basically never handed out, and in combat she generally chooses to run into the fray with a rapier instead of spell casting (she is not College of Swords.) She hasn't asked for help, so I am hesitant to outright say anything, but it is clear that she struggles with what she's supposed to do on a given turn, and generally doesn't engage in role play either. I'm just wanting everyone at the table to have fun, and am hoping maybe if she understood what was at her disposal, and the role of a bard in the party she might have more of it. I absolutely don't want to come off like I'm trying to tell her how to play her character, though. It feels like an unfortunately fine line to walk.",
            "\\[5e\\]\n\nSo i'm in the process of writing my first campaign, and conflicted if making it a time loop is a good idea. I'm thinking right now to go through the first session like it's a normal campaign and then have the party get wiped at the end of the session, before rereading my first little intro blurb. I'm not entirely worried about if the time loop idea is something that makes sense in DND, more so if it would be a good player experience.",
            "\\[5e\\]\n\nHi, I'm currently homebrewing a world and realized I completely forgot to create a deity of Peace. The gods in my world have their domains, but their general \"alignment\" can vary based on who worships them, similar to how Greek gods had epithets that specified what \"version\" of the deity was being worshiped. I was wondering if anyone had any ideas regarding how I might make the deity of Peace more interesting and multi-faceted? Thank you.",
            "[5] I\u2019m a new dm starting a campaign with 5 players, I\u2019ve only dmed once before for a once shot. My question is what level should I start my characters off at? I was debating 3-5 but I\u2019m just worried as a new dm with so many players I\u2019ll have a difficult time balancing encounters and abilities. Does anyone have advice on what level to start them at?",
            "\\[?\\]\n\ncan a dragonborn be a specific kind like a gold one with the gold dragonborn breath ability, but also have the appearance/skin colour of a different one?",
            "\\[5e\\]  \nI can't find information about this anywhere - I have a Rune Knight with a fire rune. We're about to fight a tough opponent that we would like to capture alive if possible. Can the fire rune be set to non-lethal or be cancelled if enemy is close to dying? I know it's most likely that he'll win the saving throw eventually, but I wouldn't want to kill him accidentally. Is it something that depends on DM?"
