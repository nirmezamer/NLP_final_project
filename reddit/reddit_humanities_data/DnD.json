But, it was the only thing that sounded fun at the time. Started mid campaign.) I am running great weapon fighting and using the polearm master feat with a glaive. I struggled a little bit in the encounters so I was just wondering if anyone could give me some advice on veng paladin? Specifically tactics.",
            "What actually is the disadvantage of playing an Artificer? [5e]\nI will play in a new campaign soon and chose an Artificer (lvl 3 or lvl 5) when I started building it, I noticed how overpowered it actually is, I don\u2019t see anything that is weak. I mean, I use a musket and I can just skip the reload property, my Arcane armor (infiltrator) is just amazing it can literally do anything, replace limbs, give advantage on stealth checks etc. my armor can also just negate the prone condition up to 6 times a day. \nSo is there anything bad with an artificer, or is it just completely overpowered?",
            "Am I using Thaumaturgy wrong/making it too powerful? My DM has kind of let me have a lot of free reign on how I interpreted the use of this spell, but after hearing some other examples/listening to Critical Role, I'm worried that some of my uses of this cantrip were probably too powerful. Here are some examples of things I've done with it:\n\n- Create the illusion of the sound of people laughing 30 feet away\n\n- Create the illusion of the sound of glass breaking near someone\n\n- Creating a thunder-like rumbling around myself to muffle other sounds and make it hard for someone to hear me\n\n- Causing my voice to boom so loud that I was able to cause a stalagtite to break and fall from the roof of a cave and block off an enemy's path\n\nAny feedback on my perceived power level of this spell would be helpful! Are any of these okay uses or am I making this too strong?",

            "TLDR: I'm multiclassing from a level 7 Bard into a warlock, but I'm drawing a bit of a blank on what subclass (and maybe invocations) I should take, does anyone have any fun suggestions?\n\nContext: We are currently in a cursed temple where my character found a cursed item that gave me the character flaw 'I crave power above all else and will do anything to obtain more'. I am playing a changeling College of Creation Bard and thought this was a nice moment to multiclass into warlock (I love warlocks a little too much lol), since my ability scores are high enough to not take the level 8 improvement. I have been running from an army since escaping so I have mostly been trying to stay under the radar, but this character flaw will probably change that up a bit lol.\n\nWould love to hear some ideas!",
            "[5e] Starting a new campaign, and just rolled stats for characters. I thought it would be kinda fun if I went down the line of stats (str, dex, con, -> etc.) and rolled for each of them, instead of picking where to put my stats after I rolled them all. So\u2026 I ended up pretty good with 15/11/13/14/14/7. What would be a good class/subclass to go with? My idea rn is Eldritch Knight fighter, and going 16s in str and int, but I feel like there are probably better/more interesting options, maybe through multi-classing or something (I\u2019m up for anything honestly.) I\u2019m still fairly new to the game, so I was wondering if anyone had any ideas?"

It brings them to the attention of the (usually) broke upper classes and rich merchant guilds and others looking for money.\n\nYes, there should be the threat of being robbed, how they guard it will cause them to see the wider world as a place to be interacted with as well, and yes it could even happen if they make it so easy, but just having it happen to remove the gold (the reward they earned) from the game because the DM is scared of handling it is wrong.

Wouldn't it be cool to be welcomed as heroes everywhere you go because your reputation preceeds you? To get rich people fighting to get your services because you're so good at what you do? Bonus points of you use this strategy to \"steal\" other people's achievements.\n\n- hire teachers to teach them stuff during downtime. New proficiencies, cool feats such as the ones to cook or heal people better with bandages, etc.\n\n- if it's  a naval campaign, a good amount of gold/treasure, etc. should regularly be offered as tribute to Umberlee. Or else...\n\n - make sure useful consumables are expensive and in limited supplies.

            "Do NOT listen to the comments telling you to just take it away unless you have a VERY good reason to do so.\n\nWhat I'd recommend is strongly suggesting that the party uses it to aquire a base of operations to stash their loot and maybe even make it where they need to start regularly paying for staff(maybe even explain how dangerous it is to carry that amount of gold with them). That way, they'll only be able to carry a certain amount of gold on them at a time without the possibility of losing it, and if they refuse your suggestions THEN have something like a dragon that's way too powerful for their current level steal it, because that way you can turn it into an interesting story thread with the promise that they can get it back at a later point when they're strong enough."

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1dlj9t4/am_i_being_a_lame_dm_with_my_eldritch_invocation/",
        "content": "I'm a fairly new DM. I ran a \\~15 session from last October. I'm gearing up for 2 and 3. I have a player who wants to play a Warlock with a Genie patron (Tasha's Cauldron). We're starting level 3. He'd like to take the Eldritch Invocations \"Repelling Blast\" (Player's Handbook) and \"Grasp of Hadar\" (Xanathar's Guide to Everything), which allows him to push 10ft away in a straight line and pull 10ft in a straight line respectively.\n\nHe reasons that given his Genie patron, specifically Dao, he has \"Spike Growth\" so for a 20 sq ft area any creature moves through as difficult terrain and takes 2d4 damage per 5 feet. He claims he can cast Spike Growth and, on one Eldritch blast, he can use both \"Repelling Blast\" and \"Grasp of Hadar\" to move the enemy away 10 ft and then back 10 ft for a total of 20 ft. This means his eldritch blast (at level 3) does 1d10+8d4 damage.\n\nI ruled he cannot use both \"Repelling Blast\" and \"Grasp of Hadar\" on the same Eldritch blast. If he did, it would simply cancel out for 0 ft of movement. I'm imagining Eldritch Invocation is \"invoked\" at the time of casting Eldritch Blast, and the effects happen when the spell hits its target. To allow him to push and pull implies he hits and Eldritch Blast and that grants him the ability to shake around his target like a rag doll after the fact.\n\nTo back up my ruling, I put it this way. At level 5, he gets two eldritch blasts. So, mutliply all of that by two. The maximum potential damage at level 3 is 10 + (8 \\* 4) = 42. At level 5, it's 84. A Frost Giant is 138 health. This means, at level 5, his character could 2 shot a frost giant.\n\nAll in all, my philosophy is if my players put together a broken party, I can break the things I throw at them. I'm more concerned about party balance here, especially since he's pretty veteran and some of our party is fairly new. If I break enemies for his weird eldritch invocation and spike gimmick, it sucks for everyone else. If I do nothing about it, he clears enemies before the others have a chance to do anything interesting or fun. It's a lose-lose. I chalk this up to a weird interaction when combining core content (Player's Handbook) with extra content (Tasha's, Xanadar's). All that feelings stuff away, I think I came up with a sound ruling based on the materials I have - repel and push would happen immediately, cancelling out.\n\nSo there's the details I guess. I'll pose the question again. Am I just lame?",

            "So I will say first I love that you understand the role of a DM so well even as a fairly new DM, you are right that party balance is first and foremost.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the ruling I like the way you have it as you have the justified reason for making the change, yes technically they would be able to do this but just as true is your ability to say screw the rules I am the DM (literally in the DMs role it says you can ignore any rule).\n\nI will say if you did let this happen it isn't a strict multiply by 2 because grasp is always once per turn.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI say keep the rule, tell them that it is just a niche overpowered scenario and tell them the base idea will still work at level 5 as the first shot pushes(or pulls) and the second shot does the opposite",
            "If you want to rule this like that then that\u2019s alright. RAW/RAI it\u2019s allowed but it\u2019s up to you. I would caution against using white room max rolls in order to calculate this because he can do 84 damage if he rolls perfectly after using 1 round of set up and one of his 2 spell slots. For Reference if a fighter rolled perfectly (without crits) they could deal 69 damage at this level. So that\u2019s 84 damage over 2 turns compared to 138. \n\nNeither of these numbers are what\u2019s actually going to happen in your game however. Which is why I don\u2019t think you should be evaluating just based on this math. Also him \u201ctwo turning\u201d a Frost giant wouldn\u2019t actually two turn the frost giant because he had to use one turn of set up. It would be 1 set up + 2 turns of perfect rolls.",
            "It\u2019s allowed RAW, though I get why you wouldn\u2019t allow it. But my philosophy has always been that if my player wants to spend two turns setting up a combo that MIGHT work, I\u2019m not going to tell them no.",
            "Per Xanathar's Guide to Everything, page 77:\n\n> If two or more things happen at the same time on a character or monster's turn, the person at the game table - whether player or DM - who controls that creature decides the order in which those things happen.\n\nSo, per that rule, this should be allowed to happen. However, it is stated to be an optional rule, so you are free to ignore it.\n\nThat said, once the player gets to level 5, one casting of Eldritch Blast produces multiple separate beams with separate attack rolls; one can hit and push, and then the second can hit and pull back, assuming they both hit.\n\nSome other points: First, it's definitely fully within the rules to apply one of those effects, leading to a 1d10+4d4 legitimate combo. Second, this whole thing takes two full turns to execute... One to cast spike growth, and the second to cast eldritch blast. This means the enemy has the opportunity to try to break the warlock's concentration on their turn, or simply leave the AOE of the spikes.\n\nOf course, it's possible that they might multiclass into sorcerer for Quickened Spell metamagic to do it in one turn, but at that point they've built their character to do one cool thing, why deny that? It still relies on actually hitting the target and costs sorcery points, which will be limited if they're multiclassing.\n\nOverall, I think you're overestimating the power of his combo, and should just let him have his fun once he hits level 5. After all, the vast majority of the time, he'll either miss one of the beams, or the enemy will leave the spikes before he can blast them, or he'll lose concentration from something, or he'll roll a middling or poor damage roll, or...\n\nIf you're really concerned about countering him, just put in some enemies who can Counterspell him, or Dispel Magic on the spike growth, or who are able to just fly away from the spikes on their turn... They won't take damage if they just fly straight up.",
            "I feel like you're vastly overestimating how broken the combo is. Having played it, it's not that powerful. Remember that you need a whole turn to drop the spike growth, after which the enemies can pretty easily just move outside, and spike growth is concentration so you're giving up on having another concentration spell up.\n\nI see your frost giant thing, but a level 5 fighter can also drop 80 damage in the first turn of combat with sharpshooter and action surge. Spike growth is really good, but if the rest of the party has coherent builds it shouldn't be that much of a balance issue.",
            "Eh.. it's not that strong and costs a lot.\n\nI don't think it cancels out; I'd say the enemy ends up in the same spot.  The Invocations say you can choose when to push and when to pull, so I'd rule at level 5 he could push an enemy 10ft through the spike growth and then if he hit again with the second beam he could pull it back through the same spike growth for another 10ft. \n\nI would be fine with this.  It requires a previous turn to cast Spike Growth (unless you somehow have Quickened Spell) and also costs two of the 3 Invocations you have at level 5.  If you're willing to invest that much, sure, I'd give it to you because you're sacrificing elsewhere for a very niche power spike.  The enemy you're doing this to could just run up to you or run away from the spike growth to deny you a direct line to knock it back again, plus Spike Growth also affects your party.  All for an extra 10ish damage per EB?  I mean, it's good, but I don't think it's broken any more than stacking EB, Agonizing Blast, Hex, Lifedrinker, and Hex blade's Curse.",
            "Raw they can do it\n\nThey also need to cast a spell as an action and not have their concentration broken and then hit all their attacks. I think it\u2019s a fine combo.\n\n\u201cBut they can theoretically two shot an ice giant\u201d\n\nOk, on the round the warlock casts the spell the ice giant throws two rocks at him cuz he doesn\u2019t wanna walk through the spikes. The warlock with only light armor prof is probably hit by both and must make two dc14 con saves if he\u2019s still up. \n\nGenerally monsters with like 6-8+ int should focus anyone that casts a concentration spell because they\u2019re fucking powerful and dangerous.",
            "RAW, I'm pretty sure they can push and pull on the same blast\n\nBut it requires setup, and field manipulation, multiple turns, can miss, and a spell slot on a spell to get it working with spiked growth\n\nI'd let them do it",
            "Honestly, it's not game-breaking. Spike growth is great until the rest of the party, especially martials, gets annoyed because it's in the way.",
            "I also agree with your ruling. This is a strong enough combination of abilities already, without being able to do both push and pull in sequence."
