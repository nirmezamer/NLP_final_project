This will apply to the Episode Echoes content next Tuesday, which should be spoiled until the following week, along with the raid content.\n\nLoot content is considered a spoiler as well, but we will be more loose about that, so instead keep **loot posts spoiled for 48 hours from their release**, including raid loot, Episode Echoes, etc. \n\nWe've also added several new moderators to help us out during this busy time, so welcome u/switchmod, u/dfreeezzz, u/Mastershroom, and u/iblaise, u/Tapelessbus2122! \n\n We'll be posting a Spoiler discussion thread shortly after launch to keep basic questions and discussions focused to one thread. We hope you all enjoy The Final Shape!",

            "Out of curiosity, is it possible to make sure titles are spoiler free too? In the past, both in this sub and others, I've seen people tag their post as a spoiler, but title the post in a way that spoils information anyway.  \n\nDon't know if this is possible or even if you care that it needs it, just wanted to bring it up to see where you stand on it. Thanks!",

It\u2019s just a way for bungie to fill the bright engram loot pool so you rarely get anything you want.\n\nAnd I still think this one looks like junk.
