This will apply to the Episode Echoes content next Tuesday, which should be spoiled until the following week, along with the raid content.\n\nLoot content is considered a spoiler as well, but we will be more loose about that, so instead keep **loot posts spoiled for 48 hours from their release**, including raid loot, Episode Echoes, etc. \n\nWe've also added several new moderators to help us out during this busy time, so welcome u/switchmod, u/dfreeezzz, u/Mastershroom, and u/iblaise, u/Tapelessbus2122! \n\n We'll be posting a Spoiler discussion thread shortly after launch to keep basic questions and discussions focused to one thread. We hope you all enjoy The Final Shape!",

In the past, both in this sub and others, I've seen people tag their post as a spoiler, but title the post in a way that spoils information anyway.  \n\nDon't know if this is possible or even if you care that it needs it, just wanted to bring it up to see where you stand on it.

I see it is now $60 for the 2024.\n\nI want to do almost exclusively PVE. Do I just follow the guide and buy The Final Shape since it's the current expansion as my way to get into Destiny and just get additional stuff from there? The 30th anniversary is on sale for a few bucks.\n\nEdit:, I could switch to Steam and get the legacy collection 2024 there.\n\nI think that the Legacy 2024 vs Prior Legacy has 30th anniversary, Foresaken, and Lightfall added to it.",

            "I think it might just be that a Lucent Hive siding with us is more impactful to most players than gaining a random ally protecting a bunch of people that more or less left the rest of us to our fate to live in VR Chat. \n\nIn all honesty I don't think a lot of people really care much about Neomuna or its cyborg protectors. We kind of just showed up there, they were vaguely racist toward us, then we ended up with a common goal and most of everything we know about Nimbus is that they're fairly agreeable and largely incompetent. You know, given that bungie set them up as a quest giver even though half the jobs they have us doing are ostensibly what they exist for. \n\nConversely guardians, and players, have had a long and confusing relationship with the hive and especially the Lucent Hive specifically since we share a kind of kinship with them that basically nothing else in the universe can really understand. It probably stirred up a lot of emotions for people to have a lucent wizard basically tell us that at least some of the Brood has our backs. I'm still waiting for a Hive Knight buddy to play ultimate frisbee for our side.",

            "I think the easiest and most obvious reason is the Hive have been our enemies for 10 years. Having one be friendly and aid us is wildly new and opens up a lot of potential doors.\n\nNimbus was introduced, we'd never seen or heard of people being there before, let alone silver surfers, and then one of the two of them almost immediately dies. It's not exciting or novel that Nimbus doesn't try and kill us, that's kind of what I'd expect from two new species meeting, and it turns out they're just a genetically and mechanically modified human, so yeah I really hope their first reaction isn't to kill us.",
            "Nimbus is gonna die in like what, 10 years or something? Hive are functionally immortal and, ya know, one of the most devastating enemies we possibly have that have caused the death of tens of trillions of lives across billions of years, so to gain our first real ally out this faction is absolutely massive.",
            "Nimbus has bad dialogue and an awful voice filter, Luzaku does not.\n\nNimbus sits around doing nothing, making us do their job, while Luzaku fights alongside us every time she shows up.\n\nNimbus popped up out of nowhere with no affiliation to any prior lore (connection between Neomuna and Lakshmi/Sundaresh aside), and Luzaku is both the first fully allied Hive character, and has existed as a character since Witch Queen.\n\nLuzaku is basically the Hive's Mithrax, and most people at least like old crawdaddy. Nimbus is just sorta... there. And painful to listen to. And ultimately useless."
