            "As someone who's enjoyed watching the show despite recognizing that it had a ton of flaws, I was kinda worried when I read the comments here saying the Mauler's video was a misfire. \n\nI agree with pretty much every point he makes in the video. \n\nIt feels like a lot of people who enjoyed the show are having difficulty accepting that the despite being fun, the writing is pretty awful when it comes to any level of logical consistency. And so much of the plot depends on characters being incredibly dumb.",
            "the yao guai was 10/10",
            "Was such a cathartic video.",
            "This show definitely thrives on the \"rule of cool\" and nostalgia toward the games. Everything that happens is a pretense to put explosions, gore, or easter eggs on the screen.  Why did Muldaver send in a bunch of raiders to get high on chems and murder anyone they saw when she had a very specific objective that involved kidnapping a man (who could have easily died in the raid)? Because they wanted Mad Max extras to shoot people with guns. Why did the fusion reactor light up most of LA despite it being nuked like 50 times and left to crumble for centuries? Because it would look cool. Why did Muldaver keep Lucy's mom even though she was mostly decomposed and beyond all redemption? Because zombies look cool.\n\n  \n\nUnfortunately, that's enough to seduce a huge audience. It's all incredibly stupid, and it didn't need to be.",
            "The response to the Fallout show has convinced me that if Master Chief just kept his helmet on and said a line from the games every other scene half of the Halo show's dissenters would call it a masterpiece of television.",
            "Great video.",
            "The Fallout Fandom owes Longman its eternal gratitude.",
            "Amazing video; for a west coast fallout fan it was an incredible experience to watch Mauler talk about all the lore issues and the way bethesda handle the franchise after we got harassed and gaslighted that this is how fallout was always about. Thanks to all the lore guys for helping in making this review.",
            "buddy's gonna watch mister bean next and complain about him being retarded like it's some sort of discovery",
            "I'm enjoying it so far but I haven't played the games so I'll respect you guys if you're not a fan of it, I hated the HBO last of us show because of how inaccurate it was"

I definitely feel for people who do enjoy it though, there\u2019s enough context to know Star Wars has been butchered.\n\nAlso, felt like Rags was jumping on Marc a lot this episode.
