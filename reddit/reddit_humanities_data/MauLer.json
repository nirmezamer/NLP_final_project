            "the yao guai was 10/10",
            "Was such a cathartic video.",
            "The response to the Fallout show has convinced me that if Master Chief just kept his helmet on and said a line from the games every other scene half of the Halo show's dissenters would call it a masterpiece of television.",
            "The Fallout Fandom owes Longman its eternal gratitude.",
            "Amazing video; for a west coast fallout fan it was an incredible experience to watch Mauler talk about all the lore issues and the way bethesda handle the franchise after we got harassed and gaslighted that this is how fallout was always about. Thanks to all the lore guys for helping in making this review.",
            "buddy's gonna watch mister bean next and complain about him being retarded like it's some sort of discovery",
            "I'm enjoying it so far but I haven't played the games so I'll respect you guys if you're not a fan of it, I hated the HBO last of us show because of how inaccurate it was",
            "Great, 40 minutes before I have to run a pathfinder game. Guess this will keep me up late tonight.",
            "I don't understand how this show has actual fanboys, even defending it in this very thread. Like, it doesn't respect itself or the audience. It's basically James Gunn's \"Suicide Squad\", except cringe, boring, cheap, lame and predictable. It's made by Amazon, Todd Howard and the chick who wrote \"Captain Marvel\". What the fuck is wrong with you, people? Do you unironically love Bethesda's Fallout so much that you're willing to like the show because nothing else exists? Or is it the same case as with \"Matrix Resurrections\", where you think that everything wrong with the movie is terrible on purpose and people just don't get its deep meta-irony?",
            "This video was incredible. I stopped watching fallout after 2 episodes. All the positive responses made me feel like I was missing something. I definitely wasn\u2019t."

I definitely feel for people who do enjoy it though, there\u2019s enough context to know Star Wars has been butchered.\n\nAlso, felt like Rags was jumping on Marc a lot this episode. Might have just been misinterpreting banter however.",
            "Hm this all seemed quite lucid.",

            "Quick question, don't want to make a separate post for this. During BBC, MauLer said there was a coordinated attack on his channel for some \"reel\" or \"compilation\" video. Who has the deets on this?"
