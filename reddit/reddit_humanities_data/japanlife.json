At first I thought maybe it was a KFC cookie but I can't recall seeing those in Japan...  And now I'm realizing it's been a few years since I had a warm cookie!",

While I have zero issues with them I do have 2 children running around so I was curious if there was somewhere I could sell it. Thanks",

I pay at conbini so not on my bank account transactions, can't find proof I paid it, can't connect to the kepco, can't contact support since it's weekend. \n\nI received a SMS which I assume is a scam from supposedly \"Tokyo Electricity Power1\" about unpaid bills, but maybe the Kansai And Tokyo EP companies have a connection together and it's legit? I stupidly tried to pay, but website said it failed. Website seemed to be the legit TEPCO site, but payment was in HKD, number who sent the message is +63.\n\nI have no idea how to deal with this situation, has this type of stuff happened to anyone before? Have I indeed been scammed? What am I supposed to do first?",

In a plate, you lay down your green salad, then you add avocado slices, fried onion crusts (you can buy it), and add some olive oil.\n\nThen, you put the zukini/eggplant saut\u00e9 on top, then the chicken/garlic/shiitake/tomatoes, and finish it with some balsamic cream vinegar cream and some chips of parmesan cheese (real one, not powder). You can add walnuts (and a boiled egg) if you like it.\n\nYou are welcome.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kso3md5b9u7d1.jpeg?width=1774&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=69b570510588c05ffe2197b8539016b6ed564aba",

I collected the tsuchikabe and put it in a tub outside to rehydrate and ferment--they skipped the fermentation step when they did it the first time, so the straw wasn't well-integrated.\n\n\nAfter five months of waiting and continuous naysaying/tooth-sucking by the neighbors, the recycled tsuchikabe is a perfect consistency and I can finally put it back up. It's really easy to work with and it's sturdier than expected when dry. Very happy that upstairs is starting to resemble a human habitation again.",

Be warned that I\u2019ve heard some of them can be a bit\u2026 predatory.\n\n- If you\u2019re after something a bit more structured, you may try looking for a local \u5c71\u5cb3\u4f1a. The issue with these is they tend to skew a bit older and the amount of effort people put into them can vary widely.\n\n- My recommendation if you\u2019ve got a bit of spare cash is to try one of the Mont Bell trips. These cost a bit, but you can choose women-only groups if you like and they tend to be on the younger side. You can also \u201cgrade up\u201d to more difficult hikes at your own pace.\u00a0https://event.montbell.jp/sp/plan/?cid=4",

The ER doctors called in a gynecologist who did further tests (ultrasound and echo). She told me my ovary has swelled a bit with a cyst (size is around 6 now) but it looks benign. However I have to get an MRI and surgery is recommended to prevent a twist. \n\nThat\u2019s all they could do in the ER (although the whole thing went pretty fast and effective) so now I need to get a \u7d39\u4ecb\u72b6\u3000from my gynecologist to a big hospital for MRI. I\u2019m planning to be referred to the same hospital that did the ER exams and CT scans since I already have medical records there. \n\nI also have long covid, orthostatic tachycardia, chronic fatigue syndrome due to long covid and two weeks ago I had a vertigo attack. My health situation is out of whack. I have obaachan levels of physical strength. But I\u2019m hanging on and hopeful. \n\nIf anyone had an ovarian cyst removal, I\u2019d like to hear about your experience. Emotional support is welcome. Thanks \ud83d\ude4f ",

            "can't help with any ovarian cyst removal experience of my own but sounds like you are on the way to recovery. Recovery seldom follows the timeline we would like but stamina is something that is built up with small persistent efforts as well as big ones. Once you get a  complete blood workup done there maybe things in it that can guide you in dealing with your other issues regarding nutrition. Non doc advice here is to work on your gut health and then go from there. \n\nStay positive and best wishes sent."
