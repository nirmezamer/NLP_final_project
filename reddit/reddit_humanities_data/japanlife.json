        "content": "As the title says, there is a 16-year old highschool girl that came up to me recently at the bus stop that I always take to work. We don't take the same bus, just the same bus stop. Its been around 3 months that I have been taking that bus stop. Then this girl suddenly came up to me and asked if we could be friends, so I politely asked her how old is she, she said she's 16. So I said its not a good idea as she is under 18. But she has been very persistent these past few days after she told me she likes me and I don't know what to do. I could try taking another route/bus stop to work but its too far away from where I live.\nI'm 27. And no, I am not interested in her. Any advice on how to make her stop? I've tried turning her down multiple times already.\n\nEdit: I'm married and I told her that as well. I'm already taking the first bus to work, if I take the 2nd one, I will be late. I live quite far away from work. But I will take one of the suggestions and get someone involved, maybe I'll try talking to the police on Monday and let them know about the situation before it gets worse. Thank you so much for your replies.",

He would follow me to my bus stop (inaka) ask me a bunch of questions, then leave when my bus arrived. After 4 days I told him to leave me be and I'll call the cops if he doesn't stop harassing me. It worked but I was terrified to walk there. It was the nearest bus stop (25 minute walk) and it rarely came so walking to work became scary for me.",

She would also pull out videotapes and play back meetings if anyone made a promise they didnt keep.",

Glad that's overwith, but I really feel for anyone enduring their own version of it.",
