With more performant LLMs, we saw an opportunity in early 2023 to build an AI system that could create software, with the goal of enabling non-developers to create software from prompts\n\nOur vision is to develop a new paradigm for software development where the end-to-end process of going from an idea to a deployed tool is abstracted away. We've created CodeWords \\[currently in stealth mode\\]\n\nToday on CodeWords, you can generate stateless back-end systems, or what we call \"Codewords\" functions, complemented with a minimal UI. these are tailored for content creation, productivity enhancements, and streamlining internal workflows. And many more to come\u00a0 from a simple backend of instagram post generator to complex apps that can extract molecules from a chemical structure.\n\nThe only limit becomes your imagination. We start with empowering people to build back-end workflows and tools but we aspire eventually to improve our AI system\u2019s capabilities so that anyone can build CRUD apps, mobile apps and beyond\u2026 using English.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you're interested in participating in the beta and I can send over the instructions (only takes two clicks!).",

Build free tools to help you grow \n\nThe next one was me [building a newsletter](https://indieniche.substack.com) because I love talking to people and I wanted to know more founders personally, I run a weekly newsletter where I talk to founders on a daily basis to share, I share a lot of this stories , if you are making more than $10k MRR, I\u2019ll love to feature your product on my over 5k+ entrepreneurial audience for free for serious minded people . It has been really fun \n\nNext up is the design studio, I own one because I wanted to help founders who lack design  help to also help them grow and , we have a couple of clients but this was also a way for me to meet more founders and help them grow the way I have grown, we don\u2019t have a website , most of the work has come from referrals, \n\nI am currently building my fifth product but still based on SEO to help founders find ideas and sell domain name and keywords for those ideas so they just have to focus on building but still with SEO in mind . \n\nThis days my knowledge has enabled me understand how to do marketing , SEO, content strategy, leading a team, doing cold emails , talking to clients , knowing how to write good blog post , [an example I did](https://medium.com/@pitchdeckd/which-three-components-are-characteristic-of-a-pitch-deck-a21b34d64f02) for pitchdeck design ranking in 1-3 for that keyword , has 150 search volume per month and a difficulty of  3 .\n\nThe key things to find ideas is find a keyword with a difficulty of 1-20 , that falls in a keyword volume of 500+ per month .\n\nI shared my whole experience in one , if you are looking to connect with me personally , [let\u2019s connect here](https://indieniche.substack.com)"

I'm building my first SaaS product, Pieces, a tool that integrates data from multiple sources across the web into a single, interactive dashboard without a single line of code or API integrations.\n\nA potential user recently tried to sign up for our trial but got confused by the process and left before fully experiencing the product. Here's what happened:\n\n1. They installed the browser extension first, expecting it to work immediately.\n2. The extension didn't function because they needed to create an account and set up a dashboard first.\n3. They got frustrated and left before completing the setup.\n\nThis was supposed to be our first trial, and while nothing was broken, the experience was confusing enough to drive them away.\n\n# What I Learned:\n\n* **Clear Onboarding is Crucial**: Users need a clear, guided path to get started without confusion.\n* **User Feedback is Gold**: This experience highlighted a significant flaw I hadn't fully appreciated.\n\n# What I've Done:\n\n* I've added a dedicated onboarding step to walk users through the setup process, ensuring they create an account and set up their dashboard before installing the extension.\n\nIf you've faced similar challenges or have insights on improving user experience, please share your stories and tips.
