With more performant LLMs, we saw an opportunity in early 2023 to build an AI system that could create software, with the goal of enabling non-developers to create software from prompts\n\nOur vision is to develop a new paradigm for software development where the end-to-end process of going from an idea to a deployed tool is abstracted away. We've created CodeWords \\[currently in stealth mode\\]\n\nToday on CodeWords, you can generate stateless back-end systems, or what we call \"Codewords\" functions, complemented with a minimal UI. these are tailored for content creation, productivity enhancements, and streamlining internal workflows. And many more to come\u00a0 from a simple backend of instagram post generator to complex apps that can extract molecules from a chemical structure.\n\nThe only limit becomes your imagination.

        "content": "# My first SaaS: A journey to 100 users in one week\n\nIt's been a little over a week since I launched my blogging SaaS, [Blog Recorder](https://blogrecorder.com). As an indie hacker and first-time builder of an AI product, I've been floored by the support I've received. The launch has exceeded my expectations. Here is the story of my first week:\n\n# The launch\n\nLast Wednesday marked the official debut of Blog Recorder. The support started pouring in immediately, and it's been a steady stream ever since. I was even able to sell my first subscription before the official launch to an early tester, which was a huge confidence boost. On launch day, I sold another yearly subscription, and just a couple of days ago, I sold my third annual subscription.\n\n# The numbers\n\nLooking at the Stripe app on my phone, I can see that I've hit **$35 MRR**. \n\nAnd when I check my user count, I'm at **101 users** total. It's pretty exciting to think that I welcomed my 100th user today, and out of those, three are already paying customers.\n\n# User feedback\n\nThe feedback has been incredibly positive. Right before launching, I decided to add a free trial so people can create a few articles with Blog Recorder for free. This move has paid off, with users trying it out and even publishing their articles on their blogs. I can talk all day about how amazing my product is, but user experiences will always be 100x more valuable. It's been amazing to see my tool being used in the wild and knowing that those who've tried it have loved it.\n\nHere are some quotes from users: \n\n>\u201cI've written all my recent articles using this. It's very good.\u201d - Kent C. Dodds on Twitter/X\n\n\n\n>\u201cJust tried u/BlogRecorder from u/EddyVinckk and was really impressed! Just paid the annual subscription so I can start dictating my blog posts \ud83d\udd25\u201d - Scott Spence on Twitter/X\n\n\n\n>\u201c@BlogRecorder actually took me yapping into a mic and made it into a succinct blog. .@EddyVinckk is actually cooking with gasoline. Render Recap incoming!\u201d - Dominick J. Monaco on Twitter/X\n\n# What's new and what's next?\n\nThere's a [roadmap](https://blogrecorder.com/roadmap) for Blog Recorder, and I'm currently developing some AI editing tools to enhance the user experience. I have also just added the option to add code blocks to blog posts through the editor.\n\n# Spreading the word\n\nIn the meantime, I've been promoting Blog Recorder like there's no tomorrow. I've taken to social media, sharing updates on Twitter/X, LinkedIn, and Threads. I've also been reaching out to my email list.\n\nI also joined a platform called WIP, where I can track and share my daily progress. It's not direct marketing, but the support from the community there has been great.\n\n# Launch offer\n\nAs a token of appreciation for the support and to celebrate the launch, I'm offering a discount that is still valid now. This week is the last chance to use the launch discount code `launch25` to get 25% off your first year of Blog Recorder. It's a great opportunity for anyone involved in blogging, whether it's for personal use or for content marketing to boost your product's SEO.\n\n# Try it out\n\nIf you're curious about Blog Recorder, why not give it a try? The first couple of articles are free, so you can test it out and maybe publish one or two articles on your blog at no cost. It's a great way to kickstart your SEO efforts.\n\nIf you're into blogging or looking to get your content ranked on Google, check out Blog Recorder. People are loving it, and I'm confident you will too.\n\nLet's get your blogging journey started with Blog Recorder!\n\nAnd yes, this post was created using Blog Recorder. I recorded for 5 minutes and made a few edits, exported to markdown which Reddit supports, and now I'm publishing this post. Feels great!\n\nYou can try it for free at [https://blogrecorder.com](https://blogrecorder.com).",
