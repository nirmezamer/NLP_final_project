People are also trying to pass off completely irrelevant posts as submission, thinking if they just mask it by putting \"That's not how [insert topic] works\" in the title, it will be valid\u2014 That's not how this subreddit works (no pun intended). You can't force posts to fit if they don't.\n\n#Please read the subreddit description. \n\nIf you have to put \"Not sure if this belongs here\" in the title, it probably doesn't. **Please read the subreddit rules and the subreddit description _first_**, then clarify with the moderators if you are still unsure. \n\nI understand this is a large subreddit, therefore the temptation and karma-count is there to post any and everything, but the subreddit will start cracking down on users who continuously post completely \"off-topic\" content after warnings.\n\nThank you!",

DNA are large polar molecules. This makes it extremely difficult it not impossible to pass through the cell membrane, especially since there aren\u2019t channel proteins designed to carry dna into a cell. In a lab, we get dna into a cell by manipulating the cell membrane to force it in either through electroporation, where we use strong electrical currents to punch holes in the membrane and carry the dna with it into the cell, or through the use of chemicals and heat shock to open the membrane. \n\nThen it would need to somehow get into the nucleus which is even harder than getting into the cells. Nuclear membrane is jealously guarded and angering in or our needs to be properly flagged to be able to even interact with the pump and channel or introns that bring things in and out. DNA has no reason to go in or out of the nucleus so there are no proteins that fulfill this function. Viral dna is coated in ways to the to hitch a ride in, but a random man\u2019s dna? Nah. \n\nThen finally, if the male DNA managed to get into the nucleus somehow, even here it can\u2019t do anything.
