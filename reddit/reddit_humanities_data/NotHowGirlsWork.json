        "content": "**This is not a meme subreddit.**\n\n Lately, almost every other post has been \"Off-Topic or Irrelevant\" relating to the submission guidelines, and not within standard as what actually qualifies (as an example) of \"Not How Girls Work\". \n\nQ: \"**What is \"Not How Girls Work?**\":\n\nA: \"_\"Not How Girls Work\" is when people make sweeping generalisations about \"all women\",  _or_ make any baseless assumptions or conclusions about a specific woman based off of their misguided assumptions of \"all women_\". \n\n**_This does not include low-effort memes, \"Bad Women's Anatomy\", or clips of podcasts/posts from \"Manosphere\" public figures_**.\"\n\n\nThis platform is slowing being derailed into posts consisting of any random meme that remotely mentions a girl or woman, or screenshots of Twitter posts from Red-Pill Manosphere public figures who purposely grift and make money using those talking points. People are also trying to pass off completely irrelevant posts as submission, thinking if they just mask it by putting \"That's not how [insert topic] works\" in the title, it will be valid\u2014 That's not how this subreddit works (no pun intended). You can't force posts to fit if they don't.\n\n#Please read the subreddit description. \n\nIf you have to put \"Not sure if this belongs here\" in the title, it probably doesn't. **Please read the subreddit rules and the subreddit description _first_**, then clarify with the moderators if you are still unsure. \n\nI understand this is a large subreddit, therefore the temptation and karma-count is there to post any and everything, but the subreddit will start cracking down on users who continuously post completely \"off-topic\" content after warnings.\n\nThank you!",

            "I'm genuinely glad to see mods putting their foot down on this. So many subs have devolved into \"just post memes\" even when the sub has a specific topic or scope. First they post related or semi related memes, then they just start posting anything while trying to give it a title that is really stretching to make it seem on topic, and then finally it just becomes another \"just post anything\" subreddit where the only posts the mods remove are the ones asking to stop posting non-stop memes.",
            "thank you so much for this, now if we can just get people to check back to make sure what they want to post wasn't already posted 5 min ago lol.",
            "Question! I know some subs like this allow the equivalent of eye bleach, and I wanted to post a guy who ACTUALLY knew how women worked, so would I be allowed to? (Context: A teenager being quizzed about period stuff and acing it)",
            "Yes, this has been getting _waaay_ out of hand! It's at the point now where it's super transparent that they are doing this to karma-farm.\n\nI'm trying very hard to keep the off-topic posts in the garbage where they belong, it's derailing the subreddit and the space we created.",
            "\"Period stuff\" falls under \"Bad Women's Anatomy\", so it would probably be better suited there :)",

            "As you're all aware, this subreddit has had a major \"troll\" \nproblem which has gotten worse (as of recently). Due to this, we \nhave created new rules, and modified some of the old ones.\n\nWe kindly ask that you please familiarize yourself with the \nrules so that you can avoid breaking them. Breaking mild rules \nwill result in a warning, or a temporary ban. Breaking serious \nrules, or breaking a plethora of mild ones may land you a \npermanent ban (depending on the severity). Also, \ngrifting/lurking has been a major problem; If we suspect you of \nbeing a grifter (determined by vetting said user's activity), we \nmay ban you without warning.\n\nYou may attempt an appeal via ModMail, but please be advised not \nto use rude, harassing, foul, or passive-aggressive language \ntowards the moderators, _or_ complain to moderators about why we \nhave specific rules in the first place\u2014 You will be ignored, and \nyour ban will remain (without even a consideration). \n\nAll rules are made public; \"Lack of knowledge\" or \"ignorance of \nthe rules\" cannot or will not be a viable excuse if you end up \nbanned for breaking them (This applies to the Subreddit rules, \nand Reddit's ToS). **Again: All rules are made public, and \nReddit gives you the option to review the rules once more before \nsubmitting a post, it is your choice if you choose to read them \nor not, but breaking them will not be acceptable.**\n\nWith that being said, If you send a mature, neutral message \nregarding questions about a current ban, or a ban appeal \n(without \"not knowing the rules\" as an excuse), we will \nelaborate about why you were banned, or determine/consider if we \nwill shorten, lift, keep it, _or_ extended it/make it permanent. \nThis all means that appeals are discretionary, and your \nreasoning for wanting an appeal must be practical and valid.\n\nThank you all so much for taking the time to read this message, \nand please enjoy your day!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/NotHowGirlsWork) if you have any questions or concerns.*",
