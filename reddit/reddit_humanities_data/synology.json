This will double my available capacity and also allow for 2 drives of protection.\n\nMy question is probably a simple one for most here but, after years of having this NAS now, this is my first time doing anything with the volume or drives aside from when I first set it up.\n\nWhat are the basic steps to properly do this to save myself unnecessarily building the volume incorrectly or copying data to drives that doesn't need to be copied?\n\nOnce I insert one of these 12TB drives into spot #4 my guess is it's going to have me format the drive. At that point, will it allow me to switch to SHR-2 w/2 drives of protection before expanding the volume?\n\nI guess what I'm trying to avoid here is putting the drive in and having it add it to the SHR volume as a 3rd storage drive and start writing data to it.\n\nIt seems anything with these drives is a rather lengthy process (as evidenced by the 17 or so hours it takes to test one) so I don't want to make a mistake on this step that costs me a week or even a day of building something that I don't need due to one mistaken step taken.\n\nUltimately, I want t swap these 6TB drives out, one at a time letting it build the new drive with each swap and then (once all 4 12TB drives are swapped for the 6TB ones) I'll expand the volume to the full available amount doubling my overall capacity.\n\nThanks for helping a n00b to this process out!",

            "I think adding the 4th drive, using it to switch to SHR-2, then replacing the other drives, finally growing the volume at the end is the best option from simplicity and reliability and with no down time. This is probably 4 rebuilds worth of work. Add disk + 3x replace disk.\n\nThere are faster ways though. You could probably put in the new disk, make a new volume, copy all the data to that. Then remove the 3 disk array entirely, put in 3 new disks, set up a new SHR-1 array, copy the data back, then reformat the 4th disk and add it as a SHR-2 second backup disk. But that's kind of a pain and if that 4th volume you copied to fails you have to start over. This is probably 3 rebuilds worth of work. Copy data + create new vol + add disk."
