            "I can't help you directly, but if you suspect that it's RAM related (hence why you are posting in this thread) I may have some useful information for you.\n\nI bought a 16GB crucial stick listed as compatible with my DS920+ and installed it about 2 months ago. Worked flawlessly.\n\nThen I (stupidly) last week decided to upgrade the DSM version on the NAS to the latest. I believe from 7.1 to 7.2. Notably the screens said 'once updated the NAS cannot be downgraded to a previous firmware version' or similar.\n\nUpdated it to 7.2. Worked great for a few days. Then I had to power cycle the NAS at which point I got the behavior you described-- blinks for a minute and shuts down.\n\nTake out the crucial RAM stick on a hunch and... boom, works perfectly again.\n\nMy suspicion is that they have been allowing non-Synology RAM sticks to work for some time and with the latest DSM they are locking them out. Which is really too bad because I paid $43 for my 16GB crucial stick that worked just fine and... Synology wants $326 for theirs. Ugh.\n\nHopefully I'm wrong, and hopefully there are other sticks that are still working post this latest DSM update. I'm obviously not spending half the cost on a new NAS just for a RAM upgrade.",

Still deciding but probably going for a two bay NAS. Just to have the mirroring in case one drive fails. I still have my backup in the cloud.
