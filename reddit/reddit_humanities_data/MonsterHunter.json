            "Any word/hint on when the results of the voting event for MH themes will be revealed?",
            "**MHW**\n\nThere's a very specific question that's been nagging at me and I can't find the answer anywhere in the various old threads and forums. Is there a real-world equivalent to the top used for the female Thermae layered armor? And if so, what's it called?",
            "hello! I was checking robomeche's mhw database looking at the data for breakable/severable parts, when i noticed an oddity: \n\nbase game deviljho doesnt have any data at all in the wound column, just the tail is listed a severable, while the in game picture shows both the head and the chest as breakable. On savage jho's database page the numbers seem to be listed correctly (altho it also lists the body as a separate breakable part that the in game picture doesnt list).  Does anyone know what's going on here ,and if it's possible to contact the creator of the database to fix this? \n\n\n\nIve also noticed a similar thing going on with base diablos and black diablos' pages (one lists the wings as breakable ,the other doesnt ,the in game picture doesn't show it on either one )",
            "Do you think it'll be possible for Capcom to implement a feature in Wilds to let us import our World's character customization file? Just the looks from character creation, like hair, body, face",
            "I skipped over Rise because I couldnt get use to playing it on the Switch when I tried the demo. After seeing the Wilds showcases, and now that Rise is on PC, Im curious are drop rates for jewels any better? It might be my bad luck, I remember grueling and farming for hours, and breaking parts only to turn up with nothing, or not enough because of how low drop rates were for stuff like that. Im wondering if they improved since, or if its around the same. Its not going to stop me from trying Rise now that its on PC, Im just curious.",
            "How is it that the crafty Monster Hunters still haven't developed a backpack/ carry contraption for large fragile items like large eggs so the Hunters don't have to carry them with both their arms and can move more freely.",
            "Starting Sunbreak after MH Rise Base Game completed when it got released. What exactly got added into the base game and changes in sunbreak and what got nerfed an buffed? is there an overview?",
            "I last played world at launch and feeling a new one - Rise comes to PS+ soon, but Iceborne is only 40 CAD (which is negated by getting Sunbreak eventuallt) - what\u2019s the differences between the two and which one should I go with?",
            "What's the general progression of quests to do after beating the Iceborne Story?\n\nLike do I do event quests, do I just grind grinding lands and stuff like that.\n\nI'm not looking for the weapon progressions cuz that's already a thing on the discord server but the general progression of the game.\n\nThx in advance",
            "I remember at launch Monster Hunter World was difficult to play with friends, you had to play story missions up till the point where you saw the monsters cutscene, then back out of the mission and restart it over(or something like that), did that ever get fixed? Looking to get back into World with a buddy until Wilds comes out but I'm not looking to jump through hoops just to play with him, it'd also be his first MH experience so I don't want to soil it with weird QoL."

            "Great comic! I feel like you start carving and just think, \"why not just take the whole thing?\"",
            "I still find this funny today, my rng luck makes me wonder if I get a tail, I've cut off like 7-8 Barioth tails without getting a tail drop, it was the only part I needed for a weapon. \ud83d\ude02",
            "What the hell, this is NOT yours! \nI made this comic years ago and posted it here, with even the same caption.",

            "It's the Capcom Classic",
            "This is to appease the Capcom E-suite.\n\nThey put a lot of pressure on their teams to do really, really stupid shit. Microtransactions is just one of them.\n\nBut guess what? Look up the founder of Capcom.\n\nTsujimoto Kenzo.\n\nYup. Ryozo is the founder\u2019s son. Also, his big brother is the current CEO. Good luck threatening him, lol.\n\nSo that\u2019s why MonHun has been relatively unmolested. He does good work so they can\u2019t complain about the results, and if they push too hard, the Tsujimoto family will lay down a smackdown on their asses for trying to bully their lad.",
            "Because video game corporations figured out awhile ago that people enjoy cosmetics in video games, and despite all the \u201cit\u2019s just optional/cosmetic\u201d bullshit defenses people tout out, they\u2019ve obviously pivoted from cosmetics being an included feature to a paid feature to exploit their player bases. \n\n\nIf those fuckers could figure out a way to sell you pushing forward on the analog stick to move as a separate feature, they would, and dumbasses would still defend it.",
            "Rise saw a dramatic spike in pushing microtransactions and it makes me nervous for Wilds. World was relatively inconspicuous about it, but Rise just shoved it in your face.",
            "Because of greed",
            "Because Capcom searches for ways to nickel and dime their customers as much as they can, without getting \"huge\" backlash. Many of stuff you would get for free in old gen began costing money in world, then in rise they went even further, halved the armour variants and began selling single armour/weapon cosmetics. And people keep buying it. You can be 100% sure they will come up with some new mtx bullshit in Wilds. I can guarantee that. And when people will begin to rightfully complain about it, the lemmings will come protecting the poor multibillion company because \"we already had mtx in past 2 mainline entries!\"",
            "This is not new, Capcom has always done this but for some reason only DD2 got so much backlash for it",
            "It\u2019s abhorrent. MTX in a full priced game is complete bs. I\u2019m so nervous about wilds\u2026"
