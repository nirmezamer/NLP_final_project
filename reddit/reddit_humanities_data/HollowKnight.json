Since we had a couple different posts about it, we want to time-stamp the latest news and also link to the most recent discussions. We'll replace this post next time there's news.\n\n[We have an update from Team Cherry!!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/1aqy60g/we_have_an_update_from_team_cherry/)\n\n[Welp, there's that at least](https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/1arpxr7/welp_theres_that_at_least/)\n\nAs always, you can find the affiliated Hollow Knight discord at https://discord.gg/hollowknight",

            "In my opinion the communication or lack thereof from TC is killing the hype. At least to me. There is no roadmap, no update, nothing. For all we know the game could be stuck in development hell.",
            "I thought I was lucky when I discovered hollow knight on 2021, thinking I'd get to play Silksong soon",
            "Expecting the same message next Feb 14th\u2026",
            "The amount of dickriding in this community is insane. This amount of radio silence is just bad pr no matter how you look at it. I don't know why team cherry specifically gets a pass.",
            "This is what HK players call news and it\u2019s fucking hilarious",
            "In my opinion, Team Cherry shouldn't have announced Silksong so soon if the development was still in its early stages. This always kills the hype. It reminds me a bit of the whole Eitr situation, a game I was extremely hyped about when it was announced almost 8 years ago, and now it's just a meme.\n\nThat said I will play Silksong 100% when it is released so perhaps it doesn't really matter.",
            "honestly ive kinda forgotten about silksong at this point, like, when i see something like this im like, \u201coh yeah that exists\u201d, but i dont care all that much tbh \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f i mean, i will still be super excited when there\u2019s a release date, but who knows when that\u2019lll happen",
            "The fact that any of you were concerned they just up and quit working on Silksong without any kind of announcement is kinda mind-blowing.",
            "I still remember quite fondly some last year around this time saying June 2023 was a guaranteed release month. And a giant rant about how I was a \u201chater and an idiot\u201d for doubting, because it was shown in the Xbox showcase. As if that was some legally binding contract or acting like Team Cherry was the one who made that presenting on & promise.\n \nAh how time flies!",
            "I am so lucky that I can keep playing SILK SONG when I just finish Hollow Knight\n\n\\---------written by 2020"

            "I finished the game ages ago then replayed it for a bit a few days ago at a friend's house\n\nHow bad of an idea would it be to try and do path of pain. I'm not good at gaming/platforming so like how long did it take everyone to complete it?\n\nLooking at my save I got to 105% with the time being 101 hours"
