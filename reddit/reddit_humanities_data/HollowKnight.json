Since we had a couple different posts about it, we want to time-stamp the latest news and also link to the most recent discussions. We'll replace this post next time there's news.\n\n[We have an update from Team Cherry!!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/1aqy60g/we_have_an_update_from_team_cherry/)\n\n[Welp, there's that at least](https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/1arpxr7/welp_theres_that_at_least/)\n\nAs always, you can find the affiliated Hollow Knight discord at https://discord.gg/hollowknight",

            "In my opinion the communication or lack thereof from TC is killing the hype. At least to me. There is no roadmap, no update, nothing. For all we know the game could be stuck in development hell.",
            "I thought I was lucky when I discovered hollow knight on 2021, thinking I'd get to play Silksong soon",
            "Expecting the same message next Feb 14th\u2026",
            "The amount of dickriding in this community is insane. This amount of radio silence is just bad pr no matter how you look at it. I don't know why team cherry specifically gets a pass.",
            "\u201cNews\u201d",
            "Honestly it's kinda sad that this is being treated as news. They've said they're still working plenty of times, just a few months ago Leth said this. It's not really an update so much as it is a casual reminder.\n\n\nI'm not dissing Leth for communicating of course, I just feel people are exaggerating when they refer to this as \"news\" or an \"update\" or \"confirmation that they're still working.\"\n\n\nIf they really wanted to update us, it'd be nice to like... not let us start counting the years we've passed the delay. At this rate we'll be celebrating the 1 year anniversary of it soon.",
            "In my opinion, Team Cherry shouldn't have announced Silksong so soon if the development was still in its early stages. This always kills the hype. It reminds me a bit of the whole Eitr situation, a game I was extremely hyped about when it was announced almost 8 years ago, and now it's just a meme.\n\nThat said I will play Silksong 100% when it is released so perhaps it doesn't really matter.",
            "This is what HK players call news and it\u2019s fucking hilarious",
            "honestly ive kinda forgotten about silksong at this point, like, when i see something like this im like, \u201coh yeah that exists\u201d, but i dont care all that much tbh \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f i mean, i will still be super excited when there\u2019s a release date, but who knows when that\u2019lll happen",
            "There's also the fact that Team Cherry updated their copyright year a few days ago.  \n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1as7b32/they\\_finally\\_updated\\_the\\_copyright\\_year/"

            "That's really strange.\n\nFor one, the orbs should disappear as soon as you get the final hit. I even checked a recording of one of my Radiant kills, where I have pretty much the same situation, and I would most likely have gotten hit by an orb after the boss died if the orb didn't disappear, but it did disappear instantly upon getting the final hit.\n\nFor two, it's kinda strange if this didn't count as a successful Radiant kill. Maybe it's just different for different bosses, but I know for a fact that at least on Markoth you can die during his death animation and it will still count as a successful Radiant, as that has happened to me."
