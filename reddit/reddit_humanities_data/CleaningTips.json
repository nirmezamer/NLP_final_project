Bought a fly zapper for my patio and it helped a little but we now have maggots in the trash bins. I gave the bins a bath with bleach and let them sit in the sun and I decided to try the Pine Sol trick and wash my patio. As I was washing it maggots started coming out of the cracks in the pavement and from under my house. Why??? How do I get rid of them before I burn the house down??? ",

            "Something is rotting under there and they are eating it had a similar issue with some ground squirrels ( they were precious, mom and 2 babies, and they trusted me) landlord gassed them and they died under the house, for weeks I had flies/maggots inside",
            "You ruined my night by posting this",
            "That's actually horrifying and I hope someone has solid advice soon. That makes me think something is dead under your house ",
            "They only moved the headstones, they didnt move the bodies",
            "I spoke to my partner who knows a lot more about this and its possible that they are coming up because youre making the environment inhospitable. He says 50/50 bleach water or straight up vinegar poured into the cracks. Possibly boiling water will kill them. Make sure theres nothing that they can eat or flies can eat and that will make sure they dont come back. \n\nHe said also pyrethrum insecticide. It uses borax to kill the eggs. So I hope this helps!!",
            "Oh no. Do you have a septic system by chance? The only real way to get rid of most pests is to get rid of whatever they're eating. Flies are tricky because they're opportunistic little jerks that will eat anything they can slurp up with their little sponge mouths. ",
            "Okay so what are you gonna do now OP? Im gonna need to know whats under there .",
            "Ugh very disgusting. Im sorry I have no tips. Id call a pest control expert or something.",
            "This seems like a clear cut case of \"Don't ask questions you don't want to know the answer to\" here OP. I admire your bravery in dealing with this situation head on."

Same type of dryer with the long lint trap and everything. \n\nUse a toothbrush and dish soap to clean it thoroughly. Also, run a cleaner through the washing machine before you use it. If they left the dryer like this, imagine what's hiding in the washer.",

            "Oh I have a LOT of experience with this junk. That is film from cooking grease. It's usually particularly bad if your kitchen doesn't have a stove fan. Use very hot water, dish soap (or something like Dawn Powerwash if it's sold where you live) and a green scrubby pad and go at it.",
            "Its just a mixture of grease from cooking and dust. Use a degreaser (I like the goo gone degreaser, but even dish soap would work), let it soak for a couple of minutes, and use something with a straight edge to scrape it up! I keep some plastic putty knives in the kitchen just for this sort of thing",

Post clean, put down some paper (butcher, brown paper, packing) that you can just throw away when its time to re-clean.",
