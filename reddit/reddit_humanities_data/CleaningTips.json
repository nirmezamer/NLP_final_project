Yours and your sisters health issues are most likely from the terrible conditions you are both living in. And if it isn't the cause, it is at the very least making your health issues much much worse. You also mentioned your sisters incontinence issues and there is a good chance of that being a stress or trauma response. I know this because i had a rough childhood myself and I had the same incontinence issues as a child. I then went on to become a social worker as an adult so I'm not just making this stuff up. You also briefly mentioned your parents in the post I read, and that was enough to see that things are not right and I'm so sorry you and your sister are going through that. They are not fulfilling their role as parents and caregivers and they are putting you and your sister in harms way both physically and emotionally. Please reach out to someone. If you need any more advice about who to reach out to or how to go about it, or anything at all, please send me a message and I will support you in speaking to someone. I know it's difficult, but you and your sister deserve so much better.",

If they can\u2019t come there\u2019s probably a place to send a sample. Even take it to your doctor, and have a mold health screen to be sure you\u2019re not affected. \n\nI know you don\u2019t want to make things worse for your caregivers but it might be the help they need. And hopefully soon you\u2019ll be able to breathe better as well \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd \n\nIf you do want to attempt cleaning it yourself, look into solutions to use. Bleach only works on the surface. Idk if I can give that advice here without being flagged because it\u2019s VERY strong and can be dangerous if inhaled. Always have protective gear and ventilation so you\u2019re not breathing it all in.\n\nBest of luck to you!",

            "Caked on flour is a *nightmare* to get off. Especially if it got wet or burned. Someone already told you that those stoves do thankfully flip up. Be aware of the sights you are about to see if this hasn't been done for a long time, it could get gnarly. You are probably going to be focusing primarily on good ol hot, soapy water. Put it on, let it set for a few, remove with a towel/paper towel/whatever have you that can be gnarly and washed or discarded. I would then try a baking soda/soap combo, mixed into a paste, no water. Or try BKF. Put it on the cooktop part if you think the finish can handle a mild scouring. Bunch up some aluminum foil, use that for your first bout of scrubbing before you even try a brush or sponge or pad. That should get a lot of the chunkier mess off.\n\nDo recommend testing this on a discrete spot if you rent, as I've seen stoves with cheap finishes as well as stoves that were \"refinished\" with spray paint fall apart to even the lightest of scrubbing.\n\nFinish the under of the stove off with more BKF, or if you're feeling froggy, citric acid + water, vinegar + water, or Zep (or other brand) citric acid degreaser for kitchens.\n\nIn the future I would nix the foil covers in general, they don't do a lot to actually help and can sometimes make fires worse.",
            "Pull the coil out of the electric hookup, then remove the drip pan. I would soak both the drip pan and burner coil in some hot soapy water (make sure not to get water on the part that plugs in). Let that sit for a bit while you start on the stove. Zep makes a really great degreaser, but you can also use soapy water and a sponge for this. Once you have most loose debris off the top, lift the stovetop open (kind of like a hood on a car), prop it up, and give it a good cleaning. You may be able to use oven cleaner on that surface too, but I'm not sure so don't take my word for it. It wouldn't hurt to have a scraping tool to help break thru some of the grime after the soap starts breaking it down. You can clean the drip pan as well, but you can also replace the whole set for under $15 if you'd prefer that.",
