            "I don\u2019t think we have the MLE since we\u2019re a second apron team, but isn\u2019t the taxpayer MLE only like $5M? He\u2019s definitely going to get more than that",
            "Duncan Robinson makes 19.4m next year. \n\nSam Hauser will be making 25-30m per season if he\u2019s ever a free agent. Teams like Detroit, desperate for shooting and +50m under the cap, must spend money to reach the salary floor (more punitive than the 2nd apron!).",
            "If we can retain Luke at less than 4M he is better than all the veteran min big men out there"
