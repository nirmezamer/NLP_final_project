            "I actually think this next season he will be in the discussion firmly. \n\nI feel like this season there was a lot of pressure for him to perform well and lead the team to a title and they did that. \n\nNow that the monkey is off his back, his confidence should be sky high, he\u2019ll have shut the vast majority of the noise and criticism down while understanding that he may have underperformed in some areas. That gives him a goal for next year and avoids the \u201changover championship\u201d season some contenders have had. He should be more relaxed and a chill smooth Tatum is the best Tatum.",

But for me, I would rather our C's just continue with the team basketball. \n\nWe have the luxury of having a top heavy roster where any of the top6 can be the player of the game, yet some clamor for individual awards. \n\nAlso, KP was out for 20+ games in the regular season. This team knows how to adjust cos of said team basketball philosophy.",
