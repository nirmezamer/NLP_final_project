        "content": "**Apologies for the late post! I had a baby in late March and have been extremely busy!**\n\nWelcome to the next bi-monthly installment version of the What's that Brush megathread. Here, you will be able to ask any and all questions related to specific brushes, and the community can assist you. This is to prevent users from posting threads with art that is not theirs and asking \"What brush?\" constantly.  \nClip Studio assets has a vast amount of brushes, yes, but the majority of the posts we see asking about \"What brush is this?\" are very generic round brushes; default tools such as the G-Pen or a pencil would often work.\n\n**If you asked in previous megathreads and did not get an answer, feel free to ask again!**\n\nHere is a recap of the rules and additional notes!  \n**1.** Please post a *link* (or links) to the image(s) you're trying to find brushes for, in the comments of these megathreads only.  \n**2.** Please list what brushes you've tried already and why it doesn't feel like it worked, so other users can have an idea of where to start with their suggestions. Users here generally don't seem to mind helping, but it would be nice to know you made effort as to why the default tools aren't what you're looking for.  \n**3.** Any brush-related post made that's not a comment in this thread will be deleted. It's not fair to the actual artists on this subreddit that the posts that get the most upvotes are users reposting other people's art just to ask about the tools, rather than users' own artwork posts.  \n**4.** Users can respond to each query via reply to that comment.  \n**5.** Please make sure the images you're linking are of high enough quality to actually tell the brushes you're trying to point out.\n\n-----\n\nAll past megathreads will be locked, but here is a list of past ones in case you'd like to search through them:  \n[The Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClipStudio/comments/14aencn/whats_that_brush_megathread/)  \n[Jan-Feb 2024](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClipStudio/comments/18warcl/whats_that_brush_megathread_for_january_2024/)  \n[Mar-Apr 2024](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClipStudio/comments/1b3kld9/whats_that_brush_megathread_for_marchapril_2024/)",

            "It's on ACON3D for $65. It's by a creator named Noborius. \n\nI actually bought a couple of the models. The proportions are extremely long and not really adjustable, but the model comes with multiple settings like muscle views, expressions and a few props.\n\nIt wasn't worth 65 to me, it's a matter of taste rather than utility.",
            "As the first commenter said, the proportions are very webtoon-esque. Wait for a sale, as reviews for this model are mixed. Since Acon3D doesn't offer refunds after downloading, buying discounted products is safer."
