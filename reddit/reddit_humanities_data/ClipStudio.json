        "content": "**Apologies for the late post! I had a baby in late March and have been extremely busy!**\n\nWelcome to the next bi-monthly installment version of the What's that Brush megathread. Here, you will be able to ask any and all questions related to specific brushes, and the community can assist you. This is to prevent users from posting threads with art that is not theirs and asking \"What brush?\" constantly.  \nClip Studio assets has a vast amount of brushes, yes, but the majority of the posts we see asking about \"What brush is this?\" are very generic round brushes; default tools such as the G-Pen or a pencil would often work.\n\n**If you asked in previous megathreads and did not get an answer, feel free to ask again!**\n\nHere is a recap of the rules and additional notes!  \n**1.** Please post a *link* (or links) to the image(s) you're trying to find brushes for, in the comments of these megathreads only.  \n**2.** Please list what brushes you've tried already and why it doesn't feel like it worked, so other users can have an idea of where to start with their suggestions. Users here generally don't seem to mind helping, but it would be nice to know you made effort as to why the default tools aren't what you're looking for.  \n**3.** Any brush-related post made that's not a comment in this thread will be deleted. It's not fair to the actual artists on this subreddit that the posts that get the most upvotes are users reposting other people's art just to ask about the tools, rather than users' own artwork posts.  \n**4.** Users can respond to each query via reply to that comment.  \n**5.** Please make sure the images you're linking are of high enough quality to actually tell the brushes you're trying to point out.\n\n-----\n\nAll past megathreads will be locked, but here is a list of past ones in case you'd like to search through them:  \n[The Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClipStudio/comments/14aencn/whats_that_brush_megathread/)  \n[Jan-Feb 2024](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClipStudio/comments/18warcl/whats_that_brush_megathread_for_january_2024/)  \n[Mar-Apr 2024](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClipStudio/comments/1b3kld9/whats_that_brush_megathread_for_marchapril_2024/)",

            "This artist actually shared 2 brush files on their Twitter! \nYou can scroll and post should be near time lapse process of Elora faun from Spyro",
            "It looks like a very basic default brush. Probably one of the low-to-no-pressure default markers, because it doesn't seem to have any line weight variation.",
            "I'm 100% sure that the artist in the example just rotates their canvas while drawing, or drew the line from bottom to top.   \n(Alternatively, invert your pressure curve and tweak the tapper option, though this seems overcomplicated for such simple lineart)",
            "You can use photoshop brushes in CSP, if you can find it. they use the same file type",
            "The brush looks like it's from procreate and one of the hb pencils (I think that's what's it's called)",
            "Oh wow! I didnt know that! Ty!",
            "Ah! Thank you!! I will def try it out! :)",
            "Been a few days, but I finally got a chance to look at these. Pretty good stuff. Thank you!\n\nBut I've never used the 'Materials' feature before.",
            "Thank you, friendo. I'll give these a look when I'm off work.",

Posts of your own art must include a **comment describing CSP process**, brushes used, tips (speedpaint vids okay), etc so everyone can learn CSP. If you used default brushes then specify which ones. Not following will get your post **removed without warning**. Repeated violations will result in **ban**. Some comment description ideas:\n\nHow long did it take?\n\nGeneral CSP process?\n\nWhat did you learn this time in CSP?\n\nAny references/resources you want to share?\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "still dont see any trick being used here since to me it looks pretty standard. can you clarify what you meant by that?",

            "thanks! will try it out on my next piece",
            "oh okay\n\nthe shading in lineart just seem like a rough pass to get the feeling of light direction to me, since if you look closely it doesnt really match up to the final version in a lot of areas\n\nbut lets say they actually did use the same shading from the lineart and apply it to the final colored ver, theres a few ways to do that, tho idk how exactly they do it without a timelapse to look at\n\n1. you can just set it to multiply blending mode and clip it to your flat color group/layer\n\n2. use them as a selection/mask and individually color pick the shadow color for each flat color"

            "It's on ACON3D for $65. It's by a creator named Noborius. \n\nI actually bought a couple of the models. The proportions are extremely long and not really adjustable, but the model comes with multiple settings like muscle views, expressions and a few props.\n\nIt wasn't worth 65 to me, it's a matter of taste rather than utility."
