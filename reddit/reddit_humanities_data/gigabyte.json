        "content": "~~Newest BIOS is lookin stable for AM5 users!~~ Let me know in the support megathread if you have any questions! READ THE EDITS\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: IT HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION FOR SOME USERS\n\nIf you are using AORUS B650i Ultra STAY ON F4 BIOS to prevent AUDIO ISSUES. I have passed up this info to HQ so we will see what they do with it!\n\n\\-----\n\n5/15 Edit: Looks like a wait longer angle. Current BIOS is not limiting according to hwbusters. Will continue to provide updates. Also to note: TESTING A BETA BIOS WILL NOT VOID YOUR WARRANTY. Unless you break your board over your knee (this is an exaggeration please don't do this pins are sharp) using a BETA Bios will NOT void your warranty.\n\nAlso I can't edit the title heh. Hope everyone reads this\n\n\\-----\n\n5/16 Edit: F5d fixes the audio issue for AORUS B650i Ultra. Have 1 report saying it's stable under 1.3v (may or may not update the count for every user I find)\n\n\\-----\n\n5/16 Edit: I'm being told that the most recent BIOS (should be the same beta one with AGESA 1.0.0.6) properly limits the voltage under 1.3v. To test this, using HWInfo, you can check the **CPU VDDCR\\_SOC Voltage (SVI3 TFN)** voltage and if it ever goes above 1.3 send me a link to an image or some video proof so I can send it up the chain and report accordingly!\n\n\\-----\n\n5/17 Edit: Some BIOSes have been pulled and I have already sent like 20 screenshots of users asking where'd they go to my HQ contact so please stay tuned. u/duke605 was kind enough to compile a short list of those affected:\n\nRemoved BIOSes:\n\n* B650 Aorus Pro AX = F5d\n* x670E Aorus Master = F10d\n* [B650E Aorus Master](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12yq4yb/megathread_for_am5_ryzen_7000/jkjkzt3/) = Unknown BIOS version\n* B650M Aorus Pro AX = idk where'd it go\n\nIf there are any updates to this let me know and I'll add them accordingly (hopefully they put them back up or I get a message clarifying why they were pulled)\n\nTo clarify, I have 0 knowledge of when BIOS will be released or when they get pulled I find out the same time y'all do so please bear with me and appreciate the continued support.\n\n\\-----\n\n5/18 Edit: A new non-Beta BIOS has been released for all AM5 mobo models while I was sleeping!\n\nSo if you've seen it awesome time to update! If not then hey here's your announcement. It is still AGESA [1.0.0.6](https://1.0.0.6) and I have no info on whether there will be an update or new BIOS containing AGESA 1.0.0.7a so if you ask me I will respond with a sad face!\n\nSecond Edit of the day: It seems the Video that was sent internally is now public!\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOUAy9n104A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOUAy9n104A) This video shows the voltage stability and what you should be looking for on the motherboard!\n\nHopefully this was able to help and definitely ask me anything if you have any questions! (don't ask for anything from the video idk specs settings any of that)\n\n\\-----\n\n5/22 Edit: Hey y'all. There is a new BETA BIOS for those interested in 1.0.0.7a.\n\nI know a lot of people have been asking about this but do keep in mind this is a BETA BIOS. If you're worried, stay on the standard [1.0.0.6](https://1.0.0.6) version but do remember that if you do download the BETA BIOS your warranty IS NOT VOID.\n\nSo feel free to try out the AGESA version and definitely let me know if you find anything interesting! (Preferably good interesting and not bad interesting)\n\n\\-----\n\n8/8 Edit: Everything is lookin good now so this post will prob be dropped from the stick once I've decided to replace it with another thread! Appreciate everyone of the updates and sticking through this with me.",

            "u/GBT_Calvin one thing that might help future BIOS releases is a KNOWN ISSUES section below the changelog. That way, instead of removing a BIOS because of a known issue, you can let the users decide if they want to skip that or not. I think this would cause less confusion.",
