        "content": "First of all, I'd like to preface this message by saying: Yes, I am aware that there has been a huge drop in the quality of posts these days and on behalf of the mod team (or lack thereof) I apologise for this. We have had issues recently wherein all of the mods' accounts got suspended or banned for unknown reasons. Because of this, there were no moderators to run the subreddit. Only my account didnt get suspended but I was inactive (for personal reasons) and lost most of my permissions. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, after a (very long and gruelling) chat with the Reddit Admins, I have mod permissions again. So hooray, I guess.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext, speaking of low quality posts these days, let's set some rules. The following posts will be removed IMMEDIATELY:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Posts that link news articles, or promote news articles or newsletters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. Posts that complain about GPT-4's output quality, this subreddit is for the discussion of professional usage of GPT, \\*\\*NOT\\*\\* complaining because the bot didnt give you exactly what you wanted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Posts that are very obviously generated by ChatGPT. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. The exact same posts about prompt engineering that keep popping up, as if we didnt have enough of those already\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5. \\*\\*Any sort of promotional material. Zilch, Zip, NADA\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n6. Questions like: How do I voice chat with ChatGPT, What should I do if ChatGPT \\_\\_\\_\\_, Why isnt ChatGPT doing \\_\\_\\_. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n7. Crossposts. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you disagree with the removal of your post, just reach out in the modmail. And if you \\*do\\* reach out in the modmail, don't straight up start cussing and complaining about the removal (This has happened too many times).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow that we've gotten that out of the way, now the issue of moderation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*As you can see, it's painfully obvious that the subreddit has grown exponentially while the number of moderators have dropped to literally one. Thus, I am now opening mod applications :D.\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you do want to apply, DM me u/Redditoridunn0. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe subreddit is still growing quickly and there are \\*many\\* posts being put up in the subreddit that are either straight up dogcrap or spam. In order to be able to keep up with this and upkeep the high standards of this subreddit, I will see to it that we do get a good number of mods going in here. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce again, I am \\*very\\* sorry about the huge quality drop and lack of moderation in this subreddit. If I typed something stupid in this spiel then forgive me, I have a headache and I thought typing this out while having a headache was a good idea (it very much was NOT).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Mod applications are a thing now, DM me if interested. Oh and bad posts go bye-bye.",

        "content": "One key use case for ChatGPT is writing and most recently we have integrated [CVGist](https://cvgist.com) with ChatGPT to craft professional resumes. It works like this:\n\n1. User writes one prompt on bio\n2. We\u2019ve designed prompts and instructions for ChatGPT to follow when writing all parts of a resume.\n3. Our custom document generator takes the text from ChatGPT and generates 90 resumes. \n\nSo far all is going well with our generations running quite quickly and costs are manageable(small user base so far). Has anyone else integrated their tools with ChatGPT? Any thoughts on the costs associated, performance, ect.?",
