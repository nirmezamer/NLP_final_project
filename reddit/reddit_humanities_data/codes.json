        "content": "We welcome posts related to ciphers and codebreaking. In order to maintain the quality of this subreddit, please follow our guidelines.\n\n# 1. Choose a descriptive title\n\nExamples of what **NOT** to use:\n\n* Cipher I just came up with\n* My friend just sent me this\n* Please help me solve this!!\n\n# 2. Provide context\n\nTell us context: where the cipher originated (link to the source if possible), any clues you might have, the language or format the plaintext might use, and any technique you already tried.\n\n# 3. Provide transcription\n\nIf you are posting an **IMAGE OF TEXT** which you can type or copy & paste, you **MUST** comment with a **TRANSCRIPTION** (text version).\n\n# 4. Posting special characters: make sure it's correct\n\nPay attention to formatting. If you use a character like \\_ or \\` or \\^ **you need to type a \\\\ before it** or Reddit will corrupt your ciphertext. If your ciphertext contains special characters, in order that it displays correctly you can encode it first (for instance using Base64). Alternatively use a\n\n    Code Block\n\n# 5. Provide enough example text\n\nPosting your own custom cipher? You must provide enough example text or there is no hope of anyone solving it. It should be at least a paragraph. Give hints.\n\n# 6. Do Not Delete Solved Posts\n\nYou will be **BANNED** if you delete your post after a solution has been provided.\n\n# 7. No Ciphers from Ongoing Contests\n\nDo not post codes or ciphers from ongoing competitions (CTFs, treasure hunts etc.). Such posts will be removed. Trying to circumvent this rule may get you **BANNED**.\n\n# 8. New accounts\n\nYour account must be older than 24 hours, or your post will be automatically deleted. This is to reduce spamming.\n\n# 9. No bots\n\nIf your bot is not auto-banned on [r/codes](https://www.reddit.com/r/codes/), it will be banned by a moderator. You can still have a bot on other subreddits; just don't use a bot here.\n\n# 10. No AI Generated Decryptions\n\nPlease, refrain from posting decryptions generated with ChatGPT and similar AI programs. Such posts and comments will be removed. Repeated breaking of this rule will get you **BANNED**.\n\n# 11. Required proof you read the rules\n\nIf you have read and understood these rules, include the text **\"I followed the rules\"** encrypted with **ROT-13** cipher in your post.",

During testing a HTTP header Injection tool, A webserver disclosed some 'encrypted debug headers' to me. I'm not specifically interested in ther content. I just want t figure out how they are generated/encrypted. I know some encryptions, formats and compressions have 'tells' but I'm lost on this one.   \n\n\nThe disclosed debug headers are returned in a HTTP response header calle 'x-encrypted-debug-headers'.
