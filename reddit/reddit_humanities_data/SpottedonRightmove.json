        "content": "Hi all, as we reach the 100k members mark (!) I have updated the one and only rule to now be that the link to the property listing must be within the body of the post, or it will be removed, in order to make it easier for everyone to find the listing. \n\nI've also added in some restrictions that the URLs must be from Rightmove or Zoopla, and the same link cannot be posted within 30 days. Please feedback on issues or additional websites that could be included in this list. \n\n  \nThese changes are based on user feedback and how long it takes me to crawl through reported posts to see if the link was eventually posted. Hopefully this will lead to a better experience for all.",

            "Is this sub for weird houses, or just interesting houses? Because there's been a huge increase in people posting nice houses to increase traffic to the listing.",

            "I think it might be good to add that the on the website, the UI might be a bit confusing, it has a section for text, another for photo and another for URL and that these aren't all for one post but separate options. \n\nThe easiest way to do this is just post a photo and URL in the text section, that seems to work pretty well - text as well if you like.",
            "Thank you for making the link easier to find!",
            "If you mean in the iOS app yeah it got fixed.",
            "I've tried putting it in the link multiple times on the post where it says \"URL\" and then find it never appears.",
