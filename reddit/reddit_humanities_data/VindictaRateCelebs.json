We understand most people here would not be so cruel or immature to do this, but there are an unfortunate few posting to this subreddit with bad intentions.\n\n# This sub is for discussing celebrities and actual public figures. Not regular people who happen to have a small online following. \n\nPosting someone then sending directly to the subject in question as a method of intimidation or taunting will be a bannable offence for the OP if we ever receive a complaint or takedown request.\n\n# From now on, all social media influencer / online figure posts MUST include a screenshot of their profile indicating they either have over 100k Tiktok followers or 50k Instagram followers. \n\nPosts not including this will be removed for **not following posting guidelines**.",

            "Thank god!!! Seeing all these super small IG influencers and tiktok ppl were driving me mad",
            "Yes! Ive seen a few where I was like who? Posting people who arent celebrities here just to bully them is so wrong. A lot of people rate really harshly which is sometimes understandable given that these are celebrity standards. Imo the follower requirements should be even higher, they should be a well-known name across social media like Cindy Kimberly or Charli DAmelio. But this at least helps.",
            "Omg does anyone know what happened? It seems like someone posted a influencer with a small following on purpose then DM'd them the post  and we all know that the ratings can be harsh sometimes...",
            "Usually if I dont know who it is I wont rate, or Ill at least look them up. I feel for whoever fell victim to this because these ratings are not for the faint of heart",
            "Is that that screen shot checked  ? because that would be easily faked or doctored, even though it's an easy quick check",
            "I dont see this rule being enforced",
            "Is there going to be someone to check each post to ensure they meet the follower min?",
            "This was a great decision.",
            "Maybe it's like the \"no men\" rule, you have to check it yourself in order to report the OP.",
            "He is not a traditional celebrity (being an extra in a movie still doesnt make him one) and is primarily an online social media figure (YouTube is still social media), so yes that rule still applies to him. It doesnt have to be TikTok, can be IG or YouTube if the other 2 arent available."

I just want her in some Cinderella, Snow Black and the seven dwarves, whatever fairy tale can be made i just want her as the princess .",
            "simone. she has better harmony with her features.",
            "I really can't get the hype around Simone. I don't find her features really balanced. Her jaw is too wide imo. Olivia looks like a goddess instead, way more beautiful in isolated features and balanced overall.",
            "Olivia for me Simones lips throw the balance off for me even Olivia has thinner lips but her feline features go with the lower third whereas Ashleys doe eyes and nose dont go with the masculine lower third",
            "Simone. They both have strong jaws, Olivias smaller features doesnt balance it out well - Simones does",
            "Olivia. Both are pretty much it works a bit better for Olivia. Its her eyes I think.",
            "Theyre both gorgeous but not really very similar imo. I think Simone Ashley has a face that will keep getting more beautiful with age.",
            "Simone honestly. Her lips look too small for her face but that can be fixed with filler, Olivia has really squinty narrowish eyes on quite a large face which makes it kinda hard to look at"

            "Yeah but you can tell the background moving or the heavy filter sometimes, her videos are very natural",
