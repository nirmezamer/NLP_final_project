        "content": "Updated: April 6, 2022\n\nWelcome to /r/fuckcars. It's safe to say that we're **strongly** dissatisfied with cars and car-dominated urban design. If that's you, then we share in your frustration. Some, or perhaps many of us, still have cars but abhor our dependence on them for [many reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_why_does_this_sub_hate_cars.3F).\n\nThere are nuances to the /r/fuckcars discussion that you should be aware of, generally:\n\n* We don't want to ban [ambulances and emergency vehicles](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_ambulances_and_emergency_vehicles.3F)\n* We don't want to isolate [rural communities](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_rural_areas.3F) by taking away cars\n* We don't want to disrupt [work trucks and delivery vehicles](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_delivery_and_cargo.3F)\n* /r/fuckcars isn't about a [\"left\" or \"right\" view of cars](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_politics.3A_is_this_a_.22leftist.22_issue.3F) and car dependency\n\nIn any case, please observe the community rules and keep the discussion on-topic.\n\n## The Problem - What's the problem with cars?\n*please help by finding quality sources*\n\nThis is the fundamental question of this sub, isn't it?\n\n* Pollution -- Cars are responsible for a significant amount of global and local pollution (microplastic waste, brake dust, embodiment emissions, tailpipe emissions, and noise pollution). Electric cars eliminate tailpipe emissions, but the other pollution-related problems largely remain.\n* **Infrastructure (Costs. [An Unsustainable Pattern of Development](https://www.strongtowns.org/the-growth-ponzi-scheme))** -- Cars create an unwanted economic burden on their communities. The infrastructure for cars is expensive to maintain and the maintenance burden for local communities is expected to increase with the adoption of more electric and (someday) fully self-driving cars. This is partly due to the increased weight of the vehicles and also the increased traffic of autonomous vehicles. \n* Infrastructure (Land Usage & Induced Demand) -- Cities allocate a vast amount of space to cars. This is space that could be used more effectively for other things such as parks, schools, businesses, homes, and so on. We miss out on these things and are forced to pile on additional sprawl when we build vast parking lots and widen roads and highways. This creates part of what is called [induced demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand). This effect means that the more capacity for cars we add, the more cars we'll get, and then the more capacity we'll need to add.\n* Independence and Community Access -- Cars are not accessible to everyone. Simply put, many people either can't drive or don't want to drive. Car-centric city planning is an obstacle for these groups, to name a few: children and teenagers, parents who must chauffeur children to and from all forms of childhood activities, people who can't afford a car, and many other people who are unable to drive. Imagine the challenge of giving up your car in the late stages of your life. In car-centric areas, you face a great loss of independence.\n* Safety -- Cars are dangerous to both occupants and non-occupants, but especially the non-occupants. As time goes on cars admittedly become better at protecting the people inside them, but they remain hazardous to the people not inside them.  For people walking, riding, or otherwise trying to exercise some form of car-free liberty cars are a constant threat. In car-centric areas, streets and roads are optimized to move cars fast and efficiently rather than protect other road users and pedestrians.\n* Social Isolation -- A combination of the issues above produces the additional effect of social isolation. There are fewer opportunities for serendipitous interactions with other members of the public. Although there may be many people sharing the road with you (a public space), there are some obvious limitations to the quality of interaction one can have through metal, glass, and plastic boxes.\n\n## \ud83d\udc4b Local Action - How to Fix Your City\n\nIMPORTANT: This is a solvable problem. **Progress can happen and does happen. It comes incrementally and with the help of voices just like yours.** Don't limit yourself to memes and Reddit -- although, raising awareness online does help.\n\nCheck out this perspective from a City Council Member: [Here's How to Fix Your City](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/t208rv/im_on_city_council_heres_how_to_fix_your_city/)\n\n([more](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_what_can_i_do_to_make_my_community_less_car-centric.3F))\n\n## A Not-So-Quick Note for Car Hobbyists and Passionate Drivers\nThis can be a contentious issue at times. The sub's name is /r/fuckcars, which can cause some feelings of conflict and alienation for people who see the problems of too many cars while still being passionate about them. I'll quote the community summary.\n\n> Discussion about the harmful effects of car dominance on communities, environment, safety, and public health. Aspiration towards more sustainable and effective alternatives like mass transit and improved pedestrian and cycling infrastructure.\n\nYour voice is still welcome here. Consider the benefits of getting bored, stressed, unskilled, or inattentive drivers off the road. That improves your safety and reduces congestion.

While it is still very beautiful and has many purely traditional squares, there are still some places that feature modern/modernist buildings which completely gentrifies and ruins the look, especially when you consider there were previous old buildings torn down for some of these buildings. The old town of Vienna even risked losing its UNESCO status because of some of these buildings. They literally have one right next to St Stephan's Cathedral.",
