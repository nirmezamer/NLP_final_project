        "content": "Updated: April 6, 2022\n\nWelcome to /r/fuckcars. It's safe to say that we're **strongly** dissatisfied with cars and car-dominated urban design. If that's you, then we share in your frustration. Some, or perhaps many of us, still have cars but abhor our dependence on them for [many reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_why_does_this_sub_hate_cars.3F).\n\nThere are nuances to the /r/fuckcars discussion that you should be aware of, generally:\n\n* We don't want to ban [ambulances and emergency vehicles](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_ambulances_and_emergency_vehicles.3F)\n* We don't want to isolate [rural communities](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_rural_areas.3F) by taking away cars\n* We don't want to disrupt [work trucks and delivery vehicles](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_delivery_and_cargo.3F)\n* /r/fuckcars isn't about a [\"left\" or \"right\" view of cars](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_politics.3A_is_this_a_.22leftist.22_issue.3F) and car dependency\n\nIn any case, please observe the community rules and keep the discussion on-topic.\n\n## The Problem - What's the problem with cars?\n*please help by finding quality sources*\n\nThis is the fundamental question of this sub, isn't it?\n\n* Pollution -- Cars are responsible for a significant amount of global and local pollution (microplastic waste, brake dust, embodiment emissions, tailpipe emissions, and noise pollution). Electric cars eliminate tailpipe emissions, but the other pollution-related problems largely remain.\n* **Infrastructure (Costs. [An Unsustainable Pattern of Development](https://www.strongtowns.org/the-growth-ponzi-scheme))** -- Cars create an unwanted economic burden on their communities. The infrastructure for cars is expensive to maintain and the maintenance burden for local communities is expected to increase with the adoption of more electric and (someday) fully self-driving cars. This is partly due to the increased weight of the vehicles and also the increased traffic of autonomous vehicles. \n* Infrastructure (Land Usage & Induced Demand) -- Cities allocate a vast amount of space to cars. This is space that could be used more effectively for other things such as parks, schools, businesses, homes, and so on. We miss out on these things and are forced to pile on additional sprawl when we build vast parking lots and widen roads and highways. This creates part of what is called [induced demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand). This effect means that the more capacity for cars we add, the more cars we'll get, and then the more capacity we'll need to add.\n* Independence and Community Access -- Cars are not accessible to everyone. Simply put, many people either can't drive or don't want to drive. Car-centric city planning is an obstacle for these groups, to name a few: children and teenagers, parents who must chauffeur children to and from all forms of childhood activities, people who can't afford a car, and many other people who are unable to drive. Imagine the challenge of giving up your car in the late stages of your life. In car-centric areas, you face a great loss of independence.\n* Safety -- Cars are dangerous to both occupants and non-occupants, but especially the non-occupants. As time goes on cars admittedly become better at protecting the people inside them, but they remain hazardous to the people not inside them.  For people walking, riding, or otherwise trying to exercise some form of car-free liberty cars are a constant threat. In car-centric areas, streets and roads are optimized to move cars fast and efficiently rather than protect other road users and pedestrians.\n* Social Isolation -- A combination of the issues above produces the additional effect of social isolation. There are fewer opportunities for serendipitous interactions with other members of the public. Although there may be many people sharing the road with you (a public space), there are some obvious limitations to the quality of interaction one can have through metal, glass, and plastic boxes.\n\n## \ud83d\udc4b Local Action - How to Fix Your City\n\nIMPORTANT: This is a solvable problem. **Progress can happen and does happen. It comes incrementally and with the help of voices just like yours.** Don't limit yourself to memes and Reddit -- although, raising awareness online does help.\n\nCheck out this perspective from a City Council Member: [Here's How to Fix Your City](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/t208rv/im_on_city_council_heres_how_to_fix_your_city/)\n\n([more](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq#wiki_what_can_i_do_to_make_my_community_less_car-centric.3F))\n\n## A Not-So-Quick Note for Car Hobbyists and Passionate Drivers\nThis can be a contentious issue at times. The sub's name is /r/fuckcars, which can cause some feelings of conflict and alienation for people who see the problems of too many cars while still being passionate about them. I'll quote the community summary.\n\n> Discussion about the harmful effects of car dominance on communities, environment, safety, and public health. Aspiration towards more sustainable and effective alternatives like mass transit and improved pedestrian and cycling infrastructure.\n\nYour voice is still welcome here. Consider the benefits of getting bored, stressed, unskilled, or inattentive drivers off the road. That improves your safety and reduces congestion.

Your book almost feels like a companion to Shoup's The High Cost of Free Parking in how both expose traffic engineering and parking as basically pseudoscience that has degraded the landscape of our country. \n\nYou lived, worked, and did grad school in Connecticut, correct? I'm a UConn grad myself. I'm curious how you think Connecticut could realistically improve in the near future. Although we aren't a Sunbelt state, I feel like we are basically a giant sprawl state. Even the supposedly rural areas are jammed up with cars. We seem to be going backwards in many ways on transit and road safety. We are not meeting our climate goals, nor does it seem like we are seriously pursuing them, but we are very exposed to the dangers of climate change. Our highways are congested pretty much all day every day at this point, and driving anywhere makes me feel like our transportation policy has totally failed. To add insult to injury, the areas of true walkability, for example in West Hartford or Fairfield County, have become unaffordable and are not realistic places for most regular people to live.

            "I really hope one day that we look back on car dependence as that one awkward era in America and go \"what the hell were we thinking?\"",
            "This is correct, but also: the public was bamboozled into this with the information they had.\n\nA lot of the reason why there was a good amount of support among the people for anti-transit policies was that the powerful landowners decided to not maintain a lot of the infrastructure of urban housing, turning good housing into slums. Additionally, the private transit systems genuinely also didn't invest in the infrastructure of transit to the point where it became too expensive to truly do repairs for this infrastructure.\n\nSo the public enjoyed the notion of alternatives of creating new housing in the suburbs, and housing that was car dependent was new and modern instead of spending a lot of money on fixing slums. It also seemed at the time that this was going to be better for people's health because they could see vegetation and sunshine in the suburbs rather than moldy and dirty unmaintained slum buildings.\n\nAnd then there's also the racial aspect of it: after the Supreme Court in Boynton v. Virginia disallowed segregation in public transportation, a lot of these folks truly supported this because they didn't want to sit next to people of color. And this is what's keeping a lot of folks out of transit. This one hits personally: I remember when I worked and lived in San Jose and I told people that I took the bus to the office. I generally got a lot of pushback and astonishment that I would ride the bus among \"dirty people\" (which is, of course, code for \"people of color\").\n\nOf course, we know now how INCREDIBLY shortsighted this was. And how it doesn't matter what rationalizations they had. But this is why the public supported the clearing of the slums and the ripping up of transit instead of actually investing the money on the infrastructure of housing and the conversion of slums into good housing for everyone.\n\nTL;DR: the public was also bamboozled into supporting what the city planners wanted and they also didn't want to spend money in fixing transit and fixing city housing that could also benefit people of color.",

            "This is the eastern segment of Market Street in Philadelphia. Speaking as a resident Market Street East is kinda of a dump. There's a mall so crawling with crime that it was gutted, renamed, and reopened and is now crawling with police that do random metal detector tests. There's this one building with massive time square style billboards that looks kind of nice, but it's not like there's any reason to go anywhere around there. And then there's a couple of ultra cheap stores like Marshall's which is where people to come to the area to shop actually go to shop.\n\nAll in all the traffic's to loud and there's not enough shade to make hanging around there worthwhile. If you're around there and smart you go a few blocks north to Chinatown, who's narrow streets are still busy with cars, but more manageable walking wise.\n\nThey're currently trying to save that stupid mall and the rest of Market Street East by planning an urban basketball stadium right next to the mall. They're not being completely stupid about it, bc they're not building parking for the stadium which will force people to use the (actually pretty good) mass transit options. BUT there's a lot of concern and opposition to the stadium because it's right next to Chinatown. Construction could dampen foot-traffic to a bunch of Chinatown businesses and cause them to close. Property owners in Chinatown might bulldoze a bunch of their buildings to create lucrative parking garages to cater to the most car-brained basketball fans. And if everything else goes well and the stadium is successful, the increased foot traffic might give the businesses a little more revenue, but the landlords might decide to raise the rent even higher, pushing out the small businesses and welcoming in corporate clients who can pay top dollar.",
