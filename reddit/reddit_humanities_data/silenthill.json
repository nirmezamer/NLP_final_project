            "Hyped af my birthday is in October also. Hopefully they show off a collectors edition during the sh transmission\n\nEdit: Is it just me or did James VA sound great in this trailer, particularly the line \u201c I guess I dont really care if its dangerous or not \u201c Even his body mannerism is so odd when he says it. It so James lol. Or the flat delivery of \u201c Ill be careful \u201c. And Abstract Daddy looks incredible wow.",
            "This trailer was miles. I mean miles better than what they showed us last time\u00a0",

Moderator applications are now open as well as we need more hands on deck to help with the subreddit mod queue, apply via the form link below if you're interested:\n\nhttps://forms.gle/MVd7DH8ncpzSixU28",

            "Also as a heads up I'll be reaching out to applicants who I'll be wanting to add this Thursday/Friday so make sure you keep your discord dms/friend requests open so I'm able to add you.",
            "I put in an application.\n\nFor those who don't already know, I was actually banned here a couple of months ago. The place was a toxic wasteland, so I contacted the mod mail to see if they needed recommendations for mods and after some weird interaction (DM for screenshots), I was permanently banned without an explanation. I appealed it 28 days later (after the complimentary mute expired) and got this response:\n\n>\"We will not be removing your ban but do not worry. You may still see all content on the subreddit, your contribution will simply be restricted. This is a decision made by a senior member of our moderation team which we have agreed is a best case scenario. I will be making no personal stance on this matter, but I find the light restriction to be appropriate. Please note that, for now, this decision is final and is concluded. Any further argument will not be considered. Thank you.\"\n\nFound out from N3DSDude that I was banned by the mod who just got removed. When I contacted that mod directly, he blamed N3DS for it and was weirdly flippant. After that, he basically took over the sub and that's when the breadposting, transphobia, and other issues began.\n\nBut anyways, I'm back. Looking forward to see you beautiful people in the future.",
            "Is this subreddit actually going to be moderated now? Thank god, it severely needs it.",
            "Honestly, I don't envy the mod team of this sub.",
            "I applied, I gotta say I'm pretty active in this place and I am always commenting and posting stuff, idk if that's an issue in case I'm accepted, (i rarely see the mods commenting or engaging with the members). But either way, good luck to you guys, I noticed we really need a tougher modding with all these trolls saying crazy things about Angela's new design and so on.",
            "It legit got so bad that I considered putting in a request to take the sub. I assumed it had been abandoned. I also thought about just making a new sub altogether and starting over. (I caved in and did it - r/SilentChill)\n\nI've worked in community management for several online games and had to learn the hard way that good communities don't occur naturally; they have to be cultivated. It only takes a small handful of bad actors to completely ruin an experience for everyone else.\n\nPart of me thinks this sub is a lost cause. People have gotten too comfortable being awful to each other without any consequences for too long. I'd love to be proven wrong.",
            "\\*Raises hand*\n\nYeah, hi. Quick question - what is the line between criticism and \"toxicity\"? Will people who aren't too hot on the remake or upcoming projects still be allowed to voice their concerns or will anyone not praising Bloober or Konami be banned?\n\nOther quick question - is this going to apply across the board? Because I'm seeing posts on front of the subreddit calling members of the fanbase \"disgusting\", \"Incels\", and attempting to conflate any form of criticism with \"hate\".\n\nDon't get me wrong - Toxic Negativity exists, but so does Toxic Positivity.",
            "Are you going to ban or warn peolple who insult others only because they criticise any of the games design including characters or is this going to be one way road?",
            "Appreciate your efforts, the toxicity has been really gross and I\u2019d love to see some of the worst offenders finally go.",
            "Good luck in all this, and partially sorry for the inconvenience caused on Twitter, but partially not sorry because it should at least make this a better subreddit in the future. I can't help moderating here as I'm already busy with another large subreddit, so I'll just wish you all the best in improving this one."
