            "Hyped af my birthday is in October also. Hopefully they show off a collectors edition during the sh transmission\n\nEdit: Is it just me or did James VA sound great in this trailer, particularly the line  I guess I dont really care if its dangerous or not  Even his body mannerism is so odd when he says it. It so James lol. Or the flat delivery of  Ill be careful . And Abstract Daddy looks incredible wow.",
            "This trailer was miles. I mean miles better than what they showed us last time",
            "I was pretty hesitant. This was the last trailer I'm watching. I'm getting this game, and now I want nothing else of it revealed. \n\nIt will certainly feel different than the original, but the vibe is *fantastic*.",

Moderator applications are now open as well as we need more hands on deck to help with the subreddit mod queue, apply via the form link below if you're interested:\n\nhttps://forms.gle/MVd7DH8ncpzSixU28",

            "I applied, I gotta say I'm pretty active in this place and I am always commenting and posting stuff, idk if that's an issue in case I'm accepted, (i rarely see the mods commenting or engaging with the members). But either way, good luck to you guys, I noticed we really need a tougher modding with all these trolls saying crazy things about Angela's new design and so on.",
            "Are you going to ban or warn peolple who insult others only because they criticise any of the games design including characters or is this going to be one way road?",
            "Appreciate your efforts, the toxicity has been really gross and Id love to see some of the worst offenders finally go.",
            "Good luck in all this, and partially sorry for the inconvenience caused on Twitter, but partially not sorry because it should at least make this a better subreddit in the future. I can't help moderating here as I'm already busy with another large subreddit, so I'll just wish you all the best in improving this one.",
            "Just applied myself, I am on this subreddit nearly every day. I have been looking for an active way to be involved in the community and help bring it into a more positive place than it has been before. Long time fan since the beginning. There has been times when the fanbase has been an extremely positive one and I want to keep that aspect alive.",
            "I don't understand why my post is not approved. I made a post about how dumb is to shit storm the game, when we can focus our critics on the important things like animations. I understand moderation, but it's not useful to censor who want to reduce this hate",
