        "content": "For context, I have a total of around 500 hours in all modes and I main support. I still have lots of room for improvement since I have always fluctuated between low Silver and high Bronze on all roles, but I think I know most of the basics of the game.\n\nWhenever I play Brigitte (admittedly, very rare and very little), I quickly die during most fights, either on the frontline or on the backline. Most enemy heroes seem to easily survive my damage (swing+bash+boop) and outdamage both my inspire AOE healing and my repair packs. My shield doesn't protect me, either.\n\nHowever, I occasionally see other people in my games play Brigitte and they don't seem to constantly blow up the way I do. Some of them even manage to bully the enemy tank which leaves me wondering how, since they seem to position aggressively.\n\nMy failure as Brig is probably mostly a positioning issue, but I don't struggle to protect myself when playing other supports nearly as much as I do when playing Brig. With other supports, I try to use cover, off-angles and occasional high ground, but it's not really applicable to Brig since she needs to proc inspire by being in the face of an enemy. Which doesn't help my survivability on her.\n\nI want to learn to play every support hero without hard feeding, and currently I feel Brig is the hero I understand the least.",

            "\"If the enemies don't do anything, don't force anything\".\n\nI think this is really good info. When I first started playing her, I had issues staying patient. I would get antsy, feeling like I should be doing something to have a larger impact, which would lead to being too aggressive. Once I learned to just chill, dole out health packs and whips until the enemy made a move, my win rate sky rocketed. A lot less deaths also \ud83d\ude02",
            "Upvoting this. Sam might be a controversial creator, but this is the exact video I used to learn Brig and play her in GM (before the rank changes).",
            "1. You're not a tank.\n2. Use whip shot on cooldown to space the enemy tank and trigger inspire.\n3. Use shield bash to disengage when you're in danger.\n4. Only engage aggressively against isolated targets, flankers, or when rally is active.",
            "You need pretty good game sense for brig. She's somehow got a reputation for being an op brawler who stomps any dive but she's kinda hard to get value from honestly. Inspire has lost a huge amount of value since the DPS passive buff, \n\nI have two priorities with her, one is to save the backline from dive. You don't do this by killing dive, you can't really. If you see a teammate getting dived, you throw a repair pack at them and then burst as much damage as you can into the diver so that they flee. A kill is nice but rare.\n\nThe other is to pester the enemy frontline into thinking I'm a threat. Take a safe position at a very narrow off angle and flash the shield, boob the boop, be annoying. The aim is to take pressure off the rest of the team, with shield and health regen management you can take a lot of shots while staying safe and those are all shots that are not going on the rest of your team. It's hard though, get a little too much attention, mistime your distraction, fuck up slightly, you are dead",
            "You\u2019re supposed to stay in the back line and throw packs on people. Try and land some whip shots for the 75 damage and get the Inspire to supplement the packs\n\n\n\n\nYour actual mace swing/Inspire is supposed to pressure divers and keep other backline people like Ana or Cass alive long enough until the diver gets out. You only deal 45 damage per swing. \n\n\n\n\nAnd you can press up when you get your Ult. Those Brigs you see doing well probably have their Ult. It gives you 100hp on activation \n\n\n\n\nI think it\u2019s a pretty lame play style, ngl, and I don\u2019t play her. \n\n\n\n\nKeep in mind Inspire is 15 health/second (minus the DPS passive) up to 5 seconds and doesn\u2019t stack. It won\u2019t keep you alive. \n\n\n\nYour 250 health and shield that exposes your legs won\u2019t keep you alive. You use the shield to dash behind cover instead of actual block bullets. It\u2019s really to block a single thing like DVa bomb.",
            "Biggest things that are good and simple tips for an avg player that helped me on brig:\n\nYou need to use whipshot as much as possible, and land it as much as possible - this is how you keep your healing up more often! And offer value of messing w enemy positions\n\nAnd 2nd you should neverrr be dying without a broken shield! So often I see brigs only using shield \u201cfor a good reason\u201d but in reality, that is just 250 extra health  you should be getting value out of! Whether it be chip damage, stepping in front of an ally to take a lil dmg for them, or just prolonging your death - you never wanna die with extra shield health (unless of course resetting)\n\nHitting a lot of whips and using shield well is what makes brig a beast :)",
            "Brig is a skirmisher. You are always looking to deal damage without getting blown up and your tools for survival are your shield and shield bash. If you constantly proc inspire and have good damage and heal pack use you'll give your team a ton of momentum.\n\nIf you do get blown up it's because you aren't using cover or you're making yourself a target in front of too many enemies at once. You should play near cover so you can shield bash away when you need to and always play with your team unless you get the opportunity for a favorable duel.\n\nYou just need to keep playing her and look at where you mess up. Having good game awareness really helps on Brig.",
            "What's the controversy?",
            "Brig is really good at holding choke points and protecting the backline. Especially with Sombra being in nearly every game, you gotta make sure your other support is protected. Brig can be really hard to kill",
            "A gm support here.\n\nBrig is played best as a reactionary support that counters pressure from enemies.\n\nIdeally, You control a position, or you play as a bodyguard for a squishy high impact character on your team like ana, zen, widow etc. \n\nShe controls space very well. If the enemies don\u2019t do anything, don\u2019t force anything. That\u2019s what we call \u201cfeeding\u201d.Just hit your flail to trigger inspire, give healthpack if anyone needs them, scout and wait.\n\nForce the enemies to do something, to expend resources. When they do, counter their push using flail to boop them abd slow them down, shield to absord pressure, bash for either running away or finishing someone off, and health packs for your other teammates who are getting pressured.\n\nYou are not exactly as a tank, but you aren\u2019t a support that can get long range value either. She\u2019s kinda in between. \n\nYou are the backline bait. If the enemy doesn\u2019t take it, they aren\u2019t doing anything. If they do, you get immense value"

            "Tanks don\u2019t have to pay as much attention to contesting angles. Good DPS players are working on that and finding their own off angles. Not stuff you tend to do on tank",
            "I'm also much higher on tank than dps. I'd agree the reason is mostly mechanics. For tank, climbing is mostly about conceptually learning the game. Stuff like knowing what style to play into what comp, learning to stop inting, and learning when to pull the trigger to ult. For dps, once you learn to take some decent angles, the rest is really all about winning that duel and hitting that headshot. I think i'm pretty good on dps when im really warmed up, but tbh its really hard to stay at your mechanical peak all the time. I think thats also why high rank dps players are all so deranged. You simply cannot retain your humanity with how much they need to grind to keep their mechanics up",

Trying my hand at tank and am not sure exactly what's the best way to deal with tracer. \n\nPlayed a game yesterday where my team was getting decimated against tracer. Was a control map where my team was junk and ashe on damage (mid plat) and I was initially playing Ram. My support was bap and Moira. The enemy tracer was just destroying them. The junk and bap were flaming the hell out of me despite the bap being 0-6. \n\nFrom a damage player perspective, I know how to handle this situation as I'd be playing Cassidy or Sombra. But my team refused to swap heroes and just blamed me for....I'm not sure what. Real talk though, I feel like dealing with tracer isn't my job as a tank who is either trying to hold front line as I can't be chasing tracer around the map. What should I be doing in this instance as tank?\n\nEdit: the enemy tank was JQ which was constantly pushing up and they had an Ana that was making sure to use nade on me anytime possible. ",

            "Masters tank console here\n\nJQ - you can't get close to her even as a tank it ain't worth it in these situations. Ramm especially just feeds against junker queen and you just need to switch\nAna - dive her if she's the problem\nTracer - DVa defense matrix to help your team, dive ana and their other support so they'll be forced to look at you. That way hopefully the tracer will either fall back or be forced to take an unfavorable duel.\n\nIf you don't play DVa, you could play hog and hook her. \nIf you only play ramm you probably won't be able to kill tracer. Junker queen has to get close so you could shield behind her to block her healing before switching to nemesis and killing her or forcing her back. Don't let her play aggressive you need to be more aggressive. Your shield is the only thing protecting you from ana grenade and sleep so you need to be mindful of it's placement. \n\nSometimes ignoring the tracer might be the best idea even if it sounds stupid. Put more pressure than their tracer.\n\nHope this helps"
