I still have lots of room for improvement since I have always fluctuated between low Silver and high Bronze on all roles, but I think I know most of the basics of the game.\n\nWhenever I play Brigitte (admittedly, very rare and very little), I quickly die during most fights, either on the frontline or on the backline. Most enemy heroes seem to easily survive my damage (swing+bash+boop) and outdamage both my inspire AOE healing and my repair packs. My shield doesn't protect me, either.\n\nHowever, I occasionally see other people in my games play Brigitte and they don't seem to constantly blow up the way I do. Some of them even manage to bully the enemy tank which leaves me wondering how, since they seem to position aggressively.\n\nMy failure as Brig is probably mostly a positioning issue, but I don't struggle to protect myself when playing other supports nearly as much as I do when playing Brig. With other supports, I try to use cover, off-angles and occasional high ground, but it's not really applicable to Brig since she needs to proc inspire by being in the face of an enemy. Which doesn't help my survivability on her.\n\nI want to learn to play every support hero without hard feeding, and currently I feel Brig is the hero I understand the least.",

            "You probably don\u2019t struggle with other supports because brig is short range and low mobility where every other support has one or the other. \n\nThis means that if your positioning is bad, it\u2019s going to take you a while to reposition, so you die more easily if you\u2019re too aggressive and you\u2019re too far away if you\u2019re too passive. \n\nMy suggestion is to try to find doorways and corners to play around because if the enemy tries to walk past it, you\u2019re waiting there in swinging range ready to smack them.",

            "I personally can't watch the replay right now but here's my thoughts as a long term player:\n\nThere's a time and place for playing close to your team and playing away especially with Dive Tanks mobility. The general concept for Dive Tanks is get in, tickle damage/distract/disrupt/displace, bubble, and get out asap to your team or a mega heathpack. It doesn't necessarily mean to stay lodged firmly in the enemy spawn. Leaving your team to die to Queen + Bastion on cart with no damage mitigation and luck is a surefire way to lose a game let alone a push. \n\nIf your team is asking for help from the 600HP + hero you should try to help them regardless if you think it's your place or not. At the end of the day it's a team game focused primarily on who works together better and if you're not working with yours and just playing selfishly you'll see games go awry.",
            "It's not that they don't fight on point, but we have to remember that tanks in general have the task of creating space. Each type of tank will do it in their own way. However, it's not always 100% one thing.\n\n\nDive tanks should be doing that, diving their backline (hopefully with at least one dive dps) and making the enemy turn around so that they aren't disrupted from behind. Sometimes the tank will have to retreat to point, whether it is to regroup or to get healed by supports. It's just a matter of game sense and decision making: what is going on, what might happen based on that and what I should do accordingly.",

            "So I took a quick look at your attack round. Basically, if you don\u2019t create enough pressure with your dive and the enemy tank brawls on cart, then the enemy tank will control cart. \n\nTry to prioritize target supports who are healing the dps, than the dps getting healed by supports. You can watch the replay, at one point, you seemed to prioritize the enemy Bastion over the enemy Mercy. It\u2019s very hard to kill a Bastion that is getting healed by Mercy. \n\nAlso, your initial team comp had Kiri and Mercy. None of them followed you on your dives, so you had limited uptime, which meant limited pressure, which meant not getting much done.",
            "I'm new but what ive gathered so far as a dva main is that i have to be all over the place. I'll put damage on the enemy team until I find a soft spot then I'll jump in and try to take some people out then get back for health. If someone is flanking us I'll jump back and kill them if I have to and if someone is on high ground above us I'll fly up amd deal with them bbut for the most part in on the frontline applying pressure and divimg in when i get a chance",

            "Because it\u2019s so inefficient for ranked play.\n\nYou\u2019ve seen it in pro play in the past before the Mauga meta as the \u201cgo-to\u201d brawl tank for many teams because the hero is really good at providing a lot of utilities + Block is one of the best surviving ability in the game that allow you to occupy space efficiently.\n\nHowever his kill and carry potential since S9 health buff has been nucked cause his Plummel damage has not been increased. Ram still needs 4 punches + melee to kill any 250 hp target that receive 0 healing.\n\nIn ranked playing a tank that has really low carry potential is not good enough. Most of the times your teammates will not do enough while you are surviving to justify using him.\n\nIn team environment having an high survivability tank is a good option especially when you can properly rotate your cooldown and your teams follows your engages/disengages. In ranked this doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nMoreover, he is really weak into the most played tanks, Mauga and Hog, and he doesn\u2019t counter anything specific so players do not pick him in the counterswap rotations.m\n\nEdit: Small addition, he\u2019s not even played in Pro now since Mauga hard counters him and mauga is the top dog in proplay with Sigma in brawl rn.\n\n\nTL;DR: No carry potential, Weak into Mauga/Hog, doesn\u2019t counter anything, too dependant on teammates to get the job done.",
            "As a Rammatra enjoyer, he struggles against Mauga and can struggle against Hog. He doesn\u2019t particularly counter other tanks and can\u2019t really answer typical tank busters the way that Orisa, Sigma, or even Mauga can. He can close distance, but can\u2019t get distance himself.\n\nEasiest thing you can do to fix that is to boost Pummel damage. Much like how Rein got Hammer buffs to offset S9 to keep his breakpoints. I think upping the damage to 80 might be worth a shot.",
            "I became a hard Ramattra main soon after I managed to unlock him in season 2, but I'll admit that the season 9 changes hit him pretty hard. The hitbox changes did help his consistency (or at least, helped **me** be way more consistent with him) but his Block in Nemesis form seems to get way less mileage than it did before. I think the DPS passive was a particularly hard hit to him because his Block only provides damage resistance instead of negation. As someone who also plays Sigma, there's just very little reason to choose Ram over him right now. Kinetic Grasp is vastly superior to Block despite being on a cooldown, Sig's barrier is far more flexible with way more uptime than Ram's barrier, and Accretion is much more deadly and has a much more effective type of CC than Vortex.\n\nHis Nemesis needs another adjustment buff. I used to trigger Nemesis as soon as it came off cooldown, but now I spend a significantly greater portion of my playtime in his normal form because it's generally more effective and less risky than going in for the brawl. Hell, sometimes I just do it for the armor boost :| I don't mind the brawl being risky, but if there's no advantage to doing it over Omnic form then there's no point. \n\nI personally would also like for Vortex to get a buff to its size or *something* just because it's difficult to use against heroes that should be most vulnerable to it (Pharah, Winston, Ball, etc.). Since the first two are showing up more frequently nowadays, it would be nice to address how actually ineffective it is.",
            "I don't play him because hes such an anti-carry tank. So much of his gameplay is based around threatening and not dying, with way less kill potential than any other tank. He is the tank that just stands there, menacingly.",
            "To put it simply: we're in a mauga meta right now. Rammatra isn't good into mauga because he will be forced to block while mauga sits there burning him. If you want to play to survive mauga's assault, you play either sigma or Orisa (but it's almost always sigma).\n\nI know you made this post about ranked, but in a team setting, there are basically 3 types of teams: the ones that play mauga, the ones that play sigma, and the ones that play Winston. My team is a mauga team. Our go-to team comp is Mauga, some combination of Genji, Cassidy, Pharah, and Venture, with Kiri Lucio as support.\n\nWinston teams will usually run either echo tracer, or echo Cassidy, while sigma teams will usually play Pharah Cassidy just to burn Mauga more effectively. A lot of players call this meta boring as hell, but my only real complaint about it is that my 7 year main (Zarya) is unusable right now because she just loses to rein, sig, and Mauga, with a not great matchup into Winston.",
            "He is heavily undertuned since s9. No reason to play him. Every other tank counter him, dps counter him, ana zen destroy him. I think he is only good against zarya but no one plays zarya.\n\nOnly viable playstyle he has is turtling and relying on teammates. Only peak moment he has is vortex otherwise he is completely toothless. You can pretty much ignore him.\n\nLowest pickrate tank in t500 since s9. Suffering simulator.",
            "I wish they buffed his vortex so it actually draged flying targets down, like pharah. Pharah can just do so much freely now.",
            "I must get close to do damage. Every character have 4 get out of jail free cards. Ramattra sad.",
            "he suffers from matchup issues i find. Number one is the rein matchup, its 100% skill based, i dont think ram counters rein and rein can put out consistent damage due to not having to stance swap.\n\nThe biggest one though are other characters. Ram goes against ana, zen, reaper, bastion, basically any tank counter and all ram can do is hold block and pray",
            "I will say, if you're good with Ramattra, the really refreshing thing about him is he kind of exists outside of the tank counterswap paradigm we're all forced to live in. Like even if I'm fucking \\*slaying\\* on Ramattra, the enemy team typically doesn't all fucking swap to counter me, because, you know, what even \\*are\\* the hard Ram counters? I'm sure they exist but I couldn't name them and I don't think most average players can either. \n\nHe's kind of the only tank, where, while it may be suboptimal to play him, I can atleast actually main the guy without triggering a rock, paper, scissors off. And I've found a lot of comfort in him for that reason."

            "I've played tank everywhere from Gold to T500, and I would say it's pretty common for me to have considerably more elims than my DPS, and often even more damage as tank.\n\nTanks deal a lot of damage spread out across a wide area, and often have cleave meaning they're hitting multiple people at once. It's kind of a given that you're going to have a lot of elims as most tanks.\n\nThat doesn't mean they're actually getting that many solo kills, though. Tanks soften up targets and create opportunities for DPS to win duels and secure picks. Their job isn't to just kill everything.",

If a squishy wastes a cooldown in front of you or is standing where you can isolate them you have to be able to kill them.\n\nIn general, do more damage than you take.",

If anything compare it to enemy KDR\u2019s and see who on their team is A) racking K\u2019s on your team B) who\u2019s not dying.

As long as you\u2019ve dealt any damage to a target within 5 or 10 seconds and they die, you get credit as well as any other contributors. Thus, as you say playing tank is supportive (not exactly, tanks can do huge damage, but it\u2019s true someone like winton exists to open a hole for dps to punch through), even if you\u2019re supporting them you\u2019re getting the same amount of credit for all of their kills. If you assist in all of your dps\u2019 kills and they don\u2019t overlap eachother at all, you\u2019ll have their kill count combined.",
            "Kill ratios dont really mean much in overwatch. If u play dva or winton, ur elims are going to be inflated because u can tickle 4 ppl at once for some damage. If any of those ppl you tickled gets killed (by you, or someone else), you get the elimination.\n\nAnother point is that tanks can deal big damage and kill alot. Tanks usually win 1v1 against everyone except another tank. A good agressive tank player will generally be top 2 on their team for damage and elims.\n\nIt also depends on who tgese elims were on. Ur widow could be like 8 -2 in 8 team fights, while ur sitting at 15 elims on tank. But the 8 picks the widow got were on the key support that had the ult up. With that support dead, you were able to land that fat shatter for a team wipe.",
