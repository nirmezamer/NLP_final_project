            "Just a heads up, I came across a user by the name of anvvsu on Nookazon. I canceled our transaction for a Royal Crown when I noticed just minutes before they received a review from another user claiming that they were scammed out of their crown. This person took the item and then left. I decided not to risk it so I declined. This person then proceeded to message me cursing in my DMs. I already reported them but just beware and keep yourselves safe. People like this really ruin it for everyone and I feel awful for the person who got scammed.",
            "Hi there. My kid is playing and she has wrapped presents. Please come to the island, poke around, and take a present. She's really excited and proud of herself. Please be nice, enjoy yourself, pick fruit, do whatever. DODO code: KT5G6",
            "Why is it that you can invite people to your island for dozens of free things and they still feel entitled to take above and beyond that? Some of y'all really need to check yourself. Every time I open my island I find that people have taken things I've asked them not to. I hope that's not how y'all act in real life but I'm sure it is, and I really hope it's literal children acting like this. Unfortunately, I will still be doing giveaways because I have way too much stuff and simply selling it would be sad. \n\nOn the other hand, I've had a few really generous people visit. Thank you to those people.",
            "UPDATE: closed, still have lots of clothes & furniture, might open again tomorrow!! thx to everyone who visited!\n\ni have so much stuff. please come take some stuff!!! my left beach is completely littered with fossils, clothes, furniture, etc! i also have fruit veggies u can take.",
            "******Now closed, will reopen tonight if possible. ******Closing at 40 minutes after hour, about 15 minutes. Come for a quick run around, then I have to start my real job.   Free furniture, clothes, wallpaper. Fruit and Veg for newbies. If you don't leave through airport everyone gets slammed back home with empty pockets. maryc in pirate hat, will be wandering about cleaning up island. Bags of bells for first 5 to water flowers inside right blue fence. Dodo closed. Free to look inside pink house behind Able Sisters, I have dozens of gyroids singing. ;) Fish, net, shake trees. Fishing gets bunny eggs today.",
            "I have dozens of DIYs I already know on the small beach to the left of my airport (you\u2019ll see a LEARN SOMETHING NEW sign). Please come take some! You can take any fruit/veg that\u2019s sprouted as well as pick any flowers. Flick is visiting today. \n\nEdit//island closed. Thanks to those who came! I have a ton of DIYs left still so I\u2019ll open up another time soon ^_^",
            "Opening my island for the first time!! I have veggies, coconuts, apples and peaches. I also left a lot of free things on the ground (clothes, lamps, glowing moss, etc)! Looking for cherries or oranges if anyone wants to leave any :) \n\nCode - BS82K",
            "I got shooting stars and Celeste if anyone wants, island I under construction so nothing to see :/  edit: will add code after current group leaves.\n\nEdit: getting ready to sleep send chat if you want code",
            "I have an inventory of over 600 DIYs I'm trying to pare down a bit. Comment a DIY you're after and I'll see if I have it. No payment needed, though if you have lily or cosmo seeds in your shop that'd be real helpful.",
            "Hi everyone! I\u2019m giving away free bells again. I have also set out items that I no longer have use for. Feel free to check the shops by taking the Mario pipe in front of the airport!\n\nEDIT: CLOSED"

I've been thinking it would be nice to have some new faces cycle through, I have everyone's photos, and at least half of my villagers have vacation homes now.

Between Nook and the island rep, she has to do a LOT of paperwork to keep every govt bureaucrat and pencil pusher from trying to slam them with regulatory violations. Like *every* time you add in another water source, now she has to make sure it's compliant with the local water regulatory board guidelines. Those Nook islands you stripped of resources? Yeah she has to figure out how to retroactively get permits to not get y'all thrown in the slammer for damaging govt lands. Wonder what the EPA would say if they knew you don't have a proper septic system or sewer system setup to handle the waste of a small town... Isabelle has to stay out late figuring that out, too.",
