This will include: -star fragments -pearls -diys -furniture -fruits & veggies -nook mile tickets -mushrooms And sooo much more!! If interested in stopping by send me a message and I\u2019ll give you the dojo code!\n\n!RULES! Please no picking flowers, star fragments, mushrooms or anything off my island that is not in the designated shopping area. If I see rules are broken I will close the island and it\u2019ll just ruin the fun for everyone else.\n\nAlso be advise my island is blocked off in certain areas. I can\u2019t have many people roam around freely you\u2019d understand when you get there:) If you would like a tour we\u2019ll have to do that another day\n\nSee ya soon! <3",
            "Just a heads up, I came across a user by the name of anvvsu on Nookazon. I canceled our transaction for a Royal Crown when I noticed just minutes before they received a review from another user claiming that they were scammed out of their crown. This person took the item and then left. I decided not to risk it so I declined. This person then proceeded to message me cursing in my DMs. I already reported them but just beware and keep yourselves safe. People like this really ruin it for everyone and I feel awful for the person who got scammed.",
            "5 star island.\n\nHave all veggies and fruits free for harvesting.\nIn the month of Jan if you would like to come fish or catch bugs. Have snow and starting to decorate for Christmas. Feel free to come visit and shop, explore etc.\n\nDodo is B0CLP\n\nEnjoy",
            "Are you wishing to make long lasting friendships through ACNH? Tired of sharing your friend code and then never visiting each other? Have you been scammed or had your island messed up by inconsiderate other players?\n\nI\u2019m Looking for more respectful adults who want to be friends in ACNH. People who are fun but don\u2019t trash other people\u2019s islands, scam, or are rude for example! I play often and I\u2019m also part of a really cool ACNH discord server where everyone is super nice, respectful, and fun to play with. It\u2019s a safe space and is comprised of adults (18+). I use both discord and Reddit (but mostly discord)- but if you are interested in becoming friends, hanging out, or have been looking for a good discord server for the game feel free to send me a chat! Look forward to hearing from you \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc always down to make more ACNH friends!",
            "[Closed! Thanks so much everyone! Will definitely do again!] \n\nFREE GIVEAWAY/SCAVENGER HUNT!\n\n\nHey friends! \n\nIn honor of completing my fossils I'm hosting a scavenger hunt giveaway (aka my storage is full please take all the things!)\n\nThere are SIX locations on my island with different kinds of items (Materials, Recipes/food, Gyroids, Clothing, Items, DIY). The scavenger part is you have to explore to find them! They're not super hard to find but I wanted a way where people can actually play and explore rather than filling pockets and leaving, ya know? Leif is also here and I Time traveled to morning so everyone can see. \n\nNo entry fee but if anyone has an extra Log Bed DIY lmk! Also donations/tips are accepted in the box as you enter. \n\nRules:\n1. Leave through the airport! (If you don't it's \"quiet leaving\" and bugs the whole game\n\n2. No picking Flowers, moss, or vines. \n*Shells, fruit, crops, weeds, branches, fishing, shopping, talking to villagers, visiting the museum, and bug catching is welcome!*\nBut please don't pick the flowers, moss or vines. \n\n3. Because of some of the content in my house/island, this island is 18+! It's very much in good humor but if you aren't comfortable with NSFW jokes it's not for you! \n\n4. This island was created in honor of my father who passed suddenly before Christmas. I have a memorial zone- please be super careful to not run over flowers there. \n\nThat's it!!\n\nDodo Code [closed!]\n\nI'll be open until 11pm EST and on intermittently. If you need something message me on reddit- my character will probably be sitting somewhere quietly while I clean my house \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\udc97",

Come and go if you need\nIf you can reach it, you can pick it! Watering is appreciated!\nBe patient, since I am offering free bells galore, it can be a bit busy here.\nI will not be putting new bells down until all I have placed are gone. There is too much traffic for me to stress about replenishment. Once all is gone I will close island, replace bells, and reopen with a new code!\n\nKNGS7\n\nWelcome to MysticIsle, I am your host, Smashlee! Please enjoy your stay and leave only via airport!

And I did it basically without help from friends or family ... just throwing 4980 bells at Redd on Harv's island every damn day. Thank the maker for the 2.0 update, I guess. There was a not-insignificant bit of time travel involved, but only to make the best use of the unused days in my months-long hiatus from the game earlier this year.\n\nMy storage has dozens and dozens of both duplicate genuine and fake artworks, and I'm going enjoy throwing the pile of fakes in the trash soon.",
