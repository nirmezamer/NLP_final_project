        "content": "# Submissions are now open!\n\nWe're happy to announce that submissions for the Summer 2024 Painting Competition are now open! Submitting your entry is super easy, [just create a new image post](https://www.reddit.com/r/minipainting/submit), follow the directions on how to photograph your entry below, and use the flair \"2024 Unpainted Painting Contest Entry\". Once you submit your post, you'll receive a response from AutoMod with a link to the form to complete for entering the competition.\n\nYou'll receive a message from the mod team here that your entry has been accepted (or in the rare case rejected or if there's a problem) and then you can begin painting! If you have questions on any of this, feel free to post below or [shoot us a message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r/minipainting) and we'll get you an answer. \n\n  \n\\------------------------------------------\n\n# Important Dates\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* June 10th \u2013 Initial Entries / Signups Start     \n \n* July 21st \u2013 Last Day for Initial Entries / Signups     \n \n* July 22nd \u2013 Final Image Submission Begins     \n \n* August 11th \u2013 Last Day for Final Image Submission     \n \n* August 12th - 26th \u2013 Community Judging     \n \n\nAll dates start 12:01 am / 00:01 Pacific Time and end 11:59 pm / 23:59  Pacific Time.   \n\n# ------------------------------------------\n\n# Categories\n\nThis year we\u2019re opening things up a bit and allowing users to have  multiple entries, with a limit of one entry per category and you can not  use the same model in multiple categories. If your model would fit into  multiple categories, pick the best one for it.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Single Small Models (up to 54mm scale)     \n \n* Single Large Models (larger than 54mm scale)     \n \n* Unit/Squad     \n \n* Diorama     \n \n* Busts     \n \n* Vehicles     \n \n\n# ------------------------------------------\n\n# Judging and Awards\n\nThis year judging will be handled entirely by the community of [r/minipainting](https://www.reddit.com/r/minipainting/)!  Once entries are finalized and submitted, a new post will be pinned with  the entries and information on judging. We've looked at previous years'  data and have decided on a range that we feel will give a fair result  to every entry. Judging will be simple as we make changes and test  things out, so this year the two factors that will be judged are the  build of the model, think mold lines removed, gaps filled, etc. And then  finish, so the paint and techniques itself.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Judging Criteria|Points Available|\n|:-|:-|\n|Build|1-4|\n|Finish|1-4|\n|Total Available|2-8|\n\nScoring will be tallied up and averaged from the community judging form and the following levels will be awarded.   \n\n* Gold: 6.75+ points   \n* Silver: 6-6.74 points   \n* Bronze: 4-5.9 points   \n\n# ------------------------------------------\n\n# How to Enter\n\nCreate a new image post containing the images of your submission and be sure to use the \"2024 Unpainted Painting Contest Entry\" flair. Follow the instructions on the comment left by AutoMod, **be sure to do this or your submission will not be counted!** You'll get a link to a form that will ask for a few more bits of information.\n\nOnce your submissions is in, you'll receive a message from us letting you know that your submission was accepted and you can begin painting!\n\nThe entry form includes a section to submit your unpainted entry  picture(s). Unpainted entry pictures must include the following clearly  visible and not be edited/photoshopped in:\u00a0   \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Your Reddit username\u00a0     \n \n* The date (any standard date formats is ok)\u00a0     \n \n* The word \u201csurprise\u201d\u00a0     \n \n* Your chosen unpainted mini(s)\u00a0     \n \n\nHere are some examples of unpainted entries that would and would not be accepted:\u00a0   \n\n[Good examples of unpainted entries (will probably be accepted)](https://photos.app.goo.gl/QMqQVxui9MuLZL928) \n\n[Bad examples of unpainted entries (will not be accepted)](https://photos.app.goo.gl/2GEJWN2y1uPUw5ur6) \n\n**Entry pictures need to be posted to** [r/minipainting](https://www.reddit.com/r/minipainting/) **using  the post flair \u201cUnpainted Contest Entry\u201d.\u00a0The flair will become  available starting on June 10th when the entry form goes live.** \n\nIf you need more than one picture for your unpainted entry, like if  you have multiple minis in a large entry, please make a gallery post  that includes all your images and not make separate posts for each  image. When you make this post, automod will send you a message  explaining what to do next!\u00a0   \n\nEntry pictures do not need to include the base, basing materials, or  extra bits you might add during the painting process, but everything in  your piece should be painted during the contest, base included. It is  also fine if you add a few extra bits to your piece during the painting  period that were not in your original unpainted entry. Adding simple  bits like pouches, weapons, or a simple headswap are fine, but your  unpainted entry picture should represent about 90% of what your final  piece will be.\u00a0   \n\nDo not use pre-painted/pre-finished bases or minis. Everything in  your final painted entry must be painted during the contest, after you  have made your unpainted entry.\u00a0   \n\n\u201cUnpainted\u201d is not completely literal, and there is some flexibility  in what your unpainted entry can be (including primed, based, etc).  Basically the model can have everything done up to the point of applying  actual paint beyond priming.\u00a0   \n\n**With the addition of multiple entries, if you are entering  into two or more categories you will need to submit a post for each  entry.** \n\n***Note: Banned users cannot enter this contest*** \n\n# ------------------------------------------\n\n# Final Submissions\n\nFinal submissions will begin being accepted on July 22nd and end on  August 11th at 11:59 pm/23:59 PST. If you did not submit an unpainted  entry that was accepted, you cannot submit a final painted piece.\u00a0   \n\nOnce final submissions open, a new announcement will be made with  links to the final submission form for your final pictures along with  full final submission details. You do not need to timestamp these images  or include your username. If you finish early, take your pictures, and  hold onto them until July 22nd!   \n\nPlease keep the background as neutral as possible, this means no  artwork backdrop (unless it\u2019s part of the model/base) or AI generated  backdrops, screens, etc. We suggest a neutral white, black, or gray  background that lets the viewer focus on the model(s) and your work.   \n\nFinal submission requirements:\u00a0   \n\nMust be posted to [r/minipainting](https://www.reddit.com/r/minipainting/) with the \u201c2024 Painting Competition Final Submission\u201d flair (this flair will become available on July 22nd)\u00a0   \n\nMust not be posted to [r/minipainting](https://www.reddit.com/r/minipainting/)  before the final submissions open (WIP posts are fine before this date,  as well as posting final images to other social media platforms or  subreddits)\u00a0   \n\nMust include a picture of your entry from the front\\*\u00a0   \n\nMust include a picture of your entry from the back\\*\u00a0   \n\nMust include one picture of your entry next to a standard bottle or  pot of hobby paint (ie. vallejo, citadel, army painter, etc) or a ruler  for scale placed vertically next to your mini\u00a0   \n\n\\*If it makes more sense to photograph your mini from the left and  right sides instead of the front and back, you may use those angles  instead. The important thing is we see as much of your mini as  possible.\u00a0   \n\nThe paint pot/bottle may be included in either the front or back photos, or be a separate photo.\u00a0   \n\nYou may include more pictures if you would like, but you must include the above at minimum.\u00a0   \n\nFinal submissions cannot include misleading lighting, filters, image  editing (beyond basic color/level adjustments), AI adjustments, etc.\u00a0   \n\nOnce your final submission is accepted, you cannot change or update  it in any way. Make sure your piece is finished and your pictures are  good before you submit it! Links to submit your finished piece will be  included in a new announcement post on July 22nd. Remember not to post  your final pieces to [r/minipainting](https://www.reddit.com/r/minipainting/) before this date.\u00a0   \n\nThe first picture in your gallery will be used as the preview image  during the community and judge voting. You cannot request another image  be used instead, so make sure to arrange your images correctly when you  post your gallery.\u00a0   \n\n# ------------------------------------------\n\n# Community Favorites\n\nDuring judging we\u2019ll ask the community for their favorite entry and  tally these up. At the end of judging the top entries will receive the  Community Favorite flair in addition to any medal earned from judging.   \n\n# ------------------------------------------\n\n# Important Dates\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* June 10th \u2013 Initial Entries / Signups Start     \n \n* July 21st \u2013 Last Day for Initial Entries / Signups     \n \n* July 22nd \u2013 Final Image Submission Begins     \n \n* August 11th \u2013 Last Day for Final Image Submission     \n \n* August 12th - 26th \u2013 Community Judging     \n \n\nAll dates start 12:01 am / 00:01 Pacific Time and end 11:59 pm / 23:59  Pacific Time.",

I haven't decided yet if I want to use acryllic or oil wash or thinned down contrast paint (Skeleton Horde) to do the shading. Also not sure yet what colors to do the smoke/slime/nurgling but tending to do them in purple and pink ...\n\nThe model is easy-to-build and both his feet were on a part with the \"tactical rock\", so I carefully clipped them off and cleaned them, to pin the model to the custom base I made. (Decided against a display plinth, kept base size to the game rules) Also added a Nurgling, like I did with all DG character models.\n\nFor the cape I want to make it look like wolf fur, will be adding some brown spots in later phase. \n\nNext will be the metallics, then washes and weathering. Lots to do but I'm having a lot of fun with the jolly two :D",

Face maybe a bit of above, and the left arm (right side) further from that right side of the frame. \n\nDisclaimer though, I'm awful at envisioning a final product, especially that early in the painting stages, so I could be completely wrong and unhelpful, but I think that might be a little bit of the issue. I like the overall tone of the skin itself, it just doesn't quite line up if that makes sense based on the highlighting?",
