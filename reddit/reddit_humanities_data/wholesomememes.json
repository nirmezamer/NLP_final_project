        "content": "Hello friends,\n\nThere has been a particularly nasty influx of repost spam bots and we\u2019re asking for your help to send them back into the void. \n\nIf a post seems a bit off, you\u2019re just _certain_ you have seen that post at the top of Wholesome Memes before, maybe the post seems oddly out of place like it was made by a lost Redditor or otherwise definitely isn\u2019t a meme yet alone a wholesome one, or the top comments all seem to be by accounts with some pretty obvious patterns, **please report them!**\n\nReporting is the fastest and most effective way to get them into not only our queue, but malicious bot spam reports will help ensure admins can get eyes on them, too, at an account level.\n\nWe are working diligently to swat them down as they pop up, but as we\u2019re all volunteers who do this as we can when we can, there will always be periods in which we cannot have eyes on every single post and comment. Reports by our amazing community do a great job of helping us make sure the bots get handled as quickly as we can and it is always appreciated knowing others are passionate about taking out a bit of garbage in order to keep this place tidy and nice.\n\nWe are also looking at a few different ways to help identify malicious reposting and karma farming bots and bot-like accounts sooner and more effectively so rest assured we\u2019re aware of the issue and are seeking the best options for handling it.\n\nOn a definitely, totally unrelated note, mod apps may be coming pretty soon too. \n\nIn the meantime, thank you to all of you who have already been so helpful in that regard and for everyone reading this we hope you have an especially lovely day.",

            "The bots have become unreal lately! I've seen a couple bot posts that are just baffling. \n\nI don't know how good of a mod I'd be, though I'd love to help bot swatting beyond reports!",
            "5 out of 7 of the posts on this subs front page are all by bots, its insane",
            "Just counted,9 out of 10 of the current frontpage posts are from bots, this is insane, maybe mod a few  people to just ban bots",

            "but then people with less karma aint able to post.. thats kinda annoyin ngl",
            "Aye, noted on the help offer. While I know mods often get a bad rep, most of us got into it for the same reason: wanting to help keep communities we care about the kind of place we want to keep visiting. So your mindset is already a great thing. It\u2019s easy to teach people to mod from there."
