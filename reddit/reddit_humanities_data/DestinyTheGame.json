        "content": "# Trials of Osiris is LIVE\n\nThis thread is for all general discussion, questions, thoughts, musings, wonderings, etc. for the Trials of Osiris.\n\n---\n\n## FAQ\n\n### What are the Trials of Osiris?\n\n * Trials of Osiris is the pinnacle PvP activity. Every Weekend, the best players compete in 3v3 Elimination for one goal: Go Flawless.\n\n * To start, head to Saint-14 in the Tower Hangar and buy one of the possible passages (see below).\n\n * To reach Flawless and get to the Lighthouse, you need to win 7 matches without losing one.\n\n * It uses connection and weekly performance based matchmaking, which means you'll face teams with a similar amount of wins on their card. Matches will get harder as you win more matches on that same card, and for all cards, the matches you get will be based on your overall performance so far for that week.\n\n * There is fireteam matchmaking. However, we still recommend you find a team for yourself!\n\n * Power Level matters, however bonus power from the artifact is not enabled.\n\n### How Long do the Trials of Osiris last?\n\n * Event Starts: Every Friday at Daily Reset (1700 UTC).\n\n * Event Ends: Following Tuesday at Weekly Reset (1700 UTC).\n\n### Where do I go to find Guardians to team up with?\n\n * You can use the in-game Fireteam Finder or head over to /r/Fireteams, www.The100.io, Xbox LFG system, DestinyLFG.net or DestinyLFG.com, or go to the Bungie.net recruitment forum (also available through the Bungie App). Additionally, many Discord servers host fireteam LFG services.\n\n### What if I have a question about another piece of armor/weapon or general Trials question?\n\n * Use Control + F (Or Command + F if on a Mac) and search for keywords in your question. Someone may have asked it already. If not, ask below in the comments.\n\n---\n\n## Trials of Osiris Map\n\n***Surprise!***\n\n---\n\n## Rewards\n\n* Reputation Rank 4: Upgrade Module (2)\n\n* Reputation Rank 7: Enhancement Prism (3)\n\n* Reputation Rank 10: Trials Weapon _(Changes for each rank reset)_\n\n* Reputation Rank 13: Upgrade Module (2)\n\n* Reputation Rank 16: Trials Weapon _(Changes for each rank reset)_\n\n* Flawless Reward: **[Aisha's Care (Adept)](https://light.gg/db/items/2709776995)**\n\n---\n\n## Reputation System, Trials Engrams, and Adept Farming\n\nWin individual rounds within each match to gain Trials reputation. The amount of reputation you gain increases with each round you've won on your card. Earn enough reputation, and you'll be able to claim a **Trials Engram** from Saint-14! This engram can be focused into any currently available Trials loot you have previously obtained, or it can be redeemed for a random Trials drop. **Your reputation increases after every match completion**, based on the number of round-wins on your card, regardless of the result of that match itself (win or lose, 0-5 or 5-4).\n\nOnce you have gone Flawless, keep playing! Every win you achieve while at the 7-win level, even if you lose your Flawless, has a chance to drop bonus Trials Engrams, adept weapons, prisms, and even Ascendant Shards. There is no penalty for losing once you've made it to the Lighthouse!\n\nWhen you're done, you can cash in your 7-win passage for one additional adept drop, granted you have gone Flawless that week. This resets your card so you can start anew.\n\n---\n\n## Passages\n\nName|Perk|Cost\n-|-|-\nPassage of Persistence|Losses following a win remove the win from the card. Reaching seven wins rewards the weekly Adept weapon. Reaching seven wins without having a win removed grants access to the Lighthouse.  This passage cannot be used to focus Adept weapons.|1500 Glimmer\nPassage of Ferocity|Your third match win grants a bonus win.|1500 Glimmer\nPassage of Mercy|Forgives one loss per run. Forgives a second loss if you have not yet been flawless this week.|1500 Glimmer\nPassage of Wealth|Increased reputation from match wins on a ticket.|2500 Glimmer\nPassage of Confidence|Grants bonus rewards from Flawless Chest.|5000 Glimmer\n\n\n---\n\n***Sort comments by New to join the conversation!***\n\n---\n\n[Archie](https://i.imgur.com/ai5QQ3f.png) wishes you a happy reset and good luck!\n\n---\n\n^Never ^forget ^what ^was ^lost. ^While ^the ^API ^[protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Reddit_API_controversy) ^have ^concluded, ^Reddit ^remains ^[hostile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification#Reddit) ^to ^its ^users.",

            "Eh, if people burn through it its on them.\nBut fuck time gating, not a fan.\n\nIt's just arbitrary waste of time, I would rather burn through the content and play other games than be stuck in a loop of time gated content.",
            "It's not about infinite content, it's about fun content. While fun is subjective, it is fair to criticize the current delivery of seasonal content. \n\nFor me, Echoes just isn't engaging at all. Both activities fall flat compared to what we've had previously (Deep Dives, The Coil). The Pinnacle grind continues to be a chore and I really hadn't missed it at all while it was gone. \n\nSo far, it feels like Episode Echoes was made before feedback in relation to seasonal activities was taken into account. The quality is a far cry from what we've grown accustomed to for the last 9 months (year?). \n\nI'm also not a fan of timegating content, I prefer being able to finish everything and go play something else for a while. Having to wait 6 weeks just to start grinding for a good solar rocket sidearm is pretty annoying.",
            "I think we all expected to at least be able to complete an act instead of the same weekly time gating. I don't think that was asking too much.",
            "My issue is \n\n1) Season levels are time gated. You're stuck at 100, can't go past it. So you still have to level up the season pass 50 levels when the next act drop. Why does the season level not overflow?\n\n2) Drip fed content is boring. All of the current seasonal model points \"log on once per week and play at least a few hours per week\". Most would agree that 'play at your own pace and time' would be better.",
            "Fuck time gating. I wouldnt complain about lack of content if i just speedran through it all and had nothing left to do. I would complain if the game wants to keep me playing for 4 months by giving me 1 boring fetch quest and some dialogue every tuesday. \n\n\nIts WAYY too early to judge episodes and usually the seasons that release with expansions are the worst. But man episodes feel like longer seasons with even more time gating so far.",
            "i think the acts themselves shouldn't be time gated, meaning that acts still release 1 - 3 but every individual act releases without any time gating",
            "Yes. Because they said it was going to be different, and it's not.",
            "We haven't even felt the effects of the episodic model since we're only on the first act so I find it kind of funny when people say it's no different than seasons. Wait for additional missions, weapons, and more in-depth story reveals. \n\nThe issue with a game like Destiny is that you're always going to have people who no-life the new content and then get upset when they've done everything. Adding content to keep up with that insane level of grinding is not feasible and would no doubt require additional spending - which people would also endlessly complain about.",
            "Now that the puppy love of new expansion has run its course for most people, it makes sense that these posts are popping up. New game feelings rarely last more than two weeks for people who don't touch grass like me.\n\nIn the first two weeks of TFS, I played just about 60 hours or more each week because I'm a hard-core grind kinda guy when I play Destiny 2. I generally run gms for fun, and like a lot of the harder content and grinding for god rolls and so on.\n\nSo I smashed out the legendary campaign, then went and did everything I could in the pale heart such as feathers, the  light and dark shapes, all the Micah stuff, the full khovstov quest(traveler balls and overthrow bosses). It was fun to do alongside the pinnacle grind.\n\nSo i did most of that, and also ran the story on my titan and warlock on legendary, and got to 1990 all in the first week. I got the rest of my feathers when dual destiny dropped, and I have been grinding the class item rolls I want since I got to pinnacle light last Tuesday. Finished the season pass as well last sunday.\n\nIt took me only two weeks to finish everything I was allowed by bungie to do or that I wanted to do besides grinding red borders from echoes, pale heart, or the raid. \n\nI enjoyed all of it for the most part, but it highlights that Bungie, for whatever reason, still thinks that time gating works for the two major types of people in D2. Im speaking of those who hardly play and the people like me who play too much. The people that hardly play can't efficiently plan out knocking out everything they want because there is too much grind for them, or it isn't released yet. The people who play too much like me burn through everything there is, and then have to sit on our hands waiting for more. Doesn't really help either side.\n\nOf course, Bungie does it for two reasons. First is To up engagement metrics. They like the \"played 1 hour every day\" versus the \"played 12 hours Wednesday and then didn't play again until next tuesday.\"\n\nThe second is that this is how they prevent content droughts artificially. The community gets \"new content\" once a week and thus won't be stuck waiting out over half the season/episode after finishing everything.\n\nSo yeah, prepare for the deluge of \"more content please posts\" and all the doomer posts for the little issues we ignored during the honeymoon puppy love phase. And of course, even louder titan doom posting since even the honeymoon phase didn't stop those from telling the truth.",
            "The dlc was great. The episode, just feels like seasons so far. Not the most fun or engaging. Also, the Pathfinder system kinda sucks. I hate being forced to play gambit or stuff I don't want to in order to progress the path. \n\nIt's only been out a few weeks and I hope they continue to bring the heat like FS did, but the episode is pretty bland at the moment. It's a valid complaint.\n\nBeyond that, the content from the DLC itself and exotic quests have been top notch. The dual destiny one is probably the best they've done and whisper/zero were incredible."

            "All I know is that Sunbreaker on prismatic feels terrible and useless without sunspots.",
            "I thought what Ben said about the development of the Dread was really interesting. Seems as though when Bungie began creating the Tormenter, they knew that it would eventually be part of a brand new faction.\n\nSo I wonder if the original intention was for the Dread to be in Lightfall, but due to time constraints, they could only create the Tormenter.",
            "There's basically no way to build into grenades with Prismatic Titan. I got a class item with Spirit of Verity and tried to figure out if there's anything I can do with it, but I can't even pair it with Spirit of Armamentarium since they're in the same slot. No grenade aspects, just a few fragments. And sure, those fragments do some cool stuff, but nothing to increase grenade uptime. No Devour, no Ionic Traces, no Sol Invictus, no Offensive Bulwark.\n\nAnd beyond Prismatic, Arc Titan is still dead in PvE. They didn't even give the Storm Grenade buff if you have Touch of Thunder. I know they were a bit absurd during Season of Plunder, but there's gotta be a middle ground.",
            "As nice as it is hear, sometimes Bungie is glacially slow on balancing things. I hope this isn't a \"we'll see in Episode 2\" kind of things.",
            "I hope there is a greater shift in Titan design philosophy to accommodate more aggressive playstyles. IMO, the barricade itself really clashes with the way Titan subclasses are designed currently. \n\nFor example, arc provides a speed boost, a super that requires you to launch yourself at an enemy, aspects that require you to play more aggressively with melee, and a... barricade that completely interrupts this playstyle and has zero synergy with the subclass. Thruster was a great addition, but it just goes to show how out of place barricade is within this gameplay loop. \n\nThe same goes for Berserker! Yes, abeyant leap builds can be incredibly strong, but it's BORING. Additionally, it still feels out of place when your melee, super, and aspects are built for playing more aggressively. \n\nSame can be argued for solar as well. Barricade just seems like an old relic that doesn't mesh well with a lot of Titan gameplay loops.",
            "I'm hoping it wont take like episode 3 to fully \"fix\" titans.",
            "\u201cA lot of talks about titans internally\u201d\n\nYeah I bet there fucking is lmao",
            "Glad they\u2019re talking about it just hope it\u2019s not months before something happens. Prismatic Titan could be good if the aspect selection wasn\u2019t just so bad. Throw in Offensive Bulwark or Sol Invictus and it would be a night and day difference in its usability."

            "There are actually many incarnations of this mistake by Bungie. At its core, players do not want to be forced into playing a very specific load out to overcome a contrived problem. Even in D2 2018, before Forsaken, they tried \u201ccurated loadouts\u201d in prestige raid lairs. Everyone hated it. Forced loadouts was a massive criticism of champions upon release, as well. There has always been a cyclical battle with Bungie trying to force people to play with specific guns and those gamers fighting back for more loadout freedom. Recent raid surges just tipped the scales too far in one direction of that constant struggle.",

We have to remember that Destiny has been around for almost a decade now. \n\nKeeping track of last minute changes are bound to be lost or not even considered long term.
