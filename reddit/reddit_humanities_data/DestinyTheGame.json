        "content": "# Trials of Osiris is LIVE\n\nThis thread is for all general discussion, questions, thoughts, musings, wonderings, etc. for the Trials of Osiris.\n\n---\n\n## FAQ\n\n### What are the Trials of Osiris?\n\n * Trials of Osiris is the pinnacle PvP activity. Every Weekend, the best players compete in 3v3 Elimination for one goal: Go Flawless.\n\n * To start, head to Saint-14 in the Tower Hangar and buy one of the possible passages (see below).\n\n * To reach Flawless and get to the Lighthouse, you need to win 7 matches without losing one.\n\n * It uses connection and weekly performance based matchmaking, which means you'll face teams with a similar amount of wins on their card. Matches will get harder as you win more matches on that same card, and for all cards, the matches you get will be based on your overall performance so far for that week.\n\n * There is fireteam matchmaking. However, we still recommend you find a team for yourself!\n\n * Power Level matters, however bonus power from the artifact is not enabled.\n\n### How Long do the Trials of Osiris last?\n\n * Event Starts: Every Friday at Daily Reset (1700 UTC).\n\n * Event Ends: Following Tuesday at Weekly Reset (1700 UTC).\n\n### Where do I go to find Guardians to team up with?\n\n * You can use the in-game Fireteam Finder or head over to /r/Fireteams, www.The100.io, Xbox LFG system, DestinyLFG.net or DestinyLFG.com, or go to the Bungie.net recruitment forum (also available through the Bungie App). Additionally, many Discord servers host fireteam LFG services.\n\n### What if I have a question about another piece of armor/weapon or general Trials question?\n\n * Use Control + F (Or Command + F if on a Mac) and search for keywords in your question. Someone may have asked it already. If not, ask below in the comments.\n\n---\n\n## Trials of Osiris Map\n\n***[Multiplex](https://www.bungie.net/img/destiny_content/pgcr/crucible_multiplex.jpg)***\n\n---\n\n## Rewards\n\n* Reputation Rank 4: Upgrade Module (2)\n\n* Reputation Rank 7: Enhancement Prism (3)\n\n* Reputation Rank 10: Trials Weapon _(Changes for each rank reset)_\n\n* Reputation Rank 13: Upgrade Module (2)\n\n* Reputation Rank 16: Trials Weapon _(Changes for each rank reset)_\n\n* Flawless Reward: **[Shayura's Wrath (Adept)](https://light.gg/db/items/1036661437)**\n\n---\n\n## Reputation System, Trials Engrams, and Adept Farming\n\nWin individual rounds within each match to gain Trials reputation. The amount of reputation you gain increases with each round you've won on your card. Earn enough reputation, and you'll be able to claim a **Trials Engram** from Saint-14! This engram can be focused into any currently available Trials loot you have previously obtained, or it can be redeemed for a random Trials drop. **Your reputation increases after every match completion**, based on the number of round-wins on your card, regardless of the result of that match itself (win or lose, 0-5 or 5-4).\n\nOnce you have gone Flawless, keep playing! Every win you achieve while at the 7-win level, even if you lose your Flawless, has a chance to drop bonus Trials Engrams, adept weapons, prisms, and even Ascendant Shards. There is no penalty for losing once you've made it to the Lighthouse!\n\nWhen you're done, you can cash in your 7-win passage for one additional adept drop, granted you have gone Flawless that week. This resets your card so you can start anew.\n\n---\n\n## Passages\n\nName|Perk|Cost\n-|-|-\nPassage of Persistence|Losses following a win remove the win from the card. Reaching seven wins rewards the weekly Adept weapon. Reaching seven wins without having a win removed grants access to the Lighthouse.  This passage cannot be used to focus Adept weapons.|1500 Glimmer\nPassage of Ferocity|Your third match win grants a bonus win.|1500 Glimmer\nPassage of Mercy|Forgives one loss per run. Forgives a second loss if you have not yet been flawless this week.|1500 Glimmer\nPassage of Wealth|Increased reputation from match wins on a ticket.|2500 Glimmer\nPassage of Confidence|Grants bonus rewards from Flawless Chest.|5000 Glimmer\n\n\n---\n\n***Sort comments by New to join the conversation!***\n\n---\n\n[Archie](https://i.imgur.com/ai5QQ3f.png) wishes you a happy reset and good luck!\n\n---\n\n^Never ^forget ^what ^was ^lost. ^While ^the ^API ^[protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Reddit_API_controversy) ^have ^concluded, ^Reddit ^remains ^[hostile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification#Reddit) ^to ^its ^users.",

You got 3 new good 3vs3 maps...why do we have to play on this map? The only thing that map is good for is to give people an example of bad map design.\n\nAlso someone that Bungie has to learn the hard truth that this game mode will always loose players unless they finally make it fun and rewarding. I wont Play a game mode where one or two bad games will ruin over an hour of time I have invested. Just overhaul that mode finally. 7 wins and you are good, losses dont matter, win streaks get you Bonus loot with emblems and shit at 7 winstreak..",

            "Im excited for the Khvostov and Speaker nerfs but man I really hope we get some subclass tuning soon. The amount of prismatic hunters all spamming decoys, swarm and smoke nades every single round is miserable. I took the last few months of less ability spam in the crucible for granted and I really miss it.",
            "My Team - 1 person with 1949 power that doesn't know how to sprint + 1 person who afk queued or doesn't know what positioning means\n\nThe Other Team - ultra sweats with meta loadouts that somehow have both perfect aim and awareness of where my team is even when I radar manip with smoke + invis",
            "I think the Crucible team should broadcast single-player trials flawless live every week to let them see what kind of things they have made.",
            "Playing against scouts is so fucking unfun, holy shit. Just at the other end of the map being shot as soon as you leave cover."

            "She did an incredible job with TFS. Looking forward to what she cooks up next!",

            "She had said Bungie was her dream job damn",

Especially now with prismatic and stuff you can get some crazy ability regeneration, also I'm pretty sure Ager's scepter got a tinge of the stasis damage buffs making it super lethal. (Both work great with the artifact perks btw)",
