So they use this instead which electrically is the right \u2018length\u2019 to perform \u2018well enough\u2019 for AM radio reception. They are directional, so if you\u2019re getting bad reception try reorienting the radio to see if you get better reception.",

Most multimeters are too slow to measure this pulses but reading should not be zero, in my experience the values are random on my cheapo multimeter. An oscilloscope is best tool for this, the cheap $20 STM32 oscilloscope works too.",
