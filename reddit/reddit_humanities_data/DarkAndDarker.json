        "content": "**Welcome newcomers and returning players!**\n\n---- \nQuick introduction - I am the newest mod here and I'm doing my best to stay highly active, especially with our new influx of players. I've been a user here for over a year and Held the Line like many of you.\n\n---- \n\nThis reddit can be a great resource and a place for healthy discussion of a game that can be quite frustrating. \n\n*Like a Druid that cast Mending Grove in perfect timing* - the release on Steam / Epic and some really good design changes via the devs has had this game and this sub injected with many new dungeon divers and the return of many Line Holders who are bringing good energy and good discussion!\n\nLet's keep it that way. If you encounter toxic comments here, there is no better way than to either ignore them or to try to be respectful - or to **just report them and watch us holy strike their comments.** We read the reports every day, multiple times a day. We're doing our best to stay very active here - allowing the content to generate organically while still curating spam and toxic antagonistic junk. \n\n**You'll know a gaming reddit is in a good place when the top posts are memes, fan made content, and frag videos.** So *Hold The Line* and keep this sub healthy!\n\n-----\n\n**Edit**\n\nLow effort \"Nerf XYZ Class\" posts will be removed. If you want to discuss certain abilities or attributes of specific classes that you think are creating imbalances, I will let those go as long as they seem well thought out.\n\nAnything that seems to be a \"I'm venting cus I died\" post will be removed going forward.",

            "just to throw this out there\n\nIn this subreddit people will often share information that\u2019s blatantly incorrect and refuse to comment a source. They frequently get tons of upvotes, leading more people to parrot a comment that wasn\u2019t factually correct. \n\nI just reported an example of this from a few days ago if you see what I mean",
            "I normally don't like reddit mods but this edit seems reasonable\u00a0",
            "I think the remocing nerf posts is a slippery slope. Obviously, there is a stark difference between someone who is angry and someone with valid concern.\n\nIt doesn't help either that I see far too much egging and \"Git Gud\" comments that fan the flames.",
            "Glad to see more moderation, this sub really needs it, let's keep the good vibes going. A suggestion I'd like to add is having a consolidated thread stickied when a big topic is spamming up the sub. A recent example would be \"Consolidated steam review discussion\" or some such.",
            ">I'm considering removing certain kinds of low effort \"nerf XYZ\" posts. They happen nearly hourly and are almost entirely someone venting after dying to XYZ.\n\nGo one step further.\n\nOne day ban for cryposting. This will be a harsher deterrent while silencing OP from flaming the entire subreddit until they cool down. Make it a rule and clearly posted so they have no excuse. \n\nThis will also filter out people who **only** came to this sub to cry that they died in a video game. Most people who post once and immediately get banned won't come back and we don't want them.",
            "Hello mrsnakers,\n\ncongratulations on your new position! I wish you the very best and much strength against the disrespectful posts and comments that will come. It's good to read that you will stand your ground against the toxicity of some players. \n\nJust seeing the nasty messages in the Discord when the servers are taken offline for maintenance frustrates me and my friends. Don't let the toxic players annoy you. Ironmace is on to something great and my friends and I can't wait to see the game getting bigger and bigger.\n\nKeep doing what you're doing, we're behind you. \n\nPlease greet the team and say a big thank you!",
            "Damn, I was hoping they'd be taking mod applications soon. Wanted to toss my name in the ring, but welcome!",

            "I'm new to reddit, I created an account only to be part of the dark and darker community.\n\nI tried two times to post two different questions that I had because I'm also new to the game but both posts were removed and it only says \"post waiting for moderator approval\". \n\nDo you know what should I do to fix this?"
