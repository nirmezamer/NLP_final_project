I think I actually like the manga more than most fans do, which is the reverse for the anime, in my situation.",
            "The digital animation looks weird and \"shiny\", character redesigns are questionable (krillin especially). A lot of the grit and violence has been toned down a significant degree. Most of the arcs just aren't very good, have huge plot holes, or poor endings. The continuing trend of it being the Goku and Vegeta show with the rest of the cast barely participating.\n\nThe manga isn't bad, the Moro arc in particular is a standout with how good it is. It addresses a lot of my story and character complaints. And the Granolah arc ups the violence to almost DBZ levels",

            "I'm gonna try and explain in objetive stance, from people who look at the series from most critical angles.\n\nSuper while it's good ,characters like goku seem flanderiesed to the point where some characters and seem to lose some charm. look back at Z goku and compare Super goku behinde all the power ups and colors they are almost completely different characters, goku super is seen as a idiot mostly and rarely serous. Vegets growth seems to have reverted to Z and his majin vegeta growth and number 1 speach to goku seems to be for nothing since he's still chasing goku to keep up, sure his going his own path, but the core character is \"I wont fall behind kakarot\" mentality wich he move passed in Z ...GT vegeta only went ssj4 to save the earth in GT , GT Vegeta and goku grew alot compaired to super in terms of character.\n\nStory is fumbled is places, while they expand the world interducing universes, they don't do much with the consept. sure the TOP is a cool idea but we are only invested in 3 universes , and we only realy know of one to its full extent our universe 7, sure we know parrelells to universe 6 but out side of that...we know little about there endevors like is there a buu in universe 6 we don't know.  the goku black stuff was intresting untill the end and took all tension away having zeno blip the universe away people praise the goku black arch but universaly agree the ending ruined it for everyone.\n\nfeel free to criticize if you disagree i looked at it in terms of the fandom. I like super but even i have some problems  like Blue seeming more like recolored super sayian getting verry little wins. for real no joke original super sayian 1 has more definitive wins than blue."
