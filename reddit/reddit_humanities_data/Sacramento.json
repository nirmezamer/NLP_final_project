        "content": "Join **Introverts of Sacramento** for our **June meetup** at **Honey and the Trapcat** in Old Sacramento this **Friday June 28th at 6:30pm**! Come socialize with introverts, extroverts, and everyone in between at this crowd favorite, easygoing venue.\n\n**Honey and The Trapcat** ([Web](https://www.honeyandthetrapcat.com/))  ([Map](https://goo.gl/maps/w58gtXY1vXDtVrtH7))  ([IG](https://www.instagram.com/honeyandthetrapcat/))\n\n1023 Front St A, Sacramento, CA 95814\n\n* **Everyone is welcome!** This means extroverts too. The group title includes introverts to give them an extra push to attend. This is an open event and anyone of legal drinking age is encouraged to join us.\n* **Check back in this thread day-of for last minute updates, how to identify the group, etc.**\n* **Be nice and keep the mood fun.** We're all here to make friends. Make sure everyone is safe and welcomed.\n\n**About the group**\n\nFounded in 2022, Introverts of Sacramento has had more than two dozen successful meetups at various local businesses. It was founded to encourage introverts to socialize. It filled a need post-pandemic and will be sustained with your participation. New connections were made, drinks had, and good times abound.\n\n**About myself**\n\nThey call me Perkins, or at least most do. Ever since high school when they were one too many Michaels in the class. I do a double take whenever I get called by my first name. I joined the Introverts of Sacramento meetups at #3 and began organizing them at #5. I\u2019m an INTP through and through, which odd that I\u2019m organizing meetups, but I must enjoy it if I keep doing it (right?). At least enough to step out of my comfort zone, and I hope you do too. Because these events aren\u2019t for me, they\u2019re for you.\n\n**Past Meetups**\n\n**2024**\n\n* [5/11 Last Stop Saloon](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/1ck9lj9/introverts_of_sacramento_meetup_last_stop_saloon/) ([photos](https://imgur.com/a/8S7Sprh))\n* [4/26 Drake's: The Barn](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/1c9ljuw/introverts_of_sacramento_meetup_drakes_the_barn/) ([photos](https://imgur.com/a/MmoRDBt))\n* [3/15 At Ease Brewing Company](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/1b8347i/introverts_of_sacramento_meetup_at_ease_friday/) ([photos](https://imgur.com/a/PdgJyqS))\n* [2/23 Mattie Groves Brewery](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/1aseykl/introverts_of_sacramento_meetup_mattie_groves/) **(**[photos](https://imgur.com/a/0MzoZbA)**)**\n* [1/26 Honey and The Trapcat](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/19bgw03/introverts_of_sacramento_meetup_honey_and_the/) ([photos](https://imgur.com/a/MtmRXNy))\n\n**2023**\n\n* [12/22 Drake's: The Barn](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/18kx1f1/introverts_of_sacramentopit_meetup_drakes_the/) ([photos](https://imgur.com/a/GDFSfbO))\n* [12/16 Two Rivers Cider](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/18dejs6/introverts_of_sacramentoholiday_party_two_rivers/) ([photos](https://imgur.com/a/xmewJYm))\n* [11/12 The Jungle Bird](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/17q976b/introverts_of_sacramento_meetup_the_jungle_bird/) ([photos](https://imgur.com/a/QUUfBzh))\n* [10/13 Honey and the Trapcat](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/175o16b/introverts_of_sacramento_meetup_honey_and_the/) ([photos](https://imgur.com/a/S9tcc0g))\n* [9/22 Two Rivers Cider](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/16hviyp/introverts_of_sacramento_meetup_two_rivers_cider/) ([photos](https://imgur.com/a/mRv4syz))\n* [8/19 Drake's: The Barn](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/15pdrdl/introverts_of_sacramento_meetup_drakes_the_barn/) ([photos](https://imgur.com/a/8pm62JZ))\n* [7/29 Honey and The Trapcat](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/157htlg/introverts_of_sacramento_meetup_honey_and_the/) ([photo](https://preview.redd.it/qo61rvyg35fb1.jpeg?width=3796&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bdb453e3706696f74c2a93346ad8499d2fac0830))\n* [6/10 At Ease Brewing Company](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/141upcc/introverts_of_sacramento_meetup_at_ease_brewing/) ([photo](https://preview.redd.it/kq4f90olnb5b1.jpeg?width=946&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1856ddcdb6b926c6cbecda5ce75d2ea01f30d4dc))\n* [5/17 The Jungle Bird](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/13ew593/introverts_of_sacramento_meetup_the_jungle_bird/) ([photo](https://preview.redd.it/i1kljgvy7k0b1.jpeg?width=6048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e94e4688afc41161458e84368c59d429f6aa0858))\n* [4/15 Honey and The Trapcat](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/12f56yu/introverts_of_sacramento_meetup_no_11_honey_and/) ([photo](https://preview.redd.it/mknpjbl408ua1.jpeg?width=5378&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=14c0cfabaab457a0161be7a416e5db1938434d1f))\n* [2/25 Drake's: The Barn](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/117bdtp/introverts_of_sacramento_meetup_no_10_drakes_the/) ([photo](https://imgur.com/a/GEw2Isi))\n* [1/27 At Ease Brewing Company](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/10i5o8s/introverts_of_sacramento_meetup_no_9_at_ease/) ([photo](https://i.imgur.com/wOruWVt.jpg))\n\n**2022**\n\n* [12/17 Nitty's Cider](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/zfmv03/meetup_no_8_introverts_of_sacramento_nittys_cider/) ([photo](https://i.imgur.com/MuQDQpD.jpg))\n* [10/19 The Jungle Bird](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/y8jmix/meetup_no_7_introverts_of_sacramento_the_jungle/) ([photo](https://imgur.com/ZsTPR3A))\n* [9/12 Big Stump Brewery](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/xabo8m/meetup_no_6_introverts_of_sacramento_monday/) ([photo](https://imgur.com/WNvlAcR))\n* [8/9 Drake's: The Barn](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/wh2ijq/meetup_no_5_introverts_of_sacramento_tuesday/) ([photo](https://imgur.com/c7hSBc0))\n* [5/17 Drake's: The Barn](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/unmnqe/meetup_no_4_introverts_of_sacramento_tuesday_may/) ([photo](https://imgur.com/a/iUlCPs7))\n* [4/25 SacYard](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/u891gw/meetup_no_3_introverts_of_sacramento_we_love/) ([photo](https://imgur.com/a/L50TdL4))\n* [4/5 Lucid Winery](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/trv1xv/meetup_no_2_introverts_of_sacramento_lets_do_it/)\n* [3/22 Big Stump Brewery](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/tjlyjm/meetup_introverts_of_sacramento_lets_do_this/) ([photo](https://imgur.com/a/NLDAwkl))",

        "content": "As the title states. This place is awful! We had a fire here September 2023 and as a result I was given the option to switch apartments or move out of the complex. Since I had not experienced any issues in the last 13 months I decided to switch apartments. On October 4th I moved into the new apartment and about two weeks later I caught a cold. Just a regular cold. But due to health conditions and a diagnosis of Common Variable Immune Deficiency - CVID this cold morphed into an upper respiratory and sinus infection. Reoccurring sinus infections are common with CVID so I thought nothing of it. I was out on several courses of antibiotics. They helped a little bit but never killed the infection. I just kinda sucked it up. I\u2019ve been sick for 34 of my 53 years of living. So being sick is \u201cnormal\u201d for me. Anyway\u2026 Fast forward to December. I noticed a water leak in the hall bathroom. I submitted a work order for it and it was marked as complete the same day without maintenance actually looking at it. Whatever. I did my due diligence. Fast forward again to May 24th 2024. The beginning of Memorial Day weekend. I stepped in a puddle of water in the same bathroom. I immediately called the leasing office but they were already closed. I left a message for the on call emergency maintenance. For 4 days no one contacted me. By the 5th day I reported it to the leasing office. Maintenance came the following day. They did the usual thing of ruling out the usual stuff; leaking toilet or sink. It was neither of those things. They put a dehumidifier in there, closed out the work order as completed and left it for about a day and a half. Friday I submitted a new request. Maintenance supervisor came up and said it was the toilet and it was fixed. I said BS! There\u2019s still water seeping through the floorboards. He fiddled with the toilet again. I told him it was coming from the bathtub. He shut that theory down. An argument ensued. I told him there was something going on in my apartment and whatever it is it\u2019s making me sick. Because it\u2019s now the end of May and I\u2019ve been sick for months and months. I saw my ENT doctor in March for a reoccurring sinus infection. He took a culture of my sinus mucus. It came back as \u201cheavy growth serratia marcescens\u201d. Otherwise known as pink mold or soap scum. IN MY SINUS CAVITY!! Sinus surgery was recommended. That Friday the maintenance supervisor placed an industrial size dehumidifier in the bathroom and said to keep it running until Monday. He closed the work order and marked it as complete. By Sunday I was dying. Not literally but it sure AF felt like it. Our bodies are made up of about 90% water. What does a dehumidifier do? It takes moisture out of the air! I had severe headaches, fatigue, light headedness and difficulty breathing. I turned the dehumidifier off. Monday morning I returned to the leasing office and created another work order. The maintenance supervisor returned and another argument ensued. He again said it was the toilet. I informed him that the leak was now spreading into the hallway. He said to keep the dehumidifier running. I basically told him to go fuck himself. I said this is an unlivable apartment and it\u2019s causing serious health issues. I told him I was prepared to file an insurance claim and go to a hotel. He then offered to put a blower in the bathroom. I agreed. He returned and began to rip up the laminate flooring. Guess what he found? I puddle of water coming from under the bathtub!!! \nThe following Monday I contacted CH code enforcement. An officer came out the same day. He cited the complex for mold, leaking water valve and to replace the drywall behind the shower. They have 30 days to comply. Later that week I hired a personal injury attorney and made appointments for a water detection company and a mold inspection company to come out and inspect my apartment. The water technician found water under the subfloor, the hallway and under the washing machine. The mold inspector found black mold, a lot of other fungi and high levels of toxicity in the air, HVAC system and ductwork. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?!?! The level of Penicillium/Aspergillus spores is 20,000!!! \n\nI\u2019m moving out today. I\u2019m breaking my lease by 2.5 months and I\u2019m positive I\u2019ll be fined and reported to collection agencies by the property management company. My immunologist and ENT doctors are working like crazy to order the correct tests to help my attorney win this case. Fuck JRK/Two Coast Living Property Management Company. \nI contacted KCRA yesterday hoping they\u2019ll do a segment on this. People need to be aware of these unsafe living conditions. ",

            "Ugghhh this place is something else. Luckily I never had any issues with my neighbors. The leasing agents turn a blind eye to everything. I\u2019ve been on great terms everyone here; leasing agents, assistant manager, maintenance staff. The assistant manager house sat for me when I was out of town. She did a crap job but we were friendly and I trusted her. I was on their good side. I found out from another leasing agent that the asst manager was in cahoots with the tow truck company. She would issue a notice to the tenants about expired tags, illegally parked cars etc and in 24hrs she would have the cars towed and got a kickback from the tow company. She would tell me personal information about other tenants and evictions, joke about purposely delaying deposit refunds. When I told her that I knew about her getting kickbacks, I became her best friend. She did everything and anything I needed. Maintenance staff would share with me how their key system worked, where they store keys, how their supervisor would tell them to fix major issues. People love talking to me. \n\nI understand that people need to work and make a living. But how can you willingly rent apartments to people in this condition and be ok with it?!? It\u2019s horrible. I showed them test results from doctors, mold and water reports and not surprisingly they stopped talking to me. That\u2019s fine. But if they get subpoenaed they\u2019ll have to come clean with what they know. I asked a leasing agent last week where her moral compass lies and she just smiled at me. I hope for her sake she\u2019s never in this position.",
            "Not if they didn\u2019t see the water as it sounds like it was leaking in the \u201csubfloor\u201d I\u2019m not in construction so I\u2019m not 100% certain what that is, but it sounds like it wouldn\u2019t be visible.",
            "I replied to your comment but I don\u2019t see it. I didn\u2019t see any water again until May. I have a 2bd/2ba unit and live alone. I never used that shower.",
            "I have one!!\n\nEdit to include: I have a personal injury attorney. Receiving any compensation is not important to me. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I would love to get reimbursed for everything. But my intentions are to bring this situation to the attention of people who will make a difference and to get out of my lease without it impacting my credit report or any other repercussions.",
            "Uggghhh your story is awful! I\u2019m so sorry. \n\nI used to be at the Montage. Terrible experience as well. My issue was with security. Had my car broken into a few times. And I had neighbors that would scream night and day at each other, and at their kids. Don\u2019t know if there was physical person to person abuse but there were instances of the adults breaking doors and windows in their rage. Called CPS cause the littlest there was around 7yrs old. Broke my heart. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019d try and call security, but the numbers listed online never worked. The number online would change and it either rang and rang, no answer or was disconnected. On the rare chance I did see them, they were generally smoking a blunt up by the front gate. Id call the supposed after hours line, and get a voicemail it would take 4 days to get a response to. I\u2019d email the front desk about not being able to find security. The response back was \u201cyeah, they should be answering their phone\u201d \n\nSo one night, it\u2019s pouring hard, thunder, lightening all that jazz. My neighbors start up again. Outside in between our doors. So I can\u2019t leave even if I want to. I hear the kid crying. I think they move inside but leave their front door open, I hear something break another window. \n\nDon\u2019t even bother to call security. Even if they answer, they can\u2019t do anything. I call the non emergency police line. They put it in as a noise disturbance. \n\nAbout 20 min later, security shows up, starts talking to the neighbor man. Security lets him know the cops are up at the front gate and he\u2019s \u201cholding them off for a few minutes, so he better get it together before they come.\u201d Security starts laying out his woes to the neighbor. \u201cLook man, the cops received multiple noise disturbances about your place. What the fuck dude, your stupid neighbors! Why the hell didn\u2019t they call me!? I could\u2019ve taken care of it. Your neighbors are little bitches man!\u201d \n\nIt took everything in me not to scream back I called the cops because he never answered his fucking phone. But obviously that wouldn\u2019t have helped anything, so I didn\u2019t. \n\nI went to the front desk the next day, and mentioned my experience, including what guard said. The response was \u201coh yeah that\u2019s not cool. we\u2019re in process of changing security companies.\u201d \n\nUgggh. Moved out not long after. \n\nStill think about that kid. Hope they\u2019re doing ok.",
