        "content": "Join **Introverts of Sacramento** for our **June meetup** at **Honey and the Trapcat** in Old Sacramento this **Friday June 28th at 6:30pm**! Come socialize with introverts, extroverts, and everyone in between at this crowd favorite, easygoing venue.\n\n**Honey and The Trapcat** ([Web](https://www.honeyandthetrapcat.com/))  ([Map](https://goo.gl/maps/w58gtXY1vXDtVrtH7))  ([IG](https://www.instagram.com/honeyandthetrapcat/))\n\n1023 Front St A, Sacramento, CA 95814\n\n* **Everyone is welcome!** This means extroverts too. The group title includes introverts to give them an extra push to attend. This is an open event and anyone of legal drinking age is encouraged to join us.\n* **Check back in this thread day-of for last minute updates, how to identify the group, etc.**\n* **Be nice and keep the mood fun.** We're all here to make friends. Make sure everyone is safe and welcomed.\n\n**About the group**\n\nFounded in 2022, Introverts of Sacramento has had more than two dozen successful meetups at various local businesses. It was founded to encourage introverts to socialize. It filled a need post-pandemic and will be sustained with your participation. New connections were made, drinks had, and good times abound.\n\n**About myself**\n\nThey call me Perkins, or at least most do. Ever since high school when they were one too many Michaels in the class. I do a double take whenever I get called by my first name. I joined the Introverts of Sacramento meetups at #3 and began organizing them at #5. I\u2019m an INTP through and through, which odd that I\u2019m organizing meetups, but I must enjoy it if I keep doing it (right?). At least enough to step out of my comfort zone, and I hope you do too. Because these events aren\u2019t for me, they\u2019re for you.\n\n**Past Meetups**\n\n**2024**\n\n* [5/11 Last Stop Saloon](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/1ck9lj9/introverts_of_sacramento_meetup_last_stop_saloon/) ([photos](https://imgur.com/a/8S7Sprh))\n* [4/26 Drake's: The Barn](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/1c9ljuw/introverts_of_sacramento_meetup_drakes_the_barn/) ([photos](https://imgur.com/a/MmoRDBt))\n* [3/15 At Ease Brewing Company](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/1b8347i/introverts_of_sacramento_meetup_at_ease_friday/) ([photos](https://imgur.com/a/PdgJyqS))\n* [2/23 Mattie Groves Brewery](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/1aseykl/introverts_of_sacramento_meetup_mattie_groves/) **(**[photos](https://imgur.com/a/0MzoZbA)**)**\n* [1/26 Honey and The Trapcat](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/19bgw03/introverts_of_sacramento_meetup_honey_and_the/) ([photos](https://imgur.com/a/MtmRXNy))\n\n**2023**\n\n* [12/22 Drake's: The Barn](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/18kx1f1/introverts_of_sacramentopit_meetup_drakes_the/) ([photos](https://imgur.com/a/GDFSfbO))\n* [12/16 Two Rivers Cider](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/18dejs6/introverts_of_sacramentoholiday_party_two_rivers/) ([photos](https://imgur.com/a/xmewJYm))\n* [11/12 The Jungle Bird](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/17q976b/introverts_of_sacramento_meetup_the_jungle_bird/) ([photos](https://imgur.com/a/QUUfBzh))\n* [10/13 Honey and the Trapcat](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/175o16b/introverts_of_sacramento_meetup_honey_and_the/) ([photos](https://imgur.com/a/S9tcc0g))\n* [9/22 Two Rivers Cider](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/16hviyp/introverts_of_sacramento_meetup_two_rivers_cider/) ([photos](https://imgur.com/a/mRv4syz))\n* [8/19 Drake's: The Barn](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/15pdrdl/introverts_of_sacramento_meetup_drakes_the_barn/) ([photos](https://imgur.com/a/8pm62JZ))\n* [7/29 Honey and The Trapcat](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/157htlg/introverts_of_sacramento_meetup_honey_and_the/) ([photo](https://preview.redd.it/qo61rvyg35fb1.jpeg?width=3796&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bdb453e3706696f74c2a93346ad8499d2fac0830))\n* [6/10 At Ease Brewing Company](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/141upcc/introverts_of_sacramento_meetup_at_ease_brewing/) ([photo](https://preview.redd.it/kq4f90olnb5b1.jpeg?width=946&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1856ddcdb6b926c6cbecda5ce75d2ea01f30d4dc))\n* [5/17 The Jungle Bird](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/13ew593/introverts_of_sacramento_meetup_the_jungle_bird/) ([photo](https://preview.redd.it/i1kljgvy7k0b1.jpeg?width=6048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e94e4688afc41161458e84368c59d429f6aa0858))\n* [4/15 Honey and The Trapcat](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/12f56yu/introverts_of_sacramento_meetup_no_11_honey_and/) ([photo](https://preview.redd.it/mknpjbl408ua1.jpeg?width=5378&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=14c0cfabaab457a0161be7a416e5db1938434d1f))\n* [2/25 Drake's: The Barn](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/117bdtp/introverts_of_sacramento_meetup_no_10_drakes_the/) ([photo](https://imgur.com/a/GEw2Isi))\n* [1/27 At Ease Brewing Company](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/10i5o8s/introverts_of_sacramento_meetup_no_9_at_ease/) ([photo](https://i.imgur.com/wOruWVt.jpg))\n\n**2022**\n\n* [12/17 Nitty's Cider](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/zfmv03/meetup_no_8_introverts_of_sacramento_nittys_cider/) ([photo](https://i.imgur.com/MuQDQpD.jpg))\n* [10/19 The Jungle Bird](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/y8jmix/meetup_no_7_introverts_of_sacramento_the_jungle/) ([photo](https://imgur.com/ZsTPR3A))\n* [9/12 Big Stump Brewery](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/xabo8m/meetup_no_6_introverts_of_sacramento_monday/) ([photo](https://imgur.com/WNvlAcR))\n* [8/9 Drake's: The Barn](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/wh2ijq/meetup_no_5_introverts_of_sacramento_tuesday/) ([photo](https://imgur.com/c7hSBc0))\n* [5/17 Drake's: The Barn](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/unmnqe/meetup_no_4_introverts_of_sacramento_tuesday_may/) ([photo](https://imgur.com/a/iUlCPs7))\n* [4/25 SacYard](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/u891gw/meetup_no_3_introverts_of_sacramento_we_love/) ([photo](https://imgur.com/a/L50TdL4))\n* [4/5 Lucid Winery](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/trv1xv/meetup_no_2_introverts_of_sacramento_lets_do_it/)\n* [3/22 Big Stump Brewery](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/tjlyjm/meetup_introverts_of_sacramento_lets_do_this/) ([photo](https://imgur.com/a/NLDAwkl))",

They said I had to buy some and they dont share theirs. Fair enough. So I bought some there. It was like $7. I use the 3 inches and i give the roll to the guy and I say please give this to any customer so other people don\u2019t have to pay. He was like \u201cyou\u2019re giving this for free?\u201d And I was like \u201cya, do you remember the give a penny, leave a penny trays at gas stations\u201d and he said \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of that\u201d \u201cI was like really? how old are you?\u201d This was all in a friendly rapport btw\n\nThis set him off. He started screaming \u201cI\u2019m 10, I\u2019m 10 for fucks sake\u201d\n\nI thought we were having a nice conversation until then. It was so weird. He just kept going on about how he\u2019s a \u201clittle kid\u201d clearly age is a touchy subject for this person\n\nAnyways he ran out of the main reception screaming and just left his post. It was insane\n\nThe other clerk took my package and carried on like nothing happened and then I turned to the people in line and asked everyone \u201cwhat the hell just happened?\u201d\n\nEvery one I line was like \u201cwhat the hell is wrong with that worker?\u201d\n\nAnother guy in line was like \u201cthat worker is a psychopath\u201d\n\nAnyways. That was wild, all because I wanted help strangers and give out free tape. In hindsight the worker did seem young. But I was asking his age genuinely curious, not in a condescending manner. \n\nJust crazy how literally the most mild interactions are becoming a 10 these days. That dude went postal ",
