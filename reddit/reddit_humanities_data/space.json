            "Will all US space ports be coast based or in the future when technology gets more stable that we will begin to do launches from more central US. \n\nI know we use the coast so we can shoot over the ocean to prevent debris damage but at the same time I feel when space based industries really take off we will want ports all over the US. \n\nBonus Question: what kind of safety standards do you think would be required for a launch from Nebraska or other central state.",
            "Is there a problem with space clickbait? \n\nI see a headline about how some nova explosion will soon light up Earth's skies. It's not really going to do that right? I see another article about how the sun caused a radio blackout. It was in on location and not all frequencies. \n\nI don't follow this stuff that often but when I do I'm often let down.",

But he's struggling to find copyright free videos and animations for making his videos. It'll be huge help if you guys could suggest some sites and also give any tips. The footage should be legit.",

I keep getting different answers online.\n\nAnother question, Is the milky way 100,000 light years across? How big is it around? I'm not sure how to phrase that last part circumference, perhaps.",

            "So, as I understand it. When we are looking into space at something, say, 100 light years away, you\u2019re seeing what that object looked like 100 years ago.\n\nAssume you have a Star Trek like vessel that can travel those distances fairly quickly.  As you\u2019re moving towards that object, would it be constantly changing in front of you?  As in, you\u2019ve made it 25 light years down the road, so you\u2019re now seeing what it looks like 75 years in the past?  Would it be like that object is constantly morphing to its current status as you continue to get closer?",

            "I wonder how much the astronauts secretly love the return delays. I\u2019d have to guess this could be the last visit to space/ISS for each of them and that it\u2019s hard to leave something you\u2019ve worked towards for so long.",
            "For those curious, [its probably worth listening to the NASA teleconference on Starliner's status from a few days ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TXDedBlyBI) They go into *alot* of detail about what they've been doing and the issues they've been encountering.\n\nSome interesting details which I dont see mentioned : \n\n- 5 thrusters failed, but only 1 has completely failed (it dropped from 11% to 0% thrust previously). All of the failed thrusters were aft thrusters. They've been testing the 4 other previously faulty ones (skipping the one which failed completely) and 3 which looked fine. Recent tests seem to show that all these are pretty nominal. They have some theories such as potential issues with fuel/oxidizer mixing caused by rapid thruster firing, but who knows at this point\n\n- the helium leaks seem have decreased with the lack of thruster activity, as they've noticed that they have been lessening over time while docked.\n\n- a RCS prop isolation valve was not closing properly, but they have a backup valve which has taken over. They specifically mention this is not the same as the issue with the previous valve failures on OFT-2",
            "Not exactly a clear headline, article says it will return sometime in July. \n\nOther quote of note from article as this delay isn't just to read data\n\n\"The NASA update did not provide any information about deliberations during these meetings, but it is clear that the agency's leaders were not able to get comfortable with all contingencies that Wilmore and Williams might encounter during a return flight to Earth, including safely undocking from the space station, maneuvering away, performing a de-orbit burn, separating the crew capsule from the service module, and then flying through the planet's atmosphere before landing under parachutes in a New Mexico desert.\"",
            "Since they got to the ISS, I don't think pushing the return date out significantly increases the risk, and it significantly increases the chances that they figure out what is causing the leaks and any thruster issues.",
            "I really want to see Spacex send up a Dragon to the ISS with UBER painted on it.",
            "Ah, the good old \"late Friday bad news dump\", favorite of politicians and organizations that are obligated to make a statement but want to make sure that it takes place when the smallest number of people may be following the news.  \n\nI can't say that this is a confidence-booster.",
            "The statements coming from NASA/Boeing before today reeked of that bureaucratese one reads so often when corporations and government departments attempt to downplay problems. It seems to be reaching the point where the difficulties can no longer be deflected.",
            "Must have been a real hard decision to make but this is the right call.",
            "And this is why we do a (successful) dry run before we actually strap people into these things. \n\nSeriously I still can\u2019t believe they did that",

It\u2019s a lot harder than people believe and there are a lot of variables like it coming from a blind spot, collision with other space debris changing the trajectory, human error, resources, preparation, time/distance, etc. and there\u2019s also the possibility of it breaking into several pieces creating multiple asteroids that could be catastrophic.",
