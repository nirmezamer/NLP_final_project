            "So I just recently heard this, and thought I would read about it, and I want to inquire why this is theorized or offered by Google, since I am not actually an astrophysicist or other space expert.\n\nFrom the front of Google:  \nIs the moon drifting away from Earth? - \"But it is moving away from us and it's actually changing our understanding of how our own planet interacts with it, affecting things like the length of days in Earth. Scientists say the Moon is slowly moving away from Earth, 3.82 centimeters per year.\"  \nWhat will happen to Earth? - \"We'll have fewer aquatic tides, a lengthening day, no more seasons, and no more stunning total solar eclipses. But watch out for more asteroid impacts. The moon is Earth's only friend. And yet\u2014despite a relationship stretching back billions of years\u2014the gap between us only grows wider.\"  \nCan we survive without the Moon? - \"Life as we know it wouldn't be able to survive. If the moon disappeared, the length of a day on Earth would become much shorter. It would be between six and twelve hours. When the moon orbits, it exerts a pull on Earth, slowing down its rate of spin by about 2 milliseconds every hundred years, slowly lengthening a day.\"\n\nNow-- first off, I feel like 3 contradicts 2, in saying that-- if there was no Moon the day would be much shorter (where two says it would be longer)\n\nThe way I understand it without Google is this:\n\nThe length of day/night is determined by the planet's time of orbit around the host star compared to the planet's axial rotation and distance from the star. This should change little if there was no Moon, as that would not have that much effect on either the Earth's orbit time or distance from the Sun. Thus the day would not significantly be shorter or longer, it may fluctuate a little without the magnetic counterweight of the Moon.\n\nWeather is partially determined by axial inclination. Mercury for example, is a nearly perfectly vertical planet, and so would not experience seasonal change or weather patterns, if it were able to. Venus is a nearly perfectly vertical \"upside down\" planet, and so also would not experience seasonal change or weather patterns, if it were able to. The Earth is not, it is 21-23 degrees inclined, and this affects things like having solstice and the switch of seasons, and weather patterns. The Moon leaving would affect weather patterns, and might drag out or shorten seasons, due to the disappearance of tidal effect on Earth, but it could not stop weather or seasons from occurring completely.\n\nThe Moon's \"Gravity\" or magnetic field is insignificant compared to the Earth, because the Moon has nearly no surface pressure or atmosphere, and the Moon's overall mass, probably the biggest factor of magnetic strength, is 1% of the Earth's. If you look at time lapse recordings taken by Nasa and other space centers, the Moon actually moves very little outside its orbit, its own axial rotation is very slow and hardly noticeable from Earth, and the Moon more wobbles back and forth in place with the Earth's magnetic fluctuation, and is held in its orbit by the Earth's magnetic field. This is perhaps the same principle that is utilized to keep the ISS and other local satellites held in place. Yes, the weakening or degradation of the Earth's magnetic field would loosen its hold on the Moon, causing it to speed up and drift away, but the likely causes of this has little to do with the Moon itself.\n\nAt the rate of 3-4cm/year, it would possibly take 5+ billion years before the Moon is fully independent of Earth, and we would be more likely to see the Sun go nova by that amount of time, or possibly see the collision of Andromeda Galaxy with the Milky Way by then.\n\nFeel free to give explanation if any of my observations is false.",

            "A Dyson Sphere - by definition - encompasses a star. So, no, you're not building this 'on Earth'.\n\nThe mass requirements would be pretty big and would largely depend on how thick you want the shell to be. A lower bound I've seen being thrown around would be 10 Earth masses, but that still assumes some very exotic stabilization methods of the entire structure.\n\nThat said: There's no real point in building one. If you are that far advanced that you *could* build one then you're at a state where you don't *need* to build one.",
            "With some simple math, if we were to build a Dyson Sphere that fully encompasses the Sun and very near to it, and were able to construct 1,000 square kilometers per year of the sphere, it would take us roughly 6-7 billion years.\u00a0 (6.09x10^13 km/1,000).\u00a0 10,000 km^2 would be 600 million years, 100,000 km^2 would be 60 million, etc.\u00a0 If we were able to build enough to cover the surface area of the earth every year, it would take roughly 10,000 years.\u00a0 \u00a0And all of this is assuming a Dyson Sphere very smart to the Sun's surface.\u00a0 Assuming it was at all a distance from the surface, we start going exponential on the time and area.\n\n\nWhich is probably why a Dyson Sphere is utterly impractical and pointless.\u00a0 Its an absurdist concept.",
            "It would take quite a many years, as the Earth does not have the tech to do that efficiently yet. The idea of Dyson Sphere Project was first proposed in the 1960s if I recall. A Dyson Sphere is built around the host star, in this case the Sun, and absorbs the energy of the sun to convert to electric generation that is transferred back to Earth or wherever.\n\nIt would also currently be pretty much impossible and egregiously expensive to make, because the Earth has no alloy that is capable of withstanding such close range to the Sun's heat or plasma flares indefinitely yet. Thats the first issue even if there was the ability to construct or deploy satellites and the Dyson shell close to the Sun.",

            "Good question. I guess we'll have to wait and see. As we see with airplanes they have the capacity to land on populated areas and do great damage, but they are still allowed to fly around over stuff because they have such a good track record of safety. And also to some degree because catastrophic failures of airplanes which result in a loss of control are uncommon.\n\nIf launch vehicles progress to a point of reusability and reliability where uncontrolled flight is the extreme exception then we might end up seeing launch facilities all over the place just as we see airports.",

            "Often they are trying to use designs or even parts from more than 3 decades ago. (It's to preserve their \"testing heritage\".)\n\nA lot of folks who worked on these things have retired. And some of this stuff is extremely late-20th-century state-of-the-art engineering, very difficult stuff. The RS-25 engine is an amazing engineering feat. \n\nAnd then there's the whole conversation about fixed-price vs. cost-plus contracting, which I won't go into detail, here. Orion and the SLS rocket are cost-plus contracts, which in this case have resulted in ballooning budgets, ever-extending schedules, and a lot of criticism in general.",
            "The goal is *spending money,* not launching missions to the Moon. Moon missions are just what they're spending the money *on.* With that perspective, the program makes perfect sense and is a tremendous success: keeping legacy program suppliers and engineers gainfully employed and contracted for the length of their remaining careers.\n\nThe Orion capsule (holdover from Ares) took time to develop; it is an underpowered rocket (relative to Saturn V) necessitating a different lunar orbit than Apollo, and the lander is aiming for the pole and not the equator, so they are building a lunar space station too.\n\nIt's a very good question and I hope you get good answers from others who can explain in detail why 'shuttle-derived' was not easier, faster and cheaper than an altogether new design. (Aside from the key point, which is to spend money, not to launch rockets.)",
            "Indeed, the SLS was sold as a way to get to a heavy lift launch vehicle that would be faster and cheaper because it made use of existing Shuttle hardware and designs.\n\nSo on the one hand, good news, the SLS was able to make use of substantial chunks of existing Shuttle technology. The main engines are just off the shelf (with options to make lower cost expendable versions later), the SRBs used the same SRB tech as the Shuttle but added an additional segment. The main fuselage and tankage could be based on the existing Shuttle External Tanks. The first upper stage would just use an off the shelf upper stage from the Delta IV. And so on.\n\nBut on the other hand, bad news. The SLS has been built by some of the least cost and schedule efficient folks in the history of aerospace. So as we've seen the SLS program has gobbled up over 20 billion in funding (enough for 10 Shuttle launches, enough for 200 Falcon Heavy launches) over nearly two decades of development just to arrive at where we are today with one and only one successful launch so far, with the second launch (of all time) not planned until next year at the earliest. This is why \"Old Space\" has a bad name.",
            "A nuclei would tunnel/teleport to extreme close proximity of another and they would fuse together by cold fusion, crating an heavier element.

            "No, it would mostly behave like a liquid.\n\nThe impact would be large enough to go through the earth\u2019s crust like butter. Anything not flung into space would be melted, the entire planet and crust would melt and much most of it would be flung into space, where it would vaporize or coagulate into small mostly grains. There would still probably be a big molten blob where the planet was but much of the mass would be in a vapor cloud around the planet, some on an escape velocity, some not.\n\nThey would reform over time due to gravity, not necessarily into a single object, such as what happened with the big impact that created our moon.",

            "In the past decades, researchers have used the world's strongest supercomputers to simulate millions, perhaps now billions of events of the Earth being struck by a planetary sized object at various angles and speeds, for the purpose of seeing if this is how the Moon came to be.\n\nYou can now look up many of these sims of a theoretical Earth being struck online, to get an idea of what would occur.\n\nIn the theoretical simulation of the creation of the Moon, in most cases the Earth survives the impact and the colliding object is obliterated on impact. Thus for it to destroy the Earth completely, or shove it out of its orbit, which is more likely, it would have to be a planetary object of larger mass than this one being simulated.",

            "No, the redshift from a stellar mass black hole is not significant enough to measure. But it would cause [gravitational lensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens).\n\nWe have searched really hard to find black holes like this, because they if they are common it would solve the dark matter problem. Unfortunately they are very rare.",
            "Whyt do you mean by 'significant'? That's a very qualitative word. Gravitational redshift/time dilation has an effect as soon as any mass (or better: energy density) is present.

For example, at the big bang, all the matter you see today didn't even exist.  It was in the form of vacuum energy.  It's theorized the vacuum energy spontaneously decayed to a lower state and all the extra energy was converted into matter at that time.  This is what we call the big bang.   So none of the matter had even existed before this event.  It was just energy in empty space, contained in quantum fields.  If you are thinking this sounds weird and impossible then you should learn that all matter is in fact quantum fields that are excited in certain ways.  Also Einstein proved E=mc^2 so it's entirely possible to obtain mass from energy directly and we think this happens constantly in the vacuum even today.  Particles blink into and out of existence continuously in the vacuum even today.  They are called virtual particles.

            "It would simply cause differential absorption, it wouldn't shift the whole spectrum.\n\nThere are different ways to estimate the redshift of a distant galaxy. One technique is to look at the overall light across different narrowband filters and find where the light drops off. This makes it possible to determine where the \"Lyman break\" has been shifted, which is the line where the light from the galaxy drops off dramatically. You can then figure out the observational wavelength range where the Lyman break appears to lie and use that to calculate the redshift of the galaxy. Potentially, one could argue that various effects like \"weird dust\" could absorb light at cosmological distances and cause a false Lyman break effect that made a galaxy look more redshifted than it was.\n\nHowever, the other major technique for determining redshift is by taking very detailed spectra of distant galaxies and looking for atomic emission spectral lines. Those spectral lines are fixed by quantum mechanics to originate at certain wavelengths, and their arrangement is very distinctive, like a set of fingerprints. Today we have a plethora of instruments which make it possible to collect sufficiently detailed spectra of distant galaxies to determine their redshift very precisely with a significant degree of confidence that the only factor at play is a full on spectral shift of original wavelengths to observed wavelengths. This pretty conclusively rules out the potential for \"red dust\" to simply be absorbing shorter wavelength light. One example being the galaxy [GN-z11](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2023/09/aa46159-23/aa46159-23.html) which has had detailed spectra taken allowing us to determine its redshift at z = 10.6034 +/- 0.0013, which as you can see is a very high level of precision.",

The presence of LOX can definitely make for a more prompt deflagration explosion (generally it won't be a proper detonation though) but these are more quantitative vs. qualitative differences. A jet liner crashing into a populated area can still kill thousands and cause billions in damages. The reason jet liners are allowed to fly over populated areas is because there's a huge system of training and certification of pilots and aircraft and a long track record of safety, not because it's impossible for them to crash and kill thousands while doing billions in damage. If rockets could match that track record they would likely be allowed to fly over/near populated areas too.\n\nRealistically the biggest constraint on where orbital rockets will be allowed to fly will come from acoustics, launches are extremely loud, and rockets traverse the sound barrier on liftoff and more important on landing, so figuring out reasonable corridors where that can occur would be important.",

Less gas being forced out equals slower leak.\n\nIn fact, yes: https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/leak-rate\n\nL=\u2212V * (dP/dt)\n\nwhere L is the leak rate (Pa m3/s), P is the pressure (Pa), V is the volume of vessel (m3), and t is the time (s). \n\nLeak rate depends on the difference between the vessel pressure and atmospheric pressure, this should be specified when quoting leak rates.\n\n*Unless it is liquefied helium in which case boil off would keep the pressure roughly constant until it all evaporates.

The radius of the Earth's solid core grows by ~1 mm/year = 1 meter/millennium = 1 km/million years.\n\nThe liquid core is ~2200 km thick.  At the current rate it will solidify in 2.2 billion years, long before the Sun becomes a red giant.  \n\nHowever, due to the gradually increasing luminosity of the Sun (~1%/100 Myr), the oceans will have boiled away long before the core solidifies.",

The electromagnetic forces resulting from the dynamo, similar to a motor, drive the inner core to spin slightly faster than the outer core (and the overlying mantle). However, the gravity of the mantle tugging on the inner core can slow it back down, driving it to instead rotate slightly slower than the outer core. This speeding up and slowing down appears to occur over a multi-decadal cycle, of which we happen to be in the slowing down leg.\n\nThe only practical effect is minute changes to the length of day on the order of milliseconds, which can add minor complications to ultra-precise timekeeping.",

            "This is why I genuinely believe we should've kept development on nuclear weapons. It took less than 20 years from the first bomb dropped on Japan that leveled a city, to the Soviet Unions Tsar Bomba, that exploded with a force 3600x more powerful than little boy. It was 10x more powerful than every last munition combined used in WW2, in less than just 20 years. If we had kept development I'm insanely confident we'd have a bomb so unimaginably powerful, it would actually become useful. Such as...... Destroying impossibly large objects threatening earth. I'm talking 1000 + MEGA ton nuclear warheads capable of literally evaporating impossibly large celestial bodies. There is NO known upper limit for possible power of a fusion bomb. We could've been well on our way to a bomb capable of cracking a planet in two. It's scary, but at that size it could prove to be immensely useful the one or two times we'd need such destructive power, mostly for something off earth (obviously). Just 50 megatons produced an explosion the shockwave of which circled the earth three times over. The light produced could be seen from over 600 miles away. Is this a dumb idea? Yea probably. But if we ever have a massive celestial body on collision course with earth, I bet we'd all wish we had such a capability as a species.",

That's the American way, and thank fuck it is because we're most capable of doing something about it. I don't know if that's as much of a logistical or internally political nightmare as you'd think.",

I find it hard to envision scientists backing down from a loose-bolt World-leader that wants to do it differently considering how many other scientists agree and the fact that the whole world is at risk.\n\nFor a smaller impact I could see it happening, but for an extinction-level event, the scientists are saving their own lives and families, where it's much harder to say \"fine, I'll do it your way, I don't care\".",

Blowing it up a few hours before it hits isn\u2019t going to do any good, the same amount of energy is still coming at you just in smaller, slightly more radioactive pieces. You need to just hit it with mass to alter the orbit, and the earlier you do that the less energy you need. The critical factor is and always will be time.",

What if doing so would cost billions in taxpayer dollars? \n\nAlso, outside Hollywood, nukes aren't likely to be that useful in moving an asteroid.

With the relative mass difference of the asteroid and the falcon 9 you would need to speed the falcon 9 up to something like 10% the speed of light before it has enough energy to push a asteroid out of its path in a week.\n\nCoincidentally, a falcon second stage impacting the asteroid at 10% the speed of light releases about the same amount of energy as ten thousand 1 Megaton yield nukes. So even if we unleashed the nuclear arsenal of the entire world it would still not work out for us. We would maybe have had enough nukes at the height of the cold war, not that there is any chance of us deploying them like that.

            "Personally, I'm more amazed by Spirit & Oppy than the more advanced Curiosity & Persy. I mean, the two big rovers are really cool, do a lot of science and are objectively better in every way, but the two little ones were true pathfinders in my book.\n\nFirst, they showed that you can use air-bags to cushion the landing on Mars. That's a cheaper and simpler method from an engineering perspective, and can potentially be used with a lot of stuff down the line. If Spirit & Oppy survived that, most likely other things that will be required for humans on Mars will too - food, supplies, medicine, tools, etc. They can all be \"tossed\" around and picked up later. \n\nThen there was the resilience of the things, and the fact that the solar panels worked. And that they were \"self cleaning\" if properly setup. That was another major find on Mars. The fact that they lasted so so much past their projected mission life (even accounting for nasa budget shenanigans) was really awesome and a testament to the engineering teams. I'll add here that Ingenuity also proved that CotS can also work for complex missions, and the need for over-engineered, decades old \"space hardened\" hardware is probably a bit overstated. \n\nWhat I'd like to see is NASA focusing more on simpler and CotS - based, \"cheap\" missions where success constrains are relaxed a bit. Cost of upmass to LEO has shrunk, and will continue to do so. If they would create a simple rover \"bus\", where they provide rough guidelines, launch, TMI & edl, and comms along the way, a lot of innovation in that space could take place. There are plenty of universities that could probably fund a \"mars rover\" team in a \"competition\" style series of missions. Have the MIT vs. Caltech rovers, and so on. Hell, even an Uber vs. Waymo competition could be fun. Use commercial hardware mostly, and go for quantity over space-proof. Have them incorporate all the last decade advances in self driving, decision making, and so on. I bet the amount of stuff we'd learn would surpass even the highly advanced big rover findings.",

This is something we're finding to be a more and more common situation, seemingly, with perhaps a lot more locations existing in our own solar system than we had thought. Another factor is the origin *or introduction* of life. What are the ingredients necessary to really kick off life. We used to think that habitability included this naturally, but it seems reasonably likely that's not the case. Some things we know are actually not as rare as we once thought, such as the molecular \"building blocks\" of life like sugars, nucleobases, amino acids, etc, but the conditions necessary to concentrate them, separate them, keep them in abundance in the right ways to kick-start life may be a bit rarer. We also don't know how common it is for life originating on one planet to seed life on another. On paper it's possible, micro-organisms can sometimes endure long stretches of exposure to vacuum and planetary bodies end up exchanging rocks fairly regularly via large impact events. But that doesn't tell us whether it's so common that it happens regularly in planetary systems or whether it's rarer than winning the lottery.\n\nThen you have the factor of biosphere robustness and longevity. On Earth we've had multiple billions of unbroken history of a biosphere that has stood the test of time, bounced back from apocalypse after apocalypse, that probably will endure until the oceans are boiled off the face of the planet and maybe even for a little bit after that. But is that the rule or the exception? Maybe there are lots of trees of life that are more like bushes, that maybe are so precarious they don't even make it to the enclosed cell stage before succumbing to environmental change or what-have-you. Maybe there are biospheres with multiple histories, where life arises, chugs along for a few hundred million years, and then passes, then a new strain of life crops up and charts a new history of life that continues for a while until geological change chokes off its energy source or something.\n\nWe only have the one example to go on so far, we don't really know what's common and what's possible, at least not yet.",

            "We've known about water ice on Mars for ages, the story has just changed over time.\n\nWe've known that the polar caps on Mars are water ice for quite a while, and we observed frost on Mars during the Viking lander missions in the 1970s. We've also been able to identify features on Mars that were formed by liquid water in the distant past since the Mariner 9 mission.\n\nOver time the story of Martian water has been one of finding more of it, more evidence of it, more evidence of large amounts of liquid water in the past, and more if it in more places. In the '90s we found that there is sub-surface water ice under much of Mars, at depths that vary by latitude, with significant amounts of shallow sub-surface permafrost even at mid-latitudes. Since then we've identified more water formed features on Mars, we've found sub-surface glaciers all over Mars, and we've found evidence of long-lived liquid water in the past on Mars. Long enough not just to form features like lake beds, ocean shores, river deltas, and so on, but long enough to form specific minerals. Probably indicating periods of at least millions of years where liquid water existed in some places on Mars.\n\nVery much the present state of Mars looks a lot like a planet that used to be covered in water and then a lot of it froze out and the parts that ended up exposed to the surface away from the poles ended up slowly subliming into the atmosphere and then getting lost to space along with a denser atmosphere in the past. From deuterium enrichment levels in the Mars polar caps it seems likely that at one point Mars had proper oceans of water, at least for a time.",

Who is prepared to spend billions of dollars to find out quickly? What if it's determined that there's an extrasolar object (like Ouamuamua) coming in fast perpendicular to the Earth's orbital plane, a 90% chance it's a 2x Tunguska-sized impactor (so 250-300 ft wide, a Tsar Bomba-sized impact, as opposed to a 10% chance of a 600 ft impactor, which would wipe out some smaller states), a 75% chance it's a near miss, a 80% chance it'll land in the ocean, and a 10% chance it lands in the uninhabited Sahara, a 1% chance it lands in a relatively uninhabited area of Saudi Arabia with a casualty rate under 10,000, and a 0.02% chance it lands in the suburbs of Mumbai and could kill 10 million? How many tens of billions are we willing to spend to fast-track determination of the threat and development of multiple redundant waves of nuclear-tipped impactors? What if it's a now-or-never situation in which we have to make a move within 3 months, before we figure out, in order to stand a chance of getting there fast enough to make a difference? \n\nI don't see anybody mentioning that the best asteroid defense is investing $50 or $100 billion in a planetary defense monitoring network of telescopes and satellites. Why aren't we paying for that now, on the 1 in a million chance it'll save us from an extinction-level event in 30 years? Is it a no-brainer to spend a small country's GDP to decrease our asteroid extinction risk by a few more orders of magnitude to a 1 in a billion chance? It sure as hell would be if we find one, but if we don't, after a few years someone's gonna come after NASAs budget and a few years of finding nothing will mean some administrator will be comfortable slashing the U.S.'s $400 million a year contribution in half in order to redirect funding to Boeing to save 150 jobs in a congressional district so that the representative in charge of the committee that sets funding priorities will play nice with the admin's pet projects?",

Even Oumuamua caught us unaware when it flew through the solar system. Even Bernardinelli-Bernstein, the largest comet ever discovered, went undetected - it was captured in surveys of TNOs but wasn't picked up until Bernardinelli-Bernstein went looking through the data for something else and found the comet. It won't come close to the Earth, passing just beyond Saturn's orbit, but if it were a threat to us, the impact would be more powerful than the one that struck Earth during the age of the dinosaurs. \n\nOur ability to nudge asteroids or comets is dependent on identifying them early (for now), which, given the size of space, isn't an easy feat.",

            "To hell with you! I will look up... this movie...",
            "That would depend on the size and relative speed of the asteroid, a building sized asteroid travelling at near relativistic speed would be near impossible to detect in advance and it would wreck Earth.",
            "As per above, it can not be kept a secret as millions of citizen astronomers or independent astronomers are staring at the skies on a daily basis.\n\nIt's probably way better (less chaos) for the news to be announced officially than for posts on Reddit, FB, X etc to be the platforms breaking and feeding the news - that's when you'll likely have total pandemonium.",

To get a slingshot effect that is different from the usual flyby slingshots.\n\nIf you are burning fuel then you should be able to exceed the 42 km/s flyby max but that's the ballpark you are looking at.\n\nEdit: I just noticed someone else said the Parker probe reached 191km/s by doing flyby's of Venus which doesn't make sense to me but google/nasa seem to confirm it's velocity so uh, guess I'm wrong?\n\nDouble edit: ok I think I figured it out. The escape velocity to leave the solar system when you are already at earth's distance from the sun is 42km/s because you are already most of the way out of the gravity well.\n\nThe escape velocity to leave the solar system if you are at the surface of the sun is 611km/s.",

We don't have the tech for a self-supporting antarctic base, where at least the snowflakes won't give you mesothelioma or grind every actuator apart. This stuff isn't just solved by mass, otherwise, again, Antarctica would be easy.\n\nThere's still no economic reason to go to the moon. Folks talk about He3, but we still don't have an actual commercial use for it. Most elements on the moon are trivially found on the earth, and all modern manufacturing requires enormous supply chains and intracacies in each step to work. Refining regolith into a worthwhile aluminum alloy is a beyond enormous undertaking in the first place.\n\nIt would be a million times easier to become a subterranean civilization to survive a planet killing meteor than going it alone on the moon or Mars.\n\nMost science done on the ISS is pretty mid tier. It's an important tool, and is letting us do worthwhile studies, but a lot of it is just filling space and time.\n\nMost planetary science missions are way, way, way harder than people think. The uncertainty is enormous, and that leads to lots of margin in designs. I was part of a study for comet sampling tools prior to our first landing on one, and the description of the surface was \"somewhere between the freshest fluffy dry snow you've ever felt and concrete.\" How do you design a sampling and caching system for that when it has to be done fully autonomously with processors from the mid 90s?\n\nI say all these as someone who does both ISRU",

The thought of engineers designing habitats for Mars or the Moon, combined with the scientific discoveries we could make, is absolutely thrilling.\n\nWhat about you? What aspect of the future of space exploration excites you the most? Is it the engineering challenges, the scientific discoveries, or the possibility of becoming a multi-planetary species?

            "While boots on the ground is the quintessence of exploration (Dave Scott said as much when he stepped onto the moon on Apollo 15), I'm doubtful that stuff will happen any time soon, so for now, I'm excited to get more science and exploration of the outer gas giant moons, viz. Titan, Enceladus, Io, etc.\n\nSecond to that, more drones on atmospheric planets and moons (like Ingenuity did for Mars). While rovers are great as a \"home base,\" being able to send off a handful of drones to take BEV pics and do hi-res mapping will be incredible to see.",

            ">What about you? What aspect of the future of space exploration excites you the most? Is it the engineering challenges, the scientific discoveries, or the possibility of becoming a multi-planetary species?\n\nOh where do I start?! \n\nThe top thing I'm excited about is the Starship landing on Mars (I can already imagine the naysayers' comments). \n\nIn order to do this, however, the Starship will have to progress through test flights and resolve some issues. I'm really looking forward to seeing how the next test flights go (IFT-5 mid/late July!!!). Realistically, I feel that a manned Mars landing will happen sometime in 2032, at the earliest before 2030 if all goes well.\n\nThen the next thing I'm crazy about is the completion of the Gateway Station (first space station in orbit around the moon). The first modules will be launched in 2025 and the station will open somewhere towards the end of 2028.\n\nThen Artemis 3 (which will land people on the Moon in late 2026 if all goes well) and of course Artemis 2 which will happen in late 2025 and will be a manned flyby to the Moon (first time since 1972)\n\nI'm also crazy about the Dragonfly drone that will explore Titan (it will fly and explore areas on Titan for about 3 years, mostly for astrobiological research). It will launch in 2026 and reach Titan sometime in 2034. It will also have cameras, so imagine what it will be like when we have clear pictures of Titan's surface and lakes. Also Saturn appears in Titan's sky almost 11 times larger than the moon appears in our sky. The photos will be incredible, and the research value that the drone will offer is immeasurable.\n\nAlso the Europa Clipper. It will study Europa's subsurface ocean and its geology, chemical composition and help us find a landing site for a future rover. It will reach Europa sometime in 2030 and launch this year.\n\nOne more thing is NASA's EELS. A robot snake that will dig into the ice of Enceladus and study its ocean for signs of life.\n\nI also look forward to the construction of Lockheed Martin's \"Deep Space Transport\" or, \"Mars Base Camp\". ESA took over the DSP concepts this year, so I'm really looking forward to hearing if the project will eventually move to the construction stage.\n\nI think I said what I wanted to say. I'm really looking forward to what projects will surface in the next few years.",
            "This is probably very modest compared to what others are excited about, but I work as a commercial copilot, and wish I live to see commercial space and suborbital flights, like we take off from North Africa and reach apogee 20 minutes later and land 30 mins later on the opposite side of the world. \n\nIt would be really cool with breathtaking views on every flight",

My interest had started to fade and then I saw the first Falcon 9 landing. Finally! Someone was being bold and striking out in new directions, taking big risks. Following the path off innovation and risks SpaceX is taking is very exciting and I'm looking forward very much to the first landing of the Starship HLS. That thing is thrilling to contemplate  - I can't wait to see the interior of the crew quarters. It'll be on multiple levels, just like in the old sci fi movies I saw on Saturday afternoons when I was a kid. That was a future I wanted to believe in, a future that inspired me and was an anodyne to the daily news of the Vietnam War and the grim civil unrest over it, as well as the Cold War.\n\nI'm glad you find space exploration inspiring. Your generation worries about how f'd up the world is, and in many ways it is. On the other hand, my generation of kids had to worry about nuclear war being an immediate possibility. Every generation has its problems to face but space exploration is a place for inspiration and aspiration.\n\nI look forward to a modest Moon base by 2035, although I don't expect it to be permanently occupied by then.

The large payload numbers and reusability lend to a sustainable architecture that can help NASA do whatever science they need without breaking the bank.

Once you do that the only two parameters that are influenced by the choice of material are the ration Z/A and the logarithm of the inverse of the average excitation energy, and both parameters are higher for light elements. The reason is intuitive: electron interactions is the main way the charged particles lose energy in matter and you want as many electrons per unit mass as you can. With heavy elements for every electron you are carrying more than one neutron and those are dead weight, while you have at most one for light nuclei (or zero for hydrogen). Likewise, in heavy elements you have a lot of electrons wasted since they are in deep orbitals with very low probability of interaction.",

The political sustainability aspect could be accomodated better by focusing more, and sooner, on a surface base. As they aren't required for it, the Gateway doesn't provide any staying power for the landers and surface base--just SLS and Orion, which Congress hasn't needed an external excuse (or even a mission or destination) to pour money into. Who's waiting to prove anything out? NASA is even planning on sending crew around the Moon witbout first priving Orion's heat shield and life support work. Then Artemis IV subs in an all new SLS upper stage on a crewed landing mission. On the surface operations side, JAXA and Toyota are currently (albeit slowly) working on a large pressurized rover that is intended to function as a very small mobile base. It would be nice if instead of the Gateway, NASA, ESA, Thales, etc. were focusing more on stationary surface habs and infrastructure.\n\nWe can do remote research on the Moon from Earth (Surveyors, Lunokhod, Chang'e--and CLPS and VIPER.), and with a relay satellite (or 2-3) for the poles and far side (Chang'e 6). But if that can accomplish everything as well as boots on the ground (it can't), then why send crew anywhere in space? Besides, the Gateway will be in an orbit that never takes it closer than 3000 km from the surface, and will spend most of the times tens of thousands of kilometers above the surface. When it does swing close, it will be quickly passing over the north pole, instead of the more interesting south pole targeted by Artemis.\n\nEven if we take the supposed benefits of having a space station in \"lunar\" orbit (i.e., NRHO) at face value, the Gateway will be a very poor implementation.\n\n>Gateway is also designed to be a long lasting station around the moon that can go long periods being uncrewed and can support crews for months at a time. \n\nThat sounds like the PR department's punched up version of reality: The Gateway will be unoccupied the vast majority of the time. *Eventually* NASA hopes to have annual missions lasting up to 3 months, because SLS and Orion (the other limitations of which are the *rai\u00b7son d'\u00ea\u00b7tre* for the Gateway) are too expensive and slow to build for a faster mission cadence. The Gateway exists because SLS and Orion were created without a purpose, so NASA had to some up with something they could do. Only, there was no lander, Orion can only support crew in free flight for about 3 weeks, and it doesn't have the delta v to enter and return from low lunar orbit or visit a NEO. So the (Lunar Orbiting Platform-)Gateway was created, and with Artemis is still \"necessary\" for surface missions longer than a week because we are still stuck with SLS/Orion. (And Orion can't be left uncrewed and in free flight--for... reasons? Never mind Artemis I, or the fact that from Artemis IV on the HLS is required to be capable of landing all 4 crew.)\n\nThe Gateway will also be extremely cramped, with very little habitable volume. It won't be ISS sized, or even Mir sized. The plan is to reach a pressurized volume of 125 m^(3), or 1/2 that of of Mir, and 1/8 that if the ISS. Habitable volume will, of course, be even more limited. \n\n>[\"The International Habitation [I-Hab] module will have habitable space of about 8 cubic meters [280 cubic feet] and you will have to share it with three others.\" [...] \"There are other rooms but they are not bigger and there are not many of them.\"](https://www.space.com/lunar-gateway-station-claustrophobic-architect-says)\n\nAnd based on the GAO report released yesterday, the I-Hab won't exactly be getting any bigger.

            "OK, well, when I see a Starship launch, orbit, return the booster and starship to earth, and rapidly evaluate, refurbish and launch again the same week, then I'll reassess. \n\nUntil then, it's science fiction.  \n\nSame for orbital refueling.",
            "A failure by what metrics?",
            "Lmao can really tell who doesn\u2019t have education in this field when you say things like that",
            "NASA could launch a Commercial Crew for Gateway if policy allowed, but this would effectively be the funeral of SLS/Orion, which is not possible right now",
            "Pure Civilians never had a chance to goto space during Apollo! This is just a historic fact. All the astronauts were highly qualified air force test pilots or other military affiliated backgrounds with security clearances etc. Some of the later astronauts did include civilian members but they were scientists with advanced degrees carefully selected and trained for the missions. I think the only pure civilian to have a chance at going to space was the school teacher who unfortunately died onboard Challenger when it failed during launch (RIP). \n\nNow civilians can literally pay for a seat and goto space, it's becoming a commercial endeavor.",
            "You missed their point. Going to the Moon took ~ 25 billion of a ~1.5Trillion dollar budget over the time frame it ran.\n\nThere was never going to be a consistent manned space program to the moon at those prices without something compelling to drive them.  IE GeoPolitics.\n\nBut between Korolev dying and then the US beating Russia to the Moon the Soviet menace seemed defeated.  Thus spending DoD levels of money on manned space flights was not going to fly anymore.\n\n>I'm also willing to bet that space travel has gotten complicated \nFrom a sheer physics standpoint it's just as hard as it always was. From an engineering and economic perspective it's really not.  Yes you have to deal with ITAR so that missile tech doesn't get to every country on earth creating a hostile state with capabilities to put bombs anywhere on planet.\n\nBut more countries than ever can access space. Hell there are whole private companies dedicated to utilizing space. Many of them, and some even wildly successful, a few moderately so.  That wasn't possible in the 70's.\n\nSo setting aside your premise that space is somehow harder than it used to be because of the government.  Point to the commercial companies that were regularly sending things into space in the 1970's. To my knowledge all of them were government sponsored in someway. Aerodyne, RocketJet, Boeing (Macdonald and douglas which were separate companies at the time) same with Lockheed and Martin.\n\nNone of them were doing what companies like SpaceX, RocketLab, FireFly, and the like are doing today at the pace.  They are commercial companies putting mostly commercial products into space at a blistering pace.  There were 125 total launches in 1975 there were 223 last year.\n\nMore importantly the share of those launched by the government has dropped each year. They are buying commercial services from places like planet labs rather the designing bespoke single launch of an expensive sat. They are instead buying from a commercial company that launches dozens or hundreds of them.\n\nSpace has never been more accessible. Similarly Manned Space has never been more accessible. It used to be if you wanted to go to space you HAD to pay a government to take you there.  Today? You have theoretically 2 options though really only one practically speaking, but they have more than enough capacity to support a launch when you're ready.  It also costs less. It's $50 million to buy a ride on dragon to the ISS. It cost $25 million in 2001 when Dennis Tito did it using a Soyuz. Prices have adjusted since then, but I have no idea what the rates for that particular ride would be today given the sanctions. You'd also go in a modern luxury liner compared to the cramped box that is the Russian option.\n\nSo while we haven't been back with people to the Moon Manned Space is alive.\n\nNow for the Moon argument. Apollo was a boots and shoot program. They got boots on and took some propaganda photos and some science samples and left.\n\nThere was nothing sustainable about what they did.  The SaturnV was a machine the size of a 40 story building that was flung into space then all of it minus a tiny capsule was dropped into the ocean.\n\nThat tiny ship that was roughly 2 10x10 rooms stacked on each other. All that effort for that.\n\nNow compare it to what NASA wants to do today which is build an entire Lunar economy and a sustainable path and demand to make that happen.  That is a grand fucking ambition. So they are looping in other countries and every commercial interest they can find to make it as unkillable as possible given the changing tides of US politics.\n\nYes it's complicated, but it's not \"just\" going back to the Moon it's going to try and stay.  It's the difference between a day trip on the lake in your personal boat and setting up a business that will run cruises around that lake every couple of days or so.\n\nOne is a lot more work and is inherently more complex but it happens way more often and is likely way more sustainable.",
            "Either way, at this point I wouldn't put it past them to beat SpaceX to the moon landing. As much cheering as SpaceX crowd does for those explosions all I see is the ship barely making it to orbit with no payload and we need that system to do 10 launches a week to refuel their lander?",
            "If you really want to, you can launch SLS 10 times a year, the only question is whether this is economically possible",
            "The only reason Artemis won't basically die the moment boots and flags are back on the moon is because NASA will, by that point, have access to the exact vehicle they need for shipping a thousand tons of equipment to the moon.  _They have not contracted such a vehicle,_ even though there's nothing currently available that can do it and NASA _has_ to know that nobody's going to win a contract tomorrow and then simply whip such a thing up in under 5 years.\n\nBasically, they're not arranging the contract because everyone already knows how it's going to happen.",
            ">That dumb thing will either tip over\n\nWhy? And who told you that? With the enormous leg span and the low center of mass it is *LESS* likely to tip over than the Apollo Lander. \n\n>or the stupid elevator will grind to a halt with the regolith.\n\nAh yes. Because winches as such finicky pieces of equipment, used on earth only in pristine environments and never in dirty environments like construction or battle fields. \n\n>\u00a0And it's supposed to take 15 launches for fuel?\n\nNo. 8-10. Don\u00b4t take the utmost conservative number from NASA as your fixed number. \n\nPlease, for your own sake, lay off whatever garbage you are consuming on the internet.",
            "Is it possible that Artemis III will be delayed or re-planned? Yes. \n\nIt\u00b4s also very likely that this will not happen because of a delay from Starship/HLS.\n\n>All this big talk about a ship that has only done what every other rocket has done in history and has yet to demonstrate the capability of actually delivering on any of the breakthroughs that will make any such landing remotely feasible.\n\nFunny how that developed, isn't it?\n\nIt will be an ever changing goal post and Starship will never achieve its goals. Not even a year ago it was considered completely impossible for Starship to even lift off because of the 33 completely unreliable raptors. Then it was impossible for the launch pad to withstand the launch. Then it was impossible to launch more then once or twice a year. Then it was impossible for the hot stageing to work, then it was impossible for the booster the softland. Then it was impossible for the ship to survive reentry.\n\nWhat are the next completely impossible steps which will be quickly forgotten once achieved? \n\nDo me a favor and write down all the impossible steps between now and a crewed moon landing. Then we will see how quickly you brush them aside.",
            "Congress will be the last one to be indignant since they initiated this back in 2011 (although even Constellation)",
            "Just like in my other comment, please remind me of all those completely impossible steps Starship has already done now.\n\n* launching with 33 \"unreliable\" raptors\n* Stage separation\n* Hot staging\n* internal propellant transfer\n* surviving reentry\n* Flip maneuver after reentry\n* (which did I miss?)\n\n--- we are here\n\n* orbit\n* booster catching at the launch tower\n* orbital refilling\n* launch *again* within a week (no clue was that is an absolutely necessary requirement for HLS tho...)\n\nAll the top points were once considered completely unrealistic by you. Now only the lower points remain in the future and possible for you to claim \"impossible\".",
            "You do realize we refuel the ISS all the time right? This isn't magical new physics? It's an engineering problem that has been partially solved since long ago. \n\nThe details for Starship need to work out, but that's a matter of testing and refinement not wholesale new tech.\n\nNow as for the rest. Meh. They don't really need to catch and refurbish everything they just need to make enough to get the job done.  They're currently on pace to put another test article up around mid July. This one will likely meet some of your criteria, then the next a few more.\n\nThat's how SpaceX works. They fly fix fly. That's why they land rockets when no one else can. (Orbital I'm not counting BO because Orbital velocity is significantly faster than breaking the Karman line.)\n\nWill it all be as easy as Musk predicts? Doubtful, but you're assuming each and every part needs to happen exactly as his pie in the sky fantasy is laid out.\n\nIt doesn't as long as they can get the rocket proven working (likely next text), then polish up refueling (Partially proven with ISS and the internal test transfer on IFT3 ETA mid next year.).  They don't really need to get the landing sorted.\n\nThey make 1 of these a month theoretically they need 10-12 to put in orbit to refuel. They can make those in 1 year if they don't push, don't ramp up etc.  So from July until end of next year they have 17 months they could make just 1 a month and have enough disposable units to make it happen.\n\nLanding is not required for HLS to work. it is required to make it profitable for SpaceX which is not NASA's problem.\n\nNASA offered a firm Fixed price contract and SpaceX accepted how they meet that deadline and if they make any money on it is not NASA's concern.\n\nAs such if they can meet the contract using each top half as 100% disposable then it sounds like they can do that.\n\nThere is more than one path to the goal line here and Musk's bullshit is not the only way.  But with that said I wouldn't be surprised if EOY next year they are regularly recovering at least the booster which is the real limiter on things since it has the most engines.",
            "It did not achieve it's primary goal of reducing the cost of launch.  It was not worth the opportunity cost and hindered NASA for decades.",
            "You lost half of it . I would call that a failure.\nImagine every plane sent up half comes back down in pieces",
            "The Shuttle was a technical success and an amazing piece of engineering. It was also a failure as a program by failing to meet most of its most important goals. These can both exist at the same time.",
            "I can't imagine how this is physically possible. Their launch vehicle will probably make its first flight only this fall. At the same time, they also need to develop refueling with a much more finicky fuel in a more difficult location, requiring numerous launches in a short period of time (4-8).\u00a0\n\n\nPeople who think the BO Lander is much simpler than Starship apparently haven't looked into BO's [architecture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Artemis_V_HLS_concept_of_operations.svg), apart from pictures of the more traditional landing module.",
            "Budget projections in the 1969 Space Task Group report were fairly reasonable. Lunar Taxi and Lunar Shelter were incremental upgrades to the LM. LESA would have required new development, but there was still lots of additional work that could have been done with the existing architecture",
            "It's going to be scrubbed because it's never going to happen.  Not for many many years.  And my bet, is that Congress will long abandon it before they're able to complete the mission.",
            "None of these haven't been done before on rockets.   They've been doing much of this for 50 years.  Stage separation?  Are you kidding me?  \n\nWhen you launch, recover, and refurbish and relaunch again in under a week I'll be impressed.  Until it does, this is just sci-fi.  My guess is this never happens.  But absolutely not for a decade or more.",
            "Almost 50% of its reuse compromises were to archive USAF/NRO mission objectives and timelines. \n\nIts budget was also cut by 50% over its development and its mandated delivery dates were not changed.\n\nSide saddle orbiter putting in the potential path of debris was a concern by NASA, but cost cutting measure to reuse as much of existing launch facilities as possible. Reusable first stage tank and liquid fueled fly back boosters cut due to additional budget cuts and time lines imposed by USAF funding. \n\nIf USAF/NRO didn\u2019t approve the budget, Nixon and Ford would have cancelled manned spaceflight program for NASA completely.",
            "Well if we take their word for it New Glenn should work on the first mission, because it's carrying a payload, so that would already put them ahead of SpaceX. SpaceX hasn't done any real refueling either so that's same same.",

            ">None of these haven't been done before on rockets. They've been doing much of this for 50 years.\n\nOh really? Launching with 33 engines is routine for like 50 years now?\n\n>Stage separation? Are you kidding me?\n\nYeah, this was a HUGE point of criticism by many people with little clue. They sound incredibly similar to you. Since there is no mechanism for the actual separation event the argument was that it would never work. (and subsequently no boostback, too.)\n\n>When you launch, recover, and refurbish and relaunch again in under a week I'll be impressed.\n\nFalcon9 is almost at this stage now. In like 5 years. And this rocket was NOT designed for reusability from the very start. \n\n  \nBut just to make sure: What will be the next completely impossible thing according to you after an individual Starship launches once per week?",
            "I find it incredibly hard to believe that Nixon, President during the moon landings, pre-scandal resignation, would even consider cancelling the entire manned spaceflight budget after Apollo ended.",
            "None of that changes the reality of the end system and if it was a success or failure overall.",
            "The typical success rate of first time launches is roughly 30% second launches is 70% and by the 10th you're at something like 95%.  \n\nIt's a coin flip if New Glenn works or not. Paying customers are irrelevant to that, many first launches have cargo that goes boom when they do.",
            "The huge bottleneck that I don't think will ever happen, but definitely not for a decade or more - is rapidly reusing booster and starship.  And until this happens, no part of Artemis 3 is possible.   There is a [zero.zero](http://zero.zero) chance that you'll be able to refuel some 15 times or more without this.  And even launch has to be pretty much flawless.  And then there's a whole bunch of things that have to be figured out before you refill the vehicle in orbit.  That may take years and years and years to work out with god only knows how many launches.  \n\nSpaceX will go bankrupt or Congress will cut them off long before.",
            "Moon landing was Kennedy, Nixon famously cancelled most of the post apollo plans that weren\u2019t already mostly paid for. \u201cHe also believed that NASA should be considered as one America\u2019s domestic programs without the special status it enjoyed during the 1960s, one of the lasting legacies of the Nixon space doctrine.

The goal of 300 flights was before post kickoff cuts of 50% to the development of STS, and it still hit 130, and supported most USAF NRO mission start deadlines, $4Billion USAF Vandenberg landing and cross range capability (though that USAF single orbit and return reduced the shuttle payload to orbit quite a bit). Maybe not as cheap as originally targeted with double the budget and without the USAF deadlines.",
