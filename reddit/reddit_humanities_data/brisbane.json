Places to sleep/shower/eat/get help?\n\nAbout me: I\u2019m 31 and male, ADHD/anxiety/SA/depression diagnosed and, I suspect, somewhere on the ASD. I love to help others but the last few years of doing that has seen me end up in some bad situations that have crushed my self-confidence.\n\nWould love to work! Experienced with IT, networking, marketing, privacy tech (OpenWRT, Wireguard, Tails, etc), cooking, stock management, forklift driving and learn most things fast - but I really struggle with group socialising and can become easily stressed and have abused alcohol in the past to cope.\n\nAny advice or help is greatly appreciated <3",
