These children are in grade school and will become your children\u2019s bosses or coworkers. Choosing a unique name will not make your kids stand out or be rejected on a resume. They are only low hanging fruit (whatever that phrase is) to the adults of today\u2019s generation. The only people that I have seen smirk or say something about some of these names are the teachers I work with, which says a lot about their maturity. The kids they go to school with don\u2019t seem to have a problem with these names.\n\nThink of all the names back in the day that people hated only for it to become popular now and useable. I work with a Claudia. A normal name today but with a meaning that means Lame. Or think of the name Mallory that means unlucky. \n\nGrowing up with a cultural name (popular normal name in my culture but seen as unique in North America) I was picked on. But I grew up to love my name because my parents taught me not to care and embrace it. I also love how intentional they were when they gave me that name.\n\nSo give your children the unique names you love. That\u2019s what I did and I don\u2019t regret it for one second. \n",

            "I appreciate the uniqueness of it, but I don't like the sound of Maroona. I can't quite place my finger on the issue I have with it. I'd rather see the kid just named Maroon. Adding the a to the end seems to ruin it for me.\n\nHere's the irony: if you added an a to Scarlett or Violet, then I wouldn't have an issue with it. Scarletta and Violetta seem fine. Maroona seems wrong to me for no apparent reason. Maybe I just need time to hear it some more before I get used to it.",

            "My name is so unique that a google search only shows me. My first name is Somerset. My last name was misspelled at Ellis island when my husbands great grandfather came to Amrica from Germany in the late nineteenth century. He had one kid, who had one kid, who had two kids, we have 3 kids. There are 5 people in the country with our last name as it is spelled. I love/hate the fact that my name is this unique. On one hand, I am definitely original, on the other hand, my stalker can easily find me.",
