            "I was expecting Mateo to hit the top 10 this year , but I'm surprised it entered all the way at #6! No real surprises for me in the girls' top 10, although I did notice that there continues to be a steady decline in the number of girls given each top 10 name; in 2018, 18,814 girls were given the #1 name and 10,428 were given the #10 name, but in 2023, those numbers were 15,270 and 7,811 respectively.\n\nThe biggest top 100 surprise for me was Lainey jumping a whopping 120 ranks to #54. I knew from last year's state popularity lists that it had some regional popularity (in the Midwest, I think?) but I didn't expect it to make such a splash on the national list. I'm also surprised the Juniper didn't crack the top 100 and instead held steady at #113.\n\nHere's the full rundown of the new entries into the top 100, if anyone's curious:\n\nBoys:\n\n* Thiago (#77, #107 in 2022)\n* Enzo (#90, #121 in 2022)\n* Luka (#95, #117 in 2022)\n* Amir (#99, #113 in 2022)\n* Gael (#100, #104 in 2022)\n\nGirls:\n\n* Lainey (#54, #174 in 2022)\n* Maeve (#73, #103 in 2022)\n* Eden (#77, #117 in 2022)\n* Vivian (#87, #104 in 2022 - re-entry into the top 100, last appeared in 2019)\n* Madeline (#94, #102 in 2022 - re-entry, last appeared in 2021)\n* Lyla (#98, #105 in 2022)\n* Clara (#99, #110 in 2022 - re-entry, last appeared in 2019)\n* Allison (#100, #101 in 2022 - re-entry, last appeared in 2021)\n\nI'm waiting until the top 1000 list is cross-posted on Behind the Name to do more analysis, since that list includes the rank, numerical, and percent changes for each name and gives a better sense of what's rising outside of the top 100.",
            "I'm surprised Mateo is at 6th!\n\nI'm also surprised Mia is still in the top 10. In all my years around children (teaching and my own kids), I've met 1, maybe 2 Mias.",

        "content": "Okay so I (17f) hate my name, it is spelled wierd and I hate how it's pronounced. It's a very traditionally feminine name and I've never been a particularly feminine person, nothing wrong with feminine names but it doesn't really feel right being called it. My current name starts with an A so I wanted to go by something that also started with an A just to make things easier and to keep my initials. I hated every name I saw until I saw august. I know august is a boys name, but I love it. I thought it was wierd it was a boys name since its just a month, I mean what makes it different from April or may? But anyways, if I started going by August do you think people would be really critical? I mean I know there would be some people who think it's a wierd name for a girl but I just love the name. So do you guys think it's a bad idea? Does anybody have names that kind of sound similar that are more unisex? Trying to avoid names too traditionally one way or the other so a unisex name is ideal, but is August just too masculine? Help??\n\n  \nedit: okay, I was thinking of solutions and I thought maybe I could change my name to being augusta, and then just go by August or auggie with people who are okay with that?",

            "I wanted to suggest the name Octavia. I know it has a different first letter but it\u2019s similar in vibes to August but is a strong sounding woman\u2019s name",
            "I have a friend named August who is a female. I think the name is beautiful and I don\u2019t know why more females are named this, it\u2019s gorgeous. But if you\u2019re still not sure about the name, there are other similar names that are deemed more feminine, such as Augustine or Augustina:]",
            "August does strike me as masculine. But in a world in which girls seem to be being named James and other \u201cmale\u201d names left right and centre, I think people would get used to it. It\u2019s a male name because the month was named after Roman emperor Augustus. So the name evolved into Augustus, August, and Augusta. Out of those, only Augusta would really be considered feminine. Like how July, named after emperor Julius, separated into Julius/Julian, and Julia/Julie/Juliana etc. It\u2019s August, not Bruce or Bartholemew, I think people would get used to it being a female name. \n\nSimilar names you might like: \n\nAvery\n\nAddison\n\nAubrey \n\nAlex",
            "I know a 10 yr old male August and an 8 yr old female August and they both wear it well without anyone really commenting. When I met the girl, didn't even think anything about it other than it being a name I don't hear often!\n\nI say go for it!",
            "TBH I feel August is unisex. I have never come across a female August, but to me It seems suitable for male or female. \nI understand that you really dislike your name, but you are legally a minor so you going to have some trouble getting the paperwork done. Are there any names that Work with your current legal name?  Alternatively, why don\u2019t you just start going by a nickname. I\u2019m not sure where you\u2019re located but in Australia it\u2019s not abnormal for people to go by a name as their common nickname that they introduce themselves to people in informal settings that has absolutely nothing to do with their legal. I have met boys called Rob who is legal name was Dave; I have met people that go by \u201cburger\u201d, I have met people that go by their favourite alcoholic, eg \u201cpimm\u201d. \nAnother option is also to just stop exclusively going by your last  name.",
            "i don't think you should change your name to augusta so other people are okay with it? \n\naugust is a gender neutral name to me. it leans masculine because historically it's been a male name, but nowadays with girls named parker, ronnie, ashley, charlie, jesse cameron etc i don't think anybody would bat an eye if you introduced yourself as august! \n\nyou're very nearly an adult and you're certainly old enough to make decisions about your name (worst case you can always change again in future). even if you decided to call yourself thomas or robert or richard, people can suck it lol there are bigger fish to fry. august totally works in a professional sense in a way that is gender neutral so i would have 0 concerns!",
            "There is a female August in the show 3rd rock from the sun.",
            "It's 100% masculine to me. It's a very traditional name well-established masculine name where I'm from. So from my perspective it wouldn't be any different than naming a girl 'Edward' or 'Ronald'.\n\nI would definitely not use it for a daughter. But since it's your own name.. you can do whatever you want.",
            "August is a really strong but not overpowering name. I think it is nice for a man or woman. It\u2019s really neat you found a name that suits you. I think you should go for it!",
            "The difference between April, May, etc. and August is that other months were actually months. July and August were added to the calendar and named after Julius Augustus Caesar. They were male names before they were months of the year. \n\nI personally think that if you like the name August, use it. I'm sure someone somewhere will say it's a boy's name, but I have two female cousins who are named Ryan and Mason. Life's been just fine for them."
