Do I just keep applying until it no longer soaks in? I've done 10-12 applications in 90+ degree weather using my hands to rub the oil in. ",

            "Trolls aside for those that have never used leatherique, you need to wipe it off when done. So at this point clean it off with the second step and it\u2019ll will probably be fine. I used it on my 12 year old E90 and it transformed the leather condition. Those saying to coat the leather are talking about protective products vs restorative products. I have a thing of Leather Honey I am still waiting to try on my F80",

Not saying the leatherique doesn\u2019t work it\u2019s just not the best tool for the job with coated leather, next time go for a regular interior cleaner like griots interior cleaner, boars hair brush and a microfiber rag and youre good to go. Can add a little conditioner if you want. Just to save you some headache next time \ud83d\udc4d looks good tho!!!"

Low speed rotary pass with a Urofiber pad.

            "Ive a variety of different sealants over the years. I just used cerakote to seal (I do a different process than their sanding) and it was stupid easy. I was gonna get a can of 2k but I saw lots of people saying good things about their headlight sealant. I also have used cerakote on the black plastic trim and it looks great so figured to give the headlight version a go.",
            "I normally just use UV clear coat after sanding down with 1000 grit. Like 2-3 coats is good. If you already got it looking at good as you did in the pics then just get some spray on ceramic coat from Turtlewax and apply it every month during a wash.",
            "I recognized the headlights.  I meant to say 06, but the headlights are the same.  Bought it new and it was still running like a champ when I sold it with 165k.  Only problem was a stupid little sensor that\u2019s in the most inconvenient location at the back of the engine.  The transmission doesn\u2019t like it when you floor it, but other than that it was a great car.",
