        "content": "I've been applying leatherique rejuvenating oil for the past 2.5 days. The driver seat of my car continues to have dry spots within an hour or two of each application. Do I just keep applying until it no longer soaks in? I've done 10-12 applications in 90+ degree weather using my hands to rub the oil in. ",

            "A lot of people dont know how leatherique works. Satire or not its definitely ready to be wiped down with the cleaner. The end result will be a beautiful hydrated matte leather.",
            "Trolls aside for those that have never used leatherique, you need to wipe it off when done. So at this point clean it off with the second step and itll will probably be fine. I used it on my 12 year old E90 and it transformed the leather condition. Those saying to coat the leather are talking about protective products vs restorative products. I have a thing of Leather Honey I am still waiting to try on my F80",

            "I see lots of comments that look like they are not familiar with the Leatherique system. In my opinion these look like they are ready to use the finishing solution (forget the name, Im not at home). \n\nFrom your description, seems like you are in the rejuvenation phase, applying that product.  You cant tell from the pics but you just need to clean it up now and give it a day to see if the leather is taking the oil.",

            "Looks great. I just got mine delivered. Curious but did you let yours bake in the sun for 24hrs?  Ive seen videos that say you should apply step one to the leather and let it soak in under hot conditions for 24hrs before you move on to step 2.",

            "I recognized the headlights.  I meant to say 06, but the headlights are the same.  Bought it new and it was still running like a champ when I sold it with 165k.  Only problem was a stupid little sensor thats in the most inconvenient location at the back of the engine.  The transmission doesnt like it when you floor it, but other than that it was a great car.",
            "Nice good work. As long as you keep UV protect on it. Its gonna be good for years.",
            "Ive a variety of different sealants over the years. I just used cerakote to seal (I do a different process than their sanding) and it was stupid easy. I was gonna get a can of 2k but I saw lots of people saying good things about their headlight sealant. I also have used cerakote on the black plastic trim and it looks great so figured to give the headlight version a go.",
            "I normally just use UV clear coat after sanding down with 1000 grit. Like 2-3 coats is good. If you already got it looking at good as you did in the pics then just get some spray on ceramic coat from Turtlewax and apply it every month during a wash.",
            "Mine is the last year before the started using CVT's. 170k mostly trouble-free miles. Replaced a few sensors. Shifts great at full throttle, shifts hard at light throttle going 1st to 2nd. I'll replace the shift solenoid soon.",
            "Yessir, it's been my go to process for years. I just stay too busy to get to my own stuff most of the time."
