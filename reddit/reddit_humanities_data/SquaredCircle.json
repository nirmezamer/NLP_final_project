            "Theyve made PAUL HEYMAN one of the biggest babyfaces in the company Solo is operating on a new level Im sorry the Bloodline is the best story ever told in WWE",
            "you know, Paul Heyman said you aint seen nothing yet  during his Hall of Fame speech, which usually is kind of an empty platitude when most people say it while receiving that type of reward after having a career as long as he has.  honestly tho this might be some of the best work hes done any of his his many roles in wrestling",

            "Shout out to that security guy that got cross roads'ed. Dude sold it very well.",
            "The sheer amount of gleeful fantasy booking Brock into the current Heyman angle is gross, honestly.\n\nThere's separating the art from the artist, almost every wrestling fan has to do it to some extent and set their limits on that, but too many can't even wait until Grant gets a trial date to want one of the men Vince was trying to traffick her to back on their screens.",
            "To survive as a fan of Candice LeRae or Dakota Kai, you must have the willpower of a Green Lantern or you will go insane.",
            "It was my birthday yesterday! I'm ancient. at least i have coffee and walnut cake. Finally booked myself ALL IN tickets, that should be a blast. \n\nIs stardom worth getting into? I keep meaning to watch more joshi, and it seems like a good entry point.",
            "Watching Freelance from last night,  20+ years in the industry, and The Motor City Machine Guns are still one of the best teams out there. The influence they've had on so many of today's wrestlers. Shelley and Sabin have only gotten better with age. Two guys who've done so much and will be missed when they finally hang em up.\n\nOh and them vs Bang and Matthews was absolutely fantastic",
            "Aminata vs Blue was a really great match. Definitely would recommend it",
            "Again, props to Solo. People misunderstand what he's trying to do rn, but he deserve some praise too.",
            "I always wonder what fans think when wrestling companies bring in other athletes/celebrities and they have no idea who the person is.",
            "A few months back i noticed that when Ospreay is expecting an attack from being, he cant help but keep side eyeing to see if its coming yet"
