He recounts Drew kicking him while he was down, and he decided to go the Chicago route, he wouldn't stay down. Punk planned to bury his career 6 feet under -- he just didn't think it would be that easy. He was looking forward to doing more bad things to him, but Drew took his ball and went home. Paul Heyman interrupts, saying he's not here in disrespect, despite being the Wise Man to the tribal chief Roman Reigns - he's here in an urgent situation. Punk says, you don't look so good... and Heyman gives him a big, long hug. Paul says driving in he heard on sports radio that Chicago is CM Punk's town, and that really pissed off Solo Sikoa. Now that he's the Head of the Table, he wants every town to be his town, and he wants a favor & a favor back. He says once Punk is cleared, folks will be in the ring with the Best in the World, but they don't care right now, they'll come for him. Heyman reiterates that with love and respect, please get the hell out of here right now. Punk is incredulous that Solo & the Tongans would think to ambush him in Chicago.\n\n* Sikoa's music hits and Solo says, if he wants to be on his show, he's got two options -- either pay his respects to him and the Bloodline, or they'll make sure his ass never gets cleared. Punk asks Paul, what's the favor he wanted if he does this for him? Paul says, take me with you. CM Punk acknowledges... that he doesn't see the Bloodline standing in front of him, he sees a bunch of fake-ass usos and a cosplay tribal chief. The Bloodline enters the ring, and from behind Punk, Cody Rhodes enters the ring with two baseball bats. Cody says he fashions himself as the head of the table right? Well I've already beaten the head of the table. So why not leave the family backstage and we settle this tonight. \n\n* Corey Graves notes that security is increased tonight after the events on Monday Night Raw.\n\n* Jade Cargill talks to Bianca Belair backstage about getting their rematch for their tag team titles. But Bianca says tonight she has to focus on her Money in the Bank qualifying match.\n\n* Cody Rhodes vs. Solo Sikoa is set for later tonight; Randy Orton chats with Cody backstage and asks if he really wants to do this? But Cody says yeah, he's sure. Kevin Owens is also there and is concerned, but Cody says he has a plan.\n\n* Blair Davenport chats with Bayley who was watching the match backstage, asking her to relay to Naomi that she's really looking to face her in the MITB qualifying match next week. And she's really looking forward to cashing in on Bayley.\n\n* Paul Heyman is in the Bloodline dressing room with Solo Sikoa staring him down. Solo demands he tell the Tongans that KO and Randy are to be taken out. Paul asks, you want me to do it? Solo says, if I say I want you to do it, you'll do it. And when he comes back, the two of them need to talk.\n\n* Kayla Braxton talks with Grayson Waller backstage, noting his partner Austin Theory is at home injured tonight. Waller says he's going to win the MITB for the both of them. He's interrupted by Johnny Gargano calling him a fake friend\u2026 but they all get interrupted by the crash of a garage door opening. It's Drew McIntyre, with a beaten and bloodied CM Punk. Drew carries Punk over his shoulders into the arena where he drops him on the ramp. Drew steals a bracelet from Punk's wrist. Nick Aldis appears with security and Drew shoves him, with Nick shoving him back and words are exchanged. Drew just stares at the battered Punk as he slowly backs away. \n\n* After commercial, we see CM Punk getting placed in a neckbrace, on a gurney, and hauled off in an ambulance.\n\n* KO & Tonga Loa appear to affect the MITB Qualifying Match but only serve as a distraction as they take each other out.\n\n* We get a recap of the ending of Raw earlier this week where the Wyatt Sicks were unveiled. \n\n* LA Knight hits the ring, asking Logan Paul to get his goofy hair and US title down to the ring. He's said, he wants the championship, but Logan said no. He showed up at his house, and said no. He heard Logan was supposed to be in the ring tonight, but he no-showed Chicago. He doesn't want the triple threat match to qualify for MITB, but he'll beat him. Santos Escobar interrupts. Knight is mad, he asked for Logan Paul. Escobar says he must be delusional, chasing Paul like a desperate Chicago fanboy. But next week, he's dealing with Santos Escobar. Knight says he's looking past him, but Escobar interrupts him with a cheap shot. Knight turns the tables and says you can get beat up or you can get -- he's then hit from behind by Logan Paul!\n\n* As KO heads to the ring for his MITB qualifying match, he's attacked by the Tongans. However, he still makes his way to the match.\n\n* Michin is nursing her wounds backstage, and Tiffany Stratton shows up to offer her \"condolences.\" Michin says, at least she doesn't run to Nia Jax for protection. They spar for a moment before Nia shows up and takes out Michin. Tiffany laughs.\n\n* Next Friday, we have more MITB qualifier matches announced: Candice LaRae vs. Jade Cargill vs. Tiffany Stratton; Naomi vs. Blair Davenport vs. Indi Hartwell; and LA Knight vs. Logan Paul vs. Santos Escobar!\n\n* Kayla Braxton backstage addresses the CM Punk/Drew McIntyre situation, noting that Punk will be staying overnight at a local hospital for evaluation.\n\"\n* Paul Heyman says he's talked to everyone as he was told. But, per Roman Reigns, Solo is breaking commandments. He wasn't supposed to touch CM Punk, and he was only supposed to have Cody Rhodes in check so that when the Tribal Chief comes back\u2026 Solo interrupts him saying he hates to tell him this, but Roman isn't coming back. As Solo leaves for his match, Paul asks into the ether, \"how can that be?\"\n\n* The main event is nearly immediately crushed by interference. The Tongans, Kevin Owens & Randy Orton - with the Bloodline temporarily taken out. As Solo is cornered against the turnbuckle, he starts laughing maniacally, and from behind Jacob Fatu attacks! Fatu tosses Cody onto the announce table and leaps from the top rope to splash! Solo hugs him, and the Bloodline ends the night throwing up the 1s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Additional Plugs**\n\n* Revisit the [live thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1dlh7jq/live_wwe_smackdown_on_fox_discussion_thread_june/)\n\n* Check out our [SquaredCircle Twitter account](https://www.twitter.com/wredditofficial) for all sorts of AMA announcements and interaction!\n\n* Join our [SquaredCircle Discord](https://discord.gg/squaredcircle) for live chat!\n\n* Be sure to follow [@WWE on Twitter](https://twitter.com/wwe) and [Like WWE on Facebook!](http://www.facebook.com/wwe)\n\n* Like other wrestling promotions?

After a PPV defense, she's just backstage watching MITB qualifiers and doing generic backstage stuff instead of setting up an interesting storyline. She feels so background despite being a Rumble winner who won the championship at Wrestlemania.\u00a0\n\n\nI know this alliance is doomed to be over by years end, but I'm loving this Tiffany/Nia stuff and the way Michin doesn't take their shit backstage. Someone's gonna help her, I assume Tegan Nox (a face who isn't doing anything).",
