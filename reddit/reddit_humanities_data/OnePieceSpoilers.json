        "content": "Hey! It's been 4 months (I think) since I made the Bounties & Reward system for you guys to have as user flair and since then 382 people have gotten one!\n\nI kept it low profile at first so the more active people would notice, and eventually more and more people did. I'm glad yall seem to like it!\n\nBefore I continue, let me explain for those who don't know what I'm talking about...\n\n# USER FLAIR\n\nYou can have one of these below/next to your username when you post or comment in the sub:\n\n[Bounty](https://preview.redd.it/rh29psc2k39d1.png?width=212&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae4f44951bb36502458f0d6c45a7ef4b48fe5d2c)\n\n[Reward](https://preview.redd.it/217ilxr3k39d1.png?width=215&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e55f5c4ae9e04322635ea30681704e784e72065)\n\nTo request:\n\n* **Desktop:** You need to go to the **User Flair** section that is below our sub's description and pick if you want a *Bounty (for Pirates)* or a *Reward (for Marines)*.\n* **Mobile:** Go to the sub's front page and then click on the **. . .** in the banner and then **Change user flair.**\n\n...or you can just ask for one in the comment below if you don't know how to do none of that. After you do it, I'll give your a bounty or reward when I get some free time.\n\nBounties are self explanatory, but Rewards are meant to mimic Cross Guild's system where each star is worth up to 100 million berries and each crown about 1 billion berries.\n\nI have a system I use to calculate a fair amount to everyone, but the most important part is how active you are in our sub, that's worth a lot.\n\nDon't worry if you start with a low amount, I'm planning on updating them once every 6 months, so you'll have time to participate and gain some reputation before the next update.\n\nAnyways, it's time to update everyone who picked one from the beginning until recently! The next time will be on **January 2025.**\n\n# LIVE CHAT\n\nI wanted to use this opportunity to let yall know that we have a live chat too! I created it about a month ago and also kept low profile to see who would notice, and up to now 15 people did XD\n\nI nicknamed it \"Nooticer's Chat\", and it's a bit dead... So if you wanna talk to everyone, check it out: [https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePieceSpoilers/s/A2tOiyRdYD](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePieceSpoilers/s/A2tOiyRdYD)\n\nThis chat feature is not fully released yet so it's why people who use desktop have no idea.\n\nOn mobile you can go to the front page of the sub and you'll see **Chats** next to Feed:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ndntshj9l39d1.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d616e3d05f2d7a04172171e332188cc178ad264\n\n...I believe that's all. Let me know if you have any issues.",

            "Edison is dead? I know he wasn't doing so hot but I don't remember seeing him die?\n\nEdit: I think he is just desynched from Punk Records which is why York thinks he is dead, unless he got off paneled by someone",
            "Okay, so I've been a proponent that only one Vegapunk is gonna make it out alive. I still posit that Edison is currently just offline and that he will blow himself up at the same time as York, so that she meets punishment for her actions. Used to think the Gorosei would kill her in blind fury but they keep being levelheaded and reminding themselves to exclude her. \n\nWas starting to doubt only one would make it out alive last week since the ships are starting to set sail, and then Atlas gets off the ship and puts herself in harm's way. So I'm gonna say that Lilith will be the one to make it out alive.",
            "ATLAS IS TOO CUTE TO DIE.\n\nPLEASE NO\nPLEASE NO\nPLEASE NOOOOO",
            "From the start I believed Lilith would be the last \u201cgood\u201d Punk while York goes to the enemy side. She\u2019s the Vegapunk with the most standout personality and was introduced to us first, her being represented of \u201cevil\u201d characteristics was just a red herring. As well as York initially being perceived as only being useful for bodily functions, \u201cdesire\u201d is an attribute that can lead one down a dark road. The other Punks were designed to be throwaway machine based clones, while Lilith and York seem to be organic beings (exception being maybe Shaka for his face and body are obscured).",
            "Waiting to see that the big Vega-brain can just pop out more into new bodies or something. Also interesting on York choice of words \u201c\u2026who\u2019s still interfacing with punk records\u2026\u201d. I\u2019m thinking one or more simply are \u201coffline\u201d right now"
