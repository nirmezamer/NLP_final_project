        "content": "Alright, so basically if you guys still remember the subreddit contest I hosted here last month, I think this would be a nice thing to continue in the future, as an annual or biannual event in this subreddit. \n\nSince I might be a bit too busy in the future and the contest problem could benefit from a more diverse selection of areas/branches of math, I'm deciding to recruit additional problem writers (as well as testsolvers) for this contest, in which you can apply here [using this google form.](https://forms.gle/NtJxFWoFDxqdHs857) Tentatively I'm probably looking for around 5-12 people, and the applications are probably gonna be rolling admission, so there isn't really a hard deadline to apply. \n\nIf your problem ends up being featured on the next official contest (which will be either October 2024 or April 2025), I will definitely credit you in the problem statement. \n\nAlso, now that we might have more problem writers and/or testsolvers, I'm thinking of perhaps slightly changing the format for future iterations of this contest. Perhaps instead of just 12 short-answer problems, we could lengthen the test (say, make it 20-25 problems) or maybe throw a few proof problems (that are weighted more) in there along with the short answer ones. Or maybe if we host this contest biannually, we could make October contests harder and more rigorous (e.g. more proof problems) than April contests, the latter which could stay as 12 short answer problems. The possibilities are endless.\n\nas for difficulty, I think I'll stick to early AIME to early Putnam (maybe the range could be widened) as with the first contest. \n\n",

            "This is such a fantastic opportunity for those passionate about math to get involved and contribute to the community in a meaningful way. I love the idea of expanding the contest to include a more diverse range of problem writers and potentially incorporating proof problems in the future. The possibilities truly are endless, and I can't wait to see how this contest evolves. Thank you for organizing such a wonderful initiative!",
