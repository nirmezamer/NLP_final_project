How do I do this? Where is that data stored? I don't necessarily even need to add a new follower sprite, just having Vulpix's normal one would be sufficient.\n\nI can't seem to locate any of the follower sprites in the hex code or how they're associated with specific Pokemon through the index.

        "content": " Hello! \nI\u2019m writing this post to kind of gush over Pokemon Saiph 2.\n\nI\u2019ve played a TON of rom hacks so far. Unbound, radical red, inclement emerald, emerald redux, rocket edition, Gaia, Sors, I could go on and on. \n\nI had a ton of fun especially with unbound and emerald redux.\n\nI am one of the unfortunate souls that didn\u2019t know you weren\u2019t supposed to play unbound as your first rom hack because it sets a yet unobtainable standard in rom hacking\u2026 until today. \n\nPokemon Saiph 2 has absolutely blown me away so far. I mean it\u2019s wild. The graphics and story are so great. The creative cities and the art? Mind blowing.  Saiph really takes the cake as my personal favorite in the trilogy is making its way into being a strong contender for a Pokemon unbound level of fun for me. \n\nI am a casual player. I don\u2019t know much about iv training, best moves, competitive play. I am just a \u201cflamethrower wins. If it doesn\u2019t? Hydro pump. If that doesn\u2019t? It\u2019s going to have to. Spam full restores and revives so I don\u2019t lose\u201d kind of guy. I\u2019m in it for the story, the world building etc. let me tell you i almost gave up radical red cause of the difficulty (fantastic game absolutely loved it I am just bad) and Saiph 2 is absolutely scratching the itch I feel after playing unbound. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t played it, I highly recommend it. I also recommend the original Saiph and Pokemon Sors. The first two parts of the series. \n\nI started off with Sors and I would recommend playing that before Saiph and Saiph 2 though. \n\nTo me, the story to the original Saiph isn\u2019t as impactful on Sors as Sors story is to Saiph 2. You can play any of the games in any order and still have a blast with each one. \n\nMy one gripe? The creators hard stance against cheating. \n\nListen I understand \u201cdon\u2019t cheat!\u201d But I\u2019m just trying to blast through battles and get to the story. Catch as my Pokemon as I want without it taking forever. Some cheats do work with this game but USER BEWARE! It could break your game. Thats not the creators fault, it\u2019s just how cheats work with hacks. \n\nAnyways, go play Saiph 2! I would love to know others opinions on it! \n",

            "Basically the pokedex is meant to be an actually helpful tool, letting you know how pokemon evolve since there is going to be a lot of changes, and then basic info about Effort Points gained for defeating them in battle, egg types, and base stats! \n\nThe reverse evolution would allow you to de-evolve politoad back to poliwhirl to then re-evolve into poliwrath. This mechanic could make for new team strategies, and fun move sets that were previously impossible to get! \n\nEdit: Some added context, the region the game takes place in is known for their gigantic evolution stone deposits, a world class evolution research facility, and their prestigious university. They have innovated and changed how Pok\u00e9mon evolve, effectively removing trading, held items, and beauty. They can\u2019t seem to find a replacement for friendship though :) \n\nSo basically there will be almost 100 new ways to evolve Pok\u00e9mon, so having the data base in the game instead of on a wiki page was the goal.
