It is a complete overhaul to the graphics of Pokemon Emerald, resembling a cross between the old Gameboy games and SNES RPGs!\n\nI\u2019ve wanted a rom hack in this style for years, and after some experimentation with making other (incomplete) projects, I decided to take a stab! \nThe overworld is pretty much complete, so I expect a release sometime this summer!\n\nFeature list:\n- Graphical overhaul in the overworld, UI menus, and the Pokemon themselves\n- Many traditional pokeemerald expansion features: Physical/Special split, learnsets updated to USUM, Fairy type, etc. \n- All Pokemon from Generation 1-3 available, plus cross-gen evolutions up to Gen 9!\n- New \u201cside quests\u201d and interesting NPCs to make Hoenn even more alive\n- More under development!! :)\n\nI hope you look forward to the release of Pokemon Emerald Seaglass!\n",

Totally looking forward to something else other than QOL difficulty versions of vanilla emerald. The only other hack on the horizon is Pisces afaik, other than that there's three spanish rmxp fangames in the works with a revamped/reimagined Hoenn. Take your time with gameplay related stuff cause those screenshots alone from the overworld already bumped this badboy very far up my want-to-play list. Thank you for all your effort you've already put into this.",

        "content": " Hello! \nI\u2019m writing this post to kind of gush over Pokemon Saiph 2.\n\nI\u2019ve played a TON of rom hacks so far. Unbound, radical red, inclement emerald, emerald redux, rocket edition, Gaia, Sors, I could go on and on. \n\nI had a ton of fun especially with unbound and emerald redux.\n\nI am one of the unfortunate souls that didn\u2019t know you weren\u2019t supposed to play unbound as your first rom hack because it sets a yet unobtainable standard in rom hacking\u2026 until today. \n\nPokemon Saiph 2 has absolutely blown me away so far. I mean it\u2019s wild. The graphics and story are so great. The creative cities and the art? Mind blowing.  Saiph really takes the cake as my personal favorite in the trilogy is making its way into being a strong contender for a Pokemon unbound level of fun for me. \n\nI am a casual player. I don\u2019t know much about iv training, best moves, competitive play. I am just a \u201cflamethrower wins. If it doesn\u2019t? Hydro pump. If that doesn\u2019t? It\u2019s going to have to. Spam full restores and revives so I don\u2019t lose\u201d kind of guy. I\u2019m in it for the story, the world building etc. let me tell you i almost gave up radical red cause of the difficulty (fantastic game absolutely loved it I am just bad) and Saiph 2 is absolutely scratching the itch I feel after playing unbound. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t played it, I highly recommend it. I also recommend the original Saiph and Pokemon Sors. The first two parts of the series. \n\nI started off with Sors and I would recommend playing that before Saiph and Saiph 2 though. \n\nTo me, the story to the original Saiph isn\u2019t as impactful on Sors as Sors story is to Saiph 2. You can play any of the games in any order and still have a blast with each one. \n\nMy one gripe? The creators hard stance against cheating. \n\nListen I understand \u201cdon\u2019t cheat!\u201d But I\u2019m just trying to blast through battles and get to the story. Catch as my Pokemon as I want without it taking forever. Some cheats do work with this game but USER BEWARE! It could break your game. Thats not the creators fault, it\u2019s just how cheats work with hacks. \n\nAnyways, go play Saiph 2! I would love to know others opinions on it! \n",
