            "Spotify feels like a Gen Z on molly designed it. The app is fast and I honestly can\u2019t knock that but everything else is trash. It keeps you in the loop of brand new songs picked in playlists constantly with loud mid range sound which makes people perceive better quality (thank you MTV for making people feel loud == better quality). This then makes people feel that unless they\u2019re genre hopping within a playlist like a coked up rat in a maze, their app isn\u2019t up to their \u201cdiverse taste\u201d.\n\nApple Music is dog shit slow and don\u2019t even get me started on the Mac app. But, it honestly is more mature and once you see through the facade, you start appreciating how seriously Apple takes music. And some of its constraints are well thought out and not exactly a limitation.",

Whatever they changed it to reminds me of a mix of YouTube Sans and Deezer\u2019s new font. They\u2019re okay as display fonts, and for the most part, a little bit more readable, but something about them just isn\u2019t right.\n\nRegardless, hope you enjoy Apple Music and if you\u2019re coming from Spotify, you can transfer everything from there using Playlisty.",

I also like it because I can load the music onto dedicated mp3 players like my iPod classic and my Syren waterproof mp3 player for swimming. I also collect CDs and vinyl.
