Spotify has, No lossless or Dolby atmos, no airplay 2 support, no HomePod support, Apple TV app is shit\u2026. The list goes on.. \n\nTL,DR: FUCK SPOTIFY, HELLO APPLE MUSIC. ",

            "Spotify\u2019s app on everything is pretty awful. I actually thought my PS5 was bugging out when I first used the Spotify app on it. Nope, it really just looks that bad. It\u2019s crazy how long they\u2019ve let their UI just sit as a nearly unusable mess",

            "I switched last year, went back to Spotify and now I'm back for good. Spotify's UI looks like the junk drawer of an ADHD person (I count myself among those). The Apple Music UI is so much more organized and I like how it reminds me of iTunes. Love the radio stations as well.",
            "Spotify feels like a Gen Z on molly designed it. The app is fast and I honestly can\u2019t knock that but everything else is trash. It keeps you in the loop of brand new songs picked in playlists constantly with loud mid range sound which makes people perceive better quality (thank you MTV for making people feel loud == better quality). This then makes people feel that unless they\u2019re genre hopping within a playlist like a coked up rat in a maze, their app isn\u2019t up to their \u201cdiverse taste\u201d.\n\nApple Music is dog shit slow and don\u2019t even get me started on the Mac app. But, it honestly is more mature and once you see through the facade, you start appreciating how seriously Apple takes music. And some of its constraints are well thought out and not exactly a limitation.",

            "Holy shit this ugly ass new font will be my last straw. I use both Spotify and Apple Music but I\u2019m going to cancel Spotify after this month",
            "Needed to see this new Spotify font, while I get the change most of the time (it\u2019s pretty much they don\u2019t want to pay licensing anymore, has pros and cons in terms of branding/money). Whatever they changed it to reminds me of a mix of YouTube Sans and Deezer\u2019s new font. They\u2019re okay as display fonts, and for the most part, a little bit more readable, but something about them just isn\u2019t right.\n\nRegardless, hope you enjoy Apple Music and if you\u2019re coming from Spotify, you can transfer everything from there using Playlisty.",
