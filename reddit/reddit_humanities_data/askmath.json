            "hello!!! i have a question regarding the upper and lower bound theorem. i just watched [this video](https://youtu.be/R-sZD7mjTNI?si=6PXIVRYZSupYIvjr) to understand what the concept is, but how would i use it to find a range of possible rational zeros?\n\ni'm currently taking a precalc class, and im currently reading about descartes' rule of signs while trying to understand the different theorems (as i'm doing my homework), but my textbook is brought it up as a method to narrow down the search of possivle rational zeros.\n\ni'd appreciate it greatly if someone could explain! i'm hoping i asked it adequately enough lol, i'll copy what the textbook says below:\n\n>\"Finding the zeros of a polynomial analytically can be a difficult (or impossible) task. For example, consider:\n\n>f(x) = x\\^5 - 18x\\^4 + 128x\\^3 - 450x\\^2 + 783x - 540\n\n>Applying the rational zero theorem gives us the following possible rational zeros:\n\n>\u00b11,\u00b12,\u00b13,\u00b14,\u00b15,\u00b16,\u00b19,\u00b110,\u00b112,\u00b115,\u00b118,\u00b120,\u00b127,\u00b130,\u00b136,\u00b145,\u00b154,\u00b160,\u00b190,\u00b1108,\u00b1135,\u00b1180,\u00b1270,\u00b1540\n\n>However, we can use the upper and lower bound theorem to show that the real zeros of f(x) are between (-1) and (18).\"\n\nif i need to go somewhere else for help, please lmk! thank you!!! :o)"

However, many elementary calculus textbooks write formulas such as\n\n    int(dx)/x=ln|x| \t(4)\n\n(where the notation x is used to indicate that x is assumed to be a real number)\"\n\nand then goes on to explain that \"Defining a sort of \"real-only\" indefinite integral is perhaps done so that students can apply the first fundamental theorem of calculus using a Riemann integral and get correct answers...\"\n\nBut this explanation doesn't mean much to me. Perhaps I need an ELI5 for this?\n\nThanks in advance.",

            "1/x is defined for both positive and negative x, but ln(x) is **only defined for positive x**. So we write ln(|x|), which happens to be correct for both positive and negative x\n\nThis wouldn't be an issue if you were dealing with complex numbers, because they would **allow negative x** in ln(x). Then you don't need the |x|. But complex numbers are usually taught later than elementary antiderivatives",
            "Do you want it to work for negative numbers?",
            "You are correct that the most general antiderivative contains two constants.  \n\nThe reason why we don't care about the 2 different constants is because the context will almost always involve taking a definite integral.  The integration interval cannot contain 0 for the integral to exist, meaning that x is either positive or negative, and so we only need a single constant.",
            "I\u2019m sad no teacher ever taught me this because it makes way more sense",
            "Just a remark to all the other answers here:  \nActually, the antiderivative is piecewise, since 1/x is also a piecewise function over the reals. If one would integrate it correctly, the integral F(x) would be:  \nF(x) = log(x) + c   for x >0  \nF(x) = log(-x) + d  for x<0  \nFor real constants c,d.  \n\nSo, we need two different constants, and for each pair c,d the function F(x) would be a valid antiderivative.  \nIn fact, for all piecewise functions, each individual piece would need its own constant, but this is rarely discussed; even at university level.",
            "Ok, so firstly, you need to be careful. The integral from a to b of 1/x is undefined if \\[a,b\\] contains 0. So it's better to think of it as two separate antiderivatives you need to find: the antiderivative of 1/x on (0,inf) and the antiderivative of 1/x on (-inf,0).\n\n\n\nIt turns out that on (0,inf), ln(x) does the job. On (-inf,0), ln(-x) does the job (these are easy to verify if you take the derivative of either).\n\nSo we can combine both, and say that the antiderivative of 1/x is ln(|x|). But we still need to be careful with this. For instance, saying that the integral from -1 to 2 of 1/x is equal to ln(|2|)-ln(|-1|)=ln(2) is incorrect.",
            "|x| = -x for x negative\n\nSo, for x negative\n\nf(x) = ln(-x)\n\nLet's differentiate here\n\nf'(x) = (-1)/(-x) = 1/x\n\nYou could say that if we had taken ln(x) it would work too. Yes, but the real logarithm is not defined for x negative.",

If k isn't prime, then you can find a, b both different from 1 such that k=ab. Therefore n=mk=m(ab)=(ma)b. So now ma divides n, and ma is greater than m and smaller than n. \n\nCan you finish the proof from here?",

Lastly, you state \"let m = ...\", but you need to prove that m = .... I'm not sure how strong of an argument is needed for this course, some courses might let you just say \"m must equal ...\" since it's easy to observe, but other courses might expect you to prove that (that may be something you want to ask your instructor about). The way I would've gone about this proof is start off by assuming k is not prime and seeing where that goes.",

            "At the end, just write \u201cand we know m is the largest positive integer divisor of n which is less than n because the lowest common multiple of m and k is n and we have chosen p to be the smallest prime in its unique prime factorisation\u201d.",
