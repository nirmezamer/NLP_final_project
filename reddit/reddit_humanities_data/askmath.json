            "hello!!! i have a question regarding the upper and lower bound theorem. i just watched [this video](https://youtu.be/R-sZD7mjTNI?si=6PXIVRYZSupYIvjr) to understand what the concept is, but how would i use it to find a range of possible rational zeros?\n\ni'm currently taking a precalc class, and im currently reading about descartes' rule of signs while trying to understand the different theorems (as i'm doing my homework), but my textbook is brought it up as a method to narrow down the search of possivle rational zeros.\n\ni'd appreciate it greatly if someone could explain! i'm hoping i asked it adequately enough lol, i'll copy what the textbook says below:\n\n>\"Finding the zeros of a polynomial analytically can be a difficult (or impossible) task. For example, consider:\n\n>f(x) = x\\^5 - 18x\\^4 + 128x\\^3 - 450x\\^2 + 783x - 540\n\n>Applying the rational zero theorem gives us the following possible rational zeros:\n\n>\u00b11,\u00b12,\u00b13,\u00b14,\u00b15,\u00b16,\u00b19,\u00b110,\u00b112,\u00b115,\u00b118,\u00b120,\u00b127,\u00b130,\u00b136,\u00b145,\u00b154,\u00b160,\u00b190,\u00b1108,\u00b1135,\u00b1180,\u00b1270,\u00b1540\n\n>However, we can use the upper and lower bound theorem to show that the real zeros of f(x) are between (-1) and (18).\"\n\nif i need to go somewhere else for help, please lmk! thank you!!! :o)",
