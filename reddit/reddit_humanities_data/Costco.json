Even though I'm not vegan, these little nuggies are nearly indistinguishable from their poultry counterparts... especially when cooked in the air fryer!\n\n\n\nTerrible find: Protein Pretzels (in a green bag). They were sampling this in my warehouse today, and the first pretzel had me reaching for a bag. The aftertaste of the second pretzel had me wanting to burn the whole display. Really funky aftertaste that persists even after eating\u00a0OTHER things :(",

Or if anybody has a suggestion for an easier way to document past sales?\n\n**I'll start with an example:**\n\n**Item Name**\\- Haagen Dazs Vanilla Milk Chocolate Almond Ice Cream Bars, 3 fl oz, 15-count\n\n**Item Number -**  112218\n\n**Limit** \\- No limit\n\n**Discount Amount** \\- $3.50 off 6/19/24 - 7/21/24",
