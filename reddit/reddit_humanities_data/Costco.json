            "Why are you guys so vehemently defending Costco here. Their shitty 3rd party delivery is notoriously their biggest weakness. They failed to provide the service included with the price OP paid. They should come back and fix it or compensate OP. That isn't an unwarranted sense of entitlement -its literally what OP is entitled to.\u00a0",
            "Contact them & let them know. a store employee recently told me that if you buy in store, they only help you load the item into your car. If you want delivery and assembly, then ordering online is best since it is included (which is why the price is higher online).\nI had a furniture item delivered from Costco & they put it together for the most part & took all the packaging with them.",
            "Hey man, this happened to me. Contact Costco via the online store. They will either send another team out to finish the job or give you $100.\n\nI personally took $100. (Edit\\* I should add this was 100CAD, could be different for USA customers)",

            "Awhile back I ordered a new bed from Costco. It was coming and was told it would be brought up to my unit and assembled. It was a guy and his son, they just brought it out of a UHAL truck and said they had 6 more stops to make, and it was not in their contract to put it together. My mom showed them in the printed email it was their job to put it together. The guy said \"Not right.\" and they left. My mom and I spent the day putting it together. Then she spent the rest \"chat yelling\" with Costco online. Costco said the guys should have done it, but guessed the real people sub contracted it out to someone else to just drop off. We got like a 100 bucks back.",

The delivery guys knew immediately to document it, call Costco and pass the phone to us. The driver said we could either get a credit from Costco or they'll take it back and we can wait for another one. The Costco rep offered a $100 credit on the spot, which we accepted and then they finished the delivery.\n\nThe drivers were on top of the Costco procedures and had no issues dealing with Costco for us.",
            "That\u2019s funny, that happened to me. I usually just assemble it myself, but this time I decided to give it a try since it was a whole 5 piece furniture set. \n\nFirst, they were WAY past the 2 hour window or whatever it was. They were about 3 hours late past the window. Then, they said they know nothing about set up so I showed them and they abided. It was a pretty shitty experience overall lol.",
