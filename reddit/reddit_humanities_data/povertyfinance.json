        "content": "Four months ago I posted the following message on this subreddit due to an increase of shitty people who have not read the rules or the community guidelines:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/11vwilh/special\\_enforcement\\_period/](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/11vwilh/special_enforcement_period/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings have not improved significantly.  As such, these policies are no longer temporary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo here is how it is going to be.  Any infraction can (and most likely will) incur a temp ban.  This is to drive home the point that this shit isn't negotiable.  Duration to be determined by the severity of the infraction, but ranging from 1 to 30 days.\n\nA second offense of the same penalty, or getting numerous offenses across different rules will yield longer temp bans with every infraction.  Users who demonstrate that their offenses are innate or deliberate, rather than accidental or incidental will get a full ban.\n\nParticularly shitty people will get a 365 day ban out the gate.  We believe people can change, but we're going to give them lots of time for it.\n\nOvertly evil people, troll accounts, or bad faith people will be banned outright without warning explanation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs always, all actions can be appealed if you believe they are unfair.  HOWEVER, we expect you to review what you said first, and review the rules as well.  If you think we misinterpreted something, got the wrong guy, or whatever, please appeal on those grounds and we will review it.  If you make a bad-faith appeal, whatever ban you have will be extended.  If you come into modmail asking \"why was I banned\" for an obvious infraction you will get an extension.  And please note that saying \"Other kids were doing it too mom\" is not a valid appeal.  If you think other people need to have action taken on them, report their comments as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are a small team.  We can't see everything posted here.  But we sure as hell see all the reports.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit 1:** Intent matters.  Coming here trying to help and breaking a rule will be viewed very differently than coming here with cruel intentions even if the violation is a soft-ball.  \n\n**Edit 2:** Please understand this is still reddit, an anonymous message board filled with sad, miserable, SMALL people.  We won't be able to prevent shitty people wandering in.  We can see them to the door as quickly as they arrive.  **TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE IN REPORTING SHITTY COMMENTS.**  That's how we get these bastards, when you point them out to us.  Also, if you see something shitty, report it and move on.  Don't fight with an idiot, because they will lower you to their level, defeat you with experience, and get both of you banned in the process! ",

I sold my plasma twice in one week followed by my Xbox and laptop which I was hoping to use for a remote job if I am able to get a job anytime soon, luckily most companies will supply one if that miracle happens.\n\nI am just so drained. I sold all of that so that I could pay rent and still can't. My car is due next, followed by utilities, followed by credit cards and a payday loan. All of that is on one or two extensions at this point. \n\nDays and weeks will pass while I fall more and more behind and it will become less and less likely I will catch up. I failed my wife and my kids, this is just the worst. Tonight I will get in my car which I can't pay for and do some more Postmate runs so I can continue to put food on the table while we still have a table.\n\nBest of luck everyone.",

Yes the hours probably suck and it's hard work, but it will keep you from being homeless until you land a new job. Good luck!",

The bad news is that it's costing me almost all the money I've saved up over the last two years.\n\nI know it sounds like \"duh\" kind of advice, but even as a young adult I never thought about the financial implications of being really lazy about brushing my teeth and having regular checkups with the dentist. I've always had bad teeth as a result, and now I've finally been convinced by the dentist (thankfully) to pay the piper.\n\nI will have 8 more teeth extracted, 4 more fillings, a denture up top and a partial on the bottom. This will cost me $7,500. It really hurts, since my latest paycheck had just put me over $10,000 in savings for the first time in my life. But I'll be able to smile confidently again, and that is priceless.\n\nDon't take your smiles for granted, y'all. This is probably the easiest thing I would change if I had a time machine.

I make alright money, but many factors (including a large family, one income due to wife's health problems, and bad financial decisions/luck) we live paycheck-to-paycheck and have zero savings. Sometimes can't even make it and rely on help and generosity.\n\nBut from the outside, everything appears \"normal\" to my colleagues, many of whom also have children but working spouses/partners. I dress pretty well on days I'm in the office, and packing a lunch isn't unusual for many in our department.\n\nBut I was thinking the other day, as another colleague (who are well meaning and great people) asked me \"what are your vacation plans this summer?\" how it's so hard not to just say \"well, not really much of anything unless it's free!\" Another variation of that question is asking what summer camps they are attending.\n\nSo I usually end up giving them a generic and vague answer. Like \"you know, a few things here and there, nothing crazy\" or \"we'll do some fun things close to home.\" When in reality, they have zero idea that I can't even justifiably afford one night at an AirBnB, much less a full vacation that costs $3k or more. Telling them the truthful answer really isn't helpful or productive either, so I continue to just give appearances that we are just another middle class (if that even exists anymore) family, while they all go to Florida, the Bahamas, Disney, and London (all places my colleagues and their families are going this year, sigh.)\n\nBeing poor sucks, but especially in the summer.",
