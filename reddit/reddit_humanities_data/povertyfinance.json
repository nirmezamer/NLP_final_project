        "content": "Four months ago I posted the following message on this subreddit due to an increase of shitty people who have not read the rules or the community guidelines:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/11vwilh/special\\_enforcement\\_period/](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/11vwilh/special_enforcement_period/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings have not improved significantly.  As such, these policies are no longer temporary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo here is how it is going to be.  Any infraction can (and most likely will) incur a temp ban.  This is to drive home the point that this shit isn't negotiable.  Duration to be determined by the severity of the infraction, but ranging from 1 to 30 days.\n\nA second offense of the same penalty, or getting numerous offenses across different rules will yield longer temp bans with every infraction.  Users who demonstrate that their offenses are innate or deliberate, rather than accidental or incidental will get a full ban.\n\nParticularly shitty people will get a 365 day ban out the gate.  We believe people can change, but we're going to give them lots of time for it.\n\nOvertly evil people, troll accounts, or bad faith people will be banned outright without warning explanation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs always, all actions can be appealed if you believe they are unfair.  HOWEVER, we expect you to review what you said first, and review the rules as well.  If you think we misinterpreted something, got the wrong guy, or whatever, please appeal on those grounds and we will review it.  If you make a bad-faith appeal, whatever ban you have will be extended.  If you come into modmail asking \"why was I banned\" for an obvious infraction you will get an extension.  And please note that saying \"Other kids were doing it too mom\" is not a valid appeal.  If you think other people need to have action taken on them, report their comments as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are a small team.  We can't see everything posted here.  But we sure as hell see all the reports.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit 1:** Intent matters.  Coming here trying to help and breaking a rule will be viewed very differently than coming here with cruel intentions even if the violation is a soft-ball.  \n\n**Edit 2:** Please understand this is still reddit, an anonymous message board filled with sad, miserable, SMALL people.  We won't be able to prevent shitty people wandering in.  We can see them to the door as quickly as they arrive.  **TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE IN REPORTING SHITTY COMMENTS.**  That's how we get these bastards, when you point them out to us.  Also, if you see something shitty, report it and move on.  Don't fight with an idiot, because they will lower you to their level, defeat you with experience, and get both of you banned in the process! ",

        "content": "I (30M) recently, finally went on a date after a while with a girl that I really like. We met through mutual friends and I decided to take her out to dinner yesterday to just a local restaurant that's near my apartment. Throughout the entire date, she would constantly ask me where I work, how much I make and my career goals. I am currently not facing the best financial situation, I work retail and food delivery on the side and trying to pay off a lot of debt. I immediately could tell that when I told her about my financial situation, it seemed as if she lost all interest in me all of a sudden.\n\nI asked her where she works and she told me that she is currently not working and she strongly believes that women should be not working and men should be their providers. Of course, everyone has the right to think what they believe is right, but I just simply mentioned that in this economy, it is currently extremely difficult to be the sole breadwinner, to which she immediately responded that only lazy men think like that.\n\nThe date went relatively ok after that, but this morning I texted her saying that it was cool going out with her yesterday and maybe we should see each other one more time. To which she responded, \"I'm sorry but I am looking for a long term relationship and you clearly are not on the level that I would like my partner to be. I don't mean to sound harsh, but I don't want to build a family with a bum\"\n\nAnyways, dating while poor is extremely difficult. It's probably one of the hardest parts about being poor if you are still single. ",

The take away from this is that it's EASY to weed out (some) the unsuitable people when you're poor.\n\nWhen all is said and done, what are you looking for?  Do you want a partner who is in this struggle with you 100%, who shares your hopes and dreams and wants to work with you to achieve them?  Or are you looking for someone who will leave you when things get tough (and trust me, they will) but who is really hot looking?\n\nThis person came out and said that she's the 2nd type right off the bat.  That's a good thing.",
