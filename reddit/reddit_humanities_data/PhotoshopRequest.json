        "content": "Hi all! Keen eyed wizards may have noticed a few little changes here and there lately and this announcement is to make them all official. So let's get to it.\n\nFirstly, we've begun putting together a wiki for the sub to greater explain all the extra stuff that doesn't fit within the strict character limits of the rules. It will be added to and fleshed out more as time permits, so please bear with us as we work on that.\n\n# Requesters:\n\nDo not work with anyone who did not comment publicly on your request. If anyone contacts you privately about your request, simply ignore them.  If you have a request for which you do not want to post the image(s) to be edited publicly, please provide as much detail as possible about the request and ask that interested editors reply to your post. From there, you can vet the editors who reply by viewing their comment histories and reach out privately to whomever you'd like to work with. Again, **do not respond to any direct private messages about your request.**\n\nAll posts must have a valid flair, either [Free](https://new.reddit.com/r/PhotoshopRequest/wiki/free-requests/) or [Paid](https://new.reddit.com/r/PhotoshopRequest/wiki/paid-requests/).\n\nPlease note that we will not remove editors' comments at your request unless they are in violation of the rules.\n\n# Editors:\n\nDo not contact OP privately for any reason unless they have reached out to you first. Doing so will result in a permanent ban without warning. If you happen upon a request in which OP asks to be contacted privately, do not reach out privately, instead comment that you are interested. You may include a link to your portfolio or a similar edit you've done in the past, but these must be sent publicly. You may also include a link to this post to help educate OP.\n\n* **New** [**requirement**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhotoshopRequest/wiki/requirements/) **for participation in paid requests:**  \nStarting now, participation in free requests is mandatory before being approved to participate in paid requests. Think quality over quantity. Spamming a bunch of free requests with low quality AI edits or going back and submitting a bunch of edits on old requests won't get you very far. Even if you can participate in paid requests, don't overlook the free ones.\n* **New limit on submissions:**  \nFrom now on, editors will be limited to a maximum of 2 submissions per request. If the request involves multiple files, then you may submit 2 edits for each file. For example, you may choose to submit an edit that only covers the request first, and then a second edit that adds some extras like color adjustments or cropping. Note that multiple submissions must be posted as a replies to your first submission. Posting multiple submissions in multiple top-level comments may result in all of your comments being removed for spamming. If you notice an error or something that needs adjusting in your submission, please edit the comment with the updated file rather than making a new comment. If OP asks for an adjustment, then you may provide more edits, but only when requested by OP. It's getting a bit silly with editors flooding 20+ zero-effort submissions on a single request. Again, think quality, not quantity.\n* **Editors must announce received payments:**   \nSomething new, in order to help combat OPs abandoning requests and leaving everyone wondering: if you get paid for a submission, you must either edit your comment to include, or reply to your comment with \"Payment Received\" along with your thank-you and/or the final file. While it is mandatory for OP to thank people and mark the post as solved, we all know many OPs send out payments privately and OPs who are actually paying for edits shouldn't necessarily be punished for not doing so publicly.\n* **Editors must be certain they are working on the full-resolution original files.**  \nDo not edit the preview files. Submissions that are considerably lower resolution (the previews are typically 640px wide) than the originals may be removed. If you receive a payment or tip and you provide a preview-sized file, you may be asked to either refund, or start over.  Check out the browser add-on called [Imagus](https://www.reddit.com/r/imagus/), it will help you. It's available for both [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/imagus/immpkjjlgappgfkkfieppnmlhakdmaab) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/imagus/)\n* **Editors must make an effort.**  \nWe understand that everyone begins somewhere, but also that practice makes perfect. If you've been around here for a while and you're still submitting pure AI edits with no effort made to clean up all the inevitable AI artifacts, then you might find that your approval to submit edits on paid requests may be reconsidered. If you don't bother helping people out with free requests and you only submit sloppy edits, then you may want to rethink your approach to this sub.\n\nAs always, these things are fluid and subject to change. Removals and approvals are always subject to moderators' discretion. We have a few more changes in the works that will be rolling out in the not-too-distant future and that will be covered in the next installment of ***Keith Spends a Week Trying to Write Something Coherent***. If you have any questions or concerns, let us know below.",
