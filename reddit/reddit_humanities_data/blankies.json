            "Spoilers for next week's guest for Scent of a Woman: >!DAVID KRUMHOLTZ!<",
            "Great episode all around, but the revelation that Griffin was raised to disbelieve time was the most compelling moment for me.  10/10, five stars, two thumbs up!",
            "I regret to inform you David mistakenly conflates the U.S. Federal District Court (trial courts) with the United States Courts of Appeals (Nevada and California are indeed both in the Ninth Circuit).",
            "Hall of Fame Ben bit in this episode. David and Alan's laughter realizing what's happening in real time puts it over the top.\n\nI love that Alan knows the movie so well he basically takes over steering the plot summary portion of the pod.",

            "https://i.redd.it/8ug18j4cx88d1.gif\n\nMidnight Run has the best Robert De Niro smirk.\n\nCall me stupid, but for some reason, it took me a while to realize that John Ashton was Marvin Dolfer. Forgive me since I just watched this and Beverly Hills Cop for the first time back to back. It's a testament to Ashon's range from by-to-books cop to scummy bounty hunter. MARVIN WATCH OUT",
            "It blew my mind when I saw this for the first time as it being the sample from The Avalanche\u2019s Since I Left You when De Niro says \u201cyes we would like your *finest* champagnes\u201d",
            "Why aren't you popular with the Chicago Podcast Department?",
            "Grodin playing the greatest movie scumbag in \u201cThe Heartbreak Kid\u201d is still my favorite, but he is so damn funny in this. But moreso this time I was captivated by him with De Niro in the quieter scenes where the movie isn\u2019t in comedy mode, especially when he\u2019s just listening."

I started cracking up to the point of tears in a completely silent, full theater and had to excuse myself twice in order to stop thinking about it and not disturb the crowd. I was laughing so hard that I felt like I was going to throw up, and I really could not tell you why.\n\nAnother moment like that, although one that I think was more of a wink-wink because a few others laughed in the theater, was when Donnie Yen and Keanu first meet in John Wick 4, Yen\u2019s cane pops into frame, Keanu says, very dramatically, \u201cCaine,\u201d and it took me a second to register that he wasn\u2019t just identifying the object in Yen\u2019s hands, but rather that Caine was his character\u2019s name.",
