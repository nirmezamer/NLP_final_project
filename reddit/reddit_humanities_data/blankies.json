            "Spoilers for next week's guest for Scent of a Woman: >!DAVID KRUMHOLTZ!<",
            "Great episode all around, but the revelation that Griffin was raised to disbelieve time was the most compelling moment for me.  10/10, five stars, two thumbs up!",
            "I regret to inform you David mistakenly conflates the U.S. Federal District Court (trial courts) with the United States Courts of Appeals (Nevada and California are indeed both in the Ninth Circuit).",
            "Hall of Fame Ben bit in this episode. David and Alan's laughter realizing what's happening in real time puts it over the top.\n\nI love that Alan knows the movie so well he basically takes over steering the plot summary portion of the pod.",
            "Along with Total Recall, this is my favorite third Brest",
            "It blew my mind when I saw this for the first time as it being the sample from The Avalanche\u2019s Since I Left You when De Niro says \u201cyes we would like your *finest* champagnes\u201d",
            "Why aren't you popular with the Chicago Podcast Department?",
            "Grodin playing the greatest movie scumbag in \u201cThe Heartbreak Kid\u201d is still my favorite, but he is so damn funny in this. But moreso this time I was captivated by him with De Niro in the quieter scenes where the movie isn\u2019t in comedy mode, especially when he\u2019s just listening.",
            "Buckle in for next week. hoo-ah!",
            "I'd never seen Midnight Run until yesterday. Great movie, great episode, great weekend. I love this show. I'm inspired to become a De Niro completist."

            "I think at some point there needs to just be a Madame Web bonus ep, I love hearing them discuss the weirdness of that movie",
            "Griffin\u2019s story about auditioning for this movie is worth a Patreon subscription all by itself!",
            "I actually have an idea for how Ben could be introduced in an extremely slow and drawn-out way\u2026",
            "I\u2019ve listened to the Alice in Wonderland episode so many times, and will confirm that Alice is the movie that Ben declared Burton should be spaced.\n\nEDIT: I believe Dark Shadows was recorded before Alice, so the Johnny Depp fatigue was in full swing.",
            "Buried 2 hours into this episode, my jaw dropped when I heard what Blank Check movie Griff\u2019s cousin watched. Are you kidding me???",
            "Every time David brings up the line from the Friday the 13th remake, I HAVE to point out that the line is \u201cYour tits are STUPENDOUS.\u201d My friends and I were obsessed with how bad this line was in college.",
            "A movie so bad they give up towards the end and just talk August 2014 box office!",

            "Principal Kraft! Very, very sad. Rest in peace",
            "Just watched Clue for the first time the other day and I thought he was fantastic. Loved him in Arrested as well. Seemed like one of those actors that was truly having fun with himself. Had a long  life but a hundred more years would have been nice.",

            "I never quite understood Fernwood 2 Night. Nick at Night used to air it. I watched a Tom Waits interview on there and the tone is kinda weird. Didn't know it was a spinoff of Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman, which is also a thing that doesn't make sense.",
            "Yes. The premise is really just what if the Tonight Show of the 70s were a local cable access/UHF show relying on local luminaries to be their \u201cmovie stars.\u201c Like what if some town in Ohio had its own Tonight Show.",

I started cracking up to the point of tears in a completely silent, full theater and had to excuse myself twice in order to stop thinking about it and not disturb the crowd. I was laughing so hard that I felt like I was going to throw up, and I really could not tell you why.\n\nAnother moment like that, although one that I think was more of a wink-wink because a few others laughed in the theater, was when Donnie Yen and Keanu first meet in John Wick 4, Yen\u2019s cane pops into frame, Keanu says, very dramatically, \u201cCaine,\u201d and it took me a second to register that he wasn\u2019t just identifying the object in Yen\u2019s hands, but rather that Caine was his character\u2019s name.",
