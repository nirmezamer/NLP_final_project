            "I am in my 40s and totally new to investing. I have about 250k and recently had a good conversation with a fiduciary at Captrust and was considering hiring them for 1%. However, Im also thinking about just buying a few investment funds and going it alone. The Bogle approach. I already opened a brokerage account at Schwab and maxed out a Roth IRA, Im now debating on just opening a national and global ETF and being done with it. Im not too worried about it going down. I realize there will be ups and down along the way, its just for retirement. As well as managing my portfolio, would the fiduciary also manage my tax concerns? Thanks!",
            "Why is PYPL down?\n\nAlso, I saw a number of Ethereum ETFs on Robinhood, even though I thought they weren't available yet. Can someone explain what they are and what they do?",
            "I have found if you do not have an complex situation like just have a job want to stick away money for retirement some financial advisor is not needed if you have display\n\nYou already seem to understand the bogle approach what means you are not clueless about investing. Some will help with taxes and tax planning but as far as filing your taxes you would have to ask them",
            "You will probably need to specify your country\n\nBrokerages like banks are highly regulated and not all brokerages service all countries. Then there are some tax considerations depending on the country you are in , like can you buy an accumulating fund that does not generate dividends because it internally re-invests them",
            "PYPL not sure , my guess is there is little moat . You have things like google pay, apple pay , zelle , probably other services \n\nHowever the Ethereum funds you see probably track the pricing using futures contracts vs holding the actual coins",

            "So Ive been researching alot. It seems that most tutorials are for people who at least understand the very basics.\n\nI have some very basic questions.\nSo say I want to start putting part of my salary into S&P500 maybe NASDAQ100 and that kind of thing.\n\nHow would I go about this?\nAs I understand I first need a broker? How can I choose the right broker?\n\nWill my broker also allow me to do trading as well as investing or do I need separate brokers for this?\n\nAlso what about the trading app? I know most people use MT4 or 5 or Trading view for trading? But what about for long term investments? Do I use the same apps or is there a different way I should go about this?\n\nAlso how do I reinvest the earnings. Say if Im holding S&P500 long term and I want to reinvest what I earned and buy more of the index. Do I just sell that portion and buy more for the money? Or is there some automation which can reinvest for me?\n\nAs you can see I am a complete complete beginner. I would really appreciate some help. \n\nThank you very much!\n\nEdit I am from Lithuania"

        "content": "Cheap mortgages are forcing millions of U.S. homeowners to stay put. That is becoming a problem well beyond the property market.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/economy/housing/americas-frozen-housing-market-is-warping-the-economy-35e4f0e5\n\nIf you locked in a dirt-cheap mortgage when interest rates were low, congratulations for being one of the winners in America\u2019s skewed housing market. Renters, realtors and recruiters are among those getting the raw end of the deal.\n\nHigh interest rates have had an unexpected impact on U.S. housing. Instead of triggering a fall in home prices, as happened with commercial real estate, costlier mortgages have pushed residential values higher. The value of the median existing home rose to a record $419,300 in May, according to the National Association of Realtors. Before the pandemic, it was $270,000. \n\nBlame the \u201clock-in\u201d effect of ultracheap mortgages secured when interest rates were low, which are trapping owners in their homes. It is an unforeseen consequence of years of easy money. Two-thirds of outstanding U.S. mortgages have a rate below 4%, according to Morgan Stanley\u2019s housing strategist Jim Egan. Were these homeowners to move, they would have to pay close to 7% for a new 30-year mortgage. The gap hasn\u2019t been as wide since at least the late 1980s.\n\nCompounding the lock-in effect, most people have fixed-rate mortgages today. More than 90% of newly issued home loans in recent years were 30-year fixed-rate loans, compared with two-thirds in the run-up to the 2008 housing crash.\n\nAs more owners stay put, the number of homes on the market has fallen. Tight supply is pushing prices higher, shrinking the pool of buyers who can afford a home. A household earning $100,000 a year can only afford 37% of home listings today, according to the NAR. In a balanced market where there is around five months\u2019 supply of inventory available the number should be 62%.\n\nThe frozen housing market has economic consequences. Spending linked to home sales has dropped. People normally splurge to fix up houses before putting them on the market or to renovate them after they move in. Work has dried up for professionals handling the logistics of transactions, such as attorneys and real-estate brokers. Together with the construction of new homes, these activities normally account for 3% to 5% of U.S. output, the National Association of Home Builders estimates.\n\n\nThe flip side is that millions of households that are locked into cheap mortgage rates can afford to spend elsewhere. They are feeling flush thanks to the $119,000 of additional equity the average U.S. mortgage holder has accumulated over the past four years. This may be one reason why consumer spending has been so resilient in the face of higher interest rates, making it harder for the Fed to bring inflation back to its 2% target. \n\n\nA less obvious loser is the U.S. labor market. Workers are reluctant to accept job offers in another state if it means sacrificing low housing costs, so labor mobility has taken a hit. One study by economists at the University of California Irvine and UC Berkeley estimates that the lock-in effect discouraged 660,000 moves to a new zip code over the year through June 2023.\n\nCraig Picken, co-founder of Northstar Group, a search and recruiting firm of top talent in the aerospace sector, said that it had become difficult to match companies with the right executives because relocations have financial costs that neither employees nor employers want to shoulder. He gave the example of a vice president of engineering trapped in a \u201ctoxic and bureaucratic\u201d workplace with a long commute who nonetheless turned down a new role because he had an existing 3% mortgage.\n\n\u201cHis decision came down to an Excel spreadsheet\u2026The salary increase he\u2019d get with the new job was eaten by higher mortgage costs,\u201d says Picken.\n\nAnother impact of the lock-in effect is that America\u2019s new homes are shrinking. Houses constructed in 2023 were 5% smaller than those built two years earlier. Builders are trying to keep new homes as affordable as possible for first-time buyers, but the trade-off is less space.\n\nSome housebuilders are winners from the supply crunch, specifically large builders like D.R. Horton that have lending arms. They can use excess profit from high home prices to subsidize buyers\u2019 borrowing costs through mortgage buydowns. They are also less reliant on bank loans to finance construction than smaller rivals. This is one reason why the market share of publicly traded home builders jumped to 51% last year, up from 41% in 2021, according to data provider Zonda.\n\nIn theory, if people can\u2019t afford to buy their own homes, landlords should be able to charge more. Rents for individual family homes rose 3% in April compared with a year earlier, according to CoreLogic data. But rents on apartments are barely rising because there is a glut of new supply, offering some relief for tenants for now.\n\nHow long could complications caused by the lock-in effect last? Thomas Ryan, economist at Capital Economics, thinks mortgage rates would need to fall closer to 5% for supply to start to normalize. Most projections are for the 30-year rate to be around 6% by the end of 2025. Even at this level, two-thirds of existing homeowners would still have a mortgage in place that was at least 2 percentage points cheaper.\n\nSome homeowners may decide that they can\u2019t delay big life decisions. Divorces and growing families will always force some people to sell up. But this will only boost supply on the margin. The strangest housing market in decades won\u2019t improve soon.\n\n---\n\nI would just add that housing is easily one of the largest sectors in the economy, and that for most people, their house is by far their most valuable asset.  Back in the 90s and 00s, equity loans from homeowners propelled the stock market to new highs, and may also be partially responsible for the stock market's recent performance post-covid.",

We're in an era of overly optimistic guidance so any time a company is more pragmatic, they get annihilated in the short term. I think their revenue will continue on its steady trajectory. They have a shitton of brand value. Nike isn't going anywhere no matter how objectionable some of their business practices are. There is no reason to think they'll stop being the premier sports brand anytime soon.\n\nIt might actually be a prudent move for companies to get ahead of the market with this type of guidance, because I have a feeling that this era of good vibes is going to have a crash landing for a lot of companies that have been telling investors that they will have exponential growth curves the past few years. Companies that are willing to take their licks now and revise future estimates down are probably going to take less of a beating when reality sets.",
