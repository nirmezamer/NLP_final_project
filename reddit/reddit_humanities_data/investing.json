            "I am trying to help my mom invest some money, and while I know lots about specific aspects, I of course don't know everything under the sun, and what might be best for her situation. For context, we live in Canada.\n\nShe has $10,000 she wants to invest for 8-10 months. She also wants to put in an additional $2k per month for this period. \n\nShe is pretty adamant that she CANNOT lose the principal 10k, as she needs it back at the end of this period. (I think she needs to pay something off at that time.) and she says it has to be \"accessible enough in case of emergency.\"\n\nNow, I know these are some pretty impossible conditions, but is there something for her that would be a \"best option\"? The bulk of my knowledge is on buying stocks, so that's the first thing I recommended to her, but obviously she isn't guaranteed to NOT lose money. I suggested she see an accountant or financial advisor, but she doesn't really want to do that.\n\nAny help is appreciated!",

Derivatives are Wall Street contracts tied to stocks, bonds, currencies or interest rates.\n\nFor example, when asked to quickly test Citigroup\u2019s ability to unwind its contracts using different inputs than those chosen by the bank, the firm came up short,\u00a0[according](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20240621a3.pdf)\u00a0to the regulators. That part of the exercise appears to have snared all the banks that struggled with the exam.\n\n\u201cAn assessment of the covered company\u2019s capability to unwind its derivatives portfolio under conditions that differ from those specified in the 2023 plan revealed that the firm\u2019s capabilities have material limitations,\u201d regulators\u00a0[said](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20240621a3.pdf)\u00a0of Citigroup.\n\nThe living wills are a key regulatory exercise mandated in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis. Every other year, the largest US. banks must submit their plans to credibly unwind themselves in the event of catastrophe. Banks with weaknesses have to address them in the next wave of living will submissions due in 2025.\n\nWhile JPMorgan, Goldman and Bank of America\u2019s plans were each deemed to have a \u201cshortcoming\u201d by both regulators, Citigroup was considered to have a more serious \u201cdeficiency\u201d by the FDIC, meaning that the plan wouldn\u2019t allow for an orderly resolution under U.S. bankruptcy code.\n\nSince the Fed didn\u2019t concur with the FDIC on its assessment of Citigroup, it was overall deemed to have the less-serious \u201cshortcoming\u201d grade.\n\n\u201cWe are fully committed to addressing the issues identified by our regulators,\u201d New York-based Citigroup said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWhile we\u2019ve made substantial progress on our transformation, we\u2019ve acknowledged that we have had to accelerate our work in certain areas,\u201d the bank said. \u201cMore broadly, we continue to have confidence that Citi could be resolved without an adverse systemic impact or the need for taxpayer funds.\u201d",

            "Just a guess without digging too deep. It could mean their administrative controls are lacking and that they are likely underestimating their true risk exposure. This can happen when miscategorizing assets. Different types of assets have different attributable loss estimates given default of the borrower/client (LGD). If you categorize, say, a loan collateralized by real estate as an asset based loan, you are miscounting your total LGD. \n\nThey could also have misaligned notional schedules between their underwriting for loan facilities vs the schedule of their derivative facilities as the people doing the calcs on the derivatives are not always the same folks doing the calcs on the underlying loans, even if both facilities are closing together."

            "I'm guessing when you say \"automatically reinvest,\" you are referring to DRIP, as in auto reinvesting the dividends back into the original source. Depending on your portfolio, it can make reinvestment easier. However, if you want to maintain a set allocation, DRIP is generally bad because it throws away a free opportunity to rebalance your portfolio.\n\nFor example, lets say you have a simple portfolio that holds 50% domestic and 50% international total market. Both pay 2% dividends. In one year, the domestic market gains a lot, while the international market is stagnant. Your allocation becomes skewed 55% domestic and 45% international. But if you remain convinced that the 50/50 allocation is optimal, then you'll need to rebalance by selling some domestic and/or adding more funds to international. One \"free\" way to rebalancing is to use the dividends you get to purchase the underweighted areas. If you use DRIP, you will likely be purchasing more of the overweight areas, which will cause more portfolio skew.",
            "I only DRIP inside tax-deferred accounts, as the investments inside are mostly set it and forget it, and then I rebalance every time I make a deferral/contribution. In my taxable account, I like to make more decisions and do not set anything to automatically invest.",
            "I never do drip. It can be great, but it inadvertently also decreases diversification. I use any divs for adding more of something else I have and want more of or for something new. Usually something else that does a div or something growth I think will appreciate well.\n\nThat said drip works especially with the safer ETFs, but I\u2019d rather use it to diversify into other things that may help balance and do well when others take a downturn.",

            "I always take the dividends in cash and then decide what to do with them.",
            "As I said in another recent thread, DRIP is only if you'd buy the stock at the current price. There's nothing wrong with holding a stock long term but not reinvesting in it. I scooped up some regional banks' stock in 2020 during the worst of the pandemic. They have an excellent yield compared to the purchase price but I think they're currently overvalued compared to general market, so I don't DRIP them. On the other hand, I have some staples like KO and funds like VIG that I just leave reinvesting.\n\n*what do you use it for*\n\nPretty much anything I don't DRIP goes into an VTI/VOO or equivalent fund. All of my brokers have some form of partial share purchase at this point, so it's mostly automated, plus a few days at most.",
