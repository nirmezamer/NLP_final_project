            "Shopping for whole home audio in a new how I am building. Main use case will be ambient music listening. I'd love some in-cieling/wall speaker recommendations (9ft in most cases). Also I am deciding between using 4-5 Wiim AMP Pros (when available) or dedicated AMP and Streamer. Any preference? If the latter, any recommendations on AMP setup?",

            "Need some advice for a stereo setup. I'm the process of buying a pair of Klipsch RP-600M II speakers and  a Klipsch R-121 subwoofer or the tier right below these (still have to decide which would be a better fit in terms of overall dimensions). My main issue is that I have an old AV receiver, specifically the Onkyo TX-NR509. Could I use it to drive the speakers? It's kinda of useless question though (but humor me nonetheless) considering I wanna change to something that has a smaller footprint. Are there any DACs/amplifiers that would be enough to squeeze some decent sound out of these that don't cost an arm and a leg? The main factor I'm taking into consideration is space, so it needs to be compact and fit on my desk (which is not huge) because I will connect it to my desktop PC. Also, I live in Italy in case it's a required detail.",

But it does come with a price that it can overheat the amplifier and the driver if not used carefully. \u00a0This is because the lower the frequency goes, the hotter the amp and driver will become. Our subwoofers are not recommended for party use because in such a noisy environment, one cannot really tell the articulate bass that we have.\u00a0 Many other PA subwoofers are designed for that purpose. If you do intend to use it for extended period of time, we recommend 28hz (the least bass extension) and low damping (boomier) so that you don\u2019t have to turn up volume as much to feel the bass.\u00a0 This way the thermal stress of the driver and the amplifier is less. \u00a0This problem is not just for subwoofer.\u00a0\u00a0 Most customers use their home speakers for party use. But when the driver heats up more than normal, the frequency response will change. \u00a0Higher driver temperature means higher Q in bass and therefore the sound will become \u00a0boomier.\u00a0 Our subwoofers will automatically correct that to maintain same frequency response as if the driver is at cold temperature, but that means even more power are used for the correction.\"",
