            "Shopping for whole home audio in a new how I am building. Main use case will be ambient music listening. I'd love some in-cieling/wall speaker recommendations (9ft in most cases). Also I am deciding between using 4-5 Wiim AMP Pros (when available) or dedicated AMP and Streamer. Any preference? If the latter, any recommendations on AMP setup?",
            "Need some advice for a stereo setup. I'm the process of buying a pair of Klipsch RP-600M II speakers and  a Klipsch R-121 subwoofer or the tier right below these (still have to decide which would be a better fit in terms of overall dimensions). My main issue is that I have an old AV receiver, specifically the Onkyo TX-NR509. Could I use it to drive the speakers? It's kinda of useless question though (but humor me nonetheless) considering I wanna change to something that has a smaller footprint. Are there any DACs/amplifiers that would be enough to squeeze some decent sound out of these that don't cost an arm and a leg? The main factor I'm taking into consideration is space, so it needs to be compact and fit on my desk (which is not huge) because I will connect it to my desktop PC. Also, I live in Italy in case it's a required detail.",

What amplifiers have you run that pushed enough current to these needy ones? \n\nCurrently running WIIM Pro to smsl SU1 to Fosi v3. Budgeting $1k USD. Don't have anywhere local to try gear. Internet and YouTube research has made me think about the Rotel A10 mk ii or arcam A5. This is a streaming only setup in an unfinished basement. Max volume around 85 db at less than 10 ft from speakers.",
            "My Sony Ult FIeld 1 speaker makes a high pitched ringing sound whenever it is turned on, I have tried connecting it to different devices, switching between AAC and SBC, and moving the speaker to different places. What could I do to fix this issue?",
            "Is a BlueSound Node a good way to experience lossless hifi music? Hooked up to an integrated amp. I just got a nice amp and my only source so far is my turntable, which really limits my selection. Looking to for a good way to hear more. Would a phone with an external DAC be a good way to hear or would a streamer like a BlueSound Node be better?",
            "Hello, I am looking to put in a 4 ceiling speaker and 2 floor sub system into my office, what kind I know nothing about sound systems and do not really trust my local AV companies. What size amp do I need? I am also very open to receiving brand/model recommendations. Was going to do research and try and figure out best quality to price and also just the best system as well.\n\nThank you in advance to anyone who is able to help.",

            "Hi,\nI have the opportunity to buy the Sanyo JA 220 and Yamaha A-700 amplifier for a similar price.  I wanted to ask - which amplifier should be a better choice?  I will add that I rather listen to rock, jazz and hip-hop music, although it would be nice if the amplifier was relatively universal.  Thanks in advance for your help",
            "Needing advice on connecting turntable to my setup.\n\nI just bought pair of Genelec 8030cs, Topping d10 as dac and Palmer monicon for volume control for those active speakers. I will connect all three to each other with xlr cables. In theory could I connect my turntable with rca output to phono amp and from that use rca-xlr cable to that Palmer volume controller and from that to those speakers since they are active speakers? Sorry for my poor english.",

Both uncle and aunt died too early, so I decided to build my own Sanyo system in remembrance of them. Took me some time to do it, but now I have my Sanyo tower and it always reminds me of him and that carefree days that are long gone",

I've now owned my Martin Logan Request electrostatic speakers for perhaps 25 years, and they still delight me to the point where it's hard to imagine ever feeling the urge to replace them. I also have 20 year old Macintosh MC602 power amp that similarly continues to perform flawlessly.  My ancient Velodyne ULD-15 II servo subwoofer recently required a foam surround replacement. While there are almost certainly newer products with a slight edge, I don't feel like I'm missing anything when I listen to my system, and certainly not an improvement that would justify the high cost of upgrading.\n\nI hope that everyone can eventually get to this point in their hi-fi adventure, where they can stop fussing, and just relax and enjoy the music.",

Nevertheless, its been a productive few days so Ive kicked my son upstairs, broken out some records. Ive also treated myself to an actual bottle of Spaten pilsner which is not the easiest thing to get hold of in provincial UK and Im enjoying it out of a glass Iborrowed from a Munich hotel many years ago. Late Night Final is running and the weekend fizzles with possibilities.

You could be very proud. I just got so used to tubes when I see such a beautiful picture. It feels like something is missing, I have never had many problems with any good quality tube amp , but its a real pain in the ass when you need tubes when I was a kid I could re- tube With the best tubes for maybe 30 $40 now its 300 and400 $ and you gotta & kiss somebodys ass just to get them getting too old for that bullshit. I think Im on my way to SS, slowly, but surely really beautiful system in that picture picture\n",
