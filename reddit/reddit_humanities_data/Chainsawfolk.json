As a result the art contest is going to be extended till the end of June.\n\nHere are the rules (slightly adjusted):\n\n- Submissions must be flaired \u201cart contest\u201d.\n- Art must follow the rules as done by oc fanart posts.\n- Art should fit into a circle so the subreddit icon is legible. It won\u2019t be disqualified if it isn\u2019t but the mods might have to make drastic edits to make it fit.\n- Users can only have one submission each. They\u2019re free to change it at any time before July but they can only have one at any time \n\nContest\u2019s open till July 1st, when we will release a poll that\u2019ll run for a week to determine the winner.",

Makima was still so obsessed with Chainsaw Man she would've put a target on Denji's back so he would've been lit up and his resolve would've been put to the test pretty early on, since he would not be able to avoid killing a Devil in that form he would've been on everyone's radar.",
