            "Braius is confirmed to be a Tragedy bard on Cooldown, at least level 3 to get the Sorrowful Fate feature. And he also used Blinding Smite, Moonbeam and Misty Step, which suggests at least level 9 Oath of the Ancients paladin (but Misty Step could have come from a feat, so he could still be Oath of the Watchers). I just can't believe Sam played a Tragedy bard before Liam!\n\nEdit: Braius is also 1 level higher than BH. I wonder if his build necessitates it. But I think BH will level up as soon as we come back to them after Downfall",
            "I thought the episode was good. I'm curious how the \"aeor security footage\" trilogy will effect BH. It might not sway them for or against the gods or Ludinus. I appreciate that they didn't just go \"well, July is vacation month NO CONTENT ALL MONTH BYE...\" \n\nMocktails for everyone! Break out the Beau Tiki Mugs and the Strongjaw Ale for Spooky In July!",
            "So instead of Matt describing a vision, we're going to see it play out in real time. \n\nThat is fucking cool.",
            "I'm honestly really excited to see Downfall, and see Brennan DM again. The Cooldown on Beacon has some fun information about what to possibly expect with it.",
            "To be real about the schedule for a sec: Summer vacations are going to be happening cause it is real hard for working families to vacation together at other times. So Sam, Liam, probably Laura and Travis were going to be missing some extended time over summer. Its totally reasonable to schedule around this, and ultimately a good thing for the cast, their families, the show in general. The alternative to interrupting the BH narrative was probably no shows at all, until they committed fully to the split-cast idea this campaign.",
            "So matt confirmed in the cool down that this is not Patia's orb. This is a different orb that was very \"invasive\" and recorded all means of threats either physical or mental. So it would have recorded divine thoughts and intentions. So these next 3 weeks are going to be from the view of the gods i assume?",
            "I'm fairly sure this pause being as long as it is isn't just because their going on vacation. Correct me if I'm wrong but they were running like 2-3 weeks ahead on streaming dates prior to this live show and in order to do a live show for the campaign that means they had to run up to current, which probably means there was a) a several week gap between the live show and the last episode. and b) now to get back to their normal prerecorded schedule they'll need more time. So I think that's why the main cast won't be fully back until August proper.",
            "Am I the only one who was caught off guard by Braius' art? To me that's a tiefling, I don't think I've ever seen art of minotaurs with a 100% human face. I'm not complaining or anything, but it really made me rethink how I imagined minotaurs in exandria",
            "Loved Sam's new character. Although it may take a while to get there, I'm looking forward to see Braius get more integrated into the group and forge bonds with BH and those they meet.\r\n\nMy prediction that Sam's character was going to be a Changebringer Paladin turned out to be  half correct, and my prediction/hope for Brennan to make a cameo as Asmo didn't come true... but what I got was even better. I'm all for and hyped for Downfall! Brennan is back! As a lore nerd, I'm so hyped to delve into it. Can't wait to see what he and the cast weave together.",
            "For being a Minotaur, Braius has a very human-looking face. Wonder what the story there is."

The maniacal giggling of Ashton during combat was something I missed in the character especially in recent times. Personally I saw Ashton as the center of attention during the whole fight because his attitude gave the impression as if it was a game for him and he always knew what was going on so he could just relax and have fun fighting.

Should i just watch a recap of the first 27 episodes and skip directly to episode 28 or should i just watch the episodes since its my first time watching. Would i miss anything important?\n\nEdit;thank you to everyone who replied and gave their insight.

            "Orion / Tiberius can be very... off-putting... and is certainly a stain on the first episodes, but I'd still at least try to watch them unless you have some personal issues related to misogyny, crude sexual innuendo of the non-humerous variety, or anything like that. You wouldn't be completely lost or out of the loop by skipping them all, but there are some genuinely good moments and context that I'd at least try to watch.",
            "I LOVED the beginning episodes honestly. Tiberius gets annoying but its only bad in a few episodes and you can just skip ahead during those parts. People hate on him but i felt he had some good moments. And they honor his character well after he leaves the campaign.",
            "I will say having watched Critical Role because of seeing the trailer for 'TLoVM' I watched the campaign from episode 1 without any knowledge of what happened and while I definitely noticed the problem player eventually, it didn't affect me much, plus seeing early Critical Role is something that I think shouldn't be missed. That's me tho.",
            "Watch all of them. The issues with Orion do not negate or outweigh the other 99% of amazing content. There are SO many great moments you'd hate to miss. Even more importantly, there are characters and threads that you won't understand as well, if you skip. Also note that the cast thought enough of Tiberius and their friend, to give him a very nice story ending, later.\n\nTruth be told, I watched all episodes from the beginning, before I knew of the issues. I actually just thought that Tiberius was kinda flirty and being goofy-inappropriate sometimes... *literally just like Scanlan was*. I am a grown woman, and I was no more offended by Tiberius, than I was by Scanlan (which is to say that I wasn't).",
            "The Kraghammer arc rules! IMHO its the best showcase of traditional DnD while also having absolutely wonderful RP given who the cast is. Plus you meet an important NPC and an absolute fan favorite NPC. Youll also have to tolerate some dodgy audio at points.\n\nOn the stain of the early eps, I truthfully think Orions shittiness comes in waves. He has great episodes and he has ones where you can visibly see the tension. Ultimately his last 2-3 are borderline unwatchable but you can always zip through the parts that make you feel uncomfortable.",
            "I'd highly recommend trying to power through, there are a lot of ideas and people you miss out on. If you find the audio issues/cast issues get to be too much, at least try to start around ep 16. It introduces an extremely important location in Exandrian lore and within a couple of episodes introduce some characters that come up several times in the campaign, as well as some that cross campaigns.",
            "I would recommend watching them. imo Orion doesnt get bad until episode 11, then he gets better, and then he gets worse again. He also doesnt sexually assault any of the cast members, he made a gross comment toward Laura during his last episode and wrapped his arms around Marisha the episode before when she told him not to. There are a lot of great moments and NPCs in those episode that you probably dont want to miss.\n\nWhen I watched them I just skipped the parts that made me uncomfortable and it was fine. To me, the worst part of early campaign 1 is the audio issues, twitch chat being shown on screen (I would find a way to cover it if I were you), and the YouTube comments being absurdly critical of the cast but especially Marisha",
            "I really loved those episodes, Tiberius aside. \n\nYou get the first on stream betrayal, a good final boss fight, lava damage for everyone, etc.",
            " I say watch the first 28. Im currently finishing episode 13 and it really gives you an opportunity to learn to love every character from the beginning. I read plenty about Orion but I still feel like this was the best decision. Theres a lot of reaaaaal cool moments!\n\nEdited to add I LOL",
            "They're great episodes, and honestly, just knowing that he's a problem player right off the bat lets you just roll your eyes and sigh with the rest of the fandom. It's like watching a live r/rpghorrstories post. Power through, you'll be happy you did. And seriously, he's not that bad unless you have a major DND PTSD problem player trigger."
