        "content": "I have seen so many instances, over the last week, of people chiming in on posts for listings and for rooms that they don't agree with the price. I have seen people making fun of OP's, I have seen people insulting OP's, and I have seen people making borderline threats towards OP's. Quite simply, this will not be tolerated.\n\nThis is a community where everyone should feel free to post their open apartments, listings, room or whatever, without being harassed. If someone asks for advice, and your two cents, by all means give it if you want to. If they're just posting trying to find someone, leave your thoughts to yourself. \n\nAt the end of the day, the market will sort itself out, and you don't need to make these people's lives any harder. Stop being a dick. Any comments going forward that criticize someone's listing will result in an immediate 7 day ban. Repeat offenders will be banned permanently.\n\nBe nice to each other. That is all",

The building is a pre-war, but the apartment is recently renovated.\n\nI open the dishwasher and instantly find a cockroach crawling around inside. I feel like that\u2019s a bad sign, but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m overreacting? We do live in a city after all, so this could\u2019ve been a random sighting, or is it?\n\nUnfortunately the tenants weren\u2019t home, because I would\u2019ve asked if they dealt with any infestations. I\u2019d love to hear everyone\u2019s input on whether I should still apply for it or keep looking!",

            "I'm going to give a different take from everyone else in the comments. Based on the clutter in the kitchen plus the dishwasher being nearly full I'm going to take a guess that the tenant may not be the cleanest which would lead to roaches no matter which apartment you're in.\n\nIf the price is right just ask for a deep cleaning plus roach spraying before you move in.",
            "We had a dishwasher in nyc once. Spotted one in the kitchen. Then another. Then a family was inside the panel of the dishwasher where its warm and hot from all the use. Nearly had a heart attack. RUN."

            "Also, getting to the more important part, the application fees should generally not be that high. Really depends on the building. No advances before the contract is signed. Usually a 1 month security deposit with first month rent is required upfront. If going through broker either a 1 month broker fee is also charged. (Broker fee may vary as some brokers charge 10% of the annual rent instead).",
            "The first thing you should do is go onto StreetEasy. That should give you the idea what the apt prices are in your area. \nMultiple things to look at when getting an apartment. \n2200 is a good enough budget depending on exactly which place you want to be in. \nWasher/Dryer situation. While in-unit can get expensive. I would suggest something in building is much better. However, if there is nothing in the building atleast there should be one near the apt. \nProximity to public transportation is also important. \nFor the apt itself, the actual condition of the building should be taken into account when viewing said property. If the building is clean/ well maintained when youre looking at the apartment, chances are if there is a problem in the future, the landlord/super should be able to help you with that."
