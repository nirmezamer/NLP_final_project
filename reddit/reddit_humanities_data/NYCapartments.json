        "content": "I have seen so many instances, over the last week, of people chiming in on posts for listings and for rooms that they don't agree with the price. I have seen people making fun of OP's, I have seen people insulting OP's, and I have seen people making borderline threats towards OP's. Quite simply, this will not be tolerated.\n\nThis is a community where everyone should feel free to post their open apartments, listings, room or whatever, without being harassed. If someone asks for advice, and your two cents, by all means give it if you want to. If they're just posting trying to find someone, leave your thoughts to yourself. \n\nAt the end of the day, the market will sort itself out, and you don't need to make these people's lives any harder. Stop being a dick. Any comments going forward that criticize someone's listing will result in an immediate 7 day ban. Repeat offenders will be banned permanently.\n\nBe nice to each other. That is all",

DO NOT SEND THIS SCAMMER MONEY. They will request a $200+ application fee without showing you any apartment (because they DO NOT own it). It is a scam. Do not fall for these listings asking you to contact an \"owner\" under a different number than the broker's number on the listing.\n\nI just don't want more people to fall for these. These scammers are awful.",

We are looking to move in around the start of august, likely no later than the 15th.\nThank you guys in advance",

The point is that my income has only been decent the past year. \n\nI heard as a freelancer you have to show 3 years of income but my income has not been the same for the past 3 years. \n\nI would really love to move to NYC but I don\u2019t know if I would meet the strict rent guidelines? Would I just need a guarantor? I don\u2019t have a person so I\u2019d need a third party guarantor :(\n\n",
