        "content": "Hello, Community!\n\nA little over a month ago we released [a poll ](https://new.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/1cfe9m0/poll_should_rskyrim_have_post_flairs/) asking whether you\u2019d be interested in having post flairs on the subreddit. The results were very clear: You supported post flairs, but they had to be optional.\n\nHaving optional flairs means that it\u2019s up to you to decide whether you want to use them. We encourage everyone to do so but rest assured that you will not be reprimanded for not using them. The flairs are simply to make it easier for people to filter through the content they want to see.\n\n# Post flairs on r/Skyrim\n\nWe have introduced the following post flairs:\n\n* **Discussion**: For general discussions about the game. This could be discussions about your favorite questline, character, item, etc.\n* **Question**: Similar to the above but used with the intention of asking for help related to gameplay. Maybe you\u2019re wondering how to level a skill most efficiently, how to make lots of money, how to defeat a certain boss, etc.\n* **Bug Help**: A flair to show that you need assistance with a game bug.\n   * Note: The [UESP Wiki](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Main_Page) contains many lists of bug fixes. Every quest has its own dedicated page too. If you need help solving a bug, consider checking the relevant page too. For example, if you run into one of the many bugs in the Blood on the Ice quest, go [here](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Blood_on_the_Ice) and look for the \"Bugs\" section.\n* **Lore**: For discussions about the amazing lore found in the Elder Scrolls universe! How did the Dwemer disappear? What really happened to the ancient Snow Elves? Who was Talos really?\n* **Arts/Crafts**: For you to show off your crafts! Arts, tattoos, woodworking, etc. Everything goes as long as it's directly related to Skyrim. Do keep rule 10 (Limit Your Self Promotion) in mind, though.\n* **Screenshots/Clips**: A flair for posts featuring game screenshots and clips. Show off your character, your cool items, or how you\u2019ve killed Nazeem for the 10th time (today).\n* **Modding**: For posts that deal with modding. This could be asking for recommendations, posting reviews, or general discussions about modding.\n   * Be aware that if you seek modding support (e.g. solving conflicts or incompatibilities), r/skyrimmods is a better place to post. It\u2019s totally fine to ask for support here, but the modding subreddit is generally more knowledgeable about modding. You\u2019re more likely to get professional help there from people that have the necessary experience and know-how. Posts with the \u201cModding\u201d flair will be met by an AutoMod message echoing this.\n\n# Feedback\n\nIf you have any feedback on post flairs, feel free to comment below or write us through Modmail! We\u2019re open to ideas (or criticism, should you have any). We'll make sure to do our part in monitoring the use of flairs and conversations about them.\n\nHave a nice weekend, everyone!",

            "Can there be multiple bug help flairs? Not everyone is willing or able to use console commands or mods to fix a bug, so it'd be helpful if there was something that would let us know whether the OP is open to a solution using either of those.\n\nAnd would it be possible to have the automod reply to bug help posts with a link to UESP?",
            "On old reddit, they're just plain text on white. They could do with prettying up.",
            "I'll speak with the team about the first one and see if we can find a way to implement it that makes sense.\n\nThe second one about linking to the UESP should be simple, though. I'll take a look at it.",
            "Thanks for the heads-up. I'll see if we can do something about that."

Especially arcade games. So now I am so adamant about saving and not wanting to redo shit, I save like a madman, lol\n Anyway. Just wanted to share this little bit with all of you. Any from my generation wanna comment on how it sucked to not be able save and we had to wait for stupid passwords to be invented to at least have some save point, please post, lol. ",
