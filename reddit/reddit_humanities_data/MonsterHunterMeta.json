Such as, for each element, which weapon has the superior damage output, glaive or db. \n\nIf no direct answer, what would be the best way to starting comparing numbers between them in sunbreak?\n\nThanks for any help.

            "DB will usually put more damage output than IG because of how strong element scales in Sunbreak and DB gets a 1 wirebug silkbind that can be spammed and deals a ton of damage. IG has much more utility than DB. Both are really good nonetheless.",
            "DB will easily out damage IG if using proper end game sets.\n\nIn the end game, you can easily use one set for all elements and just adjust the decos. DB uses a berserk/strife set while IG uses a mix of risen elders, primal and amatsu.",
            "IG main here as well, and before the IG was introduced I mained the Dual Blades. As a longtime user of both, I can tell you with a fair bit of confidence that no matter how they tweak combat in Wilds, Dual Blades will always beat Insect Glaive in terms of straight damage output.\n\nI plan on running *either* IG and LBG or IG and DB, depending on whether or not I can tolerate LBG. \n\nI consider the Insect Glaive a *utility* weapon, not a DPS weapon, and even in World I build it as such, and build for Paralysis, with a Heal or Poison Kinsect, and a Sleep wep for my Palico. I use the Glaive to CC the ever living hell out of the target without needing to stop. Middling DPS but with near 100% uptime and plenty of control via status and mounting. \n\nIn Wilds, I'll do exactly the same, but I'll bring Dual Blades for the latter half of the fight, built for maximum damage output and nothing else, to capitalize on the weakening I manage with the Glaive. This will also give me a lot of flexibility, having a universal utility weapon to shut down monsters I'm unfamiliar with, and DB in my back pocket to annihilate whatever else exists. \n\nAlso, I realize this is a bit off topic, but I'd just like to reiterate that the Glaive really isn't a great DPS choice. It seems purpose-built to dominate in the form of control rather than big deeps. Consider that when building it with the option of another weapon to run along side it!",
            "It\u2019s good to know the db armour will be easy to make. I\u2019ll see if I can find the builds you mentioned. Thanks!",
            "This is actually great to hear. I\u2019ve been thinking of swapping my glaive sets to status based, and with DB clearly outpacing them in element, this cements my decision. Thanks for the insight.",
            "You can try checking the !megathread. The builds are more or less similar but there's always room for adjustments based on what augments and talismans you were able to get.\n\nPersonally, I use the same build for DB and Bow as the berserk/strife set is really good for them. Then for my IG, they can work for majority of melee weapons that build crit like LS, SnS, hammer, Lance, etc. You can aim for universal skills for augments then adjust the decos and talisman as needed.",

At the end of the day, the overall skills you get in the build is what matters."

Everything I can find through searching says Aquashot Pierce 3 is more DPS, but all of my testing says otherwise.\n\nBut when putting it to the test I get completely different results I was testing mostly on Shara's first phase and my DPS with aquashot was about 80-90, but with Fatalis Depths I was hitting like 110-120 DPS. Does anyone have any info on these two LBGs on which is best overall?\n\nWas also curious with the Fatalis Depths if its better to go for the normal reload but slightly slower fire rate due to recoil or the slow reload with the faster fire rate. From my little bit of testing it seems like the slow reload is a faster DPS overall but im not 100% sure on that.",

Sorry can't say to safi or fatty gun,  but fatalis weapons just kinda outclassed safi overall.  Pick whichever you feel hurts more. If you're making aqua do more than the fatty one mostly,  use the one YOU can use most effectively and forget the meta",
            "Recoil+1 slow reload on fatty lbg rf p2 comes with power barrel, so in matchups where the weakspot isn't large enough for p2 to get all dmg ticks off, I think that config wins. I haven't tested it much though, I mostly run vor buster p3"

Otherwise, everything else matches up with the build so did they make a mistake or did a patch remove a decoration slot?
