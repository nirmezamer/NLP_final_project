We encourage you to as all your questions here, as this will help us cut down on the number of repetitive posts we get on the front page! This thread is linked with the #questions channel on our [Discord](http://discord.gg/hoggit) so that any time someone posts a new comment in here, it will be reviewed and replied to quickly! If you felt like you had a question but didn't want to bother people with it, now's your chance.\n\nAs always, we also have a discord for hoggit over at [http://discord.gg/hoggit](http://discord.gg/hoggit) which you can use for chatting with other members of the hoggit community. And don't forget to check out our wiki at [http://wiki.hoggitworld.com](http://wiki.hoggitworld.com/)\n\nHoggit Training Server runs a training MP mission that runs 24/7 that's focuses on training up the newer folks (just like this weekly thread). Every DCS module is available in this mission, and there are numerous ranges to test your skills at. There are frequently knowledgeable folks around to answer any questions you might have, or show you how to do what it is you're looking to learn. Anyone can join, even if you've never stepped foot in a MP session before.\n\n^(If you're interested in teaching/instructing at hoggit, please poke squinkys on Discord!)\n\nServer is be named `Hoggit - Training Map`. The password is `hoggit1fw`. SRS will be available at `tnn.hoggitworld.com` (it should autoconnect, but if not, use that). Come in, have a good time, learn a few things and teach a few things.\n\nThe only rule is Do not teamkill, unless the other party is a willing combatant...ie: you can dogfight if you find a partner...just don't shoot down some random A-10 trying to learn how to land.\n\n**Please review our FAQ on our wiki before posting here:** [**https://wiki.hoggitworld.com/view/Frequently\\_Asked\\_Questions**](https://wiki.hoggitworld.com/view/Frequently_Asked_Questions)",

If you are out-of-the-loop:\n\n* RB has publicly accused ED of withholding payment from module sales from ED's webstore, and as a result the 3rd party has ceased all ongoing development for DCS.\n* ED confirmed that they have been witholding payments from RB over an ongoing IP violation dispute.\n* RB has stated the ED's accusation of IP violation is nonsense, and ED has stopped commenting on the situation altogether.\n\nThanks to this, the futures of the F-15E, M-2000C, Harrier, and MiG-19 are all up-in-the-air. Different members of the RB team have stated that ED does not have the source code for any of their modules, which was corroborated by NineLine when he stated in the ED Discord that they are unable to support any RB modules in the long term...meaning if ED/RB can't find a way around this impasse, the F-15E, M-2000C, Harrier, and MiG-19 all go the way of the VEAO Hawk.\n\nDespite the uncertain future of all of these modules, ED continues selling them on their store, compared to Razbam, who disabled the ability to purchase the modules from their own storefront. At this time, we strongly recommend that community members exercise caution when considering the purchase of these modules. There is a real possibility that they will remain unsupported until their eventual removal from the DCS: World platform, just like the Hawk.\n\nWe encourage ED to provide the DCS community with an update to this situation. We also encourage them to remove these products from their storefront until the situation is resolved...it's *really* not a good look to be selling a product that is currently unsupported. And lastly, u/NineLine_ED, u/BIGNEWY, u/NSSGrey, u/dotrugirl...please feel free to stop by and let us know if any point raised here is incorrect in any way. We would love some clarity on this situation.\n\nTo the community, we encourage you to use this post as a megathread to discuss the situation, but we will not be squashing other discussions that occur outside of this thread as the situation continues to develop.",

In this newsletter, we\u2019d like to bring you up-to-date on these ongoing efforts.\n\nWe are currently reworking the target detection of ground units. Here is how it works now: The AI detects a target as soon as it enters the \u201ckill zone\u201d and the target is immediately designated for attack, if the target is within range. In the new version, the range and time after which the target is detected will depend on the crew's level of training, the unit's state (GREEN or RED STATE) and the sights with which the unit is equipped (magnification and field of view).\n\nLet's consider an example:\n\n* An aircraft approaches a BMP-2. The BMP is in a GREEN state and the crew are visually searching the surroundings). An \"average\" crew will detect the aircraft at a distance of 2.0-3.5 km, while an \"excellent\" crew will detect the aircraft at 4-5 km. As you can see, the values \"float\" because the AI has a probability of detection depending on the range.\n* In another situation, the BMP-2 crew is in RED state with hatches closed and observation only conducted through the commander and gunner sights. Consequently, it will be more challenging for the crew to see the enemy. Additionally, the target may not be in the sights' field of view (for example, the aircraft approaches from a high altitude).\n\nLet's consider another case where we are dive bombing a target convoy from 4000m. Within the convoy are 10 units that include a tank, infantry fighting vehicles, and a SAM. As seen in the screenshot, five units (SAM and 4 IFVs) managed to react to our attack, but only the SAM managed to attack.\n\nThus, the upcoming change should address this issue of non-air defense ground units being too capable of engaging aircraft. However, as mentioned earlier, this is just our first step and we will continue to refine the ground AI especially pertaining to line of sight such as trees and obstacles, meteorological conditions, target parameters such as airspeed and maneuvering, and manual aiming compared to sensor-aided aiming. We will also add more varied firing methods such as barrage fire versus directed fire, which is particularly relevant for manually aimed guns. Please stay tuned as we keep you updated on our progress of Ground AI.\n\n# UH-1H Worlds Apart Stormfront\u00a0-Campaign by Low-Level-Heaven Mission Development\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yu2gdh5s3a9d1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=09cd3513444e2ac28b9aef64f0ce669124505d32\n\nIntroducing the STORMFRONT campaign for the DCS: UH-1H, the latest story-driven campaign set in the SPRING of 2025. As a continuation of the WORLDS APART series, you step into the boots of a German UH-1H helicopter pilot of the renowned German Army \"WOLF PACK\" Squadron (Heeresflieger). This campaign offers a rich narrative experience with 12 missions, three of which are split into A and B segments, totaling 16 missions. Each mission builds upon the previous, delivering a seamless and evolving storyline with multiple tasks per mission.\n\nSTORMFRONT is designed to challenge even the most seasoned pilots, yet it provides extensive support for beginners, ensuring a rewarding journey for all. With countless language outputs and a comprehensive 77-page manual detailing every mission, STORMFRONT immerses you deeply into its demanding yet exhilarating world. Prepare to experience the intensity and intricacy of modern helicopter operations in this meticulously crafted campaign coming in the next DCS Update.\u00a0\n\nWe truly hope you are taking advantage of the important savings in the Summer Sale and that the development progress on the Ground Units AI is to your satisfaction.

            "Really excited for the AI update (finally, an AI update!) - definitely sounds like a solid start. Detection probability is definitely a good start, as is accounting for the FOV of optics and sights, particularly when buttoned up.\n\nOne thing I wonder about though is group behaviour, can we expect to see not only individualistic behaviour (where a unit must acquire a target by itself) but also behaviour more appropriate to groups where even though only one unit might've spotted a threat, the presence and direction is communicated to other members of group (perhaps taking into account RNG and skill level to determine how fast, how accurate and if this happens at all)?",
            "I wonder if it takes TREES into account when figuring out the detection.",

            "I might be jumping the gun here, but did no-one think that the name \"Stormfront\" is not a particularly good name for a campaign about a German squadron called \"Wolfpack\"?  \nGerman game censors can be a little more sensitive than others on things that can be misrepresented as supporting a more extremist past.  \n\nI hope it's to do with the content of the mission rather than promoting some ideas."
