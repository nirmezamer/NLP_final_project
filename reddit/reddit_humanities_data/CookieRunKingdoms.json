I didn't do any promotion of the sub before the game came out, but in about(?) a day, we've already hit 500 members!\n\nAnyways, uh, unless you have a post that's pretty big news or has a good reason to be here, you should move to r/CookieRunTOA. This is a sub about Kingdom specifically, and now there's a sub for TOA specifically\n\n~~also we just made a sub discorb and i'll be looking for the next mod there hehehe~~",
