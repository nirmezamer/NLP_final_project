I'd like to do more, but I think 15-20 minutes is a safe bet for now. I know little to nothing of technique, and have just been following a book I'm reading, and guided videos, both on mediumship. I don't need to be held accountable, but I'm open to some direction.",

            "Why does it bother you so much? Perhaps those people enjoy being toxic. I'm sure you also have a dark side that wants to be toxic.\n\nOnce you've integrated your dark side, it will become much easier to observe them with compassion.",
            "I get what you're intending and agree it's a great mindset in most stations. Small things shouldn't knock you out of your lane. But toxic positivity is just as bad/damaging as toxic negativity. \n\nTelling yourself your feelings aren't valid because they're negative, when your situation legitimately calls for it, can cause self worth issues and lead to not standing up for yourself when required. It can make people think the problem is themselves when sometimes it isn't.\n\nHolding on to anger and resentment isn't helpful or beneficial, as it doesn't effect the situation or other person, shouldn't be someone's default mode of thought but negativity has its place. I think to be balanced simply means recognising whether it's warranted.",
            "I would imagine that a large number of people that have issues like depression would disagree with you.  \n\nWhy think that way? The answer is usually trauma and mental illness. We are all conditioned by our past experiences, how we are treated by others, and how we were spoken to by others as children.  \n\nIt isn\u2019t always as easy as changing one\u2019s perspective, chanting om for 20 minutes and doing some deadlifts.",
            "Our psychology tends towards the negative, for most people, so I think creating a balance is important. Not repression of the negative, but a counterbalance of providing more positive thinking. Did an exercise with some clients, where each day they counterbalanced some of their negative thinking with the opposite. Adding in, rather than taking away anything. All noticed improvements in their mood in just a week.",
            "Exactly! \ud83d\ude4c It's so toxic when people get stuck in that hopeless mindset. There's no point in dwelling on the negative when you could be focusing on how to make things better. It's all about perspective and taking action!",
            "I fully understand why people think that way - I think the reason I don't like it is because I myself have this trait. I think it is natural human behavior. But I also believe we should fight back against this mentality and not accept it - because I truly believe it brings no benefit to our life and really hurts us. We go about our entire life not living the way we want to because of it. :(",
            "Oooo I love this technique.",
            "Yesssss, this is what I think too, but I am curious if there is any argument for the other side.",
            "We all have this trait. Neurotic people more than others. I definitely felt hopeless for a loooong time. But you are correct - it's not beneficial. And the only way out is through practice of some sort. I've picked up Buddism over more conventional methods such as CBT or classic therapy. Buddism is close in practice but comes with a spiritual undertone that gives hope and motivation. So, even if I feel hopeless these days sometimes, there's the practice i can turn to and that makes me calmer and gives me the seeds I need to plant in my head to start growing a better mental harvest (so to speak).\n\nBut it's a battle of a lifetime..."

            "There's a neurological aspect involved here; once certain mechanisms are triggered, our responses become deeply instinctual. Acknowledging this, and understanding the biochemical processes at play, and that they always eventually stabilize, forms the basis of my approach. Also, through meditation I've developed a heightened sensitivity to my emotional state and a more frequent awareness. By combining these two concepts I have been able to manage my speech and behavior much better during emotional overloads.",
            "Shock your nervous system. Crank the AC, cold shower, put ice packs on your head, suck on a lemon.",
            "Lengthen the exhale. Rage is a sympathetic response, when the exhale is longer than inhale it activates the parasympathetic nervous system. This focus also brings you to the present and out of racing thoughts.\n\nYou are not your thoughts. Let them pass especially when in rage mode.",
            "First of all, it is totally ok to let your rage burst, do not blame yourself! I believe you are doing great. In my perspective, I would try to feel the environment (like feel the light and sound in the room) when rage comes, and deep breath so that I can connect my inner body, in this case I would try not to harm myself and stay calm.",
            "Ugh, I feel you! It's so tough when rage takes over and you feel like you've lost control. I've found deep breaths and stepping back for a moment can really help. Also, distracting myself with something positive like music or a hobby sometimes works wonders!",
            "The reason for this is that when experiencing other emotions, your body is usually calm. However, when you are angry, there are noticeable physical reactions such as a faster heartbeat. \n\nIn the Sutra on the Full Awareness of Breathing, Buddha advises calming the body before reflecting on negative emotions.",
            "I have recently read that taking Omega 3's helps with anger. There was a recent study done. I didn't think it will 100% fix it, but might be worth looking into.",
            "The trick is in preventing it from happening, which is in your control. The moment you become enraged, it's a biological response and things will be exponentially more difficult.\n\nBecome more aware of the physical experience of emotions while meditating and throughout the day, when not enraged. How does joy feel? How does anger feel? Be genuinely curious. The more you become aware of your emotions, the more likely it is you will detect anger _before_ it becomes rage."

And to support this supposition, there's a posture called Bound Lotus in which you get into Lotus, cross your arms behind your back and grab the toes - it's like your mind has no choice but to get into a meditative state.",

            "Take it slow. Don't force it or try to get into it too abruptly. Start with the half lotus, and alternate the top leg, until it's comfortable.\n\nI did a lot of hatha yoga to sit in the full lotus without discomfort, plus I was in my twenties. A zafu is usually necessary to get both knees to rest solidly on the floor, in either pose. I need a bigger zafu for the half lotus, while a very low cushion is all that's necessary for the full lotus. For a good yoga exercise for loosening up the hips and knees, google my name and find Meditation Basics and scroll all the way to the end of that article. The beginning part on posture might also be helpful. Take care.",
            "I quit meditating for years because I felt like I had to master the lotus position.  After working toward it for several years, I was able to sit in full lotus exactly once for a minute or two.  Half lotus was the best I could ever do, but it turned meditation into a painful endurance session.  A couple years ago, I took up meditation again but quit trying to be a yoga jock and abandoned the venerable lotus position completely.  I sit in a straight-backed chair.  Don't know about my chakras, but my blood pressure's down, and I feel like I can face this dumpster fire of an election year.  I respect those who have mastered the lotus position and trust the validity of the benefits they describe, but I'm not going to let the inaccessibility of the lotus position prevent me from meditating.",
