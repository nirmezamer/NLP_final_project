            "I've never put much stock in meditation, but I did 5-10 minutes 2-3 times earlier, in an attempt to center, ground, heighten awareness, mindfulness, etc., and I felt like I was achieving the desired effect. I'd like to do more, but I think 15-20 minutes is a safe bet for now. I know little to nothing of technique, and have just been following a book I'm reading, and guided videos, both on mediumship. I don't need to be held accountable, but I'm open to some direction.",

            "Mett bhavana, commonly translated as loving-kindness meditation, is what I'd suggest. This is a technique that deals specifically with resentment, hatred and ill-will. Both towards oneself and towards others. It's a simple method and it works wonders. It is also a potent concentration practice, and concentration is intimately linked to joy, happiness and ease. Every ill-will type personality meditator will benefit greatly. It has changed my life for sure. I'd recommend you to check out Tara Brachs guided meditations. Her instructions are generally very well suited for meditators with anxiety etc.",

Look at your fingers look at the tiny lines and craters in your skin look at how much detail there is even in an inch of your body. now look at your room, the walls are empty and plain. there is nothing there no complexity or lines in the walls. see how much better it is to stare down and up on your whole body than sit there in fron of a tv or a phone watching small clips of living things doing things. Youre also a living thing and the best one you got. you have your life only, and nothing else.",

The constant grind was draining me, and my friends suggested trying mindfulness to cope. I was skeptical at first, but I gave it a shot. Now, I\u2019m curious, what pushed you to start? Was it work stress, personal issues, or something else? Let\u2019s share our stories or just a reason and maybe help each other out!",

            "As a kid together with a friend we had the plan to be in the same dream and then have cool dream adventures together. Unfortunately this didnt work out. However it got me interested in lucid dreaming. I started to read through related forums to grasp all the knowledge there is about it. There I stumbled across an experienced user who said that if youre able to meditate lucid dreaming will be the easiest thing in the world. So I bought my first book about meditation called Meditation for Dummiesand started meditating. By now (Im in my 30s) the focus of meditation has shifted (lucid dreaming is still cool but you need heaps of time for practicing) but I still do it, sit meditation retreats and constantly learn new things about it. Im really thankful of how it all went.",

            "I started because I had intense social anxiety in college. It took a long time to even be able to do 15 minutes, and I don't think I noticed any changes within the first year. But after my practice deepened, I realized meditation is useful for all kinds of other problems that nearly everyone has. Now I meditate daily for at least 20 minutes, although my maximum is well over an hour.",

The environment isn't half as important as how I approach it. \n\nIn other words, no matter where you go, there you are."
