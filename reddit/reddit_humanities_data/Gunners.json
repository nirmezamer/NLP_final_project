            "We are not signing anybody until the euros and copa is over. Calm down",
            "Why do some people forget we sold Balogun for \u00a330m last summer? Obviously we need to get better in selling but when we make a good sale you can\u2019t just ignore it to keep making a point",
            "I didn\u2019t realise Liverpool rated Quansah this highly tbh. Every time I\u2019ve watched him I haven\u2019t seen anything too special, nice young talent but I would definitely have sacrificed him to get Gordon.",
            "Thoughts on Anthony Gordon? Newcastle are apparently willing to sell him due to PSR. He would be good depth for both wings but will prolly end up being overpriced imo",
            "Everyone: How many goalkeepers do you want to sign?\n\nArteta: Yes",
            "Window has been dreadfully boring so far, its seriously lacking Zoe Kravitz discourse\u00a0",
            "Archie Gray available for \u00a330m? Might be rude not to",
            "Charles Watts tier 1 status is based on vibes at this point",
            "I mean if Newcastle are offering Isak and Gordon how come they just haven't sold Bruno instead of being stingy with that RC? I'm sure Arsenal or City would love to take him and let Newcastle keep their prized fwds",
            "Okonkwo left, signed Nygaard, will Sign Raya permanently soon, new contract for Hein and will probably sign that Espanyol Keeper. \n\nThat's FIVE transfer activities that involve keepers, aren't you excitied?"

            "Ain\u2019t no surprise that Julian knows ball. Bayern truly fucked it by firing him",
            "If you watch the game you don\u2019t see Kai, if you watch Kai you see the whole game",
            "It's honestly just a gap in ball knowledge between the general public and football experts.\u00a0",
            "Kai is a fucking baller basically",
            "Havertz is the new Xhaka from 5 years ago it would seem.\n\nTheir coaches love them yet the public seems to think they are terrible",
            "Don't worry Germany fans, you gon learn today about king kai!",
            "Players like Kai will always be underappreciated, beacuse they play to the strenghts of their teammates and it's not really seen by people who don't watch it closely.",
            "He shouldnt be dropped just bcos of one bad game. He is highly effective with the other forward in creating chances.",
            "This reminded me of what Ornstein said last summer when we were in process in signing Havertz.\n\nDespite public opinion about Havertz being at least very divisive, in the professional world Havertz is rated extremely highly pretty uninanimously. Havertz proved that people who work in that space have a much deeper understanding that fans could ever do.",
            "Deep-lying playmakers and lamp post CFs are the only players you should never trust fans to analyze. Only managers seem to rate these players. \n\nI think we are better suited to wingers, 10s, and defenders."

            "Interesting to see how clubs manage transfer clauses.",
            "I know the end goal of the youth team shouldn\u2019t be just to sell them off eventually, but we suck ass at finding opportunities for them. Balogun\u2019s prolly the only outlier",
            "As if he actually knows.... he's just guessing",
            "This guy literally made cups of tea at Colney.",
            "I don\u2019t know what people are smoking, but a 20-25% is really good in this situation. We are getting 4-5 million for a player that did not play a single minute for the Arsenal.",
            "Lmao, people actually trying to wish it into existence that its more than that. Yeah, sure, we getting 99% sell on, whatever",
            "let\u2019s just for once not excuse how poor we are at selling, even if it\u2019s a good sell-on clause, chelsea made 15m from OUR academy player",
            "How are we so terrible at loaning and developing players we\u2019ll never use ffs, Chelsea are unbelievable at it",

Also try the gunners ale with the Carling cup. Should be enjoyed refreshed in the company of other gooners.\n\nThird slide: Arsenal FC was founded in 1886 and is one of England most victorious clubs. The club is known to combine tradition and innovation. Arsenals home is emirates stadium, one of the worlds most modern football arenas, in north London. Arsenal is estimated to have 27m fans worldwide. Back home (Denmark) Arsenal is represented by the support club Arsenal Denmark. The beer you\u2019re sitting with, a red ale, has been brewed by master brewer Jan Thaagaard after the clubs colours. It is made by different Baley and hop types, which gives a smell of togetherness and a taste of class. It could with added benefit be enjoyed from a cup.",
