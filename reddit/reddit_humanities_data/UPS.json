If you have a suggested question please message the mod team and we will look at updating the post with it.**\n\n**This subreddit is not customer service and corporate does not check it. You will not get someone from corporate UPS paying attention to your questions, concerns, or comments. This is mostly inside hourly, drivers, and management who are discussing work or being nice and answering**\n\nPlease read this post before posting any questions to see if it is answered here. Also please read through the subreddit for the same or similar issue before posting. If it has and you still post, it will likely be removed. If your question is just a super specific version of one of these questions, don't post it. Few people here are likely to be able to answer you with any more specific details than are provided here.\n\nIf your post contains a tracking number it will be removed. Don\u2019t publicly post your tracking number as this can be used to find personal information about you or modify the delivery of your package.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Current Events and Disruptions**\n\n**UPS Covid: Due to the current pandemic UPS has suspended some service guarantees. See the link below for details about which service guarantees are currently in effect. Please avoid posting customer questions pertaining to the pandemic.**\n\n[UPS Service Guarantee Suspension Information](https://www.ups.com/us/en/help-center/shipping-support/service-guarantee.page?)\n\n**UPS Change to Tracking: There was a change to the tracking and chanegd much of the detailed information.** **On the desktop website, you can see more detailed tracking updates by  clicking \"View Details\", then selecting the \"Shipment Progress\" tab. These sites apparently still have detailed tracking, use of these has not been verified by the mod team and are not official UPS tracking and may have issues.**\n\n[https://www.packages24.com/](https://www.packages24.com/) \n\n[https://parcelsapp.com/en/](https://parcelsapp.com/en/)\n\n***General Support***\n\n\u00b7 Talking to a real person on the customer service line is not easy. Some suggestions are to call 1-800-PICK-UPS and press 0 until you get a person. Some have said that \u2018ordering supplies\u2019 got them a real person who then transferred them to a customer service representative.\n\n\u00b7 UPS Stores are franchises and few are corporately owned (if any). You will need to deal with local owners and operators to get specific details on why things happened or why you were charged what you were.\n\n\u00b7 If you are worried your package is lost or not going to be delivered, but you are still getting scan activity and/or the estimated delivery date hasn\u2019t passed then stop worrying. UPS and/or the shipper won\u2019t really be able to help since your package still shows to be on time and in transit. Once the delivery date passes and if it isn\u2019t delivered then, contact the shipper\u2019s customer support first and the UPS customer support. The shipper likely has an account executive who can help them with issues more effectively than generic UPS customer support.\n\n\u00b7 If your package is SurePost it will be delivered by USPS and not UPS. If it shows being transferred to them you will need to talk with USPS and the shipper to resolve any issues.\n\n\u00b7 If your package is UPS Mail Innovations it will be delivered by USPS. It also is not handled by the normal UPS Small Package network and as such few if any members of this sub will be able to help with your question. Your best bet is to talk to the shipper and USPS about your package.\n\n\u00b7 If you want to talk to someone about a refund on shipping cost or an undelivered/damaged package you have to talk to whoever you bought from. You are their customer and they are UPS\u2019 customer. This is standard practice in the shipping industry.\n\n\u00b7 If you are asking why your package hasn't moved and it is the weekend, packages don't update over the weekend. UPS delivers ground packages to certain major metro areas, but it is not to all. Despite this UPS does not process or move packages between UPS facilities except to delivery centers from Friday night to Saturday morning.\n\n\u00b7 Premium air product which has to move via the air network, and not the ground network, has to be specifically set up as Saturday air delivery which is a different service than normal air. Currently UPS does not operate the air network over the weekend except to position Sat 1DA or 2DA for delivery or regular air for Monday delivery.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Employee Questions:***\n\nBecause most employee issues are governed not only by the Master National Contract; but also regional riders; supplements; and local practice, it is always a good idea to talk to a local union steward to get the best information for your specific location. All answers here would be best asked to a Steward.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q: How does the X hour pay guarantee work?**\n\n**A:** You have to be scheduled to work or be allowed to work a shift. You must make sure to ask for your guarantee if you are offered a lay off or told to go home before the guaranteed time has elapsed. Lay offs are supposed to be offered in seniority order.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q: If I miss time in my probation period will I be fired?**\n\n**A:** Possibly, it is best to avoid missing days in your first 30 to avoid giving management a reason to terminate you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q: I have a pay issue of some kind.**\n\n**A:** First step is to notify management immediately. Generally, they are allowed a certain amount of time before you are allowed to file a grievance. Once that time has elapsed you can file a grievance (talk to a Steward on how to do this) and potentially get not just your pay, but penalty pay as well.\n\n**Q: Can I transfer UPS locations/facilities?**\n\n**A:** Transfers are rare, but not impossible. They are generally only granted for school. You will have to wait for a position of the same type you are in (hub sort, driver, etc...) to open up. You will likely lose center seniority, but will keep your years of service. In some cases you may have to quick and be rehired at the new location. In some cases you can only transfer within the same district/region based on union contract languages.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Customer Questions***\n\n**Q: My package hasn't moved in X days.**\n\n**Q: My package says in transit but it has been in the same place for X days?**\n\n**Q: Why is my tracking stuck at departure scan?**\n\n**Q: My package departed X location and hasn\u2019t updated in days.**\n\n**Q: My package is stuck at arrival scan at X location.**\n\n**A:** If your package has a departure scan it will get an arrival scan. Departure Scans are logical scans based on the most recent physical scan. When a trailer departs or arrives at a UPS facility the packages in that trailer get a scan based on that. If you have a departure scan you will eventually see an arrival scan. For most long distances (greater than 2 days of travel) UPS uses sleeper teams or rail to move trailers in order to more efficiently move trailers. These movements don\u2019t stop at UPS facilities and as such won\u2019t get any scans until they arrive at the next UPS facility.\n\nIf your package hasn't moved and it is the weekend; UPS doesn't currently move trailers between UPS facilities except to position packages for Saturday Ground delivery.\n\nIf it is on the same scan (arrival, departure, delivery, etc..) and the delivery date hasn't passed then wait until the delivery date. If it hasn't been delivered by the delivery date contact the shipper\u2019s customer support first and then UPS customer support. The shipper likely has an account executive who can help them with issues more effectively than generic UPS customer support.\n\nSometimes, there will be a delay exception after the departure scan, and  the site may stop showing the scheduled delivery date. This is fine.  Most delays will be one day or less, and you just need to wait for the  next arrival scan. \n\n**Q: My package was supposed to be delivered X days ago and nothing has updated since.**\n\n**Q: My package said it was out for delivery, then went to in transit or has a delay, and is now stuck there.**\n\n**Q: My package goes out for delivery every day, but doesn't get delivered.**\n\n**Q: Package shows scheduled delivery: information unavailable after missing delivery date**\n\n**A:** First be patient, if you are still getting daily updates, like an out for delivery scan or exception activity we are trying to get it delivered.\n\nIf you feel you need to do more than wait, contact the shipper\u2019s customer service first and work with them to get a lost/stuck package investigation started. They likely have an account rep who they can work with who will be able to do more than just the basic customer service.\n\nAfter that you can try to work with UPS customer support, but they aren\u2019t always able to be as helpful as you might like.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q: It is Saturday, is my package going to be delivered?**\n\nA: Much of the US has Saturday ground delivery, but not all zips and cities in a given delivery center are turned on for Saturday ground. Saturday Ground location will load as much as possible on package cars, including packages due for Monday delivery so your package may erroneously get an out for delivery message. This isn\u2019t supposed to happen, but sometimes does.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q: My package departed a location and then arrived back at the same location.**\n\n**Q: My package shows being back at a previous location.**\n\n**Q: My package goes between the same two locations.**\n\n**A:** There are several reasons this might have happened. If you a have an actual arrival scan at a previous location the trailer might have needed to return to the building due to mechanical issues, the departure may have been incorrect, or the arrival may be incorrect. There are too many reasons to really detail them all and it is unlikely anyone on the sub can answer to the particulars of your package\u2019s trailer. This isn\u2019t a cause for concern and you need to assume your package is still on time and will be delivered.\n\nIf the most recent activity is an exception or delay, but the location is different from the most recent, then it is likely that the exception was remotely applied. We don't have to physically scan a package to apply an exception and the exception shows from where it was applied. Yes this is confusing, but it isn't cause for alarm.\n\nFor international packages, if the scans you are seeing in once location are import/export/C.O.D. charges these are likely being done remotely from that location. UPS processes packages' import/export information remotely while the package is still in transit to reduce time in transit for international packages.\n\nSometimes package have two labels on them from being reused. This is the most common reason for a package to bounce between two buildings. The other reason is if it is bouncing between Louisville and another location is that it could have an international sticker for Louisville still on it. These sometimes get mistaken for the delivery label. Call the shipper or customer service to try and help resolve this issue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q: My package only has label created scan or shows as shipment ready for UPS.**\n\n**A:** This effectively means the customer hasn\u2019t given the package to UPS. Contact the shipper and work with them to figure this out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q: Why is my package going to the opposite side of the country?**\n\n**A:** If your package is an air service level and it goes to Louisville, this is likely by plan as Louisville is where UPS\u2019s largest air hub is location.\n\nIf you package just appeared somewhere random it could also have been misloaded by a UPS employee. If the package was in a reused box it could also have an old label on it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q: My package has an exception message stating \u201cX\u201d, what does this mean and/or when will it be delivered?**\n\n**A:** All exceptions mean your package has been delayed. Exception messages are generic and can be used for a broad category of reasons. Typically delays are only 1 business day, but can be more depending on the exact reason for the delay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q: My package shows as being at my local delivery center, can I just go pick it up?**\n\n**A:** No; you have to specifically request your package be placed for pick up at the local center\u2019s customer counter. Until your package is unloaded, it is in a trailer with approximately 1000+ other packages. If you don\u2019t request a pick up before it arrives at the local delivery center it will likely delay the package by a day if you put this request in and until the request is processed it can\u2019t be picked up or delivered.\n\nJust going up to a UPS customer counter will not allow you to pick up your package. Your package is likely already on a car or still in a trailer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q: My package has \u201cX\u201d thing wrong with the address, will it still be delivered?**\n\n**A:** Depending on what is wrong with your address it likely will be. If the address doesn\u2019t exist and we are unable to deliver it, it will likely get an address correction. If it is a valid address, but not your address we will attempt to deliver it to the wrong address. Your best bet is to contact the shipper and request they ask for an address correction. They may or may not do this as it does cost the shipper a fee to correct an address. You can try and contact UPS customer support to have an address correction done, but it is unlikely to happen since the shipper is supposed to put this request in to prevent people from redirecting packages that aren\u2019t their own.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q: My package says it is delivered, but I can't find it.**\n\n**A:** Your package likely was misdelivered or accidentally scanned delivered early. If by end of day you haven\u2019t had the package delivered first you should talk to your neighbors and see if anyone might have gotten the package by accident. If there is an address that is similar to yours (ex: 123 100th St vs. 123 100th Ave). Second contact the shipper and inform them your package shows as delivered, but you did not receive it. Lastly contact UPS customer support and ask to talk to the delivery center. The local center can use internal systems to determine where the driver was when the package was delivered. They then can recover the package and deliver it correctly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q: The live map showed the driver near me X times and I still haven't gotten my delivery. (or any variation of I watched the live map and/or don't understand the route my driver uses)**\n\n**A:** Routes are extremely complicated and difficult to build. There are a number of variables from business open/close times, premium air service commit times, preferred business pick up times, and a myriad of other variables I don't even know. Residential deliveries are the lowest priority since they can be made at almost any time in the day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q: My tracking only shows label created or shipment ready, but the shipper's site says it has shipped. What do I do?**\n\n**A:** Contact the shipper. UPS tracking trumps any shipper's tracking. If UPS doesn't show an origin, destination, or location scan then UPS doesn't have the package as far as they are concerned. The shipper needs to work with UPS to figure the problem out, get you a refund, or reship your package.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q: I dropped a package off at a UPS Store or gave it to a driver and it hasn\u2019t moved/scanned yet?**\n\nA: If you dropped it off early in the day give it until late evening to receive a scan. Packages aren\u2019t generally scanned at pickup anymore. They are scanned once the package car is unloaded at the local UPS facility and some cars return to the building in the late evening.\n\nIf you dropped it off later in the day it is possible you missed the pick-up time. Give it until evening the next day as pickups won\u2019t be made until afternoon generally.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q: Why does my tracking show lots of \"warehouse scans\"?**\n\nA: When looking at tracking, \"warehouse\" is always customs clearance  related. UPS does not usually store packages, and normal buildings are  not referred to as warehouses, only the locations that hold packages for  customs clearance. \n\nThe most common reason for a long delay is some sort of missing  documentation, and in that case you will typically see a tracking update  before the warehouse scans that refers to UPS contacting the receiver  for clearance information. However, there are many reasons for customs  delays, most of them outside of UPS control.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q: Why is my international package still being held after it cleared customs?**\n\nA: Packages have to clear customs in both the export and import  country. Depending on the exact shipment, they can also be subject to  holds by additional government agencies. For example, the FDA regulates  sunscreen and contact lenses and can reject shipments of them sent to  the US.  \n ",
