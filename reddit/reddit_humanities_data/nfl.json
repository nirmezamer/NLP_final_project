Stats for each player are included below. Additionally, their ranks from previous years are available for y\u2019all to see\n\n#METHODOLOGY\n\n*[Link to more detailed writeup on our methodology](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1d51ba1/rnfl_top_100_players_of_the_2023_season_hub_post/)*  \n  \n* **Step 1:** A [Call to Rankers](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1ae1xu9/rnfl_top_100_players_of_the_2023_season_call_for/) right after the Conference Championship games \n  \n* **Step 2:** Rankers from each team nominated players to rank, with a **11 game minimum threshold.** Players are associated with the team they played for in 2023\n\n* **Step 3:** The Grind. We instructed users to tier positions groups into T25, T50, etc based on **2023 regular season play only.** This took several weeks as the rankers tiered each position group and discussed them. There were no individual player threads and no arbitrary position caps. Just questions and rankings.\n \n* **Step 4:** Users submitted their own personal **Top 125 lists**. \n   \n* **Step 5:** User lists were reviewed by myself, u/MikeTysonChicken and u/mattkud.

Tight end, Iowa. Sam LaPorta quickly proved what a reliable target he would be for Goff. The [first two highlights here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_Va8hgT-F8) in week 2 against Seattle was a preview of the kind of player LaPorta would be. He is tough, great at making tight, contested catches, and he has fantastic field awareness especially for a rookie where he is going to fight for a first down.\nLaPorta has an exceptional ability to say to the first defender to make contact with him \"I do not wish to be tackled yet, thank you though.\" [Here's just another fun play to watch that showcases Laporta's abilities](https://youtu.be/a_Va8hgT-F8?si=YF5cuHfk-Dx5M9iI&t=546) And LaPorta didn't just have a great rookie season that showed that he has a lot of promise. He had a historic rookie season. With 86 receptions, he broke the rookie tight end reception record. He also joins the company of tight ends Gronk and Ditka to be only the third tight end to score 10+ touchdowns in their rookie year. LaPorta and Gronk both with 10, and Ditka holding the record with 12. LaPorta is a player I'm sure Lions fans are excited to watch for years to come.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\n#**#59 - Brock Purdy - San Francisco 49ers - Quarterback**\n\n***Previous Ranks***\n\n|2022|\n:--|\n|N/A\u200b|\n\n\n\n___\n\n**Written by:** u/MC_Stimulation\n\nWhat a story Brock Purdy is. His 2022 run felt like a movie, he came on the scene and completely took over the NFL headlines, winning and winning, playing good football, and proving that evaluating QB\u2019s in the draft is much more of a crapshoot than people care to admit. Then tragedy struck. Haason Reddick hit Purdy\u2019s arm in the 2022 NFC Championship game and Purdy was left unable to throw with a torn UCL in his right elbow. A devastating loss and end to the season left 49ers fans unsure of what was to come in 2023, would Trey Lance once again take the reins? The 49ers bringing in Sam Darnold also muddied the situation. There were even rumors of the 49ers reaching out to Tom Brady to have one last ride! What was the plan? But, as usual, the 49ers FO were tight lipped, ignored the media, and knew what they were gonna do. They were all in on Brock Purdy.\n\nThey made the right choice.\n\nBrock Purdy was statistically the most impressive QB of the 2023 season, leading the league in Passer Rating, Yards per Attempt, Adjusted Net Yards per Attempt, Yards per Completion, TD%, as well as being top 5 or better in Passing Yards (5th), Passing TD\u2019s (3rd), and Completion Percentage (2nd amongst starters of 10+ games played). He absolutely lit up the league this year and, if not for a very unfortunate game against Baltimore, likely would have received serious MVP considerations.\n\nBrock had many plays that former Niners QBs just couldn\u2019t make. His shifty [run](https://youtube.com/shorts/OC3VYCrftr8?si=clqr3FEjj_ymG2vA) against the Steelers in Week 1 would have been a run of no gain or throw away in the Jimmy G era. His [TD](https://youtu.be/gLqWKs9esYw?si=JCfmLzJaOwqHb4qG) against Seattle likely would have been a checkdown or a sack in the old era. Plays like [this](https://youtu.be/NhV3wBfIRe0?si=wv33VXBGWGzHwxx3) also shows that Purdy maneuvers in the pocket like a Vet and finds the open man.\n\nIs Brock a system QB? Is he only good because of Shanahan and the squad around him? There will always be doubts and criticism surrounding him because of his size, his draft spot, and the team around him. But at the end of the day, Brock Purdy has shown that he can drive the bus for the 49ers, and people might just have to get used to him playing QB for 49ers for the foreseeable future.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\n#**#58 - Danielle Hunter - Minnesota Vikings - EDGE Rusher**\n\n***Previous Ranks***\n\n|2022|2021|2020|2019|2018|2017|2016|2015|\n--:|:--|:--|--:|--:|:--|:--|:--|\n|81|N/A|N/A|20|32|N/A|N/A|N/A\u200b|\n\n___\n\n**Written by:** u/Nijo32\n\nDanielle Hunter entered the 2023 season facing numerous questions. Would he hold out for a new contract? How would he fit into Brian Flores\u2019 aggressive scheme? Was his play regressing after debilitating injuries in 2020 and 2021? Hunter answered each of these questions in resounding fashion, putting forth a milestone season filled with career bests.\n\nHunter reported to Vikings camp at the end of July, inking a one-year deal upped his guaranteed money and nixed the possibility of a franchise tag in the offseason. The outlook was clear: this was a contract year for Hunter, and he\u2019d need to deliver to earn the bigger payday he was seeking.\n\nComplicating matters in Hunter\u2019s contract season was a dramatic scheme change. Gone was the Ed Donatell scheme that sat in zone and relied on winning individual match-ups to create pressure out of 4-man rushes. Gone too were Hunter\u2019s premier rushing mates, Za\u2019Darius Smith and Dalvin Tomlinson. Instead, Hunter would now be creatively deployed in Brian Flores\u2019 ultra-aggressive, maniacally-blitzing defense, , in an attempt to overhaul 2022\u2019s 31^(st) ranked defense.\n\nHunter took to the new scheme immediately. Rather than predictably rushing Hunter from the same wide alignment (98.5% of rushes in 2022), Flores innovated; Hunter played nearly 150 snaps from a 4i / 5 / Box pre-snap position in 2023, all while his teammates unpredictably blitzed or dropped around him. He also flipped sides more than ever in his career, with a 71.2% / 28.8% split in 2023. The result was an uptick in true one-on-one matchups he could feast on, and feast he did. Hunter posted career bests in sacks (16.5, 5^(th) in NFL), TFLs (23, T-1^(st)), and tackles (83, 2^(nd) amongst edges). Hunter\u2019s volume snaps popped in part due to the iron man season he put forth, quelling any fears that injuries had left his best days behind him. His 1,004 snaps played were second only to Maxx Crosby, and his production was equally impressive as both a pass rusher and run defender. In addition to the TFLs, his 50 stops (defined as a tackle constituting a failure by the offense) ranked 3^(rd) amongst edge rushers. And while volume stats are impressive, Hunter\u2019s efficiency holds up impressively in spite of playing nearly twice as many snaps as some of his peers. His PFF pass-rush-productivity score ranks 20^(th) amongst edges, while his run stop rate ranks 14^(th). He also finished 6^(th) and 11^(th) on Brandon Thorn\u2019s True Sack and True Pressure rankings, respectively, which grade every single sack and pressure for quality (i.e. beating an elite tackle is worth more than being a free rusher on a broken play). So while Flores\u2019 scheme certainly helped unlock Hunter\u2019s monster season, it was far from empty calories.\n\nAs a Vikings fan and former defensive end, there is so much about Hunter\u2019s game to appreciate. He\u2019s a physical specimen who may as well have been built in a lab, with the most impressive [arms](https://static.profootballnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/12153111/Danielle-Hunter-Landing-Spots-scaled.jpg) I\u2019ve maybe ever seen. He pairs his incredible gifts with impeccable technique \u2013 rather than overwhelming with physical traits, his rushes are often a slow burn, controlling an OT with hand placement and relentlessly bearing down on the QB, as evidenced by his [first sack of \u201923](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-2dTMRJ820&ab_channel=NFL). In his own words, he\u2019s come a long way from Zimmer telling him to \u201cuse his hands or he\u2019d chop them off.\u201d That said, do not doubt Hunter\u2019s ability to ghost an OT; he\u2019s not afraid to [jump](https://www.vikings.com/video/hunter-gets-vikings-second-sack-for-the-opening-drive), [juke](https://www.vikings.com/video/hunter-takes-down-purdy-for-a-sack), or [spin](https://www.vikings.com/video/hunter-gets-11th-sack-of-season) his way into a sack. And as mentioned, Hunter is a do-it-all DE, so here is him [eviscerating a Lions 3^(rd) and 1](https://www.nfl.com/videos/danielle-hunter-absolutely-engulfs-jahmyr-gibbs-for-3-yard-tfl) as well as him [sniffing out a Falcons screen](https://www.vikings.com/video/hunter-and-hicks-engulf-allgeier).\n\nIf you\u2019ve made it this far, I appreciate you, but not nearly as much as I appreciate and will miss Danielle Hunter. His 2023 season was truly special, and he\u2019s one of the more complete edge rushers I\u2019ve had the pleasure of watching.\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\n\n#**#57 - Trent McDuffie - Kansas City Chiefs - Cornerback**\n\n***Previous Ranks***\n\n|2022|\n:--|\n|N/A\u200b|\n\n\n\n___\n\n**Written by:** u/confederalis\n\nAfter a solid rookie season, Trent McDuffie exploded onto the scene in 2023, establishing himself as one of, if not the, best nickelback in the league. Combining an innate knowledge of the field and how to play in a zone with robust tackling and a nose for the football, McDuffie put together a season well deserving of First Team All-Pro. And as much as it hurts me to say, he silenced any further doubt towards this position after his stellar, Super Bowl MVP-worthy performance in the season\u2019s biggest game. McDuffie is *clearly* deserving of the #57 spot on the /r/NFL Top100 List.\n\nTrent McDuffie\u2019s greatest skill, from his time at Washington all the way through to his starting role in Kansas City, has been his ability to cover in zone coverage as well as anyone in the league. He possesses incredible play recognition, closing speed, block shedding, and tackling, allowing him to roam the flats and underneaths of the field, helping to shut down the short game and prevent long plays. [Here against the Vikings](https://x.com/Nate_Tice/status/1711871190170792177), McDuffie recognizes the check down before Kirk even begins his motion, sprinting downfield, and making the strong tackle on a running back with tons of free space in front of him. [Similarly, against the Chargers](https://x.com/RealMNchiefsfan/status/1716973736929423735), McDuffie recognizes the play and breaks from his deep zone early, again sprinting hard to the ball, and making a great shoestring tackle in open space. McDuffie was also a ballhawk, leading all corners in forced fumbles, and was second in the league overall, with 5. This includes a strong tackle and forced fumble on [the one and only Tyreek Hill](https://x.com/NFL_DougFarrar/status/1724600423091515535). A great example of McDuffie combining all of his many talents is [this play against the Bills](https://x.com/Jacobs71/status/1706786735751893465), where McDuffie quickly recognizes the run, sheds his block, and punches the ball out from the back.\n\nHowever, McDuffie\u2019s game didn\u2019t just emanate from his superb run-stopping and zone coverage. He was excellent on blitzes and rushing the passer, leading all corners in pressures, sacks, QB hits, and batted passes. He could also shine in man coverage, lining up across from some of the best receivers in the league in the slot, like [Justin Jefferson](https://x.com/LedyardNFLDraft/status/1711613356849713152) and [Deebo Samuel](https://x.com/NFL_DougFarrar/status/1798363176024903900). For a great example of his skills in this department, look no further than [this rep against the Jaguars](https://x.com/InHarmsWay19/status/1703856469664227493). McDuffie, matched up one-on-one with no help, trails Zay Jones perfectly, all the way through the end zone, taking away a passing lane and pushing Jones out of bounds as the ball reaches them.\n\nTrent McDuffie excels in much of what makes a good slot corner; run-stopping, zone coverage, play recognition, and tackling, and he can more than hold his own lined up in man. Couple this with McDuffie\u2019s propensity to force out the ball and his natural pass-rushing ability and you have a player who can act as a Swiss army knife for one of the best defensive coordinators in the league. McDuffie played all over the field in 2023, and I expect him to become an even more crucial part of this vaunted defense with the departure of L\u2019Jarius Sneed. Only just coming off his sophomore season, there are only better things to come for Trent McDuffie.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\n#**#56 - Chris Lindstrom - Atlanta Falcons - Offensive Guard**\n\n***Previous Ranks***\n\n\n|2022|2021|2020|2019|\n--:|:--|:--|:--|\n|36|N/A|N/A|N/A\u200b|\n\n\n___\n\n**Written by:** u/packmanwiscy\n\nFor the 2nd straight season, Chris Lindstrom demonstrated his ability to be one of the best guards in the NFL. In his time in Atlanta, the guard has had a bevy of quarterbacks to protect and running back to block for, but regardless of whose behind him Lindstrom has graded to be PFF\u2019s best guard in the league. In 2022 PFF graded Lindstrom with one of the best run-blocking seasons in the last decade and Atlanta pounded the rock at the fourth highest rate in the NFL this year, and Chris maintained his excellent blocking throughout. The Falcons don\u2019t have a great passing attack but Lindstrom does his part, allowing less than 1 pressure per game. If you don\u2019t trust these pff stats, just watch [Brian Baldinger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDseRdlxGMY) break down his excellent play. \n\n_________________________________________________________\n\n#**#55 - Creed Humphrey - Kansas City Chiefs - Center**\n\n***Previous Ranks***\n\n|2022|2021|\n--:|--:|\n|31|31\u200b|\n\n___\n\n**Written by:** u/RomosexuaII\n\n**Intro** \n\nThere is one phrase that sums up the Kansas City Chiefs' 2023 season. \"Our down year is better than most teams' best.\" This sentiment also applies to Creed Humphrey's performance in 2023. Not as good as his first few seasons where he distinguished himself as one of the best interior o-linemen in the NFL, but was still a stabilizing force as the KC offense figured out their issues. Elite run blocker, well above average pass blocker. \n\n\n\n\n\n**Stats are generally for nerds but here are a few:**\n\n- Humphrey played 1902 snaps\n\n- He only allowed 16 pressures and 4 sacks \n\n- Accounted for 6 penalties\n\n- Had a 78.2 PFF overall rating. \n\n\n**Accolades, future, legacy** \n\nThis big beefy boy has been to two Pro Bowls and was a 2nd Team All-Pro in 2022. With Jason Kelce retired, there's no reason he can't be the consensus best at his position in 2024. He ~~will~~ could also be the first starting center to be part of a 3-peat. Will go down in history for the [greatest neckbeard](https://imgur.com/qbiy3U00) of all time.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\n#**#54 - Joe Thuney - Kansas City Chiefs - Offensive Guard**\n\n***Previous Ranks***\n\n|2022|2021|2020|2019|2018|2017|2016|\n--:|--:|--:|--:|:--|:--|:--|\n|54|72|79|59|N/A|N/A|N/A\u200b|\n\n___\n\n**Written by:** u/broccolibush42\n\nJoe Thuney is aging like fine wine. One of the most consistent guards in the league in the past decade, he has proved to be a cornerstone for the Chiefs Offensive Line ever since they gave him that 5 year deal worth 80 million dollars. In 2023, Joe Thuney won his 4th ring, and 2nd with the Chiefs, as he and the Chiefs proved to the league why they are the best team in football. Thuney uses incredible footwork to slow some of the toughest DT's in the league down. Watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv2v9s1cVx0) as he and Creed Humphrey work Quinnen Williams all game despite the rest of the Offensive Line falling apart around him You can see how he wins his matchups and excellently positions his body to create the holes his RB needs, He skillfully keeps Quinnen in place on passing downs. You can clearly see his value in this game as his compatriots on the line, outside of Creed, are just not good. I digress. Joe is 31 years old, he still has plenty of gas left in that tank, and will prove immensely valuable as the Chiefs seek to be the first team ever to three-peat the Super Bowl.\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\n#**#53 - Charvarius Ward - San Francisco 49ers - Cornerback**\n\n***Previous Ranks***\n\n|2022|2021|2020|2019|2018|\n--:|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|83|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A\u200b|\n\n___\n\n**Written by:** u/MC_Stimulation\n\nCharvarius \u201cMooney\u201d Ward followed up a solid 2022 season by ascending into the upper tier of corners in the NFL. Ward had always been a decent corner, he won a Superbowl when he was in Kansas City; but coming over to San Francisco Ward had expectations to take over and be a shutdown corner. Ward had a solid 2022 season, but his 2023 performance gave Ward his first Pro Bowl nod and was honored by being named 2nd Team All Pro for his efforts. Ward looked to lock down every team's WR1 and help the 49ers secondary change from a question mark to an exclamation point. \n\nWard was key in defending the top receivers in the NFC West, including a fantastic game against Seattle, locking up [DK Metcalf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv2Udwuv9fE) on Thanksgiving. This was likely Ward\u2019s most impressive game of the season, allowing 4 catches on 11 targets, and frequently frustrating DK Metcalf (although that is not very difficult). \n\nWard\u2019s 2023 season saw him rack up 5 Interceptions, including a [pick-six](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKjuVxssJl0), a forced fumble, and 16 PBU\u2019s. He also had 61 tackles. Per PFF, Mooney had a coverage grade of 83.3, a run defense grade of 71.7 and allowed a 63 Passer Rating when targeted. \n\nWard looks to follow his impressive 2023 season with another one in 2024, and hope that he can help the 49ers to another Superbowl, hopefully with a better outcome for the 49ers this time.\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\n#**#52 - DaRon Bland - Dallas Cowboys - Cornerback**\n\n***Previous Ranks***\n\n|2022|\n:--|\n|N/A|\n\n\n___\n\n**Written by:** u/lowkeyguerilla\n\nImagine your CB1 goes down for the season with a season ending injury in practice. What are you supposed to do? Typically, you wouldn\u2019t expect your second year, third string, former fifth round pick to be the guy that steps up in his place. The team would probably struggle and fail to compensate for the loss. Typically, a below average corner would be thrown into the role where he inevitably underperforms to the previous corner\u2019s expectations. But DaRon Bland is not typical. Bland shined when many thought he would fail. \n\nAccording to PFF DaRon Bland was the second highest overall graded corner on the year with a grade of 89.5. Similar to Trevon Diggs, many have called out Bland due to the yards given up. But when you have a top five defense in points allowed during the season, the fans shouldn\u2019t lose too much sleep over yards. DaRon Bland also broke a 52 year old record for single season pick sixes originally set by Ken Houston in 1971. \n\nNotable players bland had as many or more TDs than in 2023: Amari Cooper, Cooper Kupp, Terry Mclaurin, Michael Pittman, Jaylen Waddle, OBJ, Garrett Wilson, Chris Godwin\n\n___\n\n#**#51 - Trey Hendrickson - Cincinnati Bengals - EDGE Rusher**\n\n***Previous Ranks***\n\n|2022|2021|2020|2019|2018|2017|\n:--|--:|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|N/A|51|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A\u200b|\n\n___\n\n\n**Written by:** u/KingDing-a-Ling13\n\nIn 2021, when the Bengals signed Trey Hendrickson to a big contract, I remember I laughed at them. Carl Lawson was a Bengals free agent, and while his stats weren\u2019t eye-popping, his film was great. On the flip side, Hendrickson had great stats, but I thought they were inflated and that he would regress. After three seasons and three straight Pro Bowls, Trey Hendrickson has made me look like a cotton-headed ninny muggins. In 2023, Hendrickson had a career high in sacks with 17.5, tied for second most in the league last season, and he deserves this spot on the list, no questions asked.     \nIn order to get 17.5 sacks, you need to have an impressive and versatile bag of pass-rushing tricks. Hendrickson has made the most of his money on his signature swipe move. Hand technique is incredibly important in both pass-rushing and pass-blocking, and Hendrickson\u2019s swipe can be devastating. A subtle-looking move that can easily be missed if you\u2019re not looking for it, Hendrickson starts with what looks like a standard outside speed rush, but right as the offensive tackle tries to engage him, [Trey uses his lightning quick hands to swat away the blocker\u2019s reach](https://x.com/bengals_sans/status/1725974658208448692?s=19), throwing the tackle completely off his rhythm and allowing Trey to easily blow around the edge, killing the drive. [Here\u2019s another example with the same move](https://x.com/bengals_sans/status/1742316085955674489?s=19), where Hendrickson completely neutralizes the initial jab and speeds around the edge for a strip sack. It\u2019s an underappreciated part of the game, but those lightning quick hands give Hendrickson so many chances around the edge and can make him a nightmare for opposing tackles. He\u2019s no one-trick pony either. At 270 pounds, Trey is packing a lot of weight and strength for an edge rusher, and he can overwhelm blockers with it. A great example is [this bullrush](https://x.com/bengals_sans/status/1711769808755429597?s=19), where Trey simply explodes straight into the tackle, throwing the tackle off balance, and then finishes the rush with a rip move into the quarterback for an impressive sack. In arguably his best game of the season, a week 14 win against the Colts, Hendrickson put all of the above on display and absolutely abused the Colts left side, [repeatedly getting into the backfield](https://x.com/bengals_sans/status/1734573831321272674?s=19) for multiple sacks and pressures on the day. Brandon Thorn, a highly respected lineman-specializing analyst, [charted Hendrickson as having the tied-best \u201csack score\u201d of the season](https://trenchwarfare.substack.com/p/the-2023-true-sack-rate-tsr-week-544), a metric he created to judge a player\u2019s sack numbers based on the circumstances of the sack. Whether you\u2019re a box score watcher or a game film grinder, you can greatly appreciate the craft Hendrickson brings to the field.     \nI will use this final section of this writeup to soapbox for something I strongly believe in: half sacks are very stupid. I believe if two guys combined for a sack, they should both get a full sack attributed to their stats. Feel free to disagree with me, but my mind will not be changed! Anyways, why do I bring this up? If we convert every player\u2019s half sacks to full sacks, guess who leads the league in 2023? Trey Hendrickson. And TJ Watt is tied with him but I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll probably be getting his own writeup at some point. For now, this is the time to appreciate a guy who rarely gets mentioned amongst the ranks of elite pass rushers in the league, despite league-leading sack numbers and analytical backing. Trey Hendrickson is an absolute beast, and he has proved me from three years ago very wrong.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\n\n#[Link to Positional Tracker Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MXJi-9xuV31yE2l-er5Drzi8VoPmpZB-TLTlZ7HByzs/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n#[Link to Ranker Reveal Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Lvp4VgRJ5uQgSMvUfYoWmiY_VYqQp5Zj4qet_XTo9uQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n#[Link to Hub](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1d51ba1/rnfl_top_100_players_of_the_2023_season_hub_post/)\n\n#[Link to Previous Post (70-61)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1diwyp7/rnfl_top_100_players_of_the_2023_season_7061/)",
