            "I read somewhere that it MIGHT have been a type of masters test for blacksmiths and the like! Apparently multiple different sizes have been found and some believe that they were made to test their skills in order to become a master smith... makes sense, obviously I suppose no one knows for sure but.."

            "This is very real. I've known one guy since sixth grade and I've never met his wife. I didn't even go to their wedding because I didn't feel up to an eight-hour drive. He moved to, like, three different states and didn't even tell me, yet he'd message me out of the blue like, \"Dude, the Castlevania anime is pretty sick.\" Cool, what's your wife's name again?",
            "Lol. I'm a dude and my friends made drama about being my witnesses, let alone usual marriage politicking.",
            "I love how this meme perfectly captures the essence of bro friendships. It's all about those random, sporadic connections that never fade, even with time and distance",
            "Yup. A childhood friend of mine enlisted in the army. 8 years later he knocks on my door out of the blue random and when I open it without missing a beat says \u201chey sir, we\u2019d like to talk to you about your cars extended insurance\u201d kid you not. Didn\u2019t even call or anything. Come to find out he had a kid, a wife, did two tours, shot a guy in Korea (as part of his service) bought a house, etc. we last saw each at like 18 and at 26 the fist thing he does is a bit. Being a guy is insane.\n\nTo be fair, I did the same thing to one of my friends. I saw a friends name on the list of guests scheduled at momocon. 13 years since we last talked and I just went up to him after his panel and you would have thought we saw each other last week.",

He said, \u201chell yeah, I\u2019ll be my Best Woman\u2019s Man of Honor! What color is my dress? Can we make it super short? My legs are my best feature.\u201d \ud83d\ude02",

            " Have a few friends who dont know i got into a relationship so thats gonna be fun when they learb that",
            "Man, I can totally relate to this. It's wild how friendships can evolve over time, especially with long-distance. The sporadic messages about random stuff like Castlevania are so spot on - it's like you can go months without talking, then suddenly pick up right where you left off on the most random topics.  \n  \nP.S. The Castlevania anime is indeed pretty sick.",
            "I have a friend in highschool that got married, HAD A KID and then i noticed the photos in his facebook profile lmao."
