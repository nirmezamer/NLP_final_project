        "content": "# Greetings, Adventurers. Welcome to [r/AfkArena](https://www.reddit.com/r/AfkArena/)!\n\nHappy 5 Years of AFK Arena!\n\n**PLEASE read this post**, it's required reading, especially if you are new here!\n\n**This post will serve as our one-stop shop to all of our content in one place.**\n\n# Recurring Megathreads\n\nTo reduce clutter, we organize our Subreddit into **Megathreads.**\n\nUnfortunately, Reddit only allows us to have **two pinned posts** at any given time, so this post will be our \"megathread megathread\", giving you access to everything in one place.\n\nEvery in-game week at the weekly reset (12:00\u202fAM Sunday, UTC), **three** megathreads will be posted, which you can find below.\n\n1. [Guild Advertising/Searching](https://www.reddit.com/r/afkarena/comments/1dgv3ft/megathread_guild_advertisingsearching/) \\- for all of your guild-related needs\n2. [Friends, Mercenaries, Solemn Vow, etc. Requests](https://www.reddit.com/r/afkarena/comments/1dgv3fy/megathread_friends_mercenaries_solemn_vow_etc/) \\- for all of your friend-related needs\n3. [General Questions/Advice & Guides Compilation](https://www.reddit.com/r/afkarena/comments/1dgv3g7/megathread_general_questionsadvice_guides/) \\- for all questions, advice-seeking, and guide-hunting needs\n\nEvery month in-game at monthly reset (12:00 AM UTC, on the first day of each month), **one** megathread will be posted.\n\n1. [RNG, Pulls, and Luck-Based Showcases](https://www.reddit.com/r/afkarena/comments/1d59znq/megathread_rng_pulls_and_luckbased_showcases/) \\- to show off about your incredible feats of luck and pulls\n\nWe are currently considering adjusting the frequency of these four megathreads, feel free to chime in if you feel any particular way!\n\n**Posting content intended for these megathreads** ***outside*** **of their respective megathreads is strictly prohibited and will result in post removal.**\n\n# Event Megathreads\n\nThis section will be updated periodically whenever we have In-Game or Subreddit Events taking place, feel free to see the links below if there are currently any events taking place...\n\n* [Dragonforge Trials Crowdsourcing](https://www.reddit.com/r/afkarena/comments/1dicz2h/month_3_dragonforge_trials_guide_and_crowdsourcing/) (permanent feature)\n\n# Rules\n\nPlease familiarize yourself with [our rules](https://new.reddit.com/r/afkarena/comments/1ctmw1s/rafkarena_rules_and_guidelines/) before you post or comment in our community.\n\n# Flairs\n\nPlease familiarize yourself with [our Post Flairs](https://new.reddit.com/r/afkarena/comments/1ctmwlx/rafkarena_post_flairs/) before your post in our community.\n\n# Karma\n\nPlease note there is a minimum of 10 [karma](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/204511829-What-is-karma) to interact in our community. **Messaging ModMail will not expedite this process**, you **need** at least 10 karma. This is an automatic process that every user must go through to gain access - but once you get 10 karma for the first time, it shouldn't be an issue again. This is a very quick and painless process that we must maintain to avoid an unfortunate plague of spam, bots, ban evaders, etc. in the community.\n\n# Beginner Content, Questions, and Guides\n\nOur above weekly **General Questions/Advice & Guides Compilation Megathread** has you covered! Please visit that post, but if all you're looking for is a [recent beginner's guide](https://new.reddit.com/r/afkarena/comments/1cqhk3j/new_player_guide/), this post is included in the aforementioned Megathread as well.\n\n# Navigation\n\nWe've been hearing your complaints that it's difficult to find things, so let's try and help with that.\n\nFirst and foremost, utilize our \"Menu\" UI to find active megathreads and other content.\n\n[On Desktop](https://preview.redd.it/6rk7c19dcxsc1.png?width=1591&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac36a690ec5346960086afbf1b95224ff1a2da7f)\n\n[On Mobile](https://preview.redd.it/z14dvfy4exsc1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=11aaa9d303cdb5316aca2a1ab0db3e8f074a031d)\n\n[On Mobile pt2](https://preview.redd.it/bql5nq68exsc1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=355c568ead1b818b571ed4709e002a3007a25dd6)\n\nNext, utilize the Search feature, with the search bar at the top of the site on Desktop, or with the magnifying glass on mobile.\n\nReddit has a list of [phrases](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/19696541895316-Available-search-features) you can filter your Search by, such as \"flair:guide\" to find all posts flaired with \"guide\", \"author:rakudayyy\" to find all posts made by Rakudayyy, combining the two, and further refine your search with sorting.\n\n[Filter and Sort example](https://preview.redd.it/57ymlc57fxsc1.png?width=1079&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c89d60679dced44efd3c2149f62dc714d50ae93)\n\n# Thank you!\n\nFor making it this far, for growing our community together, for everything!\n\nAs we continue to make changes to our Subreddit, this post may change over time, but we strongly encourage you to give us your feedback for what you'd like to see in the comments below! Above all else, we are r/afkarena together <3\n\nHappy Adventuring!",

            "This thread should really be combined with the general questions megathread if only one topic can be pinned. As it is now, the low visibility and cumbersomeness for most people to navigate to is leading to lower activity and separate topics being opened.\n\nI have little questions here and there as I learn the game and don't want to clog up the sub but I also don't want to wait hours or even days for an answer with pretty much just the helpful u/Vicksin contributing in that thread lol.",
            "Vicksin, do you think Lilith will actually fix rimuru? The player feedback seems pretty overwhelming to me",
            "Best value deal for someone who wants to spend 20-25 usd for a first time purchase bonus to get daimon? Plan to be mainly f2p but don\u2019t mind dropping a few bucks to boost progress or give me an edge in pvp",
            "this is more of a question for our Weekly Questions/Advice thread! \n\nyour best bet is the monthly card and monthly deluxe card :)",
            "Please ignore if previous questions megathreads are active enough as it was based on my first impression that it wasn't. Otherwise:\n\nI fully understand that this is meant to serve as a navigation hub and it is a good, logical and organised setup but I am just wondering if the questions megathread would attract more contributors if it was at the very top of the page. Not everyone especially new people will make the effort to see how the sub is managed and find where they need to be. It is also unfair to you to have to answer the bulk of questions to help keep it going and additional advice from other seasoned players would be good to have besides.\n\nThis is why I suggested that perhaps this navigation hub could also serve as the questions megathread seeing as no one is writing anything in this space anyway. Thread title would be modified accordingly. That way, this hub remains pinned and people can see right at the top that questions can be asked here. The other pin remains reserved for whatever your need it for.\n\nUltimately, I don't know and won't pretend how mod teams operate and what would be good for the sub but all I wish is for the questions megathread to be as active as possible and seeing that there are quite a few more helpful and experienced players such as yourself answering people on separate posts, it would be nice if we could all get together in the megathread.\n\nAlternatively, you can check out r/Genshin_Impact. As far as I know, the daily questions is almost always at the top while the other pinned thread changes periodically depending on current events before defaulting as their hub.",
            "yeah I didn't leave it at **just** welcome but also \"how to find...\" because, well, players are having trouble finding things\n\nI can remake this post with some better formatting and a new title\n\nI feel your frustration tenfold regarding the limitation to 2 pinned posts. it's just not enough.",
            "the issue is we can only have two pinned posts at any given time, and this post serves as our \"megathread megathread\", linking players to all megathreads in the sub\n\nif we only had the questions thread, the other megas would be completely ignored, intentionally or not. people don't know how to find them, which is what this post serves to do.\n\nthe questions/advice thread is also pinned for as much time as we can leave it up, and I always answer everyone as soon as it's posted.\n\npretty soon here we'll be implementing a new feature with Lilith's support that will drive more of the community to help in the megathreads, as well as more people asking questions there, too. hopefully that helps straighten things out more.\n\nif you have any other ideas for making the megathreads easy to find while stuck only being able to pin 2 posts, I'm all ears!",

My brain certainly didn't register the name \"Welcome\" as what I was looking for."
