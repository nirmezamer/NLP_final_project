        "content": "Hi Everyone,\n\nApologies for the delay, but here are some mostly finalized new rules for the sub - let us know if you\u2019ve got questions! These are the rules that were publicly voted in by majority via the Phase 2 poll. \n\n**1.** Only clinical professionals (physicians, nurse practitioners) may give direct medical advice to others.  \n\n1A. Direct medical advice is anything that directly advises someone on a specific treatment for a specific indication. For example, \u201ctake X, it will treat your Y condition\u201d - only clinicians can say this.  \n\n1B. Indirect medical advice is allowed by all users. For example, \u201cI read/conducted/tested X treatment and found it is effective for Y condition, here is the information, you should consider it.\u201d  \n\n**2.** Recommendations that aren't medical advice should supply safety information for procedures or compounds.  \n\n**3.** Always include a source if you're stating something has been proven in the scientific literature.  \n\n**4.** No Pseudoscience; unsubstantiated claims of curing something with \"X\" should be removed. See rule 2.  \n\nA. Pseudoscience: Things in direct  contradiction to scientific consensus without reputable evidence.  \n\nB. If such comments are deleted, mods should provide a clear reason why.  \n\n**5.** Implementation of a 3 strike system unless the subject is clear advertising/spam or breaking Reddit content policies, resulting in an immediate ban.  \n\n**6.** N=1 Studies should be ID'd as such with flair and not overstate the findings as factual.  \n\nWe hope this will help to ensure the scientific quality of information people find here. Again, let us know if you\u2019ve got questions, and when in doubt, feel free to ask a mod first.  \n\nCheers!",

        "content": "I developed severe, chronic insomnia in 2020 while caring for a sick newborn. (He couldn\u2019t sleep lying down so I held him for three months plus got up every 3 hours for changes & feeds.) My sleep never recovered. I\u2019ve been on OTC sleeping pills (e.g. Unisom) ever since. I\u2019ve tried numerous times to get off but then I\u2019ll only get 30 mins to 2 hrs of sleep per night without it. I\u2019ve currently been able to wean down to 50 mg sleep aid and 48 mg (1 capsule) Life Extension Nuero-Mag. I\u2019ve tried melatonin, Nuero-Mag by itself, tart cherry juice, sleepytime teas, etc. and nothing has allowed me to get off the sleeping pills. I do sometimes take modafinil from modafinia to keep me awake throughout the day but lessened it. Has anyone else found a supplement that has helped with severe insomnia? Thanks in advance!",

Had to adjust/raise dosage and he gave me extra supplements + other things to get to normal.",

Probably not ideal, but *everything* falls apart when sleep isn't happening."
