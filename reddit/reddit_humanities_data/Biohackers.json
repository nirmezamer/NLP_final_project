        "content": "Hi Everyone,\n\nApologies for the delay, but here are some mostly finalized new rules for the sub - let us know if you\u2019ve got questions! These are the rules that were publicly voted in by majority via the Phase 2 poll. \n\n**1.** Only clinical professionals (physicians, nurse practitioners) may give direct medical advice to others.  \n\n1A. Direct medical advice is anything that directly advises someone on a specific treatment for a specific indication. For example, \u201ctake X, it will treat your Y condition\u201d - only clinicians can say this.  \n\n1B. Indirect medical advice is allowed by all users. For example, \u201cI read/conducted/tested X treatment and found it is effective for Y condition, here is the information, you should consider it.\u201d  \n\n**2.** Recommendations that aren't medical advice should supply safety information for procedures or compounds.  \n\n**3.** Always include a source if you're stating something has been proven in the scientific literature.  \n\n**4.** No Pseudoscience; unsubstantiated claims of curing something with \"X\" should be removed. See rule 2.  \n\nA. Pseudoscience: Things in direct  contradiction to scientific consensus without reputable evidence.  \n\nB. If such comments are deleted, mods should provide a clear reason why.  \n\n**5.** Implementation of a 3 strike system unless the subject is clear advertising/spam or breaking Reddit content policies, resulting in an immediate ban.  \n\n**6.** N=1 Studies should be ID'd as such with flair and not overstate the findings as factual.  \n\nWe hope this will help to ensure the scientific quality of information people find here. Again, let us know if you\u2019ve got questions, and when in doubt, feel free to ask a mod first.  \n\nCheers!",

So many people now overtrain, for example, and have unbelievably elaborate exercise routines which can be draining in the long run and harmful to the nervous system. The same with excessive protein consumption and overeating when weight training.\n\nWhy do you think it is that so many biohackers don\u2019t look great? You\u2019ve got to trust your eyes sometimes and Bryan Johnson doesn\u2019t look much better than Hunter Biden. Ben Greenfield and Asprey also don\u2019t look amazing which is a surprise given the extreme biohacking they do. I think there\u2019s a lot to be said for taking your foot off the gas with the self-optimisation and looking at stripping back your life as much as possible. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve done recently and I\u2019m feeling great.\n\nMy life has improved most from subtractive things like fasting, cutting out alcohol, reducing the length of my gym sessions, less screen time, and especially reducing the amounts of habits and things I have to do from a health and fitness point of view each day. \n\nInterested to hear some other perspectives.

Bus-man's holiday kind of thing. \n\n90% of the advice and results you can get are from small habits and simple rules that shouldn't take over your life, and frankly then most people should just quit the 'scene' and focus on what actually gives a good, long life, which is climbing the Maslov's pyramid and then reading some Frankl and also spending as much time as possible with family and friends. \n\nWhen you get the message, hang up the phone.",

At first you might think adding all sorts of frequencies is best, and later on you\u2019ll find yourself more and more just cutting out what you don\u2019t want. It frees up more energy to turn everything that does work up.\n\nI don\u2019t agree with bryan, ben and dave looking awful though. For their age i think they all look great.
