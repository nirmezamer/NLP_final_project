        "content": "Welcome to the Veterans Benefits SubReddit!\n\nOur sub has an extensive collection of articles on everything VA. We encourage you to start your knowledge adventure there before making a new post, as you might be able to find your answers there.\n\nClick [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/w/index) to access the Knowledge Base.\n\nOf course, if you are having trouble finding an answer in the Knowledge Base or in previously posted threads or you simply want more specific feedback, feel free to make a new post.\n\nBut, before you make a new post please be mindful of the Sub's rules:\n\n1. Help other: Don't be a jerk. If your comment is not constructive or helpful, do NOT hit reply.\n2. We're Ad-Free:  Do **not** recommend a service or product - unless as a comment to a post **specifically** asking for recommendations, **and** it is a service or product that you have direct experience using. Posting links to useful content (videos, blogs, web pages) is fine, but posts  that we determine to be purely promotional will be deleted.\n3. Don't doxx yourself, or anyone else: Respect Reddit's tradition of anonymity and don't disclose your information or that of others. Please no phone numbers, emails, license numbers, or other contact information. This also includes QR codes (the box with black and white squares) on decision letters. This rule does **NOT** apply to private entities such as VSOs, law firms, or other official agencies. EXAMPLE: It's fine to post the VA's phone number, but not an examiner's professional/personal contact information.\n4. News should only be posted once: Breaking news often gets posted and reposted. We all  enjoying seeing news posted ONCE, but a dozen posts saying  basically the same thing not so much - and this also makes discussion  tough, since nobody knows which post to comment on.\n5. Memes are for Mondays: Please keep the Meme posts to Mondays.\n6. Get verified if you want to say you work for XXX: If you are a VA employee, VSO, Accredited Claims Agent, etc. Your credentials **MUST** be verified via the sub's [Mod Mail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/VeteransBenefits) **BEFORE** you can claim to be someone of such authority. Users who have completed the process will have an appropriate user flair.\n7. Keep claim status posts and success stories to the pinned weekly post.",

Then I resubmitted 2 more times and my official claim date is July 2023 now. On December 7 I got the update that they need schedule me for the no show appointments. Then now i see is 12 You or someone else submitted DBQ last appointment for those was December 21. I even got the packet from QTC again. And every time I call I ALWAYS get a different answer from the VA people. So... now I'm thinking it'll take 6 more months probably???",

            "I dont deserve this. \n\nIm about to say something and I know its going to sound like blasphemy in this thread. I had previously been rated at 60% and I was content with that. I have a corporate job and I do just fine. About two years ago I had worked with an attorney and they had gotten me to that rating and then I let it go. Well, in the background the attorney was still working on my file and today I opened up my banking app to find a $50K deposit from the VA and opened the VA app to find out Im now rated 100%. Most people on here jump for joy when that happens but honestly it made me feel terrible. I am not 100% disabled. I have a cushy corporate job and I make six figures. I thought my 60% was fair and adequate. I feel like a fraud, I dont know what Im going to tell my live in girlfriend (who also has a good corporate job). I dont know what to do, I know some people will read this and are dying to get to 100% and I dont mean to come across like there is anything wrong with that, many people truly deserve  it and I hope they get it. I honestly feel terrible about this.",

I can't be in a helicopter for more than an hour or so without it limiting my ability to turn my neck for days afterwards. Flight surgeons didn't annotate issues I brought up. Really the only thing I have documented is moderate spinal stenosis from a MRI. I did make 24 claims, all of which affect me at least every couple days. I submitted the BDD myself as the VSO near me didn't seem interested in helping guys that aren't Vietnam or Desert Storm era. Obviously I claimed nothing in the mental realm as I can still fly airplanes as they don't have the same vibrations that have done the damage. I sleep about one full night every two weeks and wake up heart racing just about every night. I can't say I'd recommend this career to my kids. Thanks for letting me vent Reddit!"

Additionally, with recruiting and retention numbers like they are now, they are not going to release someone who is still medically qualified. \n\nAdditionally, the VA rates all conditions caused or related to service, while the DOD only rates those conditions that make the servicemember unfit for service. For example, the SM could have a high rating for a purely cosmetic skin condition and there would be no basis for separation.",

Unless you have something that is clearly disqualifying, like diabetes, then the Guard/Reserve is not going to initiate a medboard based on the percentage of your rating alone.",
