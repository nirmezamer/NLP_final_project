We encourage you to start your knowledge adventure there before making a new post, as you might be able to find your answers there.\n\nClick [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/w/index) to access the Knowledge Base.\n\nOf course, if you are having trouble finding an answer in the Knowledge Base or in previously posted threads or you simply want more specific feedback, feel free to make a new post.\n\nBut, before you make a new post please be mindful of the Sub's rules:\n\n1. Help other: Don't be a jerk. If your comment is not constructive or helpful, do NOT hit reply.\n2. We're Ad-Free:  Do **not** recommend a service or product - unless as a comment to a post **specifically** asking for recommendations, **and** it is a service or product that you have direct experience using. Posting links to useful content (videos, blogs, web pages) is fine, but posts  that we determine to be purely promotional will be deleted.\n3. Don't doxx yourself, or anyone else: Respect Reddit's tradition of anonymity and don't disclose your information or that of others. Please no phone numbers, emails, license numbers, or other contact information. This also includes QR codes (the box with black and white squares) on decision letters. This rule does **NOT** apply to private entities such as VSOs, law firms, or other official agencies. EXAMPLE: It's fine to post the VA's phone number, but not an examiner's professional/personal contact information.\n4. News should only be posted once: Breaking news often gets posted and reposted. We all  enjoying seeing news posted ONCE, but a dozen posts saying  basically the same thing not so much - and this also makes discussion  tough, since nobody knows which post to comment on.\n5. Memes are for Mondays: Please keep the Meme posts to Mondays.\n6. Get verified if you want to say you work for XXX: If you are a VA employee, VSO, Accredited Claims Agent, etc. Your credentials **MUST** be verified via the sub's [Mod Mail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/VeteransBenefits) **BEFORE** you can claim to be someone of such authority.

Take a look at the screenshots from a concurring opinion by Justice Gorsuch. He cites an example of a veteran who lost his appeal in the courts because the courts gave deference to the VA's denial based on *Chevron*'s requirement that courts simply defer to agency interpretations under most circumstances. And since the VA is in the habit of making many self-serving policy interpretations that disfavor claimants, this necessarily results in many veterans losing benefits that the law almost certainly says they're entitled to. I suspect that today's decision will open the floodgates of veterans' appeals being heard and decided favorably in the courts going forward.
