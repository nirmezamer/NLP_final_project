I'm solo travelling (I will be staying in Hostels but im not 100% sure i'll meet people who are down to go out) so im looking for a pub crawl that is solo traveller friendly and is catered towards people in my age range (ie, in their 20s). Thank you.",
            "Hello! I will be traveling to Antigua, Guatemala from July 3 to July 10. I am a 23-year-old male from the United States and was looking to see if there are any other solo travelers that will be in the area during that time. I do not speak any Spanish at all, but I have been to Guatemala before on a trip with an organization that constructed buildings for orphanages. I am really looking forward to visiting this beautiful country as a tourist this time. I completely understand that I am going during the rainy season, but hopefully the weather will be somewhat nice on the days that I am there. If you are going, please feel free to reach out to me, in the comments, through private messaging me, or even sending me a message on Instagram: @lognew",

I see online that some countries want it to be valid for at least 6 months after your current trip, but that shouldn't be an issue for my December trip.\n\nI don't *think* I have anything planned soon where I need the passport (e.g., I just used it a couple weeks ago as a second ID while checking in for a certification exam). Except I haven't booked flights for December trip yet and they may want my passport number when booking (or could just be before check-in), which I assume will change on renewal.",

Then they told me they'd give it to me today and didn't. I'm getting worried they don't have a homestay option available for me and I won't have any place to stay when I get in country.

        "content": "So I am 25f from the US, finished up school recently and finally have a job that allows me the time and money to travel. I did not travel much as a kid and it was always my goal to be in a position where I am able to travel. I had about a week off in March and decided to book a trip to Europe. I chose Madrid because the plane tickets were the cheapest! I also have a basic understanding of Spanish and thought I would feel more comfortable in a country where I can somewhat communicate in their language. \n\n*Budget:*\n\nTotal I spent was around $2,000 for everything... accommodation, airfare, food, activities. I could have probably gone cheaper but I wanted to stay in a hotel where I felt safe as it was my first time alone in a different country. So I picked a more expensive hotel in the city center.\n\n*Trip Length:*\n\n5 days, Monday - Friday! Mid-March 2024.\n\n*Accommodation:*\n\nHotel Regina: Alcala 19\n\nThe hotel was great! The location is unbeatable. It's in the middle of all the activities and sites that I wanted to see. To one side, you have the Royal Palace, to the other you have El Retiro Park. Everything is walkable from the hotel. I felt completely safe in this area and there were always people out at all hours. There is also a Metro station 1 minute away that I used to get to and from the airport. The rooms were updated and nice, but the only complaint I had was that the walls were so thin that you could hear everything out in the hall and in the rooms next to you. I did still feel safe and the front desk was very responsive to any concerns. There was also no view unless you want to pay for the more expensive rooms (no thanks!). I utilized the free breakfast buffet at the hotel which was amazing! It was easy to just head out to explore the city without worrying about where to get breakfast. \n\n*Getting to/from airport*\n\nThe Madrid airport has two metro stations. Once you go through immigration, there are large signs that point you in the direction of the exit and metro station. There are kiosks there where you can buy a ticket. I bought a 10 Journey Ticket (you are given a metro card). Since you are leaving the airport, you need to add an \"Airport extra charge\" to your purchase. Again, on the day you enter the airport through the metro, you need to add an airport extra charge again onto your metro card. It has to be purchased on the same day and before you enter the airport. People who didn't purchase the airport extra charge weren't able to pass through the turn styles entering the airport and had to wait in a long line at the kiosks to load it onto their metro cards. The metro was easy to use and navigate. I had a backpack and small suitcase with me and did just fine. I had to change trains twice to get from the airport to my station \"Sevilla\". I would highly recommend the app \"Citymapper\" which is what I used to find the correct route on the metro to my hotel. \n\n*Activities:*\n\n- **Plaza Mayor**: went there, took obligatory photos, walked around for 20 minutes, and was done. Way too many people and too touristy for me as a solo traveler. \n\n- **Royal Palace**: Absolutely beautiful location. I would recommend buying an entrance ticket online if you want to see the inside. There was a very long line to buy tickets there, but I walked right in because I had bought mine previously. The palace is beautiful but my favorite part was the observation deck. That is free and the view is beautiful. I ended up coming back almost daily to watch the sunset from there. It was stunning. \n\n- **Campo Del Moro Park**: Large park just behind the royal palace observation deck. Very tranquil and not very many people there. I didn't go down into it but saw it from above. \n\n- **Plaza de Espana**: This is a very nice area with **Monumento Cervantes**. Cute area with kids playing on the playgrounds, interesting buildings. Not a far walk from **Temple of Debod**. I did not buy tickets to go inside the temple but took you can take the stairs up and walk around the area. There are some nice views of the city from there. \n\n- **Retiro Park**: I walked around this park for at least 3-4 hours. I started at one end and kind of looped my way around to the other end to make sure I covered as much of it as possible. It is gorgeous and so peaceful. People are out there exercising, walking their dogs, school groups are touring the park as well. In late March, the flowers were blossoming and it was sunny and green. In the park, you have to see **the lake**, **the crystal palace**, and so many other monuments and gardens. **Puerta de Alcala** is also a can't miss monument super close to one of the park entrances. \n\n- **Bike tour of Madrid**: I booked a \"highlights of Madrid bike tour\" online and it was a great decision. I would recommend booking a tour like this on your first day. We basically rode around the whole city starting at Retiro Park and ending at the Royal Palace. We stopped along the way and learned a lot of information about different parts of the city. It was a really good introduction to the city and I was able to note what places I wanted to return to and see more of. \n\n- **Prado Museum**: Beautiful. I am not an art person but could not miss out on this. It took me about 3 hours to see most of the museum and I was going at a pretty fast pace. I also had a nice meal at the museum cafe. \n\n- **Reina Sofia Museum**: This was very different from the Prado. I probably would not recommend this one if you had to choose one or the other. It was smaller and the collections were separated in different rooms and the hallways were kind of bare. This one took me about 1.5 hours. They have cool glass elevators and a nice courtyard. \n\n- **Mercado de San Miguel**: Amazing spot to try some food. I was anxious to go solo but it turned out great. The place is so packed that you are squeezed in there like sardines so everyone is kind of solo there. You just find a place to stand and eat your food and it's not awkward at all. The vendors spoke English, I could pay with card, and there was a large selection of foods. Lots of tourists here!\n\n*Final Thoughts:*\n\nI had a very nice first solo trip. While walking around, I couldn't believe that I was on another continent all alone. I opened up my maps several times just to see the blue dot of where I was so it would sink in. I walked 20,000 steps a day, saw so many beautiful things, and ate some good food. I am a pretty shy person by nature so it was sometimes awkward to go eat alone or have to communicate in Spanish. I am not a partier either so my trip consisted of getting up early, seeing as much as I could during the day, and being back at the hotel shortly after dark. I went the majority of my days without talking to other people. I will definitely be taking more solo trips because it's just so easy to plan when you don't have to coordinate with other people's schedules. Trips like this really force you to be alone with yourself and step out of your comfort zone. I cannot wait to plan another trip!",
