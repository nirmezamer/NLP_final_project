            "Hello everyone. I would love to go to an island like Hawaii, any time from September going, for like 1 week. There's no one I can go with and would prefer not to go solo. If you're planning to go to an island as well, from September going, and would like to go with me, please let me know and I will tell you more about myself. But this is a little bit about me now-I'm a 27 year old Black woman in Houston, who loves to travel, especially to islands with beautiful beaches.",

Where to start?\n\nI\u2019m 24 m I\u2019ve traveled once a year with my family but we\u2019re starting to split apart and become more independent. \n\nA lot of my friends have girlfriends they travel with. I\u2019m also very introverted and keep to myself unless I know you well. \n\nIs there a warm up vacation I can take to get used to traveling alone I want to travel this summer. Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated.",
            "Hi All,\n\nI (27M) am planning a solo trip in early September to Costa Rica. I am very much into the outdoors and would be looking to stay in social hostels (initially targeting Selina) in order to meet other travelers.\n\nRight away, I'm dead set on arriving in San Jose and immediately taking a shuttle to La Fortuna. From there, after doing some research I've narrowed it down to two options. Must stay a night in San Jose at the end to catch a morning flight home.\n\nItinerary 1:\n\nSan Jose Airport to La Fortuna\n\nLa Fortuna (3 nights)\n\nMonteverde (2 nights)\n\nManuel Antonio (3 nights)\n\nSan Jose (1 night)\n\nItinerary 2:\n\nSan Jose Airport to La Fortuna\n\nLa Fortuna (2 nights)\n\nMonteverde (2 nights)\n\nSanta Teresa (2 nights)\n\nManuel Antonio (2 nights)\n\nSan Jose (1 night)\n\nRight now I am leaning toward option 1 since that would be fewer long bus rides. However, I want to make the most of the limited time I have, and it seems most people on reddit highly recommend Santa Teresa for backpackers. At the same time it seems the options are more limited in Manuel Antonio. Any advice or recommendations would be appreciated.",

For the most part I\u2019m very excited but also a little anxious, even though it\u2019s a short \u201ceasy\u201d trip it\u2019s still my first. I pretty much picked one day to knock out the museum tours, then plan on spending the rest of the time exploring the city and maybe making a day trip to The Hague. This will also be my first time staying in a hostel, so a little anxious about that. I\u2019m a pretty social person back home (USA) but also kinda shy at the same time.

            "HELP - I\u2019ve gotten food poisoning for the first time, in India. I\u2019m wondering how long I should wait to be able to eat again before I see a doctor. It took about 24h to keep fluids down, and those are fine now, but I still feel really queasy after eating anything and I\u2019ve been eating one meal of vegetables per day (keep those nutrients up as best I can) and that\u2019s it. How long should it take to be able to eat a regular meal?\n\nDr. Google says anything from 24h \u2014> ER to \u201cup to two weeks no biggie\u201d which is like\u2026 not a helpful range. \n\nIm no longer in India, have since flown to Iraq, and will try to find electrolytes as soon as I can.",

I also can't drive (well - I haven't driven for a long time and don't feel comfortable getting back into a car yet)\n\nI was thinking about Dahab in Egypt, maybe Morocco or a Greek island, I really don't know. It'd be a 7-10 day vacation from the UK, and I'm 27(M) if it matters at all. \n\nA dream would be a road trip around Namibia but I think that's too expensive and probably better shared with someone else.",

I'm trying to use my first solo trip as a way of really spending time having fun with myself. National or international both work. Here's some info:\n\nInterests: food, outdoor activities, adventurous stuff (think things that someone trying to be more carefree and daring might do, like caving or zip lining, but also things like nightclubbing, etc.).\n\nPoint of trip: try new things, get out of my comfort zone, let loose...but not too loose.\n\nIdeal weather: warm but not going above 90F\n\nMoney: under $3k.\n\nLength of trip: a week or less.\n\nAny and all suggestions are appreciated. I would love something relatively quick to plan so I can go in August, but I'm also open to planning something for September-December.\u00a0"

            "Miami is an interesting place\u2014 I live somewhat close to it so I\u2019ve visited numerous times and have had mixed experiences.\u00a0\n\nIf you\u2019re a woman who\u2019s solo-traveling there (or maybe a man, but I can only speak for women), expect to be hassled by club promoters on the beach. On one group trip, a promoter legitimately called my friend fat because we very politely declined his offer for tickets.\u00a0\n\nThings can get REALLY expensive, REALLY fast. Take Club LIV for example. Super famous club, if you listen to rap you\u2019ve heard of it. But it can be nearly $100 just to walk into the place, and then very basic drinks (e.g., vodka soda) start at $25+. When I went, I was drinking beer all night just to keep it around $15 per drink. Plus, the music was trash, rendering it not even that fun!!!\u00a0\n\nOn the expensive point, most restaurants and bars in Miami Beach tack on an automatic 20% service charge regardless of party size. Which is especially frustrating being that Miami is home of some of the slowest, rudest service around.\u00a0\n\nDO NOT DRIVE THERE. I REPEAT, DO NOT DRIVE THERE. Anecdotally, I have been involved in several terrifying road incidents there (e.g., presumably-drunk drivers barreling toward you through 5 lanes of traffic at 120 mph), and statistically, I work in insurance and see an insane volume of fraudulent auto claims come out of Miami. Do not drive there.\u00a0\n\nLike I said, I\u2019m geographically almost a local so I\u2019ve had time to have tons of negative experiences. But on a more positive note! The beaches are just beautiful and I love the hot weather. Miami is a melting pot of many different Caribbean cultures which is a beautiful thing. The Cuban food and coffee is top tier. Drink a mojito! Go dancing! It\u2019s a lot of fun and I wouldn\u2019t keep going back if there wasn\u2019t something to love about Miami.\u00a0\n\nI would say to just be prepared to spend a little money, Uber/walk/take public transit, and just be wary of scams like you would in any other tourist hotspot. You\u2019ll be perfectly fine."

I know and I admit, that is the craziest financial decision of my life. And my vacation was approved.\n\nBut that's not the point, I only have Sydney Opera House, Darling Harbour, Opera Bridge, Australia Zoo, Bondi Beach, and the Gold Coast. I haven't thought about New Zealand and Brisbane yet. Where should I go? Here's my plan:\n\nI'm arriving in Australia in November 3 from Houston since it's cheaper, concert in Sydney is on November 7, then I'm flying to Auckland on the 10th, then Auckland concert is on the 13th, and flying to Brisbane on the 15th, then back to Sydney on the 19th and flying back home. Enough time to scope the concert grounds out. So I have free 6 days in Sydney area, 4 in Auckland area, and 4 in Brisbane area. I have $5,000 saved up for leisure, since I bought the tickets and I'm not sure if that's enough, but I will save up $3,000 more until November, just in case of an emergency and just extra leisure cash.\n\nPlease leave any recommendations or any good advice on where to visit, eat, and experience, or just anything good in general. It's also my first time flying long haul alone. \n\nThank you and have a good one,\nJames D.",

            "Hi I live in Sydney. You definitely won't run out of things to do. Sydney is a huge city that also has nature on its doorstep. \n\nNot sure what kind of things you like though? \n\nSome ideas for Sydney:\n- day trip to blue mountains (nice views, Australian bush and nature, hiking). The \"grand canyon\" walk is a good one. \n- Sydney beaches. Australia has awesome beaches galore and that even includes Sydney. Bondi beach is the most famous and it's a cool place to people watch and get amongst the crowd. From there I also highly recommend doing the \"Bondi to Coogee\" walk if you don't mind walking. You will see nice clifftops, beaches as well as get a vibe for the Sydney beach life. \n- day trip to royal national park. The beaches mentioned above are more like \"city beaches\" (beautiful and enjoyable in their own way but not as wild/untouched). If you want more of the wild nature scenery go to the royal national park for a hike over magical headlands and cliffs and stop at a beach for a swim. I think the area between garie beach and burning palms beach is the most beautiful. \n- Newtown: a cool place to experience some of the alternative scene in Sydney. Good food, great bars, cool little shops, live music\n- to eat: Sydney brings a lot of cultures' foods together. Be prepared for immense multiculturalism and great food, especially from Italy and Asian countries. Try Rivareno gelato, Australian cafe culture (coffee and brunch), Chinatown, Surry hills\n- do a walk from darling square to Darling Harbour to Barangaroo to Circular Quay. Follow the harbour waters edge the whole way around (as much as you can). You can enjoy the city and water views, there are many bars, restaurants ,nice architecture and people of all walks of life enjoying themselves. \n- chill at opera bar for a drink and a prime viewing spot of the opera house.\n\nSydney is immense. I've lived here for 5 years and there is always something new to explore. \n\nHere are some other places I will just mention without going into detail: botanic gardens, Barangaroo, Surry hills, Kings Cross, Darlinghurst",
            "Only four days in New Zealand? And four days in our dreary boring-as main city. Ouch.\n\nAs one commenter said, look at going South to Waitomo caves, Rotorua and see what you can along the way. You'll need to hire a car. Public transport sucks here.  I would not even bother thinking about going to the South Island. Simply not enough time.\n\nI'm not based in top of the North Island so I'll let other people suggest activities. The main problem you've got is time. New Zealand is mostly about the outdoor geography-specific experiences - snow and mountains and Fjords in the South, beaches and swimming, hiking, scenery. A wide variety of geography in a relatively small area - but getting around is difficult. There is very little good or cheap or fast inter-city transport.\n\nTry posting in /r/newzealand/ for itinerary ideas",
            "If you go to the north island go to Waitomo Caves. Do the full experience. I had a fucking blast. I could have spent the whole day in those caves man.",
            "I live in Auckland, and even though it isn\u2019t the typical tourist destination in NZ there definitely are options for a good time. You could make a trip over on the ferry to Waiheke for a day trip, in November it will be lovely! Take a bus wine tour if you like wine, or zoom around on a scooter. Take hikes through the waitakeres if you like nture, head out to piha if you have transport to see a wild black sand beach.\n\nYou could also head over to tiritiri matangi island and see some endangered native birds and nature.\n\nOtherwise it is possible to drive over to Rotorua if you time it right, it\u2019s quite a unique town for tourists to visit.\n\nAnd as someone mentioned, waitomo caves if you can.\n\nRenting a car would be easiest (although it will be the opposite side of the road)",
            "There's not a lot to do in Auckland. As far as cities go it's super boring and spread out. In Auckland there are nice beaches and the War Memorial Museum is good (not all war stuff, promise), however I'd head out to one of the islands. Tiritiri Matangi Island is fantastic and well worth the price if you enjoy nature and want to learn about our native birds or Rangitoto for a good walk and view of Central Auckland.\n\nLike others have said I'd head south of Auckland. I took my Canadian friend around earlier this year and she loved it, was so happy we spent minimal time in Auckland. I did Hobbiton for the first time and while I'm not a LOTR fan, it was outstanding! Waitomo Caves are always solid. We did the glow worm and Rua Kuri caves. Rua Kuri was my favourite as it was a much, much smaller group and you had longer in the caves. Te Puia in Rotorua has an excellent tour, you can spend as much time in the park as you'd like and you get to see kiwi. I'm from that area and also lived for years in Auckland so feel free to send me questions you might have!",
            "Sydney you could take the ferry from Opera house area (circular quay) to Manly beach or Watsons Bay, both are beautiful and memorable. Only ferries I've ever been on in my life so I thought it was pretty cool.\n\nLike another person said, Bondi to Coogee is pretty incredible. No point in hanging around at Bondi though, the beaches south are better and less touristy. (I lived in Bondi for a few months)\n\nAustralia has a lot of high end fast food and that's always the type of place I liked to eat. Go to an actual sit down restaurant and you will cry at the bill, but the fancy fast food is good and not as pricey.\n\nAlso I saw Coldplay in Melbourne and it was an amazing show, I think you will love it!",
            "I\u2019ve lived in Auckland. A great day trip is to take the [Fuller\u2019s ferry](https://www.fullers.co.nz/destinations-and-experiences/destinations/rangitoto-island/) from downtown to Rangitoto island, and do the couple-hour walk to the top. The view is great and the island is a relatively new (600yo?) dormant volcano so the landscape is surreal.\n\nIf you have a couple of days spare, take a flight to [Queenstown](https://www.queenstownnz.co.nz/).",
            "I did an electric bike tour in Sydney and loved it! I try to do bike tours in any new international city I'm in because you can cover a lot of the highlights in a short time and get your bearings, then decide later which areas you want to go back to. I was glad to have an electric bike (was my first time on one). We got to ride to areas that wouldn't be as accessible for most infrequent riders on a conventional bike. \n\nI also did the Sidney Harbor Bridge Climb, which I highly recommend! It's expensive, but it truly is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. \n\nIn Brisbane, Lone Pine Koala sanctuary. I really enjoyed Brisbane. It has a completely different feel than Sydney. Also, took a ride on the Wheel at night.",
            "What are your interests? It\u2019s hard to provide recommendations without knowing this.\n\nCan you cancel the Brisbane leg of the trip? Taronga Zoo in Sydney is probably the best zoo in Australia and Brisbane is pretty uninteresting. Auckland Zoo is also excellent.\n\nI\u2019d suggest seeing a show at the Sydney Opera House. It\u2019s a great venue and hosts a remarkably wide range of acts.",
