I am thankful for the great music and performances they gave us.  Its so sad that their company fell apart.  I hope they all land well and are able to reunite in the future if they all wish to come back to the industry.",

            "Man this is a tough pill to swallow. TAN was such a great project group and I think they had a ton of potential as a permanent lineup had their company not screwed everything/everyone over in order to save someone else. Ill keep hoping the members can reconnect at an agency willing to take them all in, they had something really special going.",
            "They have one of the best debut songs ever imo. Shame they werent able to find success, they were very talented and got screwed again. I wish them all the best",
            "It sounds childish for me to say, but this is genuinely unfair to the members. Theyre such talented people and their music was amazing. They really deserved more recognition than they got. Its such a loss as a fan too. \n\nIt really is terrible that it came to this. I really hope they find success in whatever they decide to do in the future. Might be too optimistic to say but i hope we see them together again someday",
            "Absolutely love TAN dududu and Walking on the Moon are some of my favorite kpop songs so I'll miss them, but I hope in the future they can reunite because this group is too special to be forgotten.",
            "Losing TAN and Pixy in the same month is too much Stanning nugus is so depressing",
            "So glad I got the opportunity to see them grow musically, with their last two releases being top tier!The uncertainty around their renewal was always there, so this isn't a surprise, but it still sucks. I wish the members everything of the best, their hard work didn't go unnoticed. Going to sad bop to Fix You for the rest of the day!",
            "This really sucks. They are so talented and I really like their music. \nI imagine Changsun might enlist. Hopefully, those who want will get a chance to get together again or continue on to do their own things in the industry.",
            "Its sad, although I didnt follow them closely, I enjoyed their title tracks and a few B-sides (Heartbeat was one of my most-played songs last year). This was a second (or more) chance for basically all the members, especially Jaejun, given its his 5th chance by now (C-Clown, TREI, Mixnine and JT&Marcus), which also made me consider that he is still quite young and basically spent almost half his life in the industry trying to chase his dreams. I feel bad for all the guys, but I feel the worst for him. \n\nI hope they can reunite one day, thank you for a solid singles run, TAN  <3"
