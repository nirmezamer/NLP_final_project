        "content": "***This list is updated on a consistent basis, so please make sure you read the whole thing before you post anything in this subreddit! Check back here regularly to see if your question hasn't been answered  first! Thank you!***\n\n***Intro***\n\n***The  TSA is an AMERICAN government agency. We do NOT know about ANY other  countries rules and regulations for air travel and wont be able to  answer anything about it. TSA is also not Customs and Border Protection  either. We cannot ask or speak on CBP's rules and regulations regarding  declaring things. Please make sure you visit*** [***CBP.gov***](https://cbp.gov/) ***for more in formation regarding this matter.***\n\n***Q: What are the types of ID's I can use to access the TSA screening checkpoint?***\n\nA: *There  are many types of ID's that are valid to use to identify you're self.  Here is a list of the MOST COMMON types (There are some that aren't as  common, but those are few and far between and wont be added here).*\n\n*State  ID/Drivers License, Global entry card, DOD ID (CAC Card), TWIC, Green  Card, passport, passport Card, Canadian ID's (some ID's will be added if  missed, so check back here frequently for a more updated list!).*\n\n*These  forms of ID are all valid to use at a checkpoint, and can be still used  if expired up to a year to the day before they become invalid. If  you're unsure of the process for that, please scroll down to the third  question in this thread.*\n\n**Q:** ***My ID has a hole punched in it will that be an issue?***\n\n*A: Only if it's expired more than a year just like any other ID. It's not an issue.*\n\n**Q: My name and ticket don't match, will that cause any issues?**\n\n*A:  Yes it will. Please remember that the name on your boarding pass HAS to  match the name on the ID. If it's off even a letter, you'll likely be  sent down to the ticketing agent to have it fixed. save yourself the  headache, and make sure that everything matches before you come up to  the checkpoint.*\n\n**Q:** ***Will TSA see my arrest record when they scan my ID?***\n\n*A: No. The only thing that our ID/Passport scanners check for is that you have a flight, and that your ID matches that information in the system. That's it. It doesn't \"check for\" or \"pull up\" any other information. If you're curious, ask the officer and they'll show you the screen.*\n\n*TSA isn't interested in anything other than if you have a flight and what type of screening you'll receive when you go through. Pre Check, Standard, or Selectee. That's it.*\n\n**Q: Why did my TSA Pre Check not show up?**\n\n*A:  The most common reason that we come across is that you just forgot to  put your KTN on your boarding pass. It's a simple fix if you're already  at the airport. Have the ticketing person do that before you come up,  but keep in mind that it take anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes for that  information to reflect in our system (if the airport is uses the new CAT  machines).*\n\nThe other most  common reason is that you likely didn't read the contract, that you  signed with TSA Pre Check. You're not always guaranteed to have it. The  is always a low % possibility you just don't get it for that trip. We  cannot do anything about that either.\n\n**Q**: **Can I bring my weed (plant, cart, wax, vape etc..) with me through security (this also applies to any other drug too)** ?\n\nA: *We're  not looking for drugs. Your drugs are not going to take a plane out of  the sky. However they're federally illegal to possess and each TSA  checkpoint is under FEDERAL JURISDICTION. If it is discovered during a  search on either on your person, or in your property, then you or your  property will be held until the police arrive, and decide what they want  to do with it. Do yourself a favor and DON'T bring it with you to the  airport. Period.*\n\n**Q: I'm 18+ years old and I've lost my ID/Passport and I'm flying \\*soon\\* What do i need to do?**\n\nA: *You  need any combination of these documents (only 2 are usually required)  SSN, Birth Cert, Mail with your name on it, Prescription meds with your  name on it, School ID, work ID, and older expired ID/Passport, Costco  Card... etc. Show up THREE hours early to your flight (2 is the  standard, but better safe than sorry).*\n\n**Q:  Will a temporary ID work?**\n\n*A:  There are some temporary ID that still work as a valid ID at some  checkpoints and airports, but the general consensus is that you should  follow the advice of the answer above this question. Bring the expired  ID with you and one from the list mentioned in the above answer. Bring  the temp ID, and the expired ID (in some cases the \"expired\" ID is still  usually valid for us, being within one year to the day of expiration)  and one of the documents from the list in the above answer and you'll be  good to go. Show up early too as you'll be getting some additional  screening!*\n\n**Q: What if I don't have, or don't have access to the documents above, what is the process for that!?**\n\nA: *If  you don't have access to those types of Identifying documents listed  above (away from home and lost a wallet for example) then you, and an  officer will be going through our Independent Verification Call Center  (IVCC) which could take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour. Disclaimer  here is if they cannot verify who you are, then you will not be flying  that day, and you cannot try this process again for 24 (TWENTY FOUR)  hours starting when the call ends with them. Just like stated above,  show up to the airport 3 HOURS EARLY.*\n\n**Q: I'm under 21 (18) and I want to bring my vape with me, but I don't want my parents to find out about it. What should I do?**\n\nA: *We're  not gonna know who's bag is who's when it's coming through the X-ray.  We also see literally thousands of vapes come through in a shift. We're  not going to tell because we don't care. you hide it where ever you  think is best IN YOUR BAG, NOT ON YOUR PERSON, and you'll be fine.*\n\n**Q: Can I take my protein powder with me though security?**\n\n*A:  Yes! You're more than welcome to bring it with you. It's likely that  it'll get some additional screening, but it's not a big deal for us. We  see it all the time.*\n\n**Q: Why do I keep getting \\_\\_\\_\\_ pat down?**\n\n*A: The short answer here is: We don't know why either. The point of security screening is to do just that screen passengers. When we get an alarm (or multiple alarms) we, as officers, have to resolve each and every one of those alarms before allowing you to continue on to your flight. If we can't resolve an alarm, then there are other measures that have to be taken. If you have more questions feel free to reach out to the mod team.* \n\n**Q: Why does my bag keep getting searched while going through security screening?** \n\n*A: This one is pretty straight forward. There is something in the bag the the X-Ray operator wanted to have looked at. If you keep having a item(s) in your bag get flagged each time you fly then we recommend that when you go through screening that you remove the item from the bag and send it separate from your belongings so the officers can see it and more easily clear said item.* \n\nFor our new hires and people in our hire process please make sure you ask your questions in the new subreddit created for everyone in the hire process and new hires up to full certification!\n\nGo check out r/TSAApplicant\n\nFinally, All post with these questions will be **removed** and referred back to this post moving forward! Please check back here regularly to make sure the answer isn't here first.",

I really wanted EWR, however, someone answered they had just promoted a bunch of sups, and effectively I received the notification that I wasn\u2019t referred. I did receive notification that I WAS referred to JFK and would like to know your opinion of this airport. Is it complete trash to be a supervisor in? To work at overall? If you currently work, or have worked at JFK I would like to know your honest opinion on the work culture at this airport. And tbh, should I deny? Or just transfer when I get the chance?

        "content": "I'm on a non-immigrant visa in the US, but I've been living here for over 2 years and expected to stay here for at least 4 more with my current status. All the CLEAR agents at airports told me that I can enroll as long as I have a US government/state issued ID, but I was always skeptical so never got out of the regular line to try it out. I also know that a lot of people with my status have successfully been able to enroll. However, I also know that a lot of states just issue a regular ID/license to nonresidents (but state residents), and temp ones are just paper. In Florida all IDs are REAL ID cards, including mine, but it says \"temporary\" on it. I'm not sure if that is  still eligible for enrolment? Can someone shed some light on this?\n\nA friend of mine had issues going through TSA with FL temporary license in other states because they said its temporary and not allowed, but I've never had trouble using it at any airport through TSA. So the whole situation seems like a hit-or-miss. I travel a lot, and I'm done with dealing with the regular lines.. but I obviously can't get PreCheck.\n\nAlso, if I sign up online but at the airport I find out I'm not eligible, will get refunded?",
