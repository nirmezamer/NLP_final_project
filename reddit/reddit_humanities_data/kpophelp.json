        "content": "Hey Helpers!\n\nOver in r/kpop we just posted a new special Town Hall that is focused only on the Flairs we use to help organize our posts based on content categories.\n\n**[Link to r/kpop's 'All About Flairs' Town Hall](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/1dexags/town_hall_all_about_post_flairs_june_2024/)**\n\nWe included announcements for new flairs here on r/kpophelp and also on r/kpoppers. The following is the section relevant for this subreddit.\n\n***\n\n## NEW FLAIRS!\n\n\n* **Advice** - This flair is replacing \u2018Discussion\u2019. We want to emphasize that r/kpophelp is not a general discussion subreddit. \u2018Advice\u2019 will be for users seeking advice for things like auditioning, concert preparation, those struggling with parasocial issues, etc.\n\n* **Merch** - Any questions related to the logistics of buying K-Pop products and merchandise should use this flair. Where to buy, shipping issues, legitimacy/reliability of vendors, or other logistical issues related to merch can use this flair. Remember that buying/selling products is not allowed here and that merch authentication should be done in the Monthly post pinned at the top of the subreddit.\n\n* **Research** - Academic surveys related to K-Pop or fandom topics.\n\n***\n\nModerators will be monitoring the use of these new flairs to see if there is any further confusion and need for more adjustments. All feedback is welcome! We still have upcoming plans to properly overhaul the rules, but getting these new flairs active is something we wanted to take care of first!",
