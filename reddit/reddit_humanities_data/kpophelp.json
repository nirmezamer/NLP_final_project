Don't even care if it's fanmade or not just want to solve this mystery!",
            "I hope this counts as a \"Who's This?\" if not I'll just make a whole post I guess. I have a very r/tipofmytongue type of request, but it's Kpop related so I'll ask here.\n\nSo earlier this year/maybe last year I saw a video on twitter of a fan screen recording their fansign video call with a certain female idol. She has a note I think that has written out in Korean something like \"Can you call me yeoboseyo without honorifics?\" and the member says something like \"No I don't like these kinds of games you should just ask me to call you yeobo\" and then stares into the camera and says yeobo twice.\n\nI don't know who this idol was. I remember she was wearing pink and she had black shoulder length hair ~~that was done with large curls. I think I remember looking her up at the time and she had recently left the group she was a part of. That's a huge maybe though I may be misremembering~~. (I guess that part came to me in a dream)\n\nDoes anyone have any idea what video I'm talking about?\n\nEDIT: OKAY I think it was Gaeul from IVE I'm like 99% sure, but I still haven't found the video lol\n\nEDIT 2: I FOUND THE VIDEO FOR ANYONE THAT CARES [https://x.com/GAEULDATA/status/1715352110366417087/video/1](https://x.com/GAEULDATA/status/1715352110366417087/video/1)",

The following is the section relevant for this subreddit.\n\n***\n\n## NEW FLAIRS!\n\n\n* **Advice** - This flair is replacing \u2018Discussion\u2019. We want to emphasize that r/kpophelp is not a general discussion subreddit. \u2018Advice\u2019 will be for users seeking advice for things like auditioning, concert preparation, those struggling with parasocial issues, etc.\n\n* **Merch** - Any questions related to the logistics of buying K-Pop products and merchandise should use this flair. Where to buy, shipping issues, legitimacy/reliability of vendors, or other logistical issues related to merch can use this flair. Remember that buying/selling products is not allowed here and that merch authentication should be done in the Monthly post pinned at the top of the subreddit.\n\n* **Research** - Academic surveys related to K-Pop or fandom topics.\n\n***\n\nModerators will be monitoring the use of these new flairs to see if there is any further confusion and need for more adjustments. All feedback is welcome! We still have upcoming plans to properly overhaul the rules, but getting these new flairs active is something we wanted to take care of first!",

            "No. I think many boy groups actually find it to be a nice change of pace in a way. (Seconding that they\u2019d find it refreshing.) If you like a group and have the chance to go, then you should go. \n\n(Also a guy fan here as well.)",
            "I\u2019m a male fan who attended an Ateez fansign in Korea and personally it was an amazing experience! \n\nI wouldn\u2019t say they acted differently outwardly to me because of my gender, though. \n\nDo keep in mind that they spend almost 24/7 with their other male group mates so if anything, they may feel more casual around you.",
            "Every boy group I've ever even casually followed likes to know that men are also their fans. Any artist would want to know that their work appeals to everyone.",

            "I'm not a Stay but i get a lot of reels from skz, fancalls, reactions, etc. They seem like genuine boys, very open minded too. They got  a background of supporting everybody too, whatever their gender or sexual orientation so like I doubt they'd be super judgemental. I think as long as you don't appear like a sasaeng or an asshole they'll welcome you and laugh with you and everything.",
