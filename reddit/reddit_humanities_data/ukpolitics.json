            "I really cant wait for the 5th just so I can detox my brain after constantly checking twitter for the next poll, and not look at politics for the next 4 years.\n\nI will not let myself get sucked into American politics",
            "The whole Biden thing has really given me the blues after weeks of nervous excitement about our election. The Republicans are now openly offering to destroy US democracy and the Democrats are standing by as they do. Like it or not - what happens in the US has a big impact on us and we're going to have barely 7 months of a Labour government before the crazy descends. Reform MPs will be inviting the MAGA/Project 25 architects to parliament to discuss how the same thing can happen here.",
            "Found out this morning that my Gran who has always said she could never vote for anyone except Conservative because thats who her parents always voted for and theyd turn in their graves if she voted for anyone else (despite them being dead for 40 years) has voted Reform. If the Tories have managed to lose her then theyre really fucked. 70 years of only voting for one party finished because she quite likes that Farage guy.",
            "One thing we should take advantage of by not being in the EU is not having tariffs on solar panels and electric vehicles.\n\nWe need to focus on accelerating our green transition, reducing reliance on oil and gas, and not protecting VW from competition.",
            "Doing reenactment at a pagan festival and the political conversation is a heady brew of Green and Reform.\n\nIt's very odd.",
            "Which defeated MP do you think is going to give the most graceless Susan Hall-style concession speech? My money is on Johnny Mercer.",
            "Was on a Labour campaign call tother day and at the beginning they played a video of Labours (v high level) history. Towards the end they had Browns speech to Conference listing Labours achievements. Its pretty strong stuff and my partner pointed out the Keir could do with taking notes. That level of emotive passion just doesnt seem to be in his repertoire.",
            "In the great fire of London the police were trying to pull down houses to stop the fire spreading, but the fire was too fast so they had to start on another house to pull down. This is the same as the Tories trying to defend their safe seats as they retreat further and further into their heartlands.",
            "Anyone want to predict a time on election night when politicians move from its only an exit poll to accepting their fate?",
            "I have sympathy for the PM on the recent issue, but notice the media is focusing on that slur, and not the wishes for death to immigrants and homophobia also spewed in that expose."

            "Odd how they weren't alarmed when it was helping them",
            "This isnt new news. Weve known about this sort of interference since at least 2016. \n\nWhat theyre alarmed about is that its likely being used to screw with the Tory vote.",
            "They covered up a whole report on this previously.",
            "Its a shame that there wasnt some report written about Russian interference in our elections 5 years ago.",

            "Perhaps you shouldn't have taken loads of Russian money, perhaps you should have investigated Russian interference into UK politics and parliament.",
            "It wasn't an issue during Brexit or 2019 I remember?\n\nWho cares what the soon to be 3rd place thinks about anything?",
            "They didnt care when they helped with brexit! You reap what you sow asshats",
            "We've known about this happening on all social media for several years but nobody has done anything to try counter it yet. These feckless Tories are 100% responsible because they've been in power the entire time this has been happening and they chose to ignore it. But now they're alarmed , they absolutely should be alarmed but it's getting very late in the game now",
            "Oh, so now that they aren't backing them they care."

            "You know, given that Sunak is earnestly not a smoking fan, I genuinely thought this might have been dropped in the washup for a good reason, like wanting to prioritise other more urgent bills.\n\nNope, just more grubbiness.",
            "Tobacco firms were unsurprisingly trying to protect their interests, but I think the real reason it was dropped was because it was an unpopular bill*, and trying to wave it through in the wash-up process would cause unnecessary noise at the start of an election campaign...as it turned out, the noise this likely would have made would have been a drop in the ocean compared to what really happened.\n\n*Unpopular in the sense 57 Tory MPs  including Kemi Badenoch, voted against it, I don't think Rishi and his team wanted the risk this could cause public disunity at the beginning of an election campaign.",
            "They've dropped many of their manifesto promises over the years , it was highly unlikely they'd do anything that meant they'd lose a source of revenue. Cheap publicity stunt, that's all it was.",
            "Does anybody think absolute drugs prohibitions actually work though?\n\nThe same people who tell you banning cannabis has never worked then turn around and argue to ban cigarettes",
            "Well that was fucking dumb. One chance to do something meaningful before he is consigned to the dumpster fire of history and he fucks it up.",
            "No surprise, weakness in the face of doing something great, really shows his character.",

Partially that's because of how bad new town planning is here, but partially that's because people don't want anything (if infrastructure is built, they'll complain about that too).",
            "Well, considering the Lib Dems love to be NIMBYs alongside the Greens, I find that hard to believe.",
            "I'm a homeowner but very anti-NIMBY so this massively puts me off the Lib Dems. I still prefer them over Reform as opposition so probably will still vote LD as their other policies are generally good.",
            "His argument is correct though  you need to build the infrastructure _with_ the new houses. Shopping rows, doctors' surgeries and schools, if you can't give them a train station (lol), at least ensure the roads are suitable for a regular bus service to other populated places, ideally with bike paths.\n\nA national framework, rewriting the existing planning laws, and planning it on a wider scale is key. Let's see if Labour deliver.",
            "A vote for LD is a vote to continue the low growth no build spiral we are stuck in.",
            "We need to build the right houses like 6-8 storey maximum houses that have greenery nearby. Building tower blocks should not be the way forward.\n\nInfrastructure will be needed. Can't just have thousand people move in and not improve the roads, public transport, or access to schools and doctors",
            "Sounds like we also just need a way to either cut down om population growth for the need of new houses or get people who are hoarding large houses to downsize"
