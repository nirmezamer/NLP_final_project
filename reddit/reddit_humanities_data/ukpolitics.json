            "Ben Wallace: \"I think Nigel Farage is a bit like that pub bore we have all met at the end of the bar who often says if \u2018I was running the country\u2019 and presents very simplistic answers to actually I am afraid in the 21st century complex problems. It is not that easy to govern a country but also to find international solutions to problems\u00a0\u2026\"\n\nHard to disagree with any of that.",

            "As I sit at work early on a Saturday morning, tired, alone, and literally just watching ice melt for a few hours, I ended up thinking back to the calling of the election. There was that first mini-gaffe where Sunak strongly promised a woman he would pass a new law before the end of Parliament in the morning, then dissolved Parliament that afternoon. \n\nThere was a lot of discussion at the time on if he had meant what he said, but then in those couple of hours suddenly decided to call the election with no warning. Or of he was always planning to call it that day and was lying to her about passing new laws.\n\nThe betting scandal makes it pretty obvious that Sunak knew ahead of time he was calling the election, so was clearly lying to her. It's not a big surprise as everyone by now knows how little regard he holds for other people, but it's incredible just how readily and easily he finds deceiving random people for even super short term gains.\n\nIronically it still leaves the possibilities that either he still only decided literally the day before, or he trusts his own team so little that he had to wait until the last possible moment to tell them, and then they were still so incompetent they managed to cause him yet another scandal.",

            "It's irrelevant talking about who would benefit more or less when the real talking point should be that Reform's proposals are not in any way grounded in reality and would be completely un-deliverable anyway.",
            "Of course. The whole point of the Reform UK project, just like the Tories, is to rebuild Britain to become a tax haven for the wealthy and a sweatshop/forced labour colony for the rest of us. This is what Brexit was all about. \n\nYou don't need workers rights or proper wages, you don't need free healthcare, affordable housing or a benefits system, you don't need human rights... all this is 'woke' nonsense. \n\nIf you think Farage is 'telling it like it is' and all this stuff they're taking from you is going to be replaced, I suggest you go have a lie down and stay well away from plastic carrier bags and sharp objects.",
            "\"People who pay more tax benefit from tax cut shocker\". \n\nI'm not shill for Reform by any stretch, but these headlines (which can apply to any income tax cut by any party) very much fall into \"bear shits in woods\" category. \n\nThat said, the 40% threshold is too low. What was originally sold as a tax that only affects the highest earners is now starting to catch a lot of fairly ordinary people on fairly ordinary career trajectories.",
            "Well, all the fiscal drag and tax polices for the past 20 years benefited the low earners. 10% of population pays 60% of income tax. And let's not forget that we have one of the highest marginal tax rates in the world. \nA high earner in UK pays scandinavian level of tax without the benefits that comes with it ( like no free tuition, no free childcare, even worse, you no longer allowed to use childcare funded through your own tax money , and so on ). Being a high earner in UK is a bad return on investment compared to most of the countries IMHO.\n\nAnd before you throw shit at me. The high earners are not the problem. They're the solution. Higher earner \u2260 rich. Those are still people that work for a living. Doctors, engineers, IT professionals and so on. Currently what is happening is that we got a 8 milion NHS backlog and doctors are reducing hours not to hit 70% marginal tax rates. IT professionals and remote workers moving abroad for a better standard of living and lower taxes. That's what crab mentality gets you, a worse off society without growth.",
            "Of course they are, but isn\u2019t this right out of the modern right wing populist playbook?\n- You target the relentlessly shat on post-industrial urban poor. You say that you\u2019re the only one who gets them and can bring back the good old days.\n- You make promises that sound good on paper but are either entirely undeliverable or would do more harm than good\n- you get in and being in massive tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit yourself and the rich/powerful you\u2019ve been cozying up to\n- you dismantle and/or sell off large operations of government to those same people on the cheap to pay for it\n- you get the hell outta dodge before everyone realises you\u2019re just a snake oil salesman and they\u2019ve been conned.",
            "That's exactly what Trump did - massive tax cuts that disproportionately benefitted the higher earners while making sure that it threw a crumbs in the direction of the lower paid. \n\nBut it's those lower paid people who'll provide the bulk of the votes that Farage/Trump needed to get elected, like Trump he'll chuck in some other populist stuff about immigrants stealing your jobs. \n\nThis is basically a political Stockholm syndrome at work.",
            "Next you're going to tell me their other policies disproportionately benefit Putin!",
            "It\u2019s convenient how people attack the Tories for freezing income tax thresholds. And then when a party actually proposes reversing the threshold freezes, they get attacked for \u201ctax cuts for the rich\u201d.",
            "What a surprise. Dig into Far Right Rage\u2019s history and you\u2019ll see his backing from likes of sex predator hedge funder Crispin Odey and Aaron Banks. About as much a man of the people as Rees Mogg. But like Hitler 1932 appears teflon despite the obvious evil nature of it."

            "Always surprised it is as high as 1 in 10. Assuming that's the absolutely privileged children of the super-elite? Genuinely curious who these people are.\n\nI don't expect the other 9 are voting Labour, or even to various left parties. But I can't think of a single reason any 18-24 would vote Tory. They've been watching their future get systemically fucked by this government for their entire lives. What could possibly appeal?",
            "Fuck the Conservative Party, I couldn\u2019t care less for the fate of that as an organisation. \n\nI am worried by this though. Only 1 in 10 might be voting Conservative, but I don\u2019t believe that means 9 in 10 are committed left wing progressives. There\u2019s going to be the same underlying spread of views on the economic and social issues as there was 5 years ago.\n\nThat means there\u2019s a decent sized block of 13-19 year olds who will be looking for a \u201cright\u201dish party in the 2029 election. I\u2019m not looking forward to finding out who fills that gap.",
            "The old saying is that if you're not a socialist by the age of 20, you don't have a heart and if you're not a conservative by the age of 40 you don't have a brain. The conservatives have been relying on the shift in people's attitudes towards them as they age. \n\nThe real danger to them is not that young people are leftists. They've always been. The real danger is that the people are not shifting to the right in same numbers as they used to. In particular the millennials who should be in that transition are much more leftists than the previous generations at the same time. \n\nOne reason is the home ownership. They are struggling to buy their first house. When you own a house, you suddenly care a lot more on the protection of wealth than if you don't. If you don't own a house, you're much more open to redistributing policies of the left (although the current Labour is not promising much on this).",
            "It's not that far off the general population to be honest. Current polls show that less than 2 in 10 are voting for the Tories."

            "Sunak and Starmer are right. Farage is saying that Poland, the Baltic states and other countries with a pretty recent history of being invaded by Moscow shouldn\u2019t have chosen to protect themselves by joining NATO. Finland and Sweden did not feel a need to join NATO until Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine. \n\nAnd Putin\u2019s views on Ukrainian autonomy and independence pre-date the expansion of NATO: there is a clip of him from the early 1990s in which he complains about how Lenin gave autonomy to Ukraine after the collapse of the Russian Empire. He has repeated these views ever since: he wrote an article in 2021 entitled \u201cOn the Historical Unity of the Russian and Ukrainian People\u201d and his invasion speech of February 2022 was a long lecture about why the collapse of the Russian Empire and the USSR were bad things.",

            "Remember when people said Corbyn and Labour were threats to national security? I\u2019m no Corbyn fan but I think it pales into comparison to what farage has said. I can\u2019t imagine a world in which the British prime minister (farage) and American president (trump) are both tools of Russia\u2019s dictator. I can imagine putins glee at getting his men into high office in the two countries which have traditionally been seen as the leaders of the western world.",
            "Maybe I've missed the other parties response + possible they just haven't got to it *quite* yet. But I'm pretty disappointed that the other parties have taken the opportunity to absolutely dogpile into Farage/Reform on his statement about Ukraine.",

I mean, as much of a useless prick as he is and as much as his campaign has been like an episode of The Thick of It, here's Farage sticking up for Putin and it won't do his campaign ANY harm at all. Meanwhile every time Sunak opens his mouth it seems enough for him to lose a few more points."
