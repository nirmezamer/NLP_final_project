I tuned all my social media to disallow sensitive content. \n\n\nDespite this, for the last week or so, my Instagram feed (following feed, not explore) is suddenly filled with porn or borderline porn accounts of generalized women. I\u2019ll be scrolling through videos and pictures on my feed of people I follow, then, randomly, it\u2019ll be a video from an account I don\u2019t follow of random women doing  sexual acts uploaded to some generic \u201cexplore\u201d page (always new accounts). Because it isn\u2019t even in the \u201csuggested for you\u201d category, there\u2019s no way for me to use the \u201csee less like this\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not interested.\u201d I\u2019m stuck blocking them every time, but it\u2019s up to 5x per day. These aren\u2019t even accounts of just one person/girl, but accounts that post various videos of various women every hour, yet they aren\u2019t filtered as spam and they show up in my feed as though I follow them. When I refresh my page, it just bumps up to the top and doesn\u2019t disappear. \n\n\nI\u2019m not hacked, as I\u2019m not following any of them, but I\u2019m so lost right now. \n\n\nI posted my experience to my story and an old classmate of mine confirmed it was also happening to her and it was similarly bad because it\u2019s so shocking and triggering for her. \n\n\nIs anybody else experiencing this? Has anybody found any solutions? It\u2019s making this app unusable. I want my social media to be safe from porn as much as I can because it is horrifying to me. I\u2019ve used Instagram since it was released and I\u2019ve never experienced this. ",

I keep feeling embarrassed about how I won\u2019t have friends to FaceTime to tell about my engagement or people to come with me to pick out a wedding dress or bridesmaids.

            "Hey, for the record this is okay. This is normal.  i was in a similar situation to you. What I did was just not have a bridal party and opt for a sweetheart table with my husband and myself, and if people asked, I said I didn\u2019t want to put friends and siblings through the money and hassle of being in a bridal party. I still had female friends, sisters, that kind of thing that attended my wedding and I had fun with, and the fact that we weren\u2019t \u201cclose enough\u201d to do a traditional wedding thing was fine with me. If your husband has lots of male friends who would typically be groomsmen, maybe they can instead do a boys night out type thing and celebrate that way? I\u2019m my experience that kind of thing is less important to men (not to be stereotypical, just saying what I\u2019ve experienced), but of course YMMV\n\nI\u2019ll say that if you\u2019re sad about this, if you want more female friends in your life, you should absolutely take steps to change that. DND helped me make friends, so did going to dog-mom meetups. But if the only thing your sad about is missing out on the tarditional wedding experience, there are lots of alternatives to that that will make your day special and shine a light on you and your partner. \n\n<3 here if you want to talk about it more",
            "This is why I don\u2019t want us to have bridesmaids and groomsmen. If it makes you feel better, 3 out of the 4 weddings I\u2019ve been to this year, only 1 had the traditional amount of bridesmaids and groomsmen, and one had only one maid of honor and 2 best mans, and they were the bride and grooms sister and brother. So I think it\u2019s pretty normal nowadays.",
            "I totally understand that. I have very few female friends, although I\u2019m lucky to have a few female cousins. Do you have close male friends or male cousins? What about aunts? There are no rules that your guy friends or cousins or aunts & uncles can\u2019t come with you to the dress fitting. It may not be traditional or what you truly, deeply want, but maybe it\u2019d still feel nice to have people celebrate finding the dress.",
            "I also don\u2019t have close female friends or any sisters/cousins so I\u2019m having my brother stand up on my side. I will have my brother come with me for dress shopping and my fianc\u00e9 and I are planning to have a joint game night with all of our friends instead of separate bachelor/bachelorette parties. It may not be traditional but you can still have plenty of great experiences. Your wedding can be any way you like as long as you and your partner are happy.",
            "I was in a similar boat to you. Don\u2019t really have friends and not close with my family. I ordered my dress off eBay and my partner had to actually put me in it so he saw it first. 3 of my colleagues surprised me with an afternoon tea as I was moving to my husband\u2019s country and we got married there so I had that in lieu of a hen party. For my wedding, I had my husband, his parents, his sister, her husband and their two kids. My witness was a mutual friend who is a guy and a photographer so he did the pictures too. I\u2019d wanted to elope but felt bad not to have my husband\u2019s family as he lived away for 10 years. \n\nIn the run up, I felt a bit sad that I didn\u2019t get to do all of those stereotypical things like having a sleepover before hand with girls and getting ready with them etc but I just don\u2019t really have friends. In actuality, I\u2019d have hated dress shopping with people because I hate trying on clothes. I was a bridesmaid for my best friend and I hated walking down the aisle with everybody staring at me. \n\nIt was so nice to get ready with my future husband that morning. Everything was really calm and chilled out. We walked down the aisle together and laughed during the ceremony. We had a ceremony in the town hall, had a nice meal and cake then in the evening, we stayed at a hotel and went to a spa. It wasn\u2019t expensive but it was exactly what we wanted. \n\nThe most important thing is doing your wedding how you want it to be with the person you love without feeling like you need to tick boxes to match other people\u2019s weddings.",
            "We had our friends \"pregame\" with us but no actual bridal party. It's actually incredibly expensive to have a bridal/groomsmen party anyways. Maybe that's something you could do? If not, totally consider eloping with family present. It centers the wedding on you as a couple.",

            "1. It's fine not to have any female friends - but what does your support system look like?  You need a support system. Even if it's mom and dad and some male cousins, a brother, etc.  You need people who care about you apart from your boyfriend. They don't have to be women.\n2. If you have a good support system, and you've got someone you love enough to want to marry, then you've got a good thing going. Don't worry about it!\n3. If you don't have a support system, IDK if i'd suggest getting married. Some men seek out women with no support system so they can dominate, control and even abuse them. Especially if your fiance is significantly older than you. \n\nso, in closing: do you need female friends? no. But you do need a support system.  I don't think you should get married unless you have some sort of support system looking out for you specifically.",

My mother is like 50 I think.\n\n So essentially, I'm going to learn how to swim this summer. I want to wear a bikini or like a two piece because it'll be different for me and whatnot (never have been in a swimsuit before). It'll be cute and I'm getting older, so it won't be like bad or anything. I asked my mom if I could get one and she said no. It has to be a one piece. Now, I have nothing against one pieces, I just know that the reason she has for me being forced to wear one is fairly stupid. \n\nShe says that me learning how to swim in a bikini is inappropriate and that's something that you wear when you already have learned. She also says that I'll be around little kids (the class is like 6-17 year olds) and I'll be exposed to them. That I'm so desperate to just show myself to the world. that and creeps or whatever. But like, who cares if some creep is looking at me? chances are he'd be looking at me if I were in a one piece as well, right? Nothing bad is going to happen in a public pool during swim lessons lmao so the creep paranoia is insane. It also wouldn't be a problem if he were just looking anyway, so long as he doesn't pull anything weird so like we're good! I have to \"graduate\" to a bikini, graduation meaning that I learn how to swim so it's appropriate.\n\nMy question is, are these genuine concerns that come with wearing a bikini? Am I being too lax with everything and just not seeing her point due to me being stubborn? (would appreciate if older girls would also put in some insight since my mom is like old lol). If so, can someone explain how to prevent any issues that happen due to bikini wearing? Thank you!",

            "Hi, current swim teacher/coach here. \n\nI'd really recommend against anything like a triangle/string/tube top bikini. As some other people have said, most of those bikinis aren't made for actual swimming. It would be really awful for your top to come down while you are learning how to float or push off the wall with some force. \n\nAnother note is that often, your swim coach will need to make some type of correction. I usually do this with a tap on the body part that needs to move because your ears are usually underwater and talking is not always an option. Sometimes too if the student falls, I will need to catch them and help them back on their feet. I try my best not to hold on for very long, but for a person in a bikini if I'm holding on to your waist picking you up that could make you uncomfortable. \n\nNot all two pieces are created equal and you absolutely can wear a two-piece! Most of my older teenagers and adults do. But I would recommend something similar to a tankini or at the very least a long line bikini. \n\nAnd this is a side note from me to you. Swimming is a very important skill to have and I love that you are going to be learning it. But, please focus your energy on learning it and learning it well as opposed to looking good while learning it. There will be so many other times in your life that you can put your energy into looking cute, but I would not recommend some lessons for that time.",
            "Ok, first of all this \n\n>That I'm so desperate to just show myself to the world. that and creeps or whatever\n\nIs a disgusting thing to say to anyone, let alone your own child. \n\nBut this\n\n>She also says that I'll be around little kids (the class is like 6-17 year olds) and I'll be exposed to them.\n\nMade me wonder whether she's really poorly explaining a genuine issue, which is that most bikinis are designed more for sunbathing by the pool and casual, low energy swimming than dedicated physical activity. You should absolutely get a two piece if that's what you want, just make sure the top half is supportive and going to keep everything in place. Think sports bra vs normal bra - some swimwear will look cute but be annoying when you're actually trying to exercise.",
            "Are you learning in a swimming pool, or the ocean? My 18yr old daughter took up surfing, and she will tell anyone, depending where you are that at times a bikini isn\u2019t the best choice unless it is specifically designed as an athletic fit and style. \n\nA lot of bikini\u2019s can easily come off in physical activity. So maybe look for a sport bikini that has a bit more support, and coverage so you don\u2019t have to worry about the girls popping out.",
            "Most bikinis are not super practical to learn in if you're jumping and moving around a lot. Not because of how you would look but because a lot are designed for just kinda lounging. If you have a sportier style one that is designed to stay in place well I don't think there's anything wrong with that",
            "Honestly, the last thing you want to be focusing on in a swim lesson is trying to keep your bikini in place. Wardrobe malfunctions are pretty common. Get two suits - a one piece for swim lessons and a bikini for other occasions.",
            "I grew up in the pool and teaching other people to swim.  Your mom is phrasing things badly, but she does have a practical point underneath the judgement.  You don\u2019t want to have to manage your bathing suit while you\u2019re learning to swim, because it\u2019s a distraction for YOU, not for anyone else.  If you\u2019re thinking about a random boob popping out, you can\u2019t really focus on the lessons, so if you\u2019re going for a two piece, make sure it\u2019s sporty and not fashiony.  Think more sports bra top and less triangle bikini, and you should be absolutely secure enough to not have to think about it while you\u2019re swimming.",
            "There will be plenty of time to wear whatever you want once you've learned to swim. But until that time, just get a practical swimsuit just to be sure.\u00a0",

            "I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re located but the only thing I\u2019d caution with a bikini is the lack of sun protection if the pool is outdoors. Obviously you can still get sunburnt in a one piece but it does cover up a bit more. \n\nEither way, if it\u2019s an outdoor pool just make sure you put on sunscreen."

Practice thinking about something You are angry about but not afraid of (idiots on internet, younger sister stealing your cosmetics, sh\\*t on your boots you walked into and now have to clean up, whatever), and use it to trigger genuine anger when You need it and tell them to F\\*\\*k. Off. You are a margin of error, a waste of time, to them. They are a waste of time, a manure on boots, to you.",
            "Yes they usually just walk up to me. Once, one even followed me inside a store while I was shopping. I\u2019m going to try your advice with moving away and especially saying no loudly like you said. Thank you.",
            "Yes, they get upset when you say no! It\u2019s so weird and shocking. It\u2019s shameful."
