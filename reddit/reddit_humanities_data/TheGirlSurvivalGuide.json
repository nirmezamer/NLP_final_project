You know love isn\u2019t abuse, and you don\u2019t confuse the two. That\u2019s where most people go wrong in their understanding of love.\n\nWhat I think needs to shift is your understanding of where love needs to come from. Take a break from the dating scene and shift your time to volunteering at a day camp, senior center, or animal shelter. The time I spent volunteer tutoring ESL lifted me up. There were days I didn\u2019t want to do it, but I was always glad afterwards. That\u2019s the sort of love that lifts you up and makes your heart feel weightless.

            "Don't decenter love.  Redefine what love is important and what it means to you.  \n\nAbout 7 years ago, I had an awful blow out ending of a relationship and decided it was time to stop even caring about relationships or dating and center only really beneficial friendships.  It wasn't the easiest thing to do because society is so focused on marrying everyone off, but I put a lot of therapy and a lot of work into building myself and other types of non-romantic relationships and I have never been happier.  I'm surrounded by the best people anyone could ask for, I have the most amazing support system and funniest of all, people start coming out of the woodwork wanting to date or whatever.  \n\nI know not everyone will be into decentering romantic love but I've never been happier.  I have a very committed, non-romantic life partner.  I couldn't ask for a better friend or \"relationship\" and I never feel the urge to seek out \"romance\" anymore but I do sometimes find someone I'm interested in that sparks that little thing.  But because I'm not focused on wanting or needing to find a romantic relationship, my standards are so much higher and it's much easier to spot red flags and incompatibility because I'm not blinded by the prospect of being alone if that one thing doesn't work out.  It takes the pressure and stress off of that kind of relationship to know you don't NEED it to feel safe and happy.\n\nMy only regret is not learning to do this much earlier.
