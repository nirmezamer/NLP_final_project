            "Sorry, too late. Where was this guy last night? When youre running for president you cant have off days like that, especially not on one of the most important days of the entire campaign. 95%+ of people are not going to see this rally, but most people saw at least a little bit of his disastrous performance last night. It. Does. Not. Matter. Our democracy is at stake."

            "I agree with you that people are overreacting, but the overreaction itself is also a loss for Biden. He's getting bad publicity on top of the bad performance. I think he's going to recover (I bet my manifold account on him getting back to 30%) but I'm not sure how to respond to the establishment that's pushed Biden so hard for so long suddenly having second thoughts.",
            "Most people would rather have someone else running other than Biden. The problem is people dont agree who that should be. Theres also no particularly great answer, nor a clean way to do it.",
