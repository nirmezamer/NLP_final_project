As long as it is kept to a certain level of standard it should be fine.  \n1. absolute banger, like the comments about Steven\u2018s Israel trip.  \n2. if there is concerning or questionable stuff going on. For example Kelly going to him to rant about Steven.      \n   \n\nOther than that I\u2018d agree that it should be kept down and there certainly shouldn\u2018t be a \u201ewhat has Nathan to say to this\u201c type of mentality around. The parasocial aspect or rather weirdness of some dggers going out of their way to hang around Nathan is more questionable than sharing some of his statements here IMO.",

You can't have the cake and eat it too, either he should be isolated or embraced in the community and it feels like destiny is okay with him being a public figure going forward.\n\nAs long as people are heavily moderating his channels and chats Idk what's so terrible about this, we've all been 13 on the internet before you can't protect a kid forever."
