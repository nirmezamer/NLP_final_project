            "Does anyone know of a resource for looking at the card list booklets that come in ETBs? Just curious to see what SV promo cards technically belong to each set.",
            "Does anyone have a good site to order Japanese cards? I\u2019ve been wanting to get my hands on some but idk any places to order any.",
            "So I just saw the kingdra and Greninja promo cards coming with shrouded fable. These look amazing so I definitely want them eventually. Are cards like this usually better to pre order with kit or wait on singles prices.",
            "Is there any online resource where I can put in my deck list and have it say which is the best booster to open?\n\nI am too lazy to go thru 60 cards and note down each card's reprints and then figuring it out, there should be some easier way online.",
            "How am I supposed to ask for pricing if i cannot post the photos??",
            "Any good spot for modern Japanese singles? Tcgplayer seems to be hit and miss with them. I'm filling out my trainer gallery sets and I'm left with some blanks at the end and I'd like to get the gold rares in Japanese.",
            "Is Meowscarada ex still a viable deck?",
            "On TCGplayer, there are twilight masquerades booster boxes listed for fifty dollars from trusted sellers, why? Is there something I'm missing or why are these boxes practically half off? The one that I open to is the expected hundred dollar pricing, but the other listings are all under 60. I'm skeptical",
            "Are there any sellers selling a bunch of old reverse holos from the X and Y / Sun and Moon era? I only see individual reverse holos listed on FB marketplace and eBay. I want to buy a bunch of them all at once."

            "Was going to make this a full post but didn't wanna break any self-promo rules so I'll drop it here. I'm in the process of redesigning the original Pokemon TCG, specifically the sets from the GBC game, as if they continued on with the same trainers but rotated the Pokemon by generation. Since gen 3 is my specialty I decided on that, here's an example of the designs for the starter trio (excuse the look, still workshopping that) [https://imgur.com/a/KlMTV64](https://imgur.com/a/KlMTV64) the dream would be a working ROM hack of the GBC game but I'm beyond inexperienced in that front so it's looking more like a Tabletop Simulator mod or something right now. I've always been a big fan of the rapid-paced style of the GBC meta so being able to explore more ideas and imagine how a new set of Pokemon would fit in it has been a ton of fun, and I'm hoping it's something others may have some interest in.",
