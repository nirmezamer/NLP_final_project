            "Hey! I'm new to card collecting and was just wondering what the best and ideal way to protect cards is. I don't really know what I'm doing so I just throw every new card to my collection into a penny and dragonsleeve. Should I get plastic toploaders for valuable cards? Is a binder a good idea?\n\nI care about protecting cards for display and collecting, I don't care about their future value. I just want them to be nice and pristine so they look good.",
            "Hello, I'm looking to buy a PSA10 Umbreon Vmax alt art from Ebay and was wondering, if anyone has experiece purchasing more expensive stuff there? Am I covered by money back guarantee in case i recieve a fake one? Somewhere I've read they authenticate the card before shipping, but can't find any more info on that. The seller has a 100% positive feedback, with 700 items sold. But I'm a bit sceptical cause the cert. number on the slab has been blacked out. This is the listing im reffering to. Any info is highly appreciated.",
            "General Question/ how do people deal with scammers? Do you call them out on being one, or ghost them? \nI put up an ISO post on FB, and a guy messaged me saying he had the card I was looking for. He sent a picture from an eBay listing\u2026 I asked for a timestamp and a couple hours later, he sent what looks like a slightly zoomed in photo of the same thing, with a photoshopped piece of paper with name/date. It literally has the same dust spots/background as the OG photo just slightly zoomed it and then slightly out of focus. He\u2019s also asking Half the price of the eBay listing (big red flag).",
            "How \"valid\" or \"reputable\" is the grading service via Carmarket?\n\nI know PSA and the likes seems to be on top just due to being on the market for a log time and made themselves a name, but for me, living in the middle of Europe, a \"local\" grading service would be much better imo.",
            "Hi, is there any \u201cmust have\u201d apps on the phone for collectors? For values, or to keep track of sets? I\u2019m just getting back in and feel a little overwhelmed but jumping between tcgplayer and hand written lists haha",
            "Just found a bunch of my old cards from middle school, I'm 37 now and have no idea if they're worth anything.  I have a chansey, nidoking, clefairy, ninetails, machamp, poliwrath, hitmonchan, mewtwo, and gyrados.  Any advise on if they're worth getting graded or amhow about doing it?",
            "Newbie here. Any apps or website where I can track both ENG and JPN pokemon cards in my collections?\n\nThank you!",
            "What is a reasonable % for resellers to buy at? Pulled a SIR Perrin and never really sold cards before but idc about trainer cards. I have no idea how close to market I should be looking for.",
            "I\u2019m looking into maybe selling some of my cards, is there a reliable site/source for me to check pricing?",
            "I just got a Twilight Masquerade box, and the signature Ogerpon card in it (the one that comes in its own packaging) was warped... what're the chances I can get it replaced, and how?"

            "Its unfortunate. People are coordinating buyouts for cards to stoke FOMO and cause the prices to skyrocket as a result and its working. Its so obvious too because every price chart has a large spike around the same date",
            "Keep in mind that Japanese equivalents are easier to pull since each booster box comes with 3 ARs.",
            "Let\u2019s use an example of an older card. Psa 10 gold star gyrados in Japanese goes for 2200$-2800$. The same card in English sells for 13,000$-17,000$. English is just more desireable. If you\u2019re buying for art get Japanese, just don\u2019t expect the same value later(excluding Japanese specific promos)",
            "It\u2019s because Japanese art rares are seeded lol. It is much easier to pull art rares in Japanese than in English cause you\u2019re guaranteed several per box. Japanese art rares won\u2019t hold the same value as the English counterparts because of this. English is the way to go if you want art rares that will have a higher value ceiling. Japanese is the way if you just want the art for your collection without paying the premium.",

            "Prices have actually been coming down/correcting",
            "Yeah if I'm buying a full art, I'm buying it for the art. On japanese cards, the text is less blocky and covers significantly less of the art, as well as being cheaper and being of higher quality. I give 0 shits about my modern collection being worth money down the road, cause I only get 1 of each of the cards I like, and I'm never selling \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n\nI'm totally fine with the market the way it is, I snagged this card and the groudon for like $2 each a month ago and have enjoyed looking at them in my binder while I spend my big money on vintage :)"
