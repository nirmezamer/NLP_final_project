        "content": "We want your opinion about making SRD better! First, a bit of housekeeping\n\n# Rules Changes\n\nSRD began 12 years ago, and it's been through many changes. But at the heart of it all, we've been the place for posting, discussing, and laughing at drama on reddit. Sometimes the drama is major (such as the API protests) or silly/strange [(like baptizing the dead)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/17975oc/op_in_rgenealogy_laments_his_evil_sister_deleted/). \n\nWe introduce and retire rules in an attempt to maintain a certain level of quality. The \"surplus popcorn\" rule has been one of them. However, it can be confusing for users to understand and hard for mods to enforce.\n\n**As of today, the \"surplus popcorn\" rule is no more.** Drama will no longer be judged based on its subject matter being overdone. The rules about biased posts, and especially about \"callout posts\" will still apply. So long as you're actually linking arguing/conflict, and not merely pointing out shitty bigoted comments, your post will stay.\n\n**We are also relaxing rules for commenting**. \"Off topic grandstanding\" is no longer a rule. (Most of the reports we get for this are people using it as a super downvote, or trying to get mods to babysit their argument with another user). The \"insults/flamewars/flamebait\" rule is changing, from being removed on sight to being removed on mod discretion. (For similar reasons as before: users will get into petty arguments with each other and then begin reporting to get their opponents comments removed. Mods are no longer obligated to remove those comments or to try to maintain a certain level of civility). \n\nWe might bring back these rules in the future if there is a need. \n\n# State of the Subreddit\n\nHow do you feel about the state of the subreddit right now? What can mods and the community do to make this an active, thriving place with good quality popcorn?\n\nSome obvious suggestions are making the rules easier to understand (done!) and adding a ton of new moderators (coming soon!), but we want your thoughts and suggestions. Even if you'd like to rant about where this place as gone terribly wrong, it's still valuable feedback.",

            "I dont know about a 'rule', but some of the best posts provide background on niche topic/subreddits. \n\nWhats the general purpose of the sub? What type of people frequent the sub? Is there unique/particular history that applies? What led to the current drama? Etc.. \n\nI tend to ignore the posts that are like, 'Some drama related to *insert one of the million rando content creators/influencers/etc.*', for example. I have no idea who those people are, or why other people engage in discussion about them, let alone understand how they got to where they are at with the drama in question.\n\nJust think more could be done to establish context. I prefer posts that tell a story rather than just a dumping ground for random potential drama.",

So many of the issues men have are directly traced back to the patriarchy. Why are men so isolated? Because they don\u2019t talk to other men like women talk to women. Why is that? Because the patriarchy taught society that men don\u2019t have feelings and women have all the emotions, and that having emotions is weak. Just for one example. Women don\u2019t want to solve men\u2019s problems because we are too worn out from having to solve our own for centuries. This comment section misses the point.

My family having quite a lot of those, sadly. It does wonders for your self esteem.

Multiple planned storylines have been put into the blender after being told it was either become shit, or be shitcanned (which is how we got the infamous storyline where gwen stacy secretly cheated on peter with norman osborne and had secret goblin kids) and peter parker is allowed to become a spider god or a super duper tech billionaire genius like tony stark, but he's never allowed to have a family, be happy with his wife, or settle down or do any of the fucking normal shit his oldest and most dedicated fans have been rooting for, for ages. He's always just forever trapped as a loser living in his ancient ass aunt's house.\n\nThis isn't even a marvel exclusive problem because the DC execs do the same shit. What's that, characters have grown and changed over the decades, but you grew up with barry allen and hal jordan and now you have power and control over the company? Time to throw everything in the trash so your heroes can become the only things that matter again, and for extra fun: let's go out of our way to really stick it to wally west fans when they're not happy with this one.",
