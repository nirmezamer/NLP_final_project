        "content": "We want your opinion about making SRD better! First, a bit of housekeeping\n\n# Rules Changes\n\nSRD began 12 years ago, and it's been through many changes. But at the heart of it all, we've been the place for posting, discussing, and laughing at drama on reddit. Sometimes the drama is major (such as the API protests) or silly/strange [(like baptizing the dead)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/17975oc/op_in_rgenealogy_laments_his_evil_sister_deleted/). \n\nWe introduce and retire rules in an attempt to maintain a certain level of quality. The \"surplus popcorn\" rule has been one of them. However, it can be confusing for users to understand and hard for mods to enforce.\n\n**As of today, the \"surplus popcorn\" rule is no more.** Drama will no longer be judged based on its subject matter being overdone. The rules about biased posts, and especially about \"callout posts\" will still apply. So long as you're actually linking arguing/conflict, and not merely pointing out shitty bigoted comments, your post will stay.\n\n**We are also relaxing rules for commenting**. \"Off topic grandstanding\" is no longer a rule. (Most of the reports we get for this are people using it as a super downvote, or trying to get mods to babysit their argument with another user). The \"insults/flamewars/flamebait\" rule is changing, from being removed on sight to being removed on mod discretion. (For similar reasons as before: users will get into petty arguments with each other and then begin reporting to get their opponents comments removed. Mods are no longer obligated to remove those comments or to try to maintain a certain level of civility). \n\nWe might bring back these rules in the future if there is a need. \n\n# State of the Subreddit\n\nHow do you feel about the state of the subreddit right now? What can mods and the community do to make this an active, thriving place with good quality popcorn?\n\nSome obvious suggestions are making the rules easier to understand (done!) and adding a ton of new moderators (coming soon!), but we want your thoughts and suggestions. Even if you'd like to rant about where this place as gone terribly wrong, it's still valuable feedback.",

            "Something Ive noticed a LOT recently is people just putting a title and a link. I understand some minor dramas may be too short to put links to best quotes, but isnt it too low effort if people dont even give a summary of what the drama is about? A title like (just making it up here) Turtle owners fight over best hibernation practices that is just followed with a link is not very informative or interesting",

And then let\u2019s see how many \u201cmen\u2019s issues\u201d are actually left once women are truly on equal footing for the first time in human history. So many of the issues men have are directly traced back to the patriarchy. Why are men so isolated? Because they don\u2019t talk to other men like women talk to women. Why is that? Because the patriarchy taught society that men don\u2019t have feelings and women have all the emotions, and that having emotions is weak. Just for one example. Women don\u2019t want to solve men\u2019s problems because we are too worn out from having to solve our own for centuries. This comment section misses the point. I think your comic could have nailed it home \u201cbetter\u201d if I\u2019m being fair and objective but just because your comic wasn\u2019t perfect doesn\u2019t take away from any of this being factual.

            "Both of Kentuckys major city subreddits are truly terrible. Lexington had always had this anti-progressive streak to it. Louisvilles isnt as bad, except for all the folks practically frothing at the mouth to bomb the West End or some shit.",
            "Kink has been a part of pride and the LGBTQIA+ community since forever. If you aren't interested in that stuff, there usually are plenty of events that aren't sexual in nature at all. Even ones specifically catered towards minors. Why are people still arguing about kink and pride? Don't we have anything new to discourse about?",
            "Lexington is weird. On one end, there are a lot of queer folks here. There are lot of awesome open and inclusive spots and circles. Weve had an openly gay mayor. I think in the past, Lexington had one of the highest percentage of queer citizens per city in America. At the same time, there is a ton of deep rooted homophobia and really nasty bigoted people. Read the FB comment section of a local news station and it will look like a Klan rally.",
            "No matter what we do, the bigots will call us deviant sex perverts. Why is a single 18+ kink dedicated room an issue? \n\nAlso love the assholes trying to deny any link between kink and lgbtq+ issues, as though for years laws against \"obscenity\" didn't primarily targer queer people in the first place. kink spaces are where many queer and trans people could meet up freely with no fear of judgement. Denying these historical links is denying who we are.",
            "That comment chain has big \"I'm gay but you would never know because I don't make it my whole identity\" energy.",
            "Go to any gay bar or club, and they'll have kink nights, leather nights, pup nights, underwear nights, the list goes on. Every major city has some sort of leather organization that operates outside of some of the oldest gay bars in the area, because leather has been a (mostly) gay thing since the end of WW2. Gay bars are often where you can find dungeons outside of official clubs, which even then lean very not-heterosexual.\n\nKink and queerness, and therefor pride, overlap a ton. Now if you are uncomfortable with kink or just raunchiness in general, that's fine, that's cool, a good pride should have space for that. Plenty of homosexuals who are proud professionals and parents who want to present as such is a good thing, but when I go into a gay bar and I don't see any assless chaps or harnesses, the drinks are probably going to be overpriced with monitors showing reruns of RuPaul's Drag Race.",
