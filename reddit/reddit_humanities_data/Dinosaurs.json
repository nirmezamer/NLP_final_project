        "content": "Hi all, \n\nI know there's a lot of dinosaur related games (and more coming out this year!). \n\nI want to keep it mostly separate from the regular /r/dinosaurs content to avoid a situation where we have too many people posting about their game servers. Yes, it is dino-related, but... We run the risk of being *overrun!* \n\nInstead I propose that we have this thread, where people are free to make a top level comment with links to their (dinosaur game only!) server, discord, subreddit etc. \n\nI encourage the following info to be included in such posts: \n\n>Name of Game (platform)\n\n>Name of Server\n\n>\\# of players \n\n>The Vibes: who is playing, who we're looking to add, and level of seriousness (playing \"realistic\", free for all, fun & games, etc) \n\n>Times people generally play (if any) (UTC preferred: https://dateful.com/convert/utc ) If you have a regular time to gather, it helps grow a consistent group! ie Saturday 08:00 for PST (me) = Saturday 16:00 UTC. \n\n>Links \n\nAs ever, please keep it family friendly, and in the spirit of engaging with and enjoying all things related to dinosaurs. \n\nCheers!",

            "Path of Titans has great potential but the devs focus only on new skins and other non-sense, instead of improving quests and actual gameplay. They haven't addressed toxic mix packing. The last time I played, I was literally added by a fellow herbivore and then they were communicating my location and following me and brought a bunch of friends to kill me. They did the same to another player who was nearby.\n\nI have quit the game since then until they actual make a meaningful improvement. I am honest tired of seeing skins of the week. They they either hired too many designers or they have no clue wtf they are doing.",

            "Hello fellow dinosaur lovers! I play a dinosaur survival mmo game called Path of Titans! Its a fantastic game and has constant updates and cool mods. I am currently building a Realism server for it. A realism server of course entails strict behaviors one must follow to immerse players into what it would actually be like to be that dinosaur. \n\nWe are currently writing profiles for each dinosaur which dictates how they need to act and limitations. However, my co owners and I are struggling to do this on our own. We are looking for folks well versed in paleontology facts to help out! If you would be interested to help bring these ancient creatures to life please message me!!! We really need some help! We want this to be as perfect as humanly possible!",
            "Hey everyone! I'm the community manager for an upcoming dinosaur + evolution inspired game called Adapt, which is coming to PC and currently has a free demo available on Steam. It's heavily Spore-inspired (we're calling it a Sporelike game), and I thought it might be of interest to those of you who are interested in dinosaurs - we're constantly looking for feedback! \n\nYou can find us over at r/AdaptTheGame, where you can also find links to our Discord and Steam!",

            "Fairly well done! I like the lighting and background, and the animation on its head for the roar looks very nice! Id say however that your weak point would be the stiffness of its movement, mostly in the legs. I think looking at animals like cassowary and ostriches would be a good place to study from! I hope to see more of your work in the future!",

I might try and see if I can do the same as you. But Im guessing itll be harder for me, as  Im focusing on human characters as opposed to animal ones.",
