Look out for the people with the orange Snoo sign :)\n\n**Date:** Saturday 20th July 2024\n\n**Time:** 2:00pm onwards\n\n**Venue:** Good George North Wharf\n\n**Address:** 1 Jellicoe Street, Wynyard Quarter, Auckland Central 1010.\n\n# FAQ:\n\n**I don't want to show up alone and interact  with a big group of strangers!**\n\nThat's not a question, but if anyone's feeling a little shy about meeting Redditors IRL, I'll be happy to meet up beforehand in 1 on 1 or in small groups. PM me and we'll arrange something :)\n\n**How do I get there?**\n\nThere are public transport options; please note that the Wynyard crossing bridge is currently closed and it is a 15min walk from the nearest train station (Britomart). There is parking at Jellicoe St, or Wilson parking on Gaunt St.\n\n**Never been to one of these events before. What are meetups like?**\n\nIt's pretty chill. We are a bunch of people who decided they had nothing to lose by showing up to an event advertised on Reddit and ended up making real friends.\n\n**What if everyone already knows each other? It would be so awkward for me!**\n\nCome grab a nametag, have a drink, and see how it goes. At worst you've had a nice afternoon out, at best you'll have a good chat and some friends.\n\n**I can't make this event. Are there any more meetups?**\n\nWe try to do pub crawls or meetups like this regularly, stay tuned!\n\n**How do I know you aren't a bunch of axe murderers?**\n\nThat's the neat part, you don't. In all seriousness though, we understand there is a sketchiness in meeting strangers from the Internet in real life; that's why we hold this event in a public space. We also want people to feel comfortable so any person behaving badly will be asked to leave.\n\n**What's the typical age range of people at these things?** \n\nGenerally mid 20s to 30s, though we have had a few below and above that. We welcome all genders and sexual orientations.\n\n",

            "I'm keen! I'll leave the AI, axe-murdering chatbot at home though",
            "Keen. Just keep us posted.  \ud83d\ude0a",
            "I'm keen too! I'm new in town so everyone is a stranger to me lol\n\nKeep us posted. \u270c\ud83c\udffb",
            "Does that mean you aren't planning on going along for this one?",
            "That was a one off for me. Not the kind of environment for me.   NOt saying it\u2019s good or bad just not for me.",
            "I get what you're saying, but these meetups generally have more people who are strangers than those who know each other. The last one I went to, it was about 20% people who knew each other and the other 80% was all newbies. All I'm saying is you have to put in the effort to make friends, it's unlikely to happen after one meetup.\n\nI do agree that it does attract people who want to make friends and are generally lonely - nobody goes to the random internet people as their first resort, and it does therefore bring in many people who are expecting a lot and then getting disappointed, but if you keep going to things, you aren't a weirdo (or you are a weirdo, just the right kind) and interact well with others, you can make friends this way.",
            "I went to one of these in the past and here\u2019s my experience. Everyone present was very nice however I felt it was very forced. Realistically I think it\u2019s what happens when you have a bunch of people from completely different backgrounds ( yea there are a lot of IT people) with different interests and different hobbies. \n\nI talked to almost everyone present and it was surprising that everyone I talked to was a working professional. Surprising because this among other characteristics was certainly not representative of a random reddit sample.\n\nIf you are planning to go for a drink anyway and want some random company then sure why not. \n\nNow I mean this in the nicest way, if you are trying to make new friends etc I don\u2019t feel this is the best \u201cmeetup\u201d type of environment for it.",
            "I think it's worth noting that one person's experience isn't going to be the same as everyone's experience.\n\nI organized a lot of these meetups in 2019-2022, and yes, there are a lot of IT people (virtue of being on Reddit I guess), however there were plenty of people from all sectors - students, arborists, civil and construction workers, people who worked retail and many more.\n\nLots of people that came to these meetups became friends, but you've got to come to more than one meetup, or participate in the group chat. If you show up once, decide that everyone was just random company and then never speak to anyone or attend anything ever again - then yeah, it's likely that you won't make friends.\n\nMaking friends, especially if you're not in high school/uni and don't want to make friends at work is hard, and I think a lot of posts like yours (and I'm not saying that you've done anything wrong - it's just how it is) come from the fact that people come to one meetup and then decide they didn't have an instant connection and never participate again.",
            "Everyone's experience is certainly going to be different. With these reddit meetups it seems to be a group of friends meeting up and decided to open it up to the public. Now don't get me wrong. It's very nice of these people to do that but what you get is a group of people that knows each other very well then a bunch of random stragglers.\n\nIf you have been organizing these previously then I trust you would already know a fair amount of people prior to the meet which at baseline would give you a very different experience to a random straggler.\n\nThis, unlike say an airsoft club or a gliding club where all participants share similar interests is indeed a difficult place to make friends.\n\nWith reddit meet ups the goal should be just to go for a drink and socialise abit. If the goal is to go and make friends then you will most likely be very disappointed. If nothing else I'd be weary of giving out my personal details to randoms that I just meet for an hour.\n\nI think part of the issue is given the platform and way it's done (not saying I can do better). It is very much targeted/attracts people that are lonely and want to make friends. If majority of the random stragglers go in with this expectation then they won't have as good a time as say a \"work\" party where you are just there to get drunk and have a good time. And are more likely to be left feeling disappointed after the fact.\n\nThis isn't to encourage or discourage people from participating. But I do see where the other commenter is coming from.",

Fortunately as the video showed when the camera panned back, you can see that not everyone is like that as the next couple cars were coming out fairly quietly and politely. \n\nthe dumbass in the Accord was definitely being a moron however, as was the BMW driver.
