            "If there isn't, there should be. That's metal as hell, especially if said Daemon Prince assaulted Zharr Naggrund or some other settlement as a mortal, earned his apotheosis for it but the Chaos Dwarfs still managed to settle the debt.",

            "Chaos dwarf daemonbinding has been mostly vague; in the 40k setting, all sorts of specific daemons are bound into specific machines. For example, the Brass Scorpion is specifically full of at least one Bloodthirster if I recall correctly\n\n\"More daemon engines\" is the #1 thing I'd want for Chaos Dwarfs personally, and I'd def encourage people to consider who is shoved into their machines",

            "Wasn't the hellcannon the last chorf unit around like a decade ago? How did that work?",
            "Daemonprinces are SPECIFICALLY mortals who have managed to ascend to daemonhood.  However they often share some other aspects like being more strongly bound to the material plane that allows them to remain manifested in reality far easier than any regular or even greater daemon.  That being said, if you managed to find out the true name of a daemonprince, you could *probably* bind it into the frame of the hellcannon.  What is alot more likely is having a greater daemon bound into the hellcannon, instead of a regular daemon, and that being what makes it extra juiced.  In 40k, daemon primarch angron beat a quite high up Slaaneshi greater daemon to death with a large iron ingot in one of khornes gladiatorial pits in the warp, and doing so forged the daemon and ingot togeather into the daemon blade Samniarius.  I cant imagine why you couldnt do the same with a cannon.",
