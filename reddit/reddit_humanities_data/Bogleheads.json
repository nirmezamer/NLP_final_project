        "content": "We get a lot of questions about single-fund solutions, so here's my simplified take (YMMV). *So, should you invest in ...*\n\n----------------\n\n> Q: An S&P 500 or Nasdaq 100 index fund?\n\nA: No, those are not sufficiently diversified, as they only hold US large cap stocks.\n\n> Q: A total US stock index fund?\n\nA: No, that's not sufficiently diversified, as it only holds US stocks.\n\n> Q: A total world stock index fund?\n\nA: Maybe, if you're just starting out; just be sure to have a plan to add bonds later.\n\n> Q: A total world stock index fund along with a US or global bond fund?\n\nA: Yes, that's a great option; start with a stock/bond ratio fitting your need/ability to take risk.\n\n> Q: A 'target date' retirement fund?\n\nA: Yes, in tax-advantaged accounts, that's often the simplest, one-stop, highly diversified, set-and-forget solution.\n\n-----------------------\n\n**Thank you for coming to my TED Talk**",

            "Your answers are really only appropriate to the question of whether a person should buy **only** the ETF in each subquestion. That's very different from the quetion in the post title.\n\nMy view is that one ETF is not generally enough to make a portfolio, nor is it recommended when it is so easy to buy multiple ETFs, so I'd say the question that is being answered is not that helpful.",
            "Apologies but for a rank beginner who is looking for a view on retirements funds in 30+ years away, based in the UK, what's the 'ultimate set and forget' option to invest here\n\nAny of these? VTI,VWRD,VUSA, VWRL, VWCE?",
            "Someone in another sub has been arguing with me about VOO vs VTI. He\u2019s saying that because VTI is \u201coverweight\u201d large cap tech, the benefits I\u2019m saying it has(regarding small and mid caps having greater returns over time) don\u2019t matter, as if there is a \u201creversion to the mean\u201d with mega-cap tech stocks, VTI would also be hurt. \n\nAnd the recent history of about a ~1% greater return of VOO makes it more ideal.  Thoughts?"

            "Didn't expect a crypto themed episode on the Boglehead podcast. Think i'll skip this episode. \n\n  \nFeel safe in saying the sentiment here around crypto will likely be a bit negative (and the publicly traded companies that deal in crypto are all already included in, at market weight, in things like VT/VTSAX)",
            "The wonderful thing about investing in real companies that make products and services is you don't have to rely on finding a greater fool to buy the security off you at ever increasing prices.\n\nThe difference between public equity markets and crypto is that the former is a positive sum game and the latter is a negative sum game after you consider exchanges and miners.\n\nI'm sure the crypto people will get around to addressing the whole 'expected returns' thing any day now, just after they solve the single digit transactions-per-second limit and lack of reversibility."

My \"fun money\" is buying the things that I enjoy and I feel confident I will actually use, and there is  certain amount of \"fun money\" for me knowing I spent it on some precious metals almost certainly just to pass on to kids. I like knowing it exists. Say my minivan, at some point I will trade it in for a new one, but it is a 2016, maintained well, and I still enjoy driving it. I could afford to trade it in but I just don't want to yet. Maybe in a couple of years.",
