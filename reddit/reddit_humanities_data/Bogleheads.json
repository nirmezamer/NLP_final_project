They're both very heavy on the same AAPL, TSLA, GOOG etc. Yes, IWDA has thousands of companies but most of them weigh insignificantly in the portfolio.\n\nSo in this case I ask if this diversification is just on paper but not really practical?\n\nFor example, if there's a US tech stock crash aren't you still toast with IWDA? Maybe not toast to the same figure but toast to the same degree?\n\nLater Edit: Is there any form of rebalancing that is done in time? For example if the US stock underperform then an international index fund can redistribute accordingly while a S&P500 is always limited in scope to S&P500. This would make sense to go for diversification. \n\nAny light shed on this is greatly appreciated.",

            "I personally like VOO.  If the money you are investing doesn't need to be touched for anything (emergency, down payment, ...) then I like the strategy.  Bogleheads tend to diversify across 3 major groups.  \n\n1.  Total Market \n2.  International \n3.  Bonds\n\nThey will invest in these according to their risk tolerance.  Explanations and example portfolios are listed in the links at the top of the group for convenience and research.  Recommend going through that to get an idea of where most in this group come from.  \n\nI think looking at the S&P Chart over the long term, your strategy makes sense if you are young and have a lot of time to compound your initial investments in it.  The long term chart demonstrates this very well.  Which is why I like your thought process. \n\nAs you begin to get into your mid career and later, the total Market, international can add a lot of diversity into your portfolio.  Or of course you could start now.  Really no bad choice there.  Rebalancing is a key component to any diverse plan as it allows for taking advantage of market differentials in the different asset classes.  Like taking profits out of your winners and putting them in your less performing assets and getting in on lower prices.  \n\nI've read that by doing this you inherently get roughly a 2-4% boost each year just by rebalancing.  I haven't done a deep dive research on the claim but I can see that it could be a valid observation given the nature of non-correlated asset classes.  \n\nLots of stuff in here, but bottom line is, you are on the right track.  Keep up the hard work and remember the power of compounding works in your favor the sooner you start.  You are well ahead of your peers.  This much, I can assure you.  Your future self will thank you for the efforts and sacrifices you are making now."

Don't worry, this is not all of my retirement fund.  I have substantially more in a rollover account from my previous employers, which is where I will roll this fund and combine it all.\n\nI just saw this as a real world, practical example, of how it works.  I note that this time point (a bit over 6 years) is about the point where the exponential growth curve would really start taking off.",

            "I\u2019m worried about the negativity towards bonds.",
            "It's worth looking at bonds as an asset class you can rebalance with. When the market is down, the bonds are a source of capital you can use to buy more stocks, and when the market is high you can use that growth to buy more bonds. Rebalancing both reduces your risk and can even lead to a higher long term return depending on the (unknowable) behavior of your preferred asset class. You can also use other non-correlated asset classes like international stocks or a mix of these 3 or more.\n\nYou also run a real risk that the market will be down as you retire, and if it happens to be down significantly, you pay a very large premium as you begin withdrawals. This sequence of returns risk can dramatically reduce your total available assets in retirement, even if you've seen large gains leading up to retirement.",
            "Generally the recommendation is a smooth transition to a higher bond allocation rather than an abrupt cliff at R-5.  Doing it this way means a crash right before R-5 ends up being way worse than a crash just a year later, whereas with a glide path the conservatism scales directly with the impact it will have on your retirement.  \n\nBest case scenario given a crash right before you add bonds is that your R-5 just turns into R-8 or something; you need a couple of extra years of working to get back to your goal retirement number.  A less best case scenario is that the crash is a big one, there's a huge recession, and you lose your job.  Then not only are you losing income and potentially having to work even more years to make that up, but searching for work as a 60+ year old is often an awful experience because even if age discrimination is illegal it's basically impossible to prove and companies generally don't want to hire someone who's going to work a few years.  With a properly conservative asset allocation you can sort of make that work as basically a forced early retirement, but if you lost too much portfolio value it'll be a problem.  \n\nNow I don't think you have to start your glide path 25-30 years before retirement like a lot of TDFs do.  I personally plan to stay aggressive until R-10, transition to my maximum bond allocation by R-5, and then hold there until about R+10 before going back up again.  Though it's only a vague plan since I still have many years before I'll have to make these decisions.",

            "It\u2019s reasonable, it\u2019s called a \u201cbond tent\u201d. I plan to be 100% equities until 5 years out and then build my tent to lessen sequence of returns risk. ERN has a good article on this.",
            "If you do that (which I recommend) you don't have to worry about getting conservative at the end, because you'll have margin for error.\n\nI'm 12 years INTO retirement and, like the last 34 years investing, see absolutely no reason to own bonds or bond funds.\n\nThe numbers show time and again a 100% equity portfolio in the accumulation phase of investing is a far better choice than owning bonds.",
            "Two things:\n\n1. That\u2019s fine if you\u2019re ok delaying retirement if there\u2019s a major correction right before you decide to include bonds.\n\n2. Don\u2019t keep playing once you\u2019ve won the game. Don\u2019t be more risky than you need to be. If your savings gets to the point where you have enough to retire, then that\u2019s a good time to reduce risk and just retire.",
            "Perfectly fine idea.",
            "No it\u2019s not terrible just make sure you model your risk and you might change your mind when you actually hit a certain net worth.
