        "content": "Since reddit has decided to silently sell all the content on their sub to be used for training AI, it's no longer fair for artists to have their art posted here by other people.\n\nSo there is a new rule in place:\n\n# You may only post art you created 100% by yourself, or have the right/permission to post\n\nViolating posts will be removed and violators will be temporarily banned.\n\n**This includes the following previously allowed posts:**\n\n* posting other people's art with credit\n* reposts from the subreddit\n* traces, downscales, pixel-overs and other derivative art\n\n**And the still not allowed posts:**\n\n* pixel art recreations (copying pixel art into another medium like beads/crossstitch, minecraft)\n* ai generated art\n\n**The following is still allowed:**\n\n* fan art (provided it's not a trace)\n* game screenshots / videos, provided you own the art, or have permission to post it\n\nPlease report any violating posts so we may remove them. Thank you.",

            "I\u2019m a game developer, whose game includes pixel art. As part of my project, I\u2019ve worked with pixel artists as contractors, who have created pixel art for me, and been paid to do so. As part of our agreements, I now hold the copyright to the created pixel art, so that I can use it easily in my game and elsewhere.\n\nDoes the new rule prohibit me from posting my game\u2019s artwork if I choose to?",
            "I think this is a solid change. \n\nTangentially related, it might not be a bad idea to add a link to an article to the automod message that explains the reddit/google deal, for those who aren't aware/to help prevent misunderstandings like the other day where the person seemed under the impression the sub itself was selling it.",
            "Good. All art subs should have this rule.",
            "I'm pretty new to this can anyone explain what trace overs etc are? I use photos for reference",
            "If Reddit is selling our art is there a way to opt out of it? Or is it just the effects of posting on Reddit now.",
