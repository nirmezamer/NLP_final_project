            "This is not because of patriarchy, it's because of classism. \n\nBack in the 50s, my grandfather used to wear dhothi and go to work as a teacher, but it was seen as a \"poor people\" outfit. Doctors and lawyers and engineers used to wear Western formals with tie and shoes, which was considered as a \"rich people\" outfit. \n\nThe next generation who went to work in 70s- 80s didn't want to be considered as poor, and irrespective of their income they wore pant shirt to office. \n\nHowever, saree for women was never considered as something worn by poor people, and irrespective of class you could wear it in public. As a result, even in weddings and Indian festivals, ladies continue to wear beautiful traditional wear and men are wearing pant shirt.",
            " The burden of culture and tradition is always on the women, while men can choose what is convenient for them. \n\nThe simple answer is women weren't allowed to wear western clothes for a long time. They are wearing now but not as much as the men yet",
            "And all these comments about traditional attire for men being expensive is stupid because the cost for women is way higher because the sarees themselves (if you want good materials) would be expensive plus the tailoring charges are outrageous for blouses. \n\nAlso guess what, traditional attire\u2019s for women ain\u2019t comfortable either. Sarees are revealing af and I hate wearing them. So, if all these are problems for women too, then it can\u2019t be the reason for men not wearing them unless you guys have better choices due to patriarchy.",

Indian men's formal wear is the bomb - it's unique and colourful and we should take pride in wearing it. I will never wear a suit and tie again, unless at a funeral - I fucking hate penguin suits.",
            "The onus of culture n tradition falls on women due to patriarchy. Men can wear anything n no one bats an eye, but society is ready to judge if a women wears western clothes, some ppl even judge basic (non revealing) stuff like jeans n t-shirts. \n\nN to all those saying Dhoti is difficult/uncomfy - same goes for Sari. If u r gonna say that women can wear kurti, then I can say that men also haive option of Kurta.",
            "my guess would be it's restrictive to wear a dhoti or kurta everyday to work or anywhere for that matter. and the cooperate world already had the dress code as formals.\n\nwoman entered the workforce much later and were allowed to kept their dress choice as long as a dress code is not assigned like certain factories woman need to wear it's uniforms / safety equipment.",

I think I lucked out because he's never been a red flag, not in the first 6 months of our marriage not now 6 years later. The only complaint I've maintained through these years is that he's extremelyyyyy lazy and so moody. But we make up for each other's drawbacks.

Our real growth is being masked by outliers due to the immense population of the country. Our per capita and Human development index is laughable.
