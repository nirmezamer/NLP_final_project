            "I can only speak for myself. I wear ethnic on weddings and religious occassions other than that I don't wear them cause they are not very comfortable. I can't work in an office in a kurta, I will be annoyed as hell.",
            "I will happily wear a loose kurta payjama or dhotar to office. Will be so much comfortable. But corporate india is stuck with \u201cBritish dress code\u201d",
            "And all these comments about traditional attire for men being expensive is stupid because the cost for women is way higher because the sarees themselves (if you want good materials) would be expensive plus the tailoring charges are outrageous for blouses. \n\nAlso guess what, traditional attire\u2019s for women ain\u2019t comfortable either. Sarees are revealing af and I hate wearing them. So, if all these are problems for women too, then it can\u2019t be the reason for men not wearing them unless you guys have better choices due to patriarchy.",
            " The burden of culture and tradition is always on the women, while men can choose what is convenient for them. \n\nThe simple answer is women weren't allowed to wear western clothes for a long time. They are wearing now but not as much as the men yet",
            "Women are expected to be traditional, homely etc but men have the freedom to wear whatever they want.\u00a0",
            "my guess would be it's restrictive to wear a dhoti or kurta everyday to work or anywhere for that matter. and the cooperate world already had the dress code as formals.\n\nwoman entered the workforce much later and were allowed to kept their dress choice as long as a dress code is not assigned like certain factories woman need to wear it's uniforms / safety equipment.",
            "I do. I have worn a Sherwani at weddings in San Francisco, a winery in France, in the UK, and at my own wedding in Pune - my French wife wore a red chanya-choli. I recycled the same sherwani across those events because it looks great  \nI have also worn a Nehru jacket/bandh gala at 3 offsites for a UK company I worked for, and I still insist on wearing Indian formal men's wear at many FAANG offsites in the US. Indian men's formal wear is the bomb - it's unique and colourful and we should take pride in wearing it. I will never wear a suit and tie again, unless at a funeral - I fucking hate penguin suits.",
            "I would gladly wear it to office, if they allow, it's about time comfortable clothing should be mainstreamed rather than Jeans and shit."

            "For Indian parents, marriage is not about you finding a partner you love and who loves you back. It\u2019s about finding a partner that aligns to their cultural and societal values. They don\u2019t care if you\u2019re happy.",
            "It mostly happens with Indian parents who had gone through an arranged marriage, how can they understand falling in love.These arranged marriage couples since childhood are taught not to talk to strangers. When they turn adults, they are forced to marry a stranger! Very few arranged marriages fall in love after marriage. For most it is just compromise under society pressure to drag on with the marriage even if they are not happy!\n\nSo they pass on these expectations to their children.",
            "I too don't get it. It's not the parents alone. The entire Indian society is built that way. They say, don't go after girls, don't masturbate, don't do anything sexual. But then, I turn 30 with little to no experience in girls. Now everyone around me asks to get married while I have no clue how to deal with a wife. I don't even know how to carry a girlfriend.",
            "Because they view you as an extension of themselves and not as an individual person who can make their own decisions.

For example, \"let's get ready with me\" videos often start with people in their underwear. It's not that I'm old-fashioned, but I don't like this trend.\n\nPlus, the toxic behavior on Instagram is terrible. People harass and make nasty comments. A friend of mine, who is disabled from birth, posted a photo. I wanted to comment something nice like \"pretty,\" but I saw someone had commented \"adrak lag rahi ho\" (you look like ginger). I was shocked by how cruel people can be.\n\nI don't have many friends on Instagram\u2014just 8-9 online friends and a few from university, but they rarely talk to me. So, I've decided to stop using it. I'm a bit addicted, but I'm trying to quit completely by the end of the month. Do you have similar issues with Instagram? What do you think about it?

I\u2019ve always been friendly and respectful with people, be it male or female and the same way I\u2019ve been with them so I\u2019ve not given them any hint or done anything that\u2019d hint otherwise.

I respect them and their sexuality but I\u2019m just very confused if I am infact giving out such vibes?\n\nWhen I was 14-15 years old, I had faced unwanted touching from a random stranger when I was travelling via train. I was too small to even realise what had happened until a random person saw what was happening and started advocating me about it. He said it\u2019s because I am very fair and good looking for a guy, thus such things happen. \n\nAll this is concerning to me because I don\u2019t want to lead on any one like that! \n\nAm I overthinking? Is this supposed to be taken as a compliment of some kind, that I\u2019m attracting attention from men? Because, almost any time I talk to someone about this, they brush it away as if it\u2019s nothing.
