So without further ado...\n\n**Top  posts**\n\n* **[I don't understand Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1dgiz2d/i_dont_understand_reddit/)**\n\n* **[Moderator harassed, insulted me](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1dfibnc/moderator_harassed_insulted_me/)**\n\nA user made a comment in a subreddit and then received a message that it had been removed by a moderator for being off-topic. They were genuinely confused by the removal, but moved on. Later, they felt that all of their content was being removed from all subreddits and were wondering if a moderator had the ability to do that. \n\nAnd the other user felt that a mod was harassing and insulting in their responses to them. \n\nBoth of these are definitely not ideal situations. Moderators do have the ability to remove your content within the subreddit that they moderate, but they are unable to extend that permission to subreddits that they do not moderate. \n\nIf you feel that your content is not showing up in the sub, feel free to contact the moderators of that subreddit. Their contact information can be found on the sidebar of the sub on desktop or by tapping the three dots in the upper right and tapping \"Message moderators\" on the mobile apps.\n\nIf you feel that the moderators are acting in bad faith, you have a couple of options. If you would like to file a report about a subreddit, you can use [this form](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360001103212). \n\nAnd if you would like to report a Moderator Code of Conduct violation, you can use [this form](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=179106). \n\n* **[Is it a bug or a feature? Previously, I could return to the feed from a post with just a click on the side. Now, I have to use the back button, and it takes me all the way up to the top. This issue occurs when I use the new.reddit.com page.](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1degkk3/is_it_a_bug_or_a_feature_previously_i_could/)**\n\nBoth! Returning your feed to the top so that you lose your place is not intentional. I have flagged that to the appropriate team and that is being worked on.  But I'm sorry to report that the other part is intentional. I am happy to pass along constructive feedback about that to the team, though!\n\n**TOP HELPERS FOR THE WEEK** \n\n* jgoja\n* Timozkovic\n* IMTrick\n* formerqwest \n* Markiemoomoo\n* sea_stomp_shanty\n* tumultuousness\n* Eclectic-N-Varied\n* TheOpusCroakus\n* antboiy\n\n\n\nY'all are [rock stars](https://i.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExZjQ3bXNhNXU5b2RxemE3Nnljd3YxbzY0bGQ3NTdqYnhuMjZ6cW12byZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/xT5LMwo52zAlr8TsAM/giphy.gif)!

            "Thank you for the report.\n\nThis was a fairly calm, quiet week. Lots of reports as always but no big trends that I have seen. But my time was down again this week so I may have missed something.\n\n**In very old business.**\u00a0The algorithm has continued to be problematic. Not showing some subreddits on peoples feeds at all, showing all new content on the app home feed. Reports still are coming in. We also still have reports of not posting in profile or sub. Yesterdays\u00a0[post](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1dk0ak8/comment/l9f43vn/?context=3)\u00a0was android app.\n\n**New UI.**\u00a0 Same issues and under performing as always\n\n**Issues.**\u00a0Some Reddit's Filter reports again here. They did seem to be down this week so I am hoping they took our feedback into consideration\n\n**Issue.**\u00a0 We have regularly received reports of not being able to add subreddits to custom feeds. To my recollection most have been from the app but I am not sure the percentages. The two yesterday were on the Android app. Uninstalling and reinstalling and clearing cache sometimes allow one more. The first one linked below from yesterday mentioned adding 10 subreddits, but only 2 added. I have linked the two from yesterday, but I can see if there are any more in the few days I can see on the feed if you need them.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1dja4k5/comment/l9esn90/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1dja4k5/comment/l9esn90/?context=3)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1djsk70/cant\\_add\\_communities\\_to\\_custom\\_feed/](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1djsk70/cant_add_communities_to_custom_feed/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1dk5a42/i\\_cannot\\_add\\_anything\\_in\\_my\\_feed/](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1dk5a42/i_cannot_add_anything_in_my_feed/)\n\n**Issues**. This is a newer issue I noticed yesterday and hope to get ahead of since we I have room this week. Some people who have set their account settings to opt out of redesign are getting put into\u00a0[new.reddit.com](http://new.reddit.com/)\u00a0. Not the old reddit they want and not the current reddit. There were 2 reports of this, but the other appears to have been deleted.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1djacjf/when\\_i\\_log\\_in\\_i\\_am\\_given\\_newredditcom\\_despite\\_me/](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1djacjf/when_i_log_in_i_am_given_newredditcom_despite_me/)\n\n**Issues**: Over time we occasionally see reports of ads in one of the opt-out categories that always get through. I am not talking the occasional add because I know it is not 100%, but a specific add that falls in a category not be removed at all. You provided the ad report form previously for inappropriate ads, but can anything besides the normal reporting be done with them. Even though it is said reporting works, I have never seen that to be true. Here is the post that prompted this.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1djqy52/disable\\_ads\\_not\\_working\\_properly/](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1djqy52/disable_ads_not_working_properly/)\n\nThank you for reading my ramblings.",
            "can we get some help for /u/TheOpusCroakus on /r/redditrequest\n\n:) \n\nSeems Opus the only active admin there doing any of the work! \n\nbased on all the other admins post history, some not even active anymore :(",
            "The sitewide filters are completely unfit for purpose and there's no recourse when they go awry.  Removal has happened so often that mods are unwilling to unblock content and rightfully so\u2014they'd be absolutely overwhelmed with the number of requests.  \n\n*Why* is there no accurate, automated override for wrongly removed content?  I've probably had well over 100 comments quashed by now because of some filtering function (don't know which one).  My posts tend to be longer and informative, but apparently that's considered spam.  For the admins, many links to removed comments are here, if you're curious as to content: [https://www.reddit.com/r/bugs/comments/1d8vdmv/desktop\\_web\\_reddits\\_sitewide\\_spam\\_filter/](https://www.reddit.com/r/bugs/comments/1d8vdmv/desktop_web_reddits_sitewide_spam_filter/) \n\nBy the way, I am still seeing a bug where if a person replied to one of my (eventually) deleted comments, the reason for the removal is \"Comment removed by moderator\".  I am *very* certain the comment was not removed by a moderator.  When a comment is removed but *doesn't* have any replies or child comments, there is no reason given for removal: it's just a blank space when logged out.",
            "It wouldn't be a Thursday without your much appreciated not-ramblings! =)\n\n* I just checked with the team that is working on the disappearing posts issue. They have been working on it and feel that it should be happening less frequently within the last month or so. Would you say that is the case or that there it has increased/stayed the same? I also learned that the fixes that have been implemented for this may not have had the same effect on gallery posts. \n\n* Will share the new UI feedback with that team. It should be getting better! \n\n* Glad to hear some of the filter reports are going down! \n\n* I was able to reproduce not being able to add a sub to a custom feed on Android, but I wasn't able to do it on iOS. I've flagged this to the team and a ticket has been created and it is actively being looked into at this time. \n\n* For the issue with not going to old.reddit.com, I was able to reproduce this (and I'm not thrilled about it)! I am flagging this right now to get someone on it. I don't think that should be happening. Thanks for the early heads up! The workaround would be just to log into old.reddit.com with that setting on. \n\n* Users shouldn't be seeing ads from categories that they've opted out of. I'd be interested in where this is happening (desktop or mobile) and which sort of ads (home feed, comments or sidebar). \n\nWhew! I think I've just talked to every team at Reddit this morning. LOL",

        "comments": [
            "1. Upvote things you like, comments that express what you're thinking, comments that are helpful or that explain something well, comments that someone clearly put some effort into, and as a courtesy, I usually upvote any comment that I reply to.\n2. Downvote things that are false or misleading, comments that express bigotry or are otherwise intended to cause harm, comments that add nothing to the discussion, or comments that are obviously fishing for upvotes (you'll learn to recognize these as you become more familiar with the site). Note that you should not downvote things just because you do not like them or because you have a difference of opinion with someone. In those cases, simply do not upvote.\n3. Before commenting yourself, check to see if someone already said what you were going to say. If so, upvote that comment instead of repeating what's already been said.\n4. Read the article, not just the headline. Headlines can be misleading, they're usually written by an editor who did not write the article. Sometimes the people you encounter in the comments didn't read the article, and when that happens, it shows.\n5. If the post is an image with text on it, or a video of someone unknown to you, and it is making claims of fact, do not upvote it unless you already know it is true, or until you have verified for yourself that it is providing true and accurate information.\n6. If you're debating with someone, link to reputable sources when making claims of fact that are not widely known or are in dispute. This isn't required, but it is customary, and it will make your argument stronger and more convincing to others who are reading.\n7. Don't take downvotes personally. Sometimes your post or comment will get downvoted for no apparent reason, or reasons that are not immediately clear to you, and nothing will earn more downvotes than complaining about downvotes. Take your licks and move on.\n8. The /all feed is mostly garbage because most people don't do what's in suggestions 1 through 5. Search for subreddits about topics that interest you and subscribe to those. The buttons marked Best, Hot, New, Rising, etc. only show you results from subreddits you've subscribed to. You'll get the most out of the site by focusing on your own areas of interest or expertise.\n9. There are different rules in each subreddit and you should read them before posting or commenting. Moderators have nearly unlimited discretion in their own subs and **they are not required to be fair or helpful**. There is no one to complain to if the mods simply don't like you, all you can do about it is find a better sub, or create one of your own. That said, most mods are nice as long as you are nice to them. Don't fly off the handle or attack them if they do something you don't like or agree with. Approach them calmly and politely and they will usually explain where things went wrong.\n10. Just something I've learned after long experience and observation: The third top nested comment is where all the worst comments live. There is a symbol next to each comment that looks like this [-] and if you click it, it will collapse the comment and all of the replies to it. If you start to use this site often, collapsing the third top comment as soon as you enter a thread with more than 500 comments will add years to your life, trust me. This is what you're looking for:\n\n> [-] Top comment responding to the article or link\n>> [-] Reply to top comment that is usually still germane to the linked topic\n>>> [-] This is where things start to go off course, nearly everything under this is worthless\n\nThe above only applies to the top-level thread, threads below that do not suffer from so much entropy in the third top comment as the thread spawned by the highest upvoted top-level comment does.\n\nGood luck, and try not to take this place too seriously. It's still just the internet.",
