That\u2019s because Changelog has officially moved to the [Reddit Help Center](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us)! \n\nAll bug fixes, minor improvements, and information on app versions will now live in the [Changelog section of Help Center](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/sections/27664826932116). We\u2019ll be adding a link to Changelog\u2019s new home in the sidebar here, and posting here when a new Changelog is available. \n\nThanks for tuning in to this short and sweet update! Here is [your moment of zen.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eyebleach/comments/1do8ha5/paradise_beach/)",

If it is a report that would go to the sub mods, I never get anything in response, as those reports are anonymous and the mods can't see who submitted the report.\n\nThirdly, it all depends on how urgent the report is. Occasionally I have gotten a message from Reddit admin two+ days afterwards. They aren't on a time limit , and aren't really at your beck and call. \n\nFourthly, WHY would Reddit just be throwing out your reports? Why? If it doesn't make sense, it probably isn't true. Ok? \n\nIf you are working yourself into some paranoid rambling, then you really need to deal with that on your own time, and not drag other people I to it. That's on you.\n\nOkey dokey?",
