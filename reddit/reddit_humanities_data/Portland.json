            "I rode a motorcycle from Port Orford back home to Portland that day. I took 101 to 126 to 99. When I left the coast and was riding east on 126, it felt like the temperature was rising like a degree every minute. Once I hit 99, I had to stop every 30 mins or so just to drink water and gatorade because I was getting so dehydrated. I remember stopping at a Safeway in Salem and getting a container of chopped watermelon and just hanging out in the AC and eating that melon was like mana. That last stretch of 99E from Salem to Portland was so brutal.",
