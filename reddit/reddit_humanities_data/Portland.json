Unless you swim to those areas and dig around in the river bottom you are not exposed to those chemicals.\n\nTheres a bunch of horrible crap in the fill under The Pearl from the railyards - unless you excavate down and drink a cup of ground water youre not exposed. Not a perfect analogy but same idea.\n\nThe main impact of the superfund is to make future development/use of the land/river bottom impossible without massive cleanup - because it would stir up all the sediment.\n\nPractically speaking for swimmers - its not a concern."
