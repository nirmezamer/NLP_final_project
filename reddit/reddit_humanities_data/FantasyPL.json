As we're in the off season for FPL, we'll post a discussion thread for each matchday, so those playing the UEFA game can discuss the games.\n\nThis is the place to moan and discuss every single thing that happened in games and with your team. If your player didn't start or saw a red card, or you picked the wrong player, captain, or other, this is the place to share all your rants, memes, and outbursts (and your score).\n\nFrom all of the mod team - good luck!\n\nThe r/FantasyPL Euro 2024 league code is: RVgJUa\n\nThis is NOT an RMT thread.
