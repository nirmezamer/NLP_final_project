        "content": "We understand that lots of people are interested in the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and want to discuss it on Reddit. Unfortunately, due to the very high number of users who are unable to talk about it in a civil manner, we are forced to **temporarily ban all posts and comments about Israel, Palestine and Gaza**.\n\nThis ban also includes **videos from protests** in support of either side, **older videos related to this topic** (from before October 2023), and **randomly bringing up this topic in the comments of unrelated videos**. You might be banned if you decide to post or comment about it. This post is the only and last warning.\n\nWhy the ban? Well, all these posts and comments lead to is harassment and insults towards other users over different opinions, hatred (both Islamophobia and Antisemitism), glorification of violence (against both Jews and Arabs/Muslims), misinformation about the situation, and in some cases even the terrorism support. We are not interested in this content when so many users can't discuss it like decent people.\n\nIf you are interested in a civil discussion about the topic, please use other subreddits instead.\n\nThank you for understanding.",
