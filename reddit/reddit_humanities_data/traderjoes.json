        "content": "There has been some misunderstanding and/or or misinformation claiming that human moderators are intentionally censoring or deleting union posts on r/traderjoes, which is false.\u00a0\n\nHuman Moderators are not and should not be expected to be online 24/7. Moderators often rely on AutoModerator (bot) to assist with various tasks. Posts that do not follow subreddit rules and/or are reported multiple times may be removed for varying reasons. When a post is repeatedly reported, AutoModerator will automatically remove that post as a precautionary measure.\n\nPrevious union related posts that were removed by AutoModerator preemptively will be reviewed and manually reinstated as long as subreddit rules were followed and they are not reposts.\n\nMoving forward, all future union discussions will be directed to this Megathread. This will help keep all unionization discussions and union updates organized.\u00a0\n\nAs previously mentioned, we understand the importance of support for Crew Members and creating a space for union discussions but if you do not agree with somebody else's comment, please keep comments civil - this includes no name-calling and please do not vindictively report comments for \"Someone is considering suicide or serious self-harm\" inappropriately. \n\nArticles that have already been posted:\n\n01/26/24 - [Bloomberg: Trader Joe\u2019s Follows SpaceX in Arguing US Labor Board Is Unconstitutiona](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-26/trader-joe-s-follows-spacex-in-arguing-nlrb-is-unconstitutional)l\n\n01/26/24 - [Huffington Post: Trader Joe\u2019s Attorney Argues National Labor Relations Board Is \u2018Unconstitutional\u2019](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trader-joes-attorney-nlrb-unconstitutional_n_65b41e7ae4b014b873b11cc2)\n\nOther recent articles:\n\n01/29/24 - [Trader Joe\u2019s Wine Shop in NYC could reopen after grocer accused of union-busting](https://nypost.com/2024/01/29/business/nyc-trader-joes-wine-shop-could-reopen-after-union-busting-allegations/)",

            "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to have this single mega thread that\u2019s hidden from view. The issue is also not just about unionization but protecting workers\u2019 rights. The title minimizes the situation",
            "Making this a megathread only topic (and putting the comments in contest mode) sure makes it seem like intentional censoring.",
            "I think TJs attempts at union-busting are the antithesis of their whole entire way of operating, and really makes me reconsider shopping there. At the end of the day they are *just* a grocery store. And I've been to plenty of grocery stores that are proudly unionized.",
            "\u201cWe\u2019re not deleting union posts! We\u2019re just hiding them in this mega thread\u201d",
            "As a two decade (non-management) member of the Trader Joe's Crew, this is nonsense! Many, many of us do NOT want to unionize, nor need to. Trader Joe's has consistently treated its employees with respect and adequate, if not superior, benefits. It's been and is a wonderful place to work. The \"union\" has pulled shady tactics and bullies anyone who has anything negative to say about it. Who is to protect us from the Unions? Most of us want NOTHING to do with it, but their free speech is protected while everyone else is accused of \"union busting\" or some other unfair nonsense. The articles written about this have a clear bias towards THEIR political agenda and are simply erroneous. Most of these pro-union people have worked for the company less than a few years and simply wish to push their socio-political views on everyone. To compare working at Trader Joe's to the danger and horrors of the mining community circa the 40s is just insane. We are treated well. The Unions want money and power to further their agenda.  I am not rewarded in any way nor discouraged by TJ's to speak about anything. I have stayed there most of my life because it's great. They have always listened to and compromised with the crew who had concerns, if remotely realistic. The union is corrupt and sneaky and trying to take our free speech, among other things! Don't believe what you read. TJ's cannot comment on the lies because of Union protections. But who protects us from the Unions??? BTW, this union that has come to TJS stole the Black Power fist and put a box cutter in it as their symbol, as if stocking groceries for almost $20 an hour (to start) is akin to the struggles of my people in the 60s. DOWN WITH THE UNION",
            "We don\u2019t care boycott Traitor Joe\u2019s",
            ". I hope people continue to talk about this and bring awareness to more and more people. \u00a0I keep seeing people post on Instagram and the subreddit posting their weekly TJ HAULSSS completely blind or ignorant to the issue at hand. I don\u2019t like it because I did enjoy shopping at Trader Joe\u2019s but it can\u2019t be overlooked. Lost another shopper.\u00a0",
            "It's great to see all union-related discussions being directed to one centralized Megathread for organization and clarity. Let's keep the conversation respectful and productive as we navigate this important topic. Thank you to the moderators for their hard work in maintaining a fair and balanced discussion space.",
            "Curious to the people who are going to stop shopping there, where are you going instead? \n\nI go maybe 2x a month and spend about $20 so pretty simple for me tbh but it's not like the other grocery options I have are better employment wise.",
            "I love Trader Joe\u2019s and I have stopped shopping there since all this."

I find it a bit low in the veggies, so I often add a little more of my own, but an easy option and beats a lot of thai takeout. Bonus points for garnishing with the TJ chile lime cashews.",
