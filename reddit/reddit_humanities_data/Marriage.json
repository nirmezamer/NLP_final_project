        "content": "I (28F) have been with my husband (27M) for six years, married for four years, and we have two kids (3F, almost 1F). Everything in our relationship is perfect for us. He\u2019s the best husband and father to our kids that I could have asked for. I am absolutely in love with him and his actions and words have always shown me that he feels the same way. There\u2019s no better feeling than going to sleep in his arms every night.\n\nLast weekend, my husband and I had some friends over and we were having a barbecue. We were all outside in the backyard, surrounding my husband who was on the grill. As the food got closer to being ready to eat, we all started sitting at our backyard table. Once the food was all ready and at the table, my husband went inside to use the washroom and get another case of beer. I didn\u2019t realize that my best friend (28F) had followed him. When he was coming back out, my best friend hid behind the wall separating our kitchen and living room and surprised him by pulling him and forcing a kiss. My husband immediately pushed her back and yelled wtf. She immediately started crying and ran out of the house and left. My husband came back into the backyard and asked to speak to me privately and immediately told me what had just happened. I was shocked and told him that it would be okay and that we could talk after everyone else left. I managed to put on appearances for the next couple of hours but I was mentally distraught.\n\nAfter everyone left, my husband sat me down and told me what happened and showed me the footage from our living room camera. It was exactly as my husband has described it. My best friend of 10 years, the person who I treated as my literal sister, forcibly kissed my husband. After the third date with my husband, she was the one I told that I was going to marry him. She knows how much I love him and how strong our relationship is and still she chose to try to come in the middle. For fuck\u2019s sake, our 3 year old calls her \u201cAunty\u201d. \n\nMy best friend tried showing up the next day \u201cjust to talk\u201d and my husband had to hold me back from beating the shit out of her and he kicked her out and told her to not come back. It\u2019s been almost a week now and I\u2019m nowhere close to moving on. I don\u2019t blame my husband one bit. He\u2019s completely innocent in this and if anything, he\u2019s the victim. I\u2019ve been lying down on my husband\u2019s chest and just crying every day and night. I\u2019m so angry and frustrated and don\u2019t know what to do. My husband has been amazing and like always, he just gets it and understands how I\u2019m feeling. He brought me flowers almost every day and cooked my favorite meals multiple times in the last few days. I love and appreciate him all the more for it. I just don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to move on and trust any of my friends again after this.\n",

            "Has she said why she did it? Although it doesn't matter I would never talk to her again but I am curious as to why she would throw away your friendship like that. Your husband sounds like a good guy. Sorry that you have to deal with this.",
            "What she did was beyond wrong.  Your husband is obviously not the type to play games or entertain fools.  You should be happy for that and the obvious fact that he loves you. Now concerning this woman.  I think you should completely ghost her.  Don't be surprised if she tries to lie to others about what happened.  Good luck it will take time to get passed this.",
            "Commenting on the other comments in this post, it's astounding to me that the spouse immediately objected to the assault and immediately told OP and showed her video proof so she knows he's telling the truth and there are *still* people in this thread that are immediately jumping to \"he's having an affair and trying to hide it\", and are getting significant support/approval.\n\nLike, this is insane, please describe to me what would have had to go differently in this encounter for you to *not* immediately jump to the spouse is having an affair?",
            "I hate to be the guy who thinks there must be more to this story, but something just doesn't ring 100% true to me here. Other commenters have raised the thought that  they have had an affair and she was not aware of the cameras. He might be trying to get ahead of it by doing damage control. Maybe he led her on, even if it was out of naivet\u00e9, trying to be kind but sending mixed signals. Cheating would explain why he is buying you flowers and cooking for you, love bombing you to secure forgiveness. I won't dwell on this, but it is possible.\n\nLet's look at this from another perspective that I rarely see brought up in posts like this:\n\nIf everything is 100% as described here, your husband was sexually abused, and has had no ability to deal with his trauma because he is taking care of you. You are suffering, and you have every right to be upset. This will sound harsh, but for the good of your relationship with your husband,  quit being selfish, and allow your man to deal with what happened to him. He was assaulted in his own home. Be there for him.\n\nYour post sounds like you are so focused on how YOU feel, that you have not considered how HE feels. He is a good man to focus on you. He will likely never tell you how he feels after this, because he will default to taking care of the woman he loves. This is not healthy, and will cause resentment. He will feel like he can never feel emotion, because you are teaching him that your feelings matter more than his,\n\nBe there for him, even if he says it is not a big deal. Don't force him to talk about it, because he probably won't, but make sure he knows that he is your rock star. Love and treasure him, let him know you are there for him. It will mean the world to him, even if he never shows it.",
            "Was she wasted?  Seems like a very odd thing to do.  I think you want to talk to her, and you should.",
            "You have a great husband.\n\nPlease keep the proof. \n\nIs she single?\nDo you hang around in the same circles?",
            "There is definitely missing info here. There\u2019s no way someone just does that out of the blue",
            "plot twist : She isn't your friend. Sorry that happened. You know who to cut out of your life.",
            "Living room camera?",
            "Wow.... I mean... Yeah, I don't blame you. That's such a huge betrayal and will take a lot of time to get over. I would honestly look into therapy because this is the type of thing that can seriously mess with your outlook on life and you don't want it to damage your relationship with others just because she's clearly a messed up person. \n\nOf course, my number one thing would be to never let her back in your life ever again. She cannot be trusted around your family. There is no excuse for what she did and while there would be part of me that would want to know what the hell she was thinking, you're likely not going to get the truth from her lips. She assaulted your husband, she betrayed you as a friend and she didn't even have the backbone to stick around and explain herself. There's nothing to save there. That friendship is dead in the water and I'd honestly have that recording ready to go to make it clear to any mutual friends exactly why you're not accepting her in your life anymore."

He barely takes two bites of it. They package it up for us and we take it home as leftovers. \n\nFor ELEVEN DAYS, this slice of cake sat in the fridge, untouched. 11 DAYS. After eleven days, I start to nibble at it a bit each day. I paid for it, I like cake, he clearly wasn't touching it, so YEAH, I started nibbling at it. I didn't want it to go bad, it would've been money down the drain. \n\nFast forward a few weeks. We're sitting in one of our marriage counseling sessions. And GUESS WHO brings up the fact that I ate the cake........ \n\nOf course, he left out a bunch of context as he sat there spinning this tale to the therapist. I was painted as some fat b**ch that unjustly ate his birthday cake. \n\nI filled in the gaps to the therapist. \n\nFast forward about six months. I'd been separated from him for about three months at this point. I was doing my weekly grocery shopping, and happened to walk by the bakery section. I spotted one of those huge, fat, thick slices of cake that is basically a mini cake unto its own. BOOM. Easiest purchase ever.

I couldn\u2019t believe a therapist would use the term \u201cbasket case\u201d to refer to one of their clients, to their face. It felt like he was trying to make a lighthearted joke to get my husband on side but it was just inappropriate. I didn\u2019t say anything, just never went back.

We clash a lot, he\u2019s extremely logical and analytical, where I am highly emotionally intelligent and more sensitive. At the end of the day, though, we love each other fiercely and we are a constant work in progress, but we never fail to let our love be first.\n\nSo we tend to have sex anywhere from 1x/week-3x/week, more if we have extra days off from work. We love to make love, fuck, every which way our (currently chonky) bodies will allow. All in all, we have a healthy sex life, I surmise. \n\nLast night, while my husband was out of the house, I opened this jar that I made him 7 years ago that was filled with tiny sheets of paper with things I loved about him. This was so needed for my heart because I have felt a bit disconnected from him lately, just due to misunderstandings, miscommunications and the sort(our growing pains). I decided to put some sexy lingerie on underneath my work clothes that I still had on. He got home, we had dinner, watched tv, etc.-I had it on the whole time, he had no idea. \n\nWe stood up to do something(idk get some cookies or something) and he said \u201coh you gotta see this\u2026\u201d and got his phone to show me something. That\u2019s when I decided to take off my shirt and say \u201cWell you\u2019ve gotta see *this*\u201d. \n\nInstantly hard, instantly had his hands all over me, told me I was so sexy, so hot, that it was so sexy that I had it on the whole time I was sitting next to him. Had amazing, passionate *missionary* sex. Sometimes you really can\u2019t beat the feeling of kissing and twirling your tongues while he\u2019s deep inside. Ya know? \n\nAnyway, our marriage has been kinda hard the past few years(lost my sister, his grandpa, his uncle, my uncle, my mom, who we took care of in her final days) from grief, he had to set hard boundaries with his parents(didn\u2019t talk to them for a year), losing our soul dog, and just, in general, discovering we both have some poor emotional behaviors due to trauma we both need to deal with on our own, so, with all of that said\u2026\u2026it was a breath of fresh air for us and I have been looking forward to seeing him all day because I know he\u2019s been thinking about our hot moment last night. \n\nI really wanted to share for a few reasons, mainly because I wanted to share a perspective that maybe, if you\u2019re feeling some type of way, reread any letters YOU wrote about/to your spouse, or anything that might take you back in time to when your love was young and fresh and new. That is like a soft reset for me. I will be doing it at least every couple months from now on. \u2764\ufe0f",
