        "content": "My wife and I have been together about 7 years and married 4. To give a little back story, about 3-4 weeks ago my wife had admitted to me that she had been considering divorce for some time now. It caught me caught me completely off guard. I knew our marriage wasn\u2019t perfect, but no one\u2019s is. She stated that she felt she was lacking attention and affection from me and that\u2019s what was leading her to the thought of her wanting a divorce. During that conversation I committed to working on myself as long as she was willing to work on our marriage also. She was somewhat hesitant but agreed that she would work together with me to better it.\n\nLess than 24 hours after this conversation I found out that she had been having an emotional affair with another man online that lives locally to us. I was mad, heartbroken, and shocked. She admitted everything to me, yet deleted the conversation before I could read it. I needed the next 2 days to think over the whole situation and what I wanted to do. I was so angry I wanted to end the whole marriage right there on the spot but was committed to making it work not only for us, but for our kids. \n\nA few days went by and things didn\u2019t get any better. We were back to arguing over small things and my wife just acting completely checked out. We sat down and had a serious conversation and both agreed that divorce would be for the best. The following couple of weeks were the least stressed I have felt in a long time and we both had seemed to be in decent moods. I believe because we both knew this rocky road of a marriage was coming to an end. I agreed to get an attorney and start the process. She was completely fine until\u2026 about 2 days ago. \n\nI went and filed and paid the attorney 2 days ago and it was like she was in complete shock. She started bawling crying and begging me to not go forward with it. Then a few hours after she was mad stating that I was ruining our family without even trying to make it work. We are at the point now that we barely even talk, which is better than arguing to me to be honest. \n\nI guess my whole post is about, why the sudden change up on her end? She was fine when discussing divorce, and even sat down with me to fill out the paperwork dividing up time with our kids etc. Yet when I actually went and filed it was the end of the world. Especially when all of this was sparked by a conversation of her stating she has been considering divorce for some time now.\nJust to throw this out there I am not having second thoughts about filing, I just cannot stand the constant change up of emotions.\n\nAny advice or input is greatly appreciated.",

Filing the paperwork made everything more real than she hoped it was so she\u2019s showing you how much this is truly effecting her. It could also be a number of other things, but regardless it sounds like she\u2019s hurting which is normal at this point. You have to make the best choice for yourself and your family.",

        "content": "I (28F) have been with my husband (27M) for six years, married for four years, and we have two kids (3F, almost 1F). Everything in our relationship is perfect for us. He\u2019s the best husband and father to our kids that I could have asked for. I am absolutely in love with him and his actions and words have always shown me that he feels the same way. There\u2019s no better feeling than going to sleep in his arms every night.\n\nLast weekend, my husband and I had some friends over and we were having a barbecue. We were all outside in the backyard, surrounding my husband who was on the grill. As the food got closer to being ready to eat, we all started sitting at our backyard table. Once the food was all ready and at the table, my husband went inside to use the washroom and get another case of beer. I didn\u2019t realize that my best friend (28F) had followed him. When he was coming back out, my best friend hid behind the wall separating our kitchen and living room and surprised him by pulling him and forcing a kiss. My husband immediately pushed her back and yelled wtf. She immediately started crying and ran out of the house and left. My husband came back into the backyard and asked to speak to me privately and immediately told me what had just happened. I was shocked and told him that it would be okay and that we could talk after everyone else left. I managed to put on appearances for the next couple of hours but I was mentally distraught.\n\nAfter everyone left, my husband sat me down and told me what happened and showed me the footage from our living room camera. It was exactly as my husband has described it. My best friend of 10 years, the person who I treated as my literal sister, forcibly kissed my husband. After the third date with my husband, she was the one I told that I was going to marry him. She knows how much I love him and how strong our relationship is and still she chose to try to come in the middle. For fuck\u2019s sake, our 3 year old calls her \u201cAunty\u201d. \n\nMy best friend tried showing up the next day \u201cjust to talk\u201d and my husband had to hold me back from beating the shit out of her and he kicked her out and told her to not come back. It\u2019s been almost a week now and I\u2019m nowhere close to moving on. I don\u2019t blame my husband one bit. He\u2019s completely innocent in this and if anything, he\u2019s the victim. I\u2019ve been lying down on my husband\u2019s chest and just crying every day and night. I\u2019m so angry and frustrated and don\u2019t know what to do. My husband has been amazing and like always, he just gets it and understands how I\u2019m feeling. He brought me flowers almost every day and cooked my favorite meals multiple times in the last few days. I love and appreciate him all the more for it. I just don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to move on and trust any of my friends again after this.\n",
