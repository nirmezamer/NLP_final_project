        "content": "I used to create music over a decade ago using FL Studio. I have the opportunity to learn either Ableton or Logic Pro. In the past I dabbled with Ableton and found the structure confusing. I am willing to put the effort to learn either of them. \n\nWhich DAW is the most favourable to create video game music and jungle and please let me know why.  \n\nThanks in advance. ",

            "Logic Pro has amazing stock presets, sample library, synths and plugins. I was ready to go within a day or two of learning the Logic interface.",
            "You can do any genre in any DAW. You should just go with whatever is easier for you to use.\n\nI prefer Ableton. It does have a learning curve, but so does anything else, it's cross platform and pairs well with my Akai Force. Logic is great though. I know several people who wouldn't use anything else.",
            "I take it you have a Mac, so Logic Pro would be the way to go. \n\nThe value of its performance and sound library is unmatched. It even has its own grid based loops paradigm that Ableton pioneered over ten years ago.",
            "I had the same dilema, I started with Cubase years ago and the steep learning curve drove me away. I then picked up logic and dabbled with Ableton because my Novation Launchkey came with Ableton Lite.\n\nIt comes down to what workflow you prefer. Ableton is better for electronic music with it's loops feature, which is vastly different to linear production. Logic has a more linear and straightforward workflow, which is one of the easiest DAWS to pickup. Logic I find is easier to use when connecting multiple instruments. , \n\nWhat kind of video game music are you planning to make? Is it like electronica and plugin synths or are you looking to use instruments and vocals?",
            "Logic rocks.",
            "Anything. And then get Chipsounds and you're good to go.",
            "If it's in any way electronic, synth based game music, then Ableton or bitwig, if it's general, classic music production, logic or Cubase. For jungle, it doesn't matter as long as you have a good time stretching alorgrithm and a nice way to cut up breaks, without being cumbersome. I would say Ableton over logic anyday though. It's more expensive but it's honestly better  in my opinion, especially for electonica.",
            "No DAW is better suited for a style of music than any other. The differences are work flow, and you choose the one you like. But they all do the same thing."

            "I make synthwave, which is pretty niche. I'm still trying to become more established, but I couldn't ask for a better community and fanbase.",
            "I've release 3 albums.\n\n2 of them I call my \"sleep\" albums. Not to be confused with the band Sleep or any other bands with sleep in their names.\n\nThe first is all piano using minimal stems on each track and anytime I found myself getting too close to making a memorable melody I forced myself to veer away from it. Didn't want any of it being \"catchy\". I also tried my best to put every track through the same effect filter including reverb settings to try and create the feeling/sound of a piano in the woods by a large river.\n\nThe second is very similar except I allowed more \"stems\" on each track and more instruments. Tried to mold the reverb and effects to how I imagine it would sound if you could hear music on the moon with no helmet. Little bit more melody allowed on these.\n\nAnyways. These two albums were written and built to sound best at 50-75% volume and to help relax into sleep with. I'm not a professional sleep science or anything so no major techniques just exploring my own relationship with poor sleep cycles (I have severe sleep apnea and used to suffer from severe sleep paralysis). \n\nSo...I don't know if that's niche or just a weird concept, but I added both albums to a Spotify playlist full of other people's mellow piano tracks and listen to it every night while sleeping.",
            "I make instrumental prog rock with a sax instead of a vocalist. Two guitars, bass, synth, drums and me on tenor. I love making it but getting people to engage when I\u2019m not playing live is so disheartening. \n\nSo then I tried to make lofi because it was more popular. Ended up making more instrumental neo-soul /jazz hop so realistically niche is all I know haha",

            "First of all, pick one genre and stick to it for the time being. Genres have various common conventions that you can work with when beginning. For example, common drum and percussion patterns. Common chord progressions. \n\nSo until you can learn the basics of your DAW, and learn some basics for creating music stick with one. \n\nNext, instead of just being all over the place with trying to create a track for a song. Start by trying to build a musical idea. Like the instrumental equivalent of a chorus or a verse in a song. And learn to create the tracks for that. \n\nThen once you become more advanced, you can learn how to expand on that musical idea into a full song. So for example, if you go with techno or some other type of EDM, stick to an eight bar loop. And then eventually you will study song structures to expand it from there, such as described in this video \n\nhttps://edmtips.com/edm-song-structure/\n\nAs you begin working with melodies and chords and creating musical ideas, at some point it will be a good idea to start learning some basic music theory. Music theory is about the relationship between notes. And scales, chords, arpeggios, and rhythms are the building blocks for creating music. \n\nYou won't be able to learn everything you need to know about music theory in the beginning. It'll be something to work with overtime where your knowledge of music theory grows as your other knowledge about creating music grows.\n\nThen once you can create some full songs, you can focus on learning to use creative effects like reverb or delay.\n\nFinally, save other mixing (such as EQ, side chaining, transient shaping) and mastering until you've gotten the hang of those other things. That's the frosting on the cake. But you got to be able to bake the cake first.",
