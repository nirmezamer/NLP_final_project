        "content": "I used to create music over a decade ago using FL Studio. I have the opportunity to learn either Ableton or Logic Pro. In the past I dabbled with Ableton and found the structure confusing. I am willing to put the effort to learn either of them. \n\nWhich DAW is the most favourable to create video game music and jungle and please let me know why.  \n\nThanks in advance. ",

            "You can do any genre in any DAW. You should just go with whatever is easier for you to use.\n\nI prefer Ableton. It does have a learning curve, but so does anything else, it's cross platform and pairs well with my Akai Force. Logic is great though. I know several people who wouldn't use anything else.",
            "Logic Pro has amazing stock presets, sample library, synths and plugins. I was ready to go within a day or two of learning the Logic interface.",
            "I take it you have a Mac, so Logic Pro would be the way to go. \n\nThe value of its performance and sound library is unmatched. It even has its own grid based loops paradigm that Ableton pioneered over ten years ago.",
            "Anything. And then get Chipsounds and you're good to go.",
            "I took a class on Ableton and was pretty blown away. Moving forward, I\u2019ll probably stick with it.",
            "i use both for different things. ableton is THE BEST for automating parameters with its lfo plugin and its interface is much more catered to sampling and resampling and stuff like that imo. however, for some reason whenever i try to mix vocals, they sound so much worse in ableton than in logic pro for me. i use logic for anything that doesn\u2019t necessarily need quantized or more organic sounds like drums (which their drummer feature is not like any other and sounds pretty good) or guitars and bass (they have really good amp presets) or vocals!",
            "If you have a Mac and need to start from scratch you may as well go for logic.  It\u2019s unbelievably good value and correct me if I\u2019m wrong always had free updates unlike ableton that some 2007 I\u2019ve probably sunk about $2000 in updates which over 17 years I suppose isn\u2019t a lot but Apple, oddly, have never asked for a penny!",
            "Logic = easier to work with real instruments and recordings \n\nAbleton Live = easier to work with virtual instruments and plugins",
            "Like others said, any of the big DAWs are good for any genre. I haven't trialed Ableton but I'm sure there's lots to learn and do in there. I'm an owner of Reason, Logic, and FL. Reason is my favorite, then FL, then Logic. I can make bangers in all of them. Reason is just super streamlined for straight up producing and mixing + mastering, meaning I work fastest in there and it has the most comfortable interface for ME",
            "If it's in any way electronic, synth based game music, then Ableton or bitwig, if it's general, classic music production, logic or Cubase. For jungle, it doesn't matter as long as you have a good time stretching alorgrithm and a nice way to cut up breaks, without being cumbersome. I would say Ableton over logic anyday though. It's more expensive but it's honestly better  in my opinion, especially for electonica."

I love making it but getting people to engage when I\u2019m not playing live is so disheartening. \n\nSo then I tried to make lofi because it was more popular.

            "I make a very niche electronic style of music, it\u2019s a decently niche genre with some of the bigger artists like Porter Robinson and San Holo only having around 1 - 2 million monthly listeners. This means smaller artists will definitely have a much more insignificant number of listeners, but I love the music that I make and it makes me appreciate people who listen to my music so much more. Think about it people in much more mainstream genres get millions of stream and a lot of the time don\u2019t give that the light of day, on the other hand you see a couple hundred streams on your tracks and it makes you so happy that these strangers are checking out your songs."

        "content": "Hey all, I've been tinkering with NI Komplete 14 Standard for a while now and I use lots of the VSTs and I think it is really good, (I especially love the pianos and some other sampled instruments) but I would like it if there were some orchestral sounds too. I want to get an orchestral pack as I'd like to get into film scoring/orchestral music. I've heard Komplete 14 Ultimate isn't worth it for AU$1800 for just the orchestral sounds but since there's a 50% sale on right now and I have Komplete 14 standard its only AU$300. Does anyone reckon this is a worthwhile upgrade. I was thinking about stuff from spitfire and I can hear in the samples its really good but I'd like an all encompassing kind of pack with violins and horns and big strings and stuff and too my knowlage that would be extreemely expensive with spitfire. I'd still use *some* other VSTs from K14 Ultimate (probably guitars, effects and so on), but not as much as the orchestral stuff. Any opinions? \n\n  \nTL;DR: Should I upgrade to komplete 14 ultimate for only AU$300 for mainly the orchestral sounds",

            "with NI the sale price of Komplete kind of is the price. it goes on sale to the lower price at least once a year (maybe more?) is it worth the sale price, maybe, but don't even think about the higher price.",
            "so do you think i should get it for 300? (upgrade price)",
            "Hard for anyone else but you to know. but I normally do this: have a look at the list of plugins you would get in the bundle, list out the ones you would buy seperately at their individual list price if they were not in a bundle. add them up, if it's more than the price of the bundle and you can afford the bundle then buy it.",
            "i was more thinking of the fact that im quite new to the orchestral scape and as of current id probably want to buy most of the orchrstral vsts in the pack as i like the sound of them but i am not very experienced so i dont know of what im hearing is worth the money. Action strings 2 for example, is 200$. I wouls probably buy that but ive heard online its \u201ca bit mediocre\u201d so idk what to do lol"
