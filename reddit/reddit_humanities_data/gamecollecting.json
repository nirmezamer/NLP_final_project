If you make a post regarding these topics, the post will be removed and possibly get a 1-7 day ban.   \n\n  \n\nIf you see posts on these topics PLEASE report it. It helps immensely.  We will be updating automoderator to help alleviate some of that burden from us and you onto it.  \n\n\\---  \n\n  \n\nIf you are asking to price something normal. Like the normal release of a game, or a special edition, normal consoles, or some special editions. You can find a decent approximation of its value here [at PriceCharting.com](https://www.pricecharting.com/)  \n\n  \n\nTo help, here are some links directly to some consoles. These are not ALL of the consoles the site has. So please if you do not see a link below for the console you are looking for, go to the site and look around. This should cover MOST games, if it is not listed, please ask in this thread.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, to possibly get you closer to the \"real\" value. [Click on this link once you found your game](https://i.imgur.com/bbKIiPV.png?1) (for loose/CIB/Sealed) which will show you the data it is pulling from [(like this)](https://i.imgur.com/lvvRnCZ.png). You can see if there are any outliers being sold for far to much, or far to little. Maybe a listing that had other games with it is being used for data, or its CIB rather than loose.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Nintendo**\n\n|[NES](https://www.pricecharting.com/console/nes)|[SNES](https://www.pricecharting.com/console/super-nintendo)|[N64](https://www.pricecharting.com/console/nintendo-64)|[Gamecube](https://www.pricecharting.com/console/gamecube)|[Wii](https://www.pricecharting.com/console/wii)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|[WiiU](https://www.pricecharting.com/console/wii-u)|[Switch](https://www.pricecharting.com/console/nintendo-switch)|[Gameboy](https://www.pricecharting.com/console/gameboy)|[GameBoy Color](https://www.pricecharting.com/console/gameboy-color)|[GBA](https://www.pricecharting.com/console/gameboy-advance)|\n|[NDS](https://www.pricecharting.com/console/nintendo-ds)|[3ds](https://www.pricecharting.com/console/nintendo-3ds)|[Vitual Boy](https://www.pricecharting.com/console/virtual-boy)|[Game&Watch](https://www.pricecharting.com/console/game-&-watch)||\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Playstation**\n\n|[PS1](https://www.pricecharting.com/console/playstation)|[PS2](https://www.pricecharting.com/console/playstation-2)|[PS3](https://www.pricecharting.com/console/playstation-3)|[PS4](https://www.pricecharting.com/console/playstation-4)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|[PS5](https://www.pricecharting.com/console/playstation-5)|[PSP](https://www.pricecharting.com/console/psp)|[PSVita](https://www.pricecharting.com/console/playstation-vita)||\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**XBOX**\n\n|[Xbox](https://www.pricecharting.com/console/xbox)|[Xbox360](https://www.pricecharting.com/console/xbox-360)|[XboxOne](https://www.pricecharting.com/console/xbox-one)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|[Xbox Series X](https://www.pricecharting.com/console/xbox-series-x)|||\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Sega**\n\n|[Genesis](https://www.pricecharting.com/console/sega-genesis)|[32x](https://www.pricecharting.com/console/sega-32x)|[Sega CD](https://www.pricecharting.com/console/sega-cd)|[Saturn](https://www.pricecharting.com/console/sega-saturn)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|[Dreamcast](https://www.pricecharting.com/console/sega-dreamcast)|[Game Gear](https://www.pricecharting.com/console/sega-game-gear)|[Master System](https://www.pricecharting.com/console/sega-master-system)|[Pico](https://www.pricecharting.com/console/sega-pico)|",

The shrink wrap looks legit, but the square around the PS logo on the spine, the \u201cPlayStation\u201d word, and the \u201cPAL\u201d label have inconsistent colouring. It feels like the colour is bleeding out compared to my other games. I also own another copy of the same game, and it doesn\u2019t have these issues.\n\nThe one on the right is my older copy, and the one on the left is the eBay purchase. I\u2019ll attach photos for comparison.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with this? Any tips on gathering evidence or confirming if it\u2019s fake? Thanks!",

I have been a long time Nintendo fanatic and have a piece of memorabilia I would like to get some information about and potentially what something like this would be worth.  Over the year, I have scoured the internet looking for similar pieces to see if they have been sold or even to get more information about them and to this point I have come up empty handed.\n\nThis jacket as given to me as a gift when I was really young and it appears to be some sort of send away type of piece via Nintendo Power magazine a popular Nintendo magazine from back in the day.  I used to feel pretty darn cool wearing this to school with my friends and I'd like to share the pictures with you to get some feedback, information, or any information about what something like this would be worth.  At the very least I think it is an awesome piece of Nintendo history!\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nRiftshaper\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8yerkfqteu5d1.png?width=447&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3ae5e7e6ff27203d084f8f14f5179d0ef42139d",

Try again after that 24 hours, as he is generatively learning how the fresh prince of bel air rolls wit it.  This helps to fight fake accounts and spam bots \n\n\n**Secondly**, just as a reminder and to also find out who reads these megathreads as well.  ***The first monday of the month***, is **MEME MONDAY**.  Keep it clean, keep it game collecting (or gaming in general).  Any other time you all see a meme outside of this first monday, please report that.  I like them just as much as you do, but trying to keep things on topic the other days of the month. The first monday is madness, so make me laugh, if you can.  And make sure to tag me in the best ones please. \n\n*\n\n[**Remember the rules, which can be found here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamecollecting/wiki/rules). <--- clickable link... try it if you are confused or unsure of something.  As for the rest of the rules, if you dont know them, go check them out.  These are sort of important as we reference them when people misbehave.\n\nWhy a megathread? It us to help keep the sub from being cluttered with questions. So ask your questions here. Make a comment that wouldn\u2019t normally be posted in the sub otherwise. Have some fun. Might wanna start getting consoles dusted off for summer heat waves, make sure the sun isnt bleaching your case art, consoles are in a well ventilated area, weather is changing in the US at least, and summertime fast approaches.\n\n\n*\n\nEvery moment frontin' and downloadin'\nChillin' on a game they spent all day min-maxin'\n\n*\n\nIf your looking to verify if a game is legit or not, try our friends over on /r/gameverifying (they also have a discord over there too, just like we do)..they do their best to help and are some good folks. \n\nIf your looking to sell, give our friends over at /r/GameSale a look first, you can also try r/gameswap for swapping. The discord also has a trading space.\n\nThanks everyone! \n\nOh and did you know we have an official Discord server? Link in the sidebar or go to www.gameandcollect.com.  We are working on some exciting things, in partnership with other discord servers and websites, and always a welcoming community so come say hey.  Now enjoy your summertime....",
