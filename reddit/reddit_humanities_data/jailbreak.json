Previously, when I was in the 14.3 system version, I used version 6.2.0 unc0ver. After I upgraded to the 14.8 system version, I used version 8.0.2 unc0ver, but no matter which version of unc0ver, I will encounter a serious problem, that is, my mobile phone often can't receive the push messages of the application in the cellular data state. Only those messages will be pushed all of a sudden after practicing Wi-Fi. This problem really bothers me for a long time. I sincerely hope you can help me solve this problem.",
