            "If I\u2019m a back button focus user, but I know I will have to hand the camera over to someone not familiar with mirrorless cameras for group photos. In those cases, there isn\u2019t anything wrong with leaving \u201cAF w/ Shutter\u201d on for those instances while I\u2019m using BBF for the rest, right?",
            "Those who own an A7iv or those who are instantly going to buy the A7v (eventually). What upgrades are you wanting/expecting?\u00a0",
            "I want to start photographing with IR light. Namely, I want to photograph my subjects in complete darkness using an IR flash. Currently I have the A7RIV.  Will this pick-up IR flash or need I modify the sensor and or put on a filter... Hows that for today's question? :-)",
            "I have been shooting for a little bit on an a700 but have considered getting a different 2nd hand camera with lenses due to various reasons; so I wanted to ask how the SLT cameras compare to a traditional DLSR. The one available for me to purchase is an a58 with 18-55, 55-200 and 75-300 lenses for $250aud. \n\nAnyone who has any experience with these model SLT cameras who could share some experience and maybe photos would help a lot, and whether you think this might be a worthwhile deal. Thanks :)",
            "I brought the Sony 35mm out on a trip and felt it did not have enough reach for my liking. Would looking at the Sigma 18-50mm be too short. I mostly live with my 55-210mm on. I was also looking the 18-135. I ruled out the 17-70, its a little big.",
            "Just found a A6000 for cheap guy says it doesn't work red light flashes when he puts in the battery from most of my reading this should be a memory card failure right? I bought it just to play around with even if i cant fix it I wont be mad but wondering if anyone else has seen the problem before.",
            "Hi! I'm looking to replace my aging SLT-A57 with possibly an A7III or A7IV, but want to see if it's possible to keep my two lenses. I have the stock SAL1855 which came with the camera and a DT 55-300mm SAM lens and I'm confused by which A mount adapter I should/could buy. I think it's between the LA-EA4 or LA-EA5, but not sure if I lose certain functions on the old lenses (auto-focus capability etc.) in different modes by using this on either of the A7's i'm looking to buy.\n\nCan anyone explain pros and cons of either adapter or if selling the lot and buying a native E-mount lens (or lenses) is the way to go?",
            "Hi everyone, I'm really really new in photography and I'm using second hand Sony A6000 and Helios 44-2 2/58 lens that I took from my dad's old soviet Zenit E camera(I'm using manual lens because its fun to use). But my question is when I'm using autofocus lens (TTartisan 35mm) it's just the little green rectangles for focus but when I'm using manual lens I'm seeing redlines around my object and I don't know if it should be like this and is it like this any other cameras? I'm asking this because these redlines helps me so much and I want to buy another camera but if it's not have a redlines like this I don't think I can shoot with manual lens. \n\nThanks.",

            "Hi everyone, I am looking to buy a telephoto zoom for my A7 IV. Currently looking at Sony 70-200 f/4 macro, Tamron 70-180 f/2.8 and the new Tamron 50-300. I shoot mostly stills and mainly landscapes/cityscapes. Any input or feedback from users of these lenses are welcome!"

Proof of use and unless some of the mech is misbehaving, shouldn't be a problem. How did the lens take the drop? I would be more worried about that.",
