        "content": "A few years ago, I left my family and friends behind to move across the country for my girlfriend. It had always been her dream and I wanted to make that happen for her.\n\nOnce we got here, she discarded me. I had to move out and get my own place. I should have just gone back home but I couldnt really get myself to accept what was happening and going home felt like giving up. Now that I've stayed, I'm falling apart. I work hard, I walk 3 to 5 miles every day in addition to playing basketball. I live in an amazing location with so much to do and see.\n\nBut idc about any of it. I hate life now. I was always an optimist until this and this changed how I see the world. I cant find logic in this. I cant grasp that humans can do such a 180 and throw someone away that they claimed to care so deeply about.\n\nThis broke me. I'm barely functioning and I don't trust anyone now. I have a great job but I'm too depressed to do it well. I'm in sales and I need to be high energy and efficient and I just can't fake it anymore. What's the point? I thought I was doing this so that I could provide a life for the person I loved and a family.\n\nIdk how that could ever happen now. I'm 34 and I'm never going to trust someone again after this. Even if I pull myself out, how am I supposed to believe someone actually is going to love me? No one had ever seemed to care so deeply about me and the second she got everything she wanted, she was gone.\n\nThe worst part is that she refused a civil break up. She still wanted to be together so I kept trying to make it work but she would always find a reason to shut me out. One day I was bit by a rattlesnake. I tried to get ahold of her bc I was scared. I also had to spend the night in the hospital and I don't have any friends or family here so I needed her to maybe take care of my pets.\n\nShe had blocked me on everything and when she did finally get my messages the next day she called the hospital and yelled at me for not getting ahold of her. Apparently I was supposed to know to use *67 to bypass being blocked and so it was my own fault I had to be alone. That's what she said to me. Ironically, I tried to talk to her at a later point and she won't answer if I use *67.\n\nObviously she is no longer in my life now.\n\nI get that so many ppl have it worse. I get that ppl have kids and intertwined lives and this happens to them. That's my biggest fear and idk how they do it either. Even then though, I can see how kids would give you a purpose and a reason to keep it together. All I wanted in life was a partner. I just wanted my person and I thought that's what was happening. I literally left everything behind for this. It has been over a year since I moved out. Every day is the worst day of my life and its just a massive struggle to survive until I can get in bed again.\n\nThe typical advice doesn't work. Exercise doesn't work. Therapy doesn't work. Nobody cares. Everyone just thinks it was just a relationship and it happens and you move on. My friends and family hated her and I can tell they judge me now for still being here. It's terrible.\n\nTldr; I was lied to and led on and I no longer view the world in the same way. Has anyone ever felt this way? What got you through it? Idk how I'm going to get through another weekend of this. At least work is a distraction.\n\n\nEdit - First of all, thank you to everyone who has responded. I figured this would go ignored, so on a lonely Friday evening, it has been extremely helpful to know there are people out there willing to help.\n\nI think I'm learning that we live in a world where all anyone can say is to worry about yourself. I think our culture is becoming wildly individualistic and it scares me how quickly people contribute to dividing and isolating tactics.\n\nI'm going to do my best not to do that. I don't really want to live in a world where that's all anyone is doing. I hope some others will consider this and know that they don't have to conform either. I think I was maybe just born at the wrong time and I can accept that.",

            "What would you tell your best friend, your sibling, your cousin, if they were dumped. Would you tell them no one will ever love them? Would you tell them they will never have a relationship again? Would you tell them that they will never have the family they desire? \n\nIf you wouldn't tell them those things then why do you tell this to yourself?",
            "I'm a reddit stranger but I have felt exactly where you are at before. So basically I had all my friends and family turn their backs on me when I was at my lowest point and my brother even filmed my breakdown and farmed it Instagram likes. Some part of me thought that it was my fault deep down and I deserved it. Anger towards another person got suppressed and became anger towards my own actions. After 6 years of soul searching and leaving town for a bit I realized that I did nothing wrong to cause all that suffering and my anger should be placed at the people who wronged me. Nothing super aggressive like vengeance or anything but just knowing that I'm not crazy and that these people wronged me, took advantage of me at my lowest, kicked me figuratively and literally, used my kindness and consideration as ammo to hurt, etc., etc, makes me feel better knowing that there are better strangers out there than people that are meant to be close to you. I'd be mad too if I got tricked by someone who used me and wasted my time for themselves and having my family wag their fingers and saying \"I told you so\" doesn't really help me feel any better about it either. Also they don't get to judge when they knew and watched you go anyways like damn bro, where's the family backup? I'm placing blame on them if I hear them be snarky about it. I doubt they actually feel that way but if you hear them say it once, you get to lash out at them, with civility of course.\n\nAt the end of the day, recognizing where your self hate comes from and redirecting it towards an outlet is only one way of releasing all that anger in you. It wasn't just a relationship. It was your time, money, energy that you'll never get back.",
            "I kind of get where you're coming from.  I also moved for a relationship, and by the time the move was complete she didn't want to see me.  Hot and cold for years leading up to it, I should have seen the signs, and I felt duped.  I was too ashamed to admit that I moved here naively for a girl that didn't want to be with me, so I had to kind of 'start over' on my own.\n\nSo this is my advice based on my own limited experience.\n\nYou have to \"date yourself\" for a bit and figure out what you want / like, etc.  Forget dating for a bit because you need to get back to a place where you can trust people, but not through a romantic relationship.  Partner, kids, etc., can all wait a few years.  Don't focus on it, just focus on yourself.\n\nIt's hard, but you have to give up on this woman and take control of your future.  Think of it this way... our 'core' adult lives (good health, ability to travel, do what we want, etc.) are what - age 20 to 75 maybe?  That's a 55 year year span, and you're only 14 years into that.  You still have 75% of that time left to **live** for yourself and do what you want.  Don't let this person take any more of that time away from you.\n\nForget the computer, TV., etc.  They're just material things.  *Our single most valuable asset is our time* and she has taken enough of that from you.  You don't have to \"get over her\" - it's impossible to get over somebody when you focus on it.  Instead, you have to remove her from your life **to spite her** and take back your life.\n\nYou should start a journal (if you don't already), and absolutely force yourself to do a daily, positive affirmation.  It's lame as hell, and it'll sound that way.  But really force yourself to come up with a list of things that are going well, or stuff you like.  \"I had an amazing breakfast today\" or \"the weather was perfect\", etc.  You need to find some positives to let your mind focus on.",

It must be really hard owning all of the pain and when the dark starts . Your tears will fall. Your heart shattered. It's really lonely . You still have the courage to continue life and that's what matters right now.  Can you move out there . Leave that kind of person because the longer you stay . The longer yourself will be broken into pieces. Save yourself. There's your family .your parents ,siblings ,and good friends there for you . You may feel ashamed leaving them before and not talking with them but once you go back . I know it will be a little hard but at least they are there with you.  I don't force you to go back . It takes a lot of time to do that but I hope you will consider it. And even how much you hurt I still hope you still believe in Love. You still live with love within Yourself. Go out from your zone that will never comfort you .The importance in life even how hard we feel in pain, is the presence of you in every situation .

This WILL work out for you, you\u2019re almost there. Maybe some changes in job and lifestyle first, but you\u2019re well on your way to the life you\u2019ve always imagined.
