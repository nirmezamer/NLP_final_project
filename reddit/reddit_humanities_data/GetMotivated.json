Auto-moderator will now remove any YouTube links that are posted. They are usually self-promotion and/or spam and do not contribute to the theme of r/GetMotivated\n\nCrossposts are banned for the reason being that they are seen as very low effort, used by karma farming accounts, and encourage spam, as any time some motivational post is posted on another sub, this sub can get inundated with crossposts.\n\nSo, crossposts and YouTube links are now officially banned from r/GetMotivated\n\nHowever, We encourage you to Upload your motivational videos directly to the subreddit, using Reddit's [video posting tool](https://www.redditinc.com/blog/video-is-coming-to-reddit/). You can upload up to 15-minute videos as MP4s this way.\n\nThanks, Stay Motivated!",

            "Can we revise the rules around posting links? \n\nIronically, there's a repost up that was posted by a karma-farming account, but when I try to post a link of the original in the comments, the automod deletes my comment claiming it's a crosspost.",
            "How do I post longer videos? I was about to post an old Tony Robbins video from 1989 that is really good, but it is 18 minutes long.",
            " Glad to hear it! It can be frustrating when a subreddit gets flooded with irrelevant content, and hopefully this change will help keep the focus on actual motivational content. Are there any other changes or improvements that you think could be made to the sub",
            "Probably the best decision ever made in this community :D",
            "Oh poo, and I found a great video from someone else I thought might have helped some folks.\n\nIs there a \"Get advance approval from the mod team\" exception available?",
            "That's fantastic news! It can be aggravating when a subreddit becomes overrun with unrelated stuff; ideally, this update will help preserve the focus on actual motivational content. Are there any additional adjustments or improvements you think the sub may benefit from?",
            "why does linking to somebody's profile in the comments count as a crosspost?",
            "Yes, spammers can definitely ruin a good thing. It's great to see that the mod team is taking steps to keep this subreddit focused on genuine motivational content. Do you have any other suggestions for how to keep this community spam-free and on track?",
            "I completely agree with you. It's important to have focused and relevant content on any subreddit. Regarding the comment on more user engagement, have you thought about having a weekly thread for users to share their own personal motivational success stories?"

        "content": "If I could only share one lesson with the world, it would be this.\n\nProcrastination is an emotional problem.\n\nYou don\u2019t put things off because you\u2019re lazy, unmotivated, or lack discipline.\n\nWe put things off because it\u2019s the easiest way to cope with the negative feelings caused by a daunting task. And one of the most common obstacles we face is fear. So, here\u2019s why fear could be holding you back - and some actionable steps you can take to overcome it.\n\n1) Name your fear\n\nThere could be many reasons why fear is limiting your productivity. Perhaps you\u2019re scared of getting something wrong in front of your new boss, so you just ignore the task completely. Maybe you\u2019re confused about where to begin.\n\nYou could even be scared of success - what if my new business takes off and my life changes completely? Whatever your situation, first you need to work out exactly what it is that\u2019s holding you back.\n\n2) Reduce your fear\n\nEasier said than done, right? When we\u2019re scared, we tend to jump to the worst possible conclusions. This is called catastrophising - what if I make a mistake and lose my job? What if I fail this exam and my life is ruined?\n\nInstead of letting your mind come up with all sorts of disasters, you need to try to refocus your thoughts in reality.\n\nI like to ask myself this: Will it matter in ten minutes? In ten weeks? In ten years?\n\nIf you really fail an exam, you might feel pretty rubbish for a while. But in ten weeks time you\u2019ll have studied more and worked with your teachers and you\u2019ll be feeling a lot more confident, ready for a resit. And in ten years time you\u2019ll barely remember that you failed at all.\n\n3) Overcome your fear\n\nOne of the best ways to overcome your fears is to increase your confidence. One of my favorite methods for doing this is called The Batman Effect.\n\nBasically, you need to imagine yourself as someone else - someone you admire, who\u2019s brave, confident, and capable.\n\nPerhaps you picture yourself to be a famous writer, or your favorite singer, or a billionaire CEO.\n\nHow would they feel about the job at hand? They\u2019d tackle it head on, and feel good too. When you sit down to a daunting task, you\u2019re not doing it, it\u2019s your superpowered alter ego.\n\nDon\u2019t let fear hold you back from doing the things that matter the most to you.",

            "A more nuanced version of this is actually what my therapist talks with me about. At first i also thought nah i just proceastinate because im lazy. Fear is not always obvious",
            "For me sometimes its a feeling of god Im so sick of doing the same thing day after day, Id rather not do that report or those slides because its boring \n\nSometimes its fear but I have a lot of confidence if I put my mind to it it will come out well. Its just boring a lot of times",
            "This is good advice, but sometimes it really is just being lazy. What I have found is doing the job for your \"future self.\" This has really helped me over come my procrastination. For instance, I used to leave the dishes for the morning, but now I do them right away after dinner and the next morning when I go into the kitchen I'm very happy that I did them the night before. This goes for everything. I could get gas after work today or I can get it tomorrow before work - I will always get it today bc that way it's out of my head completely and I'm not inconvenienced by it. Basically when some job comes up I do it as quickly as I can. I do make a mental note of what I did the day before and kinda consciously thank my old self for doing that for \"future self.\" Kinda corny I know, but it really works for me and I hope it works for someone out there too. Give it a try.",
