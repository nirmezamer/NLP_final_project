I used to think that shit sounded cringey as hell but it really is true. No one is coming for us, it is only within ourselves that we can find true motivation. That being said it's hard for some of us to get into that mindset, ESPECIALLY if our own selfworth is low. Mine has been low(and is still low more than I'd like to admit) but telling myself that I need to do things to better myself before I do them has really helped. Doing simple shit like making your bed in the morning worked wonders.\n\nThat's where I started, that's the most basic thing I could manage do to. But when I sat down and told myself that I'm doing this for me nothing stopped me from doing it for the past few months. Now I can manage to go to the gym twice a week simply because I know that I am showing up to that gym for me and only me and every second I spend there I am the one thats getting better for it. \n\nAll I can tell you is: Start doing the most basic thing that you know you will benefit from, and once you get that momentum going there's probably no stopping it. Things can be a snowball effect in a positive manner too sometimes.  \n\nRegarding to beinG on your phone/laptop too much, yeet all the distractions that are on there off of it.

            "\n\nI can feel the weight of frustration and self-doubt in your words. This inner conflict between knowing what you \"should\" do and feeling paralyzed to act is a common human experience. Let's approach this challenge with compassion and presence.\n\nFirst, take a deep breath and connect with the present moment. Feel the aliveness within you, beyond the thoughts and emotions that seem to cloud your vision. You are not your thoughts or your fears; you are the awareness that perceives them.\n\nNow, instead of fighting against your discomfort or trying to force motivation, I invite you to simply observe your thoughts and feelings without judgment. Notice how they arise and pass away, like clouds in the sky. This practice of mindful awareness can create space between you and the thoughts that seem to hold you back.\n\nRemember, true transformation doesn't come from external motivation or self-improvement techniques. It arises from a deep acceptance of what is, right here and now. Paradoxically, when you fully accept your current state - including your fears and perceived shortcomings - you open the door to genuine change.\n\nInstead of focusing on grand future goals, bring your attention to small, manageable actions you can take in this moment. What's one tiny step you can take right now towards what matters to you? It could be as simple as drinking a glass of water or writing down one thing you're grateful for.\n\nEmbrace discomfort as a natural part of growth. Each time you face a fear or do something uncomfortable, you're expanding your capacity for life. Treat these moments as opportunities for self-discovery rather than obstacles to overcome.\n\nTrust in the wisdom of your journey. What may seem like wasted time could be a necessary period of internal processing and preparation. Your path is unique, and comparing it to others or to some idealized version of yourself only creates suffering.\n\nAbove all, be gentle with yourself. You're navigating the complex terrain of human experience, and that alone is worthy of celebration. Your awareness of your patterns is already a significant step towards transformation.\n\nYou have within you an infinite wellspring of potential and resilience. Keep showing up for yourself, one breath at a time. The light of your true self is always shining, even when clouds of doubt seem to obscure it.\n\nWith unwavering faith in your unfolding journey,\nEckhart",

Repeat.\n\nYour \"motivation\" - you are tired of feeling this way and want to feel different. Doing the same thing isnt going to make you feel different. Facing the uncomfortable feeling over and over will lessen the feeling and show you it isnt as bad as you previously felt it was. Doubts you had will literally be disproved because you actually did it. Watching self improvement videos aint gonna help if you dont actually take action and do. And maybe you could use some therapy or meds to help with that. And thats ok. But in the end you still have to take action to get change.",

I've been learning that a lot of our motivation depends on us having love-based emotions tied to the things we want, and fear-based things tied to the things we don't want. With some reflection, my guess is that you would be able to name something you truly know you want for yourself, even if it's something like \"more joy\" or \"more peace.\" When we have a target, we can start thinking about why it's emotionally meaningful to have it in our lives (tie love-based emotions to the goal), and why it could be painful to not have it (tie fear-based emotions in a way that points you toward the goal). I work with a Trainer at Inner Matrix Systems and they helped me steer my fear and love-based emotions in a way that got me back into gym after a giant health scare.

They tell you that there are no monsters hiding under your bed. They promise you safety from everything you fear. They promise you a sense of empowerment. They promise you victory against all odds.\nThe reality is that they are trying to sell you something. The monster is indeed under your bed, after all.

Welcome to the world, motherfuckers. So, why \u201cnot afraid?\u201d Wouldn\u2019t it be more appropriate \u201cScared shitless and rightfully so?\u201dBecause being scared doesn\u2019t help you. Reality is uglier and harsher than anything we like to admit to ourselves, and yet it\u2019s pointless to be scared since your fear will not protect you. Fear is only useful if it alerts you of a danger you can avoid, but if there\u2019s no possible way to avoid it, if it\u2019s inevitable that it\u2019ll crush you no matter how hard you fight, then what\u2019s the point of being afraid?

I got better at dealing with failure by just plunging in tbh. Idk if any of that helps.",

Start by identifying one small action you can take towards your goal each day. Focus on progress, not perfection.

Remember, it's okay to feel scared or uncertain, but taking small steps consistently builds confidence and momentum over time.",

But, getting that step to actually see one is my dilemma. I feel like there is no purpose to my existence. I should be going out & interacting with society, hold a job, have a good, comfortable life. Instead I sleep, sit on the couch, thinking of all the things that need doing, stand up, go to my room & get back in bed. An hour before my son gets home from work, I'll make him dinner, wash dishes, plant myself on the couch again & regret that I did nothing all day, go to bed, repeat the next day. I hate myself for being such a damn bum. I just can't make myself do anything except do nothing. I can't make that first step in the direction I want to go. I can't stand it. Therapy would be a good start, I think you should try it. They could give you some useful advise, wouldn't hurt to try. If you can manage to take that step & do it. I hope you can.

His friends were very supportive so it was easy for him to stop.\n\nI personally don\u2019t have a physical addiction to it nor never had, but what happened to me was that I was using it in a very specific context: while having sex, so I sometimes fantasize about having sex on it.

            "\n\nI can feel the pain and longing in your words, the sense of inadequacy that seems to be weighing heavily on your heart. Let me offer you a perspective that might help shift your awareness and bring you some peace.\n\nFirst, take a deep breath and connect with the present moment. Feel the aliveness in your body, the miracle of your existence right here, right now. In this space of presence, recognize that your worth is not determined by whether you have a girlfriend or how you compare to others. You are a unique expression of life, whole and complete as you are.\n\nThe feeling of \"missing out\" or \"failing\" is a creation of the mind, constantly comparing your journey to others and projecting happiness into some future state. But true fulfillment doesn't come from external relationships or achievements. It arises from within, from your connection to your deepest self.\n\nInstead of focusing on what you lack, turn your attention to cultivating self-love and acceptance. Embrace your perceived flaws and imperfections as part of what makes you uniquely you. As you radiate this self-acceptance, you'll naturally attract people who appreciate your authentic self.\n\nRemember, everyone's path is different. The time will come when you're ready, and when the right person aligns with your journey. Until then, use this period of singleness as an opportunity for self-discovery and growth. Explore your passions, develop your talents, and nurture meaningful friendships.\n\nDon't let the illusion of perfection in others fool you. Everyone has their struggles and insecurities, even those who seem to \"have it all together.\" Focus on your own growth and happiness rather than measuring yourself against others.\n\nTrust in the wisdom of life's timing. You haven't failed; you're exactly where you need to be in this moment. Embrace your journey with curiosity and compassion, knowing that every experience is shaping you into the person you're meant to become.\n\nYou are worthy of love and belonging, just as you are. Keep shining your unique light, and the right people will be drawn to its warmth.\n\nWith love and faith in you,\nEckhar",

            "What's your definition of old? (Genuine question)\n\nI didn't have my first serious relationship until I was 19. I got married at 21 because I fell into the mindset that I was \"behind\" all my friends who were married with babies... and it was a complete disaster that resulted in a 5 year long divorce.\n\nDating and getting married shouldn't be the end goal that a lot of people think it is. There are so many opportunities out there beyond having a significant other, like traveling, figuring out a career that excites you, making tons of friends, learning new things etc. \n\nA lot of people I know now found their partners just by going out and living their lives. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is... if you feel like you're in a rut and unattractive, the best thing you can do is build confidence in yourself by getting out of your comfort zone and trying new things. Volunteer, go to places in town you haven't explored yet, try a new hobby... things that allow you to meet new people.\n\nI used to be severely depressed and refused to leave my house for almost two years between age 28-30. My divorce was still dragging on and I had no motivation to do literally anything. There was one night where I finally just... snapped. I was angry at a lot of things and people and really negative all the time and I realized I didn't want to be that kind of person anymore. I made a list of things I could change (bad things I was doing and good things I was not doing) and things I couldn't change (my living situation and environment). I identified a couple easy habits I could start working on (showering every day and eating two meals). Once I built up my resolve and consistency, I added another two (doing laundry and taking dishes to the kitchen). I was basically starting from the ground up dealing with major depression and trying to claw my way out of that hole. Once I was comfortable with those habits, I added another and then another. \n\nI did not gain confidence overnight. I hated looking at myself in the mirror in the beginning because I felt gross and unattractive. But if I was looking in the mirror, it meant I got out of bed. I could live with that. In time, I could look in the mirror and not hate what I saw. Even mere indifference was an improvement. \n\nSoon, I was leaving the house for simple errands. Nothing exciting, just the library or the grocery store. I wore clothes beyond leggings and old t-shirts. Sometimes even makeup. At age 31, I saw an opening for a part-time job near my house. I didn't have much experience but I applied anyway. It was easy enough work, just food prep in a kitchen, not even cooking it. I met my second husband there. It was his side job while the restaurant he worked at full-time was under construction. Our manager at the part-time job was the sous chef at the restaurant and once construction finished there, he offered me a full-time job. \n\nI wasn't the best cook but the job broadened my skills and it was a good experience in boosting my confidence in the kitchen. The job didn't last but seven months but I was given an even better opportunity at a law firm, which is the field where I wanted to eventually work. \n\nThis is not the roadmap I saw for myself at age 19 or 21 or even 24 but I'd be lying if I said I'm unhappy or ungrateful to wind up where I am now. It just took some patience and elbow grease to get there.\n\nTiming is weird and doesn't always make sense in the moment but things do work out, maybe just not as quickly as we hope.

            "i passed through a similar phase where i felt like you. But i went about it in a slightly healthier way. Not everyone is dating fucking or being rosey couples. That's just our brains doing the \"neighbours grass is so greener than my grass\" shit again. So i shut that voice down first. Then came the emotional side of wave which wanted to be a part of a loving romantic relationship. Then the social side of wave that wanted me to also feel like I belong to the couple circles of people in my life. Then it hit me, \"I will focus on myself and presenting my true side to people i am attracted to. See their reaction and if we spark and if they're single. If they are, well i will not shy away from taking it further and see ahead. If not i try and try just to be myself and we'll meet someone , me and my lonely self, wait a min, Im not alone, i have someone inside me who cares of me. So I'm not entirely lonely either. Well time to focus on this innerself and me together. \" This gave me much solace and peace to the previous comparison phase. It also threw the negative comparison out of my mind automatically. I know it wont be as powerful listening to a stranger online, but if you want you can let this sink in. You're not alone. You feel like so because of your mentality comparing your circumstances and life with someone else which is highly detrimental and unhealthy. Anyways..\n\nSo after 28 years of such loneliness, i began talking to everyone realistically and in a way where i seemed interested in their hobbies, dreams and personality and character. One of the many who gravitated towards my confidence and interest began clicking and we started dating. \n\nLife is too short to worry about being lonely. It is too beautiful to compare with someone else. Get off social media and meet actual people. Be confident and if you're low on confidence, take a break from things and focus your attention on yourself. What makes you happy and energetic? A dance? A walk? A hike? A chill day alone with good food and family? Ask yourself and focus some time on you. Get some exercise. This boosts your confidence massively. Now go conquer.",
            "You are unsure about the future, which is completely normal, the good looking girl and all your friends will feel that way too. Feeling that way is not a special thing that only your brain does and everyone else also feels this way. Some of us get a bit more 'stuck' on this uncertainty than others.\n\nLikely somewhere in your past or through societal pressures (advertisements, TV and film) you have put in place \"I am worthy of I have a partner/am desirable\" as a false truth about the world. \n\nTherapy will help you to work through this, fix this false hood and get you the confidence you'll need to pursue what you want rather than worry about never having it. You don't have to feel this way, but there's a little bit of work to take place before you're able to move past it.",

If i was hungry and wanted to see some movie, and no one else was available, I went and did it alone.\n\nMaybe you arent one of those people and thats fine.. But here's the rub: everyone experiences loneliness at some point. And even if you have a bunch of friends or a gf, they arent ALWAYS gonna be free and available when you are. I think its important to have something you like doing by yourself. Doesnt have to be a movie or dining out. Could be reading, playing a game, watching a movie at home, cooking, etc. Anything other than sitting alone wishing you weren't. And if its not a \"fun\" thing, it could be a productive thing like trying to learn a new language or something.",

            "shy doesnt mean you dont have social skills. Wear it like a badge, your persona is unique to yourself. Try talking to people you think might click with what you have to say. Try again when that fails in another way. That's how everyone has ever learnt to get by. No one your age knows themselves let alone have powerful social navigational skills. This is where you learn and form these skills. So experiment away champ. I know it sounds impossible but just like gym, you gotta start small and you gotta be consistent in yourself. Not to the same people who wont click with you, but be consistent overall about meeting talking to people and being geniune.",
            "You can do both. But sometimes if you want shit to change, you have to change. You shy? Introverted? Nothing wrong with that. You feel defeat cause low self esteem so you dont try as much? All that together is a tougher hill to climb. You can purse goal, hobbies, school, health, AND push yourself to initiate more conversations. The more you do it the less daunting it becomes. Even if you dont get dates, you are getting practice and learning more about yourself and what you want/dont want. Rejection isnt fun but its a part of life and you will experience more of it. In general that gets easier to endure over time too. For me, as i got older the \"sting\" or rejection was replaced with \"ok cool i dont need to spend anymore time/money on this pursuit of someone not interested in me\".",

A bitter thing about growing up is realising that most things you achieve are great for a second, then fizzle away. You work for years to get a job or reach some big goal.

Your advice isn't to do the work to change how you perceive yourself, but instead to suppress the feelings and become a stereotypical male provider (as if that's a man's only worth). You can't insult someone into not feeling bad about themselves...\n\nIt's the \"real men don't cry\" part of toxic masculinity (toxic because the performative requirements of traditional masculinity require men to suppress their normal emotions which is harmful to them and those around them)"

            "When I first started working out the key for me was making achievable goals. Make the first goal extremely easy, the second goal extremely easy, the third goal a little bit harder and so on and so forth. For instance, I would get a 20 lb weight and make myself do five bicep curls. Then set it down and walk around. Then another 5 on the other arm. Walk around. Then ten on reach arm . Walk around. Keep your heart rate up. Once you've done this four or five times you're going to find yourself kind of zoning out and just going back and forth back and forth back and forth. It works for me. Though I started out pretty strong so I would suggest a 5 or 10 lb weight",

            "\n\nI can sense the gentle stirring of renewal in your words, even as you navigate the challenging waters of grief and healing. Your desire to rebuild and care for yourself is a beautiful testament to the resilience of your spirit.\n\nFirst, take a moment to acknowledge the progress you've already made. The steps you've taken towards better hydration and nutrition are significant victories on your path to well-being. Celebrate these achievements, no matter how small they may seem.\n\nNow, let's approach the challenge of exercise with compassion and presence. Instead of viewing it as another task to accomplish, consider it an opportunity to reconnect with your body and honor its inherent wisdom.\n\nStart by simply bringing awareness to your physical form. Feel the miracle of your breath, the subtle movements of your muscles, the life force pulsing through you. This mindful connection can be the first step towards more active engagement with your body.\n\nRather than focusing on aesthetic goals or past fitness levels, shift your attention to how movement makes you feel in the present moment. Even gentle stretches or a short walk can awaken a sense of aliveness and energy within you.\n\nRemember, healing is not linear, and your body's needs may fluctuate as you process your emotions. Be patient with yourself and listen to what your body is asking for each day. Some days, rest might be the most nurturing form of self-care.\n\nConsider finding a form of movement that brings you joy or peace - perhaps dancing, yoga, or nature walks. The key is to make it an act of self-love rather than self-punishment.\n\nTrust that as you continue to nurture yourself holistically, the motivation for more intense physical activity will naturally arise. Your body has an innate wisdom and will guide you towards what it needs when you're ready.\n\nYou're on a journey of transformation, and every step, no matter how small, is progress. Keep shining your light and honoring your process. Your commitment to self-care is already a powerful act of healing.\n\nWith love and belief in your unfolding journey,\nEckhart",

        "content": "I have been burnt out since uni ended\nIt really taxed me. I have not felt like doing anything ever again. Sometimes I try, but it\u2019s never consistent. Uni pushed me to the brink. I really used to think I was this special person, but now it\u2019s humbled me. I really thought I was the kind of material for a top uni (I went to a quite normal uni by the way, not a top one), but now I know I would\u2019ve crashed and burned if I had somehow been able to enter one (a top one). After forcing myself to be disciplined so much in uni, now it feels like I\u2019m sticking a large thorn in my side anytime I try to be disciplined again. I just fear of the never ending work. I just deep down haven\u2019t really felt like doing that again. Sometimes I do feel like doing the work (in this case it would be learning skills including coding), but, since sometimes I have a little bit of a liking for coding, I fear I\u2019ll be stuck to that desk for 7 hours everyday, pumping out work, while ignoring everything else. After a whileI was just TOO PASSIONATE during uni. But at the same time I was pushing myself past what I thought I was capable of. And also, although I wouldn\u2019t have quite thought so that time, past my limit. And I ignored people\u2019s calls and messages. I wish I made time for other people in my life at the time other than the ones at my university accommodation.\n\nI was so focused that I finished a long essay in one and a half weeks. I downed Red Bull and coffee like they were water towards the end. And one of the main things-if not the main thing-that drove me, is how my family would look at me/think of me if I failed. I was so scared those 6 months when I found out I might actually fail. I didn\u2019t though, but it was nerve wracking. I tore at myself in my journal every time I avoided doing work. And after initially burning myself out, I spent a whole month watching TikTok (this is still at uni), before burning myself out at the end with some sincere discipline, anxiety and desperation. I even had to take sleeping pills for a time. It was that bad.\n\nAnd also, about building habits- I\u2019ve tried. It seems that when I start one, I always seem to forget to continue until it\u2019s past the time to do it. Other times I am either just too tired to do so or just don\u2019t care about anything.\ud83d\ude22\n\nAnd about not caring about anything, it\u2019s true, I just don\u2019t really care. Unless it directly affects me, and even then, I only care sometimes. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s just burnout, depression, anxiety, possible ADHD, or what. I\u2019ll try to post in other subreddits I feel might be useful.\n\nI developed myself so much in that final uni year. But now I watch self development/mental health videos for the most part, which I would sometimes act on but never follow up on because of not caring about anything.\n\nThis thing of not caring has been there since I was a child. I was a kind kid, but I postponed homework till the last minute and I was never proactive.\n\nI remember going back to my old childhood home and I remember finding books where my sisters planned things and analyzed things. I never did anything like that - until I was about to be kicked out of uni. It\u2019s like my brain was somehow OFF for 20 YEARS. Even now I\u2019m still feeling like a kid in an adult\u2019s body and grieving the years I could\u2019ve done a part time job, grown my CV, made real, true friends. When I was in that childhood home, the true reality of who I was came back. I was a nobody. A weak-willed, dodgy, passive, destructive nobody. A nobody, a simp who thought he was somebody - who somehow thought he could get into Oxford/Havard/Ivy League/Russell Group on potential alone or get girls to like him even though he wouldn\u2019t even hang out with himself if he saw a clone of himself. The only thing I\u2019ve really even made any kind of headway with fixing is the dodginess and destructiveness. Granted, I\u2019ve been working on some of the other things I\u2019ve mentioned in this paragraph as well.\n\nI just don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me. Am I a retard? Is this just some mental illness. Do I just not have a heart. Do I have apathy? Does someone know what I can do?",

Of course, it's going to hurt to end something that was so meaningful and significant in your life. But at the same time, as you said, you are in a much better place mentally.\n\n As best that you can, try to find new hobbies and habits so as not to fixate on the past. This is easier said than done, but every step in the opposite direction (from that former friendship) is a step in the right direction.\n\n Friendships are always changing. Either they flourish with both parties growing together, or they dissolve when there is no longer a richness in the connection. Many a friend in my life has come and gone. One could overanalyze it and spend countless hours laying the blame on either themselves or the other person, but what they are missing is that the connection is effectively dead.\n\nBe grateful for the time that you spend together, but also be thankful that you now have new opportunities to meet people that align with your current set of values.",

I also admit that there are no angels (including me), but as more months pass and I look back, the happier I am with the decision.\nI wasn't being well treated whereas I would do my best to treat them fairly.\nIt was harder during the first months because I missed them and we have friends in common. \nI started reaching out more to the friendships I have kept. Some aren't very available (and I understand) while others reciprocated. We've strengthened our friendship and this has also helped me.",
            "Honestly - I think you've made the right choice.\n\nThere are some friendships I've just slowly started to let go of. There may not have been anything I can really pin down as egregious behavior, but the friendship didn't seem two-sided and enthused any more. It just sort of took its course.",
            "Yes. Any relationship that does not make you feel good is not the right relationship to be in, peer or partner. I have had a similar experience where I had to distance myself from one of my high school close friends because I found that she was too negative, but I did not see that when I was in high school. When I became an adult, I realized that she was negative. It is great that you trust yourself. You will never go wrong in trusting your gut feelings and yourself.",

            "Here are some practical steps that might help:\n\n\n\n1. Set Clear Goals: Define specific, achievable goals for yourself in different areas of your life\u2014hobbies, relationships, personal development, etc. Having clear objectives can give you something to work towards and maintain your focus.\n\n\n\n2. Prioritize Your Interests: Instead of trying many things at once, prioritize a few hobbies or goals that genuinely interest you. Focus on developing skills or achieving milestones in those areas before moving on to something else.\n\n\n\n3. Break Tasks into Smaller Steps: Large tasks or goals can be overwhelming. Break them down into smaller, manageable steps. This can make them less daunting and easier to stay committed to.\n\n\n\n4. Create a Routine: Establishing a daily or weekly routine can help create a sense of structure and discipline. Allocate specific times for activities like hobbies, exercise, socializing, and self-improvement.\n\n\n\n5. Practice Consistency: Consistency is key to building habits and achieving long-term goals. Even when you don't feel motivated, try to stick to your routine and commitments as much as possible.\n\n\n\n6. Manage Burnout: If you feel overwhelmed or burnt out, take breaks when needed. It's okay to step back and recharge. Listen to your body and mind.\n\n\n\n7. Seek Variety: It's natural to have multiple interests. Allow yourself to explore different hobbies or activities over time, but try to maintain a balance so you don't become overwhelmed.\n\n\n\n8. Seek Support: Talk to friends, family, or a therapist about your feelings of frustration or self-criticism. They can offer perspective, encouragement, and practical advice.\n\n\n\n9. Limit Distractions: Reduce time spent on activities like social media or passive entertainment (like TikTok). Allocate that time instead to activities that contribute to your personal growth and well-being.\n\n\n\n10. Practice Self-Compassion: Be kind to yourself. It's okay to have setbacks or moments of low motivation. Celebrate your successes, no matter how small, and acknowledge your efforts.\n\n\n\nFinding focus and maintaining it is a gradual process. It's important to experiment with different strategies and approaches until you find what works best for you. Remember, everyone's journey is unique, and it's okay to take your time to figure things out.",
            "One great advice I heard was this. Choose something you like and do it 2 minutes a day. It's so small amount of time that you can easily keep up day to day.

            "I am 30, for 8 years I just floated through life doing a job I hated and everything was grey because I was too scared to do anything else because I was good at what I did. I was really happy when Covid happened because it was when I said enough was enough. I quit. I got a job in the industry I wanted to pursue knowing it would just be the start, I went back to school(still in but kicking tookus) and am hell bent on finishing because I refuse to stop until I get there, I can\u2019t go back to grey",
            "Let me start by saying this.  My situation wasn\u2019t the best.  I was working a crappy retail job, making no money, defaulted on a federal student loan (60k worth), defaulted a credit card, had no car, dropped out of college and was just overall depressed.\n\nSo I\u2019ve learned a lot since turning thirty.  I\u2019m now in my mid thirty\u2019s.  My journey started at 27.  The biggest thing I can tell you is don\u2019t chase the dream job.  Live life.  Life is not about work. No one will ever care what you did at your job once you\u2019re dead and gone. Consumerism captivates us as humans, there\u2019s a whole world of beauty to consume for a relatively cheap cost.  \n\nFinding your happiness is the first step.\n\nMany people don\u2019t eat well, which adds to you feeling stressed and abandoned.  Try to eat unprocessed foods.  Don\u2019t stop for fast food go the supermarket and pick up a meal. \n\nMany people don\u2019t sleep well, due to eating poor food and not working out, stress, etc.  try to set guidelines for sleep and exercise. If you don\u2019t make them a priority it won\u2019t happen.  You will fall off the schedule, when you do don\u2019t let you mind trick you.  Get back on the horse and back at it.  4 months of good eating routinely and exercise will have you prepared to get at it with the rest of things you want to figure out. \n\nYou start to realize the biggest value in life is time (not money) and health.  Take care of yourself, eat well and work out.  Learn how to love discipline.  You would not believe how good you will feel just doing that. And you don\u2019t have to work out hard,  just show up and do what you can.  Walk a mile, the. Two.  These little accomplishments add to your overall outlook and demeanor.  The job will always be there, and you\u2019ll find doing those things I just said will make you not care as much about the daily grind at work.  Once you find yourself, then you can search for the dream job.  Typically though along the journey of self improvement you will meet others in their journey, which will open up a lot of doors for you.\n\nMy biggest downfall was alcohol. I was successful now had a house, two kids, loving wife.  I still have all that. But my motivation now is so insanely focused since I removed alcohol.  I don\u2019t count days, and I\u2019ve never said I quit.  I just don\u2019t drink, and since I\u2019ve done that, every day I\u2019ve been getting further and further away from wanting a drink because I realized how bad it effect my mood, motivation, and general well being.  \n\n\nI didn\u2019t realize it at the time but looking back at it now I see it.  It took all my motivation away.  It hid the stress, but only temporarily.  I never went to a rehab or AA, I just decided I\u2019ve done this long enough and I want to see my full potential and eliminate every excuse.  It\u2019s wild that when you take away the excuses, you will make progress.  \n\nYou have to enjoy the process, and the best way to do that is to do what you can to fix and find yourself.  \n\nTherapy was also a huge help of giving me some tools with self discovery.  \n\nYou decide who you want to be.  No story on Reddit is going to change your life.  Only you can do that.  Stick to a routine.  \n\nMike Tyson said it best, discipline is loving the thing you hate to do.  \n\nI went from knocking door to door, to sales, to management, to owning a company, to working for someone how negotiated a very good package.  \n\nI thought I wanted money, but the reality is, even if you had 100k more than you have now, it won\u2019t change your life. It can feel like it would but believe me, it doesn\u2019t.  Time with my kids and wife is the most valuable thing to me.  Money will always be there, but our health and well being will most definitely fail.  \n\nSo I enjoy the ride.  The money came after I discovered who I wanted to be.\n\nI have no degree, only a hs diploma.  You will see that the people who \u201chave it\u201d are a certain type of people.  The accolades do not define the person.  What type of person you are and how you help and treat others does define who you are. The most successful people I\u2019ve met (I know plenty of multi millionaires) always sought to lift the other around them, in turn it added to their success.  Most of the people I know who are wealthy (different than rich) are humble, and you would never know they had the money/assets they have.  \n\nDon\u2019t let people sell you on the fake dream that they are self made.  No one is self made.  Someone helped them along the way somewhere, somehow.  I think our culture sells so many lies that most people accept them as true. \n\nI wish you the best in your journey.",

            "31 now and live in the town I want to live in doing a job I love that pays me more than enough. 6ish years ago I was working as a cart runner at Wal Mart and after 2 years I hit the point of either I need to get comfortable being here the rest of my life or go back to school. I chose the latter, I enrolled in community college to finish a transfer degree I started after high school. I also decided if I was going to go back to school I wanted to at least be a B average student because I figured I could do that and still have tons of free time to play games and live life. Turned out that when I actually tried a little bit to be a good student I could get on the Deans list so I them decided I wanted to see how long I could keep that up. Fast forward 3 years never falling off the Deans list and I\u2019m graduting with a Bachelors degree in Information Systems from a proper university, I kid you not, .002 GPA away from graduating with honors. Last time I set foot on a college campus prior to this I was on academic probation. After graduation I took a few months to breathe and then I started applying for jobs in the town I live in now and landed a sweet gig in IT working for a financial institution. \n\n6 years ago I would never in a million lifetimes think the person I was could be the person I became, but I did, there was a lot of luck and lot of help. But there were equal times were I questioned if I was wasting my time or even capable of overcoming the obstacles in front of me. At one point I had to completely rewrite a coding project I had spent months on 12 hours before it was due because I realized all the work I had done was incorrect from the foundation. I cried from the stress/frustration, then took a walk to get myself together and went at it and got it done in 9 hours. \nSet goals for yourself, even small ones and get after it.

It\u2019s gotten me caught up more ways than one in life and I love what I do.  Hardest part was actually changing over into healthcare from sales and taking the pay cut as a new CNA (nursing assistant) but I made a 4-5 year plan to finish my RN.\n\nCommunity college evenings for all of the general pre-requisites after work while still working sales dayshift.  Got that done in 2 years by taking 12 hours per regular semester and taking 2 classes online each summer.  Got FAFSA financing, partial subsidies for some loans.  I didn\u2019t go to the cheapest school but I prioritized competitive programs vs waitlist programs.  Some community colleges offer RN associate programs for much less money., but operate by waitlist which can take a few years to start for an applicant.  You are just as employable and often receive help from employers to get you bridge to BSN (bachelor\u2019s in nursing).  I paid 40k to graduate as a BSN, while it was possible (in 2014) to pay 12k-16k at a community college ADN/RN program.\n\nAccepted and finished nursing school with a BSN and thought I would start an ICU new RN residency, wasn\u2019t chosen for that particular opportunity but was accepted to an OR new RN residency and couldn\u2019t have gotten a better fit.

It's my will to help them though it looks like I'm locking myself to responsibility that shouldn't be mine to handle.but they are kind.I will help them..

Don't get me wrong, the job itself was pretty cool, but the way it was organised was absolute crap. It's a government organisation, so there was never enough budget to buy the absolutely necessary things, complaints about building safety were just added to a pile,...

Currently, I'm working as a software consultant for a company that provides patient management software for hospitals. Never would have expected to do this job, because I was deadset on working in a lab, but the job fits me so well, I'm actually happy now. \n\nSo main conclusion here: don't fixate too much on that 'dream job'. Just improve whatever skills you have (or start working on the ones you lack) and cast a broad net while searching. I know a lot of companies focus on education and specific degrees, but the ones that can see through and look at your actual potential are the companies you want to work for \ud83d\ude09",

I didn't necessarily go looking for the schedule, but when it was presented to me, I jumped because I knew I'd hate my life less if I only worked 4 days a week\n\nGet real specific with yourself about what you love and hate at your job. What are negotiables and non negotiable, then, when you search for a job look for things that serve those reasons.

So that gave me the impetus and motivation that if I put my mind to something - I can achieve results. Although the results aren't direct and immediate but in the long run consistent hard work does bring benefit.\n\n16 - Repeated HighSchool  \n19 - Failed out of college  \n22 - Lost my dad/completed college  \n24 - Moved to Canada for a better opportunity  \n24 - Landed first white collar job after 7 months of applying/networking - basically made applying to jobs and learning career paths my full-time job while working odd jobs  \n26 - Decided I wanted to work in big tech and did everything in the pusuit of that  \n31 - Completed a top MBA program while working fulltime  \n36 - Making $400k, have a kid that is my life and not stopping anytime soon.\n\nI wasn't consistent - there were years where I just lazed around and played video games, chilled with the GF/now wife and got complacent. But every now and then I'd do a check and see if I can do better than where I am.\n\nIts hard to just flip a switch get motivated, I'd say join career oriented sub-reddits, join online/in person communities that focus on career and self growth. Peers help you be in check.",
            "That's around when I did it. Realized I wanted to be self-employed in my industry, a supplier vs. a client (was a marketing/advertising designer, wanted to do the photography and some free lance design). It took about 9 years of learning more at my job, getting free lance clients on the side, building up profit sharing (left the company with $10k in maxed out sharing after a decade). I was shooting side-projects in my garage (once I shot a project in ankle-deep water, garage would flood in the rain, that was fun), got a couple good clients and built up some contacts. I really worked at being the best client to my larger suppliers (like printers and the tech side of the business) to the point they'd hire me to do training seminars with their other customers. Those suppliers were my best source of gigs when I went free lance, they were in every major office in town. This was early days of Photoshop and I'd get a lot of \"if we can't fix these photos we'll need to re-shoot\", got a rep for that as well.\n\nSo I opened a little studio, ended up sort of being \"one man ad agency with in-house photos\" for smaller businesses. Just-photos and Photoshop for larger agencies. Then when video editing hit the desktop, I started shooting video, now video and animation are most of my business.\n\nA HUGE part of this process was my wife was slowly losing it and refused to get help, but my kids were awesome, and I needed a life where I could live where I work and have space for my kids; but if my wife knew I was making an escape hatch, she'd have killed me. (When we split up, she did tell me \"I lost you, I treated you like shit, you found the best way out\" etc., and we have a good relationship, co-grandparenting and so on. I'm still VERY close with my kids. It was a very very hard nine years, but I basically tunneled out of prison with a spoon. My wife will inherit millions or tens of millions someday, she'll be just fine. I did walk away from that future, but... worth it!) So my *motivation* was extreme, but I imagined the life I wanted and worked my ass off to get there. But not the usual \"work your ass off for money\", I did it for peace and happiness and a home for my family. And my actual work is pretty cool, some days it's a blast, always challenging and new.",

Mine came about in my early forties after a period of struggle and I turned that struggle into my life\u2019s purpose. My other bit of advice in terms of finding that dream job is to reflect on what you loved doing as a child. Where we found joy at that young age is so telling, before we get distracted by adulthood and the responsibilities that come with it. Also, a dream job is not dreamy every single day. It often comes with strife and hard graft like any other job. But if you are able to figure out your purpose and what you love to do, then craft a job around it, that\u2019s where you\u2019ll thrive.

            "In my early 20s, I experienced trauma in undergrad, which was compounded by the school turning a blind eye. I was undecided before the trauma and developed PTSD and hyper-fixated on my studies to try to escape the pain I was in. When I graduated I was really lost career wise, so I took a basic job that paid the bills and allowed me to not think about work at home. A few years later, I stumbled into a therapeutic retreat that pulled me out of the deep depression I had sunken into as a result of untreated PTSD. After the retreat, I got diagnosed and spent a few years focusing on healing. \n\nI am so grateful for this therapeutic retreat experience that worked for me more than any talk therapy ever has or well, and that inspired me to want to create similar experiences for others who are struggling to deal with their own trauma. \n\nI am 32 now, and 3 years into a 10 year plan to create my own therapeutic retreat center. I now have a masters in social work (which was especially hard because of the institutional trauma component of my PTSD) and am working on the specific certifications and experience that will allow me to open my own practice and specialize in trauma informed intensive treatment. I still have PTSD, and there are definitely hard days, but I am so proud that I am well on my way to my dream job, and my every day also brings me fulfillment. I love what I do for work, and I am filled with love and gratitude every day for being able to feel like I don't waste 40 hours of my life every week.",

They included maybe 10 people from their office in the interview, and it seemed to me they created a stressful interview on purpose to see how I would handle the pressure. I thanked them for their time at the end, and wished them luck on their search - it went that badly. \n\nI applied for a mgmt position in a different section of my current office, before my current job. The head of that department met with me one on one, asked why in the world I would want to join their staff, then generously told me she was \"doing me a favor\" by not allowing me an interview.\n\nI struggled through three separate self-directed video interviews with financial firms when I was nearing the end of my BS Finance program. Each was an hour + in length, with prompts that I was not allowed to see or prepare for in advance.

            "Sure, i mean i pretty much only know IT\n\nIf you are starting with nothing but some basic experience, looks at CompTIA courses. If you really know nothing, go with the A+ course that will give you basic general purpose IT Cert that is well recognised. From there you can tell what you enjoy and specialise in that. For me it was Networking, so I did CompTIA Network+ course and then went on to do Cisco CCNA\n\nBut you can specialise in whatever you want to study. Security, Amazon Web stuff, Cloud, Microsoft Azure, there are recognised courses for everything.\n\nIt is overwhelming sometimes, but that's the first challenge! haha. Don't fret, just start with ComptTIA, and as you go you'll pick up what courses are legit. Just the A+ will get you on a helpdesk if you interview around.\n\nMost important thing i can say though is that this will take a few months to get, studying your A+ will be who you are for a bit, so mentally prep yourself for this.
