There will be a tab with a little pencil that says, \" USER FLAIR PREVIEW\". Click that and separate tab should pop up. It will ask you to pick your logo and add in some text. \n\nPlease note, using the app does not always work. This is not an sub issue, but it can be an issue with Reddit.\n\nPlease click on the link to see a picture explanation. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n [Click me!](https://imgur.com/a/Bw6gExm) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you,\n\n\\-Audi Mod Team",
