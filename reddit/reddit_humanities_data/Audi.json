There will be a tab with a little pencil that says, \" USER FLAIR PREVIEW\". Click that and separate tab should pop up. It will ask you to pick your logo and add in some text. \n\nPlease note, using the app does not always work. This is not an sub issue, but it can be an issue with Reddit.\n\nPlease click on the link to see a picture explanation. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n [Click me!](https://imgur.com/a/Bw6gExm) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you,\n\n\\-Audi Mod Team",

            "I think it all comes down to interior space for that choice, and looks. So much else is the same. Id imagine the TT is more nimble but maybe not, what the RS3 just accomplished at the nurburgring is insane. I personally like the look of the RS3 and the extra space is critical for me but I love both."

Should I assume that means it does not have any engine problems if it was checked by Audi specialists? Should I let it go or go for it? Need someone else\u2019s opinion. Thanks \ud83d\ude05\n",

            "I'm pretty sure the 09 cabriolet has the better (IMO) 2.0t FSI with a timing belt and not the first gen TFSI with the notorious timing chain and timing chain tensioner failure. The biggest problems as someone else has mentioned is definitely the cam follower and the oil pump, but I have yet to see an oil pump issue with my car (06 A4)",

            "It has the EA113, B7 and C6 came with it until their last days of production.",
            "Well, considering this ISNT an S4, it has a timing belt. The cams are driven by a chain, but theyre of no concern. \n\nThere are issues with B7s (especially if it is a 2.0T). Oil pump pump failure and cam follower failure are at the top of the list. By this stage, the early cam issues are sorted, there are no oil consumption issues (rings) on the B7, and the turbo failures mentioned are due to wastegate adjustment rods failing. \n\nHaving owned a B7 and putting 450k on it as a daily and having a second one as a fully built endurance race car, I know them inside and out. \n\nAt $10K, youd be crazy to buy this car. Seriously, these are maybe worth $5k in any condition. Youd be better served buying a similar or newer generation TT for similar money.",
            "Personally not, its not my color.\n\nBut the car looks pretty good, also the roof \n\nCheck if the expensive things like timing chain makes some noise.",
            "I have a b7 a4 with 211k miles and some questions if you have a sec\n\n450k km or mi? \n\nHow often did you do your timing belts? \n\nYou never changed the rear timing chain?\n\nHow often did you change the cam follower?\n\nWhats the oil pump issue? Did you just replace it in advance?",
            "450k km. \n\nI did the timing belt and water pump on that car probably three times.\n\nI never had any issues with the cam timing chain, or the tensioner. I ran Rotella T6 diesel oil in it, and never had any oil pressure issues.\n\nThe oil pump can be an issue, but more of the balance shafts. They are all connected, and the balance shafts spin at 2x RPM. It was an issue in the race car, so I deleted it, but in a daily driven car, you can get low oil, pressure issues from the balance shaft and oil pump. Its generally the pick up that gets clogged, and needs to be cleaned or replaced. The only issue with removing or replacing the oil pump is the pan has to come off and for that you either need to drop the subframe or engine out.\n\nI did the cam Follower every 15,000 km or so. Its a fairly low cost where item, but I do suggest running cam follower studs instead of the bolts. Bolts tend to strip the aluminum threads out of the head if you dont torque them properly. Studs give you a much more solid Connection. the race car now has a Roller Follower upgrade so I never have to worry about that again."
