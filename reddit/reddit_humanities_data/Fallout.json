            "I was surprised that they made stimpacks work like they do in the game (immediately repair anything). At first, I thought that was unrealistic. But then I remembered none of this is realistic, so I think it is actually a pretty cool addition.",
            "The final shot of the season gagged me to high heaven",
            "Bro they got the Junk jet on the first episode!",
            "my one and only critic about this show is that they reused the maximus flashback so many times without showing any new footage or a continuation of his flashback. i expected some more interaction with the knight that inspired him to become one, or how his life was before the city got bombed, but through the entire series we saw the same flashback over and over again.. \n\nthe show is still a 9.8/10 for me and still better than the last of us, and i'm not even a fan of the games...",

            "Apply the thing the Mother gives so his influence spreads.  \nHarold won't be mad about it, he will actually accept it rather kindly.  \nWhat you did? I hope game bugs and sends out like, 30 Talon Company mercs, or 30 Regulators.",
            "I told him how important he is to the environment that he is able to make trees grow where not even weeds could. He accepts.\n\nAlso I explained to the tree huggers that when Harold says something, he meant it exactly how he said it. If Harold's going to spend his days as a god worshipped by these people then at least I make sure they know what he's saying",
            "The most ethical thing would\u2019ve been to lobotomize tree man, He doesn\u2019t have to suffer the cognition of his fate and the whole capital wasteland benefits from clear water a lush reforestation. He is simply to much of a boon to the wasteland, yes his suffering is sad but I always choose to keep him alive. \n\nEveryone is suffering in the apocalypse and I think you could eventually reassure his that his sacrifice would benefit more than he could comprehend.",
            "I just finished the quest 1 hour ago. What a coincidence ! I killed him with the heart. The poor soul...",
            "I go with Laurel's plan. But if I didn't know Harold is kinda OK with it I would have more reservations.",
            "By respecting my favourite ghouls whishes and ending his life.",
            "I don\u2019t remember. But I remember this quest as one of the best in the whole 3D fallout series.",
            "Have you guys and gals ever seen\u2026 a tree? No, no, no. Not those shriveled black things. I\u2019m talking real trees. Brown bark, green leaves, photosynthesis, all that good stuff.",
            "I have done all four options: spread, diminish, kill, immolate.  Spreading his influence is what I chose first and default to."
