            "I've been playing for about 20 mins now and I noticed that the crimes are a bit more varied. Instead of the repetitive hordes of those monsters time after time, they actually changed it to more diverse ones with burglars and stuff.",
            "AM I TWEAKING OR DID THEY FIX THE RAIMI SUIT??",
            "I think there\u2019s a glitch already; it says Peter has 3 new suits with the big yellow 3 over Peter\u2019s suit selection screen, but there\u2019s only the new Hellfire suit\u2026",
            "Pressing Touchpad and Start opens the Debug Menu which I feel like maybe isn't intentional?",
            "Them releasing an update without the ng+ stuff first is an all time hilarious bit imo. But just check for another update and you get the real one",
            "\\>Mission Replay: Replay ***that*** mission (and many others) as much as you'd like now\n\nOkay, maybe I missed something. What's ***that*** mission?",
            "The golden gadget upgrade and Suit tech Fusion upgrades are ludicrously expensive. To purchase all suit tech Fusions and golden gadgets you need 25,633 tech parts. That is a lot of grinding.",
            "nothing in the update, number is supposed to be 1.002",
            "I know I shouldn\u2019t be disappointed by the update providing us pretty much what it advertised, but I was kind of hoping that, because it took so very long, there\u2019d be more in there that was being kept as a surprise (more suits, DLC tease, etc). I\u2019m happy to have NG+ and am curious to see the new suit styles in game (at any point in the story), but I\u2019d be lying if I said I was completely satisfied\u00a0",
            "Only got the 1.001.006 update for the charity suits. Still haven't got the 1.002 update.\n\nEdit: nevermind. I just got it. Had to close the game and manually check for an update for it to show up."
