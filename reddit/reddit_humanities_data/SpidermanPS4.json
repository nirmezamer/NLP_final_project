            "To those missing the NG+ (1.002.000) update, check your game for an update. \n\n- Go to the game on the Home Screen.\n- Press the options button\n- Click \"Check for Update\". \n\n1.002.000 should then start downloading. It will be a 3.576GB update and not the 600MB one (1.001.006).\n\nThe 1.001.006 update was released at the same time as this one, so people are receiving that one and thinking they don\u2019t have 1.002.000, but if you check for an update, then the NG+ update (1.002.000) should appear and start downloading.\n\n\u2014\n\n# Update: \n\nIf 1.002.000 doesn\u2019t appear, wait a couple of minutes, keep checking for an update or try restarting your console and see if that does anything to help. It seems to have worked for a few people. The servers are likely overloaded, hence the slightly out of sync release onto everyone\u2019s consoles.",
            "I've been playing for about 20 mins now and I noticed that the crimes are a bit more varied. Instead of the repetitive hordes of those monsters time after time, they actually changed it to more diverse ones with burglars and stuff.",
            "only 600mb?\n\nedit: where do i start NG+? Apart from the button to buy the 90s suits nothing changed in my game\n\nedit2: a second update just went live with 3.4gb",
            "AM I TWEAKING OR DID THEY FIX THE RAIMI SUIT??",
            "I think there\u2019s a glitch already; it says Peter has 3 new suits with the big yellow 3 over Peter\u2019s suit selection screen, but there\u2019s only the new Hellfire suit\u2026",
            "Pressing Touchpad and Start opens the Debug Menu which I feel like maybe isn't intentional?",
            "Them releasing an update without the ng+ stuff first is an all time hilarious bit imo. But just check for another update and you get the real one",
            "got a 600mb update. Is that the NG+? nothing seems to have changed\n\nEdit: that update seems to have added the option to buy the new suits. But there's now another 3.5GB update\n\nEdit2: the 3.5GB update added the NG+ option. I'm going in...",
            "\\>Mission Replay: Replay ***that*** mission (and many others) as much as you'd like now\n\nOkay, maybe I missed something. What's ***that*** mission?",

            "Yeah the suits and parry/traversal animation option are cool and all but the big news is that you can skip the spider bot section in Funky now! Let\u2019s fucking go",

            "Thanks for this update Insomniac Games! New suits and the return of the old ones are great!\nBut there are a few problems. PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO THIS:\n1) Some bugs are still in the game;\n2) When you choose Symbiotic parry and traversal animations to NON-symbiotic suits, the sound effects of traversal for a moment become like Spider Arms;\n3) Symbiotic finishers are absent after completing the story. \n\nSo, please do the following:\n1) Fix some bugs;\n2) Fix the sound effects of Symbiotic traversal animations;\n3) Give players the opportunity to choose for themselves between special finishes (Spider Arms and Symbiotic), even after completing the story, both in NG+ and in the first playthrough.",

            "on a real note: Insomniac should make their MJ more like 6160 MJ in *general*, not just this panel specifically, but yeah having MJ being Peter\u2019s emotional rock or an anchor to keep him grounded is way better than the lois lane esque version in the game with her taking out trained hunters and powerful symbiotes",
            "Don\u2019t get your hopes up.",
            "Sorry, Insomniac can only write them fighting or being awkwardly formal as if they barely know each other",
            "You better shatter those hopes because they're not happening, because not only are they two games into their version, there's no way they're gonna have a whole ass boss where MJ literally airs her dirty laundry about constantly needing to support Peter and push her personal life aside only to do exactly that in the last game. \n\nAdd to the fact that average player doesn't seem to mind her that much in the sequel with the most controversy being her face, on TOP of the fact that the creative director himself openly admitted to doubling down on their version of MJ being in the battle and capable and \"not giving a shit if she's a little OP\".",
            "I actually like how we get different interpretations of MJ.\n\nI like both insomniac AND comic version! \n\nPlus acting like this would be a little out of character for MJ now in insomniacverse.",

            "While I do think this sub tends to go over the top with the hate for SM2. The MJ sections of these games are genuinely some of the lower points of the games and drags them down for me",
            "I actually don\u2019t want her to be like this in sm3\u2026although this would be much better\u2026to change it now would make it awkward and feel as if she was literally a different person so it wouldn\u2019t make sense",
            "How, our fan base is fucking trashed.",
            "I\u2019d much rather just play as MJ infiltrating a diamond mine and freeing the children from their oppressors, then make a podcast about how the new normal is her being a worldwide merc with web gun in hand. Much more in line with the Insomniac MJ."
