Want to know how many grams of coffee you should use or how fine you should grind it? Not sure about temperature adjustments? Wondering about your coffee's shelf life or the best way to store it? Maybe you\u2019d just like some recommendations on new gear?\n\nThere are no stupid questions here, ask any question and the community and moderators will chime in to help you out! Even if you don\u2019t actually know the answer to a question someone asked, don\u2019t be afraid to comment just so you can participate in the conversation.\n\nYou can still post questions as an official post if you feel it warrants a larger discussion, but try to make use of this area so that we can help keep things organized in case others potentially have similar questions.",
