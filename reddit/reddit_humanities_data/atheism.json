        "content": "Fear of Islam\n\nI study philosophy at university in England\u2026.\nOh boy my homeland is being overrun by Islam. \n\nOne guy legit told me the other day on a Friday that \u201cI should be at the mosque\u201d and shouted at me for not being so. I know plenty of Christians, and whilst I myself am atheist, none have ever tried to convert me or call me a heretic- whilst the only homophobes I know have been Muslim. Someone also said my degree, philosophy was \u201cdevil worship because asking questions about the universe and truth is evil- this is especially true because I focus in logic and game theory. They said it was not \u201creal\u201d and satanic\u2026\n\n\nWhat scares me most is that the left (of which I am a part of) seems to protect Islam by way of calling all who support it islamaphobic\u2026.when I said I supported Israel as it\u2019s the only safe space for LGBT guys in the entire Middle East, and a democracy- someone spat at me and called me a \u201cdevil\u201d.\n\nIt is psychotic\nSorry for the vent: I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that I am very inclusive, but I cannot be inclusive to those who hate inclusion because fictional sky dad said no. \n\nEdit:\nIn reading your comments I agree with you all\nTbh it\u2019s weird: I\u2019m considering voting the far right anti immigration party this voting season, but labour will get in and continue to let Muslims into the country\u2026.\nDo you think the uk will be a Muslim majority any time soon? Or at least run under Muslim law?\n\nEdit\nHoly shit this blew up\u2026\nOk, here are some things in the comments I wanted to address:\n\n1. Christian sympathy\nNO NO NO NO NO!\nI get it, I misfired- this post was not meant to come across as Christian apologising, not at all. I hate Christianity as an institution, the world would be better without it. I am absolutely in no way a fan of Christianity. \nI was trying to point out that in the uk, the (surprisingly few) Christian\u2019s I\u2019ve met were pretty chill, and speaks to my country\u2019s general secularism, as there have not been many, and most are just normal guys who go to church and loosely interpret the bible. \nIslam has been not great to me- as mentioned I\u2019ve been spat at, yelled at, been called a \u201cwhite rat\u201d, a \u201ctraitor\u201d, etc. \n\nI was not saying: Islam bad, Christianity good or not as bad\n\nI was saying: \nChristianity scary. Islam scarier\n\n\n2. Fascism.\nI am not a far right guy.\nThe comments unfairly called me such. That said, I understand why you do. \nThere are three main issues at play here:\nA. English \u201cfar right\u201d versus American and European far right\nB. Policies of the English \u201cfar right\u201d \nC. My relationship with them.\n\nFor A., the English far right is different to the American and European far rights. Our far right is less fucking \u2018handmaids tale\u2019 than America, for instance and is closer to a moderate republican in the states- not the terrible fascists in the GOP.\nEffectively, our far right is anti illegal immigration, and wants to make our free health service more like France\u2019s and needs ID. \nFor B., as I said, this \u201cfar right\u201d party (Reform) is nowhere near the right of the American and European far rights, and I support them only because no other party is concerned with illegal immigration.\nFinally, C., FUCK OFF those of you who call me a \u201cfash\u201d or \u201cnationalist\u201d. I have been to every pride march since I could walk, I vehemently support a global, liberal world state and democracy. I fucking love the left wing. I am a member of my uni\u2019s fucking socialist society. I have voted the left wing party (labour) over and over again. However, here, they do not care about stopping immigration, but will probably up it, and take in even more. I don\u2019t care what you look like- I don\u2019t care what language you speak or where you come from, but I don\u2019t want you to come to my land which is secular and pretty chill and try to convert it to a religious fascist hell hole. I don\u2019t care if they are Christian, Muslim, or any other backward faith: I don\u2019t want to be stoned to death for being gay, and the uk does not really have a Christian right that advocates for that, but a lot of normal Muslims do.",

        "content": "I don't know if this belongs here but I am going to rant about my discussion with a Muslim that didn't believe in the origin of life. First off I was on discord and I saw this guy talking about how Christians were wrong and that Allah made everyone which I don't know if that is true but I guess the Quran says that. I said that I believe that we came from evolution which was a mistake that costed me 1 hour of my life. He said that \"we came from air to something\" which that's basically what happens in most religions when a figure makes us?? But after he said that I responded \"we came from primordial soup and eventually evolved to humans\" which he responded \"so we went from liquid to flesh? Very logical\". At this point I was annoyed at how much he didn't understand so I said \"we came from the building blocks of life, amino acids and proteins formed the first cell walls and rna and dna but he still said that I had no proof that we came from evolution after explaining it 3 times. He said that we were made by God and that evolution wasn't real and that's why \"we couldn't clone humans or make more\" so I stated that lactose tolerance is a sign that humans are still evolving and we can't clone humans because of laws and maybe morals. I also said that we could actually genetic engineer stuff for example we made goats produce proteins that are found in spiderwebs and he still flat out denied it and said I had no proof. He then made the claim saying specifically in some weird broken grammar \"you said we come from sperm which goes into egg so humans can't evo\" which makes no sense at all and I eventually gave up and I'm sure he thinks he won. That's all I have to say\n\nTldr; muslim denies all my claims of evidence of life and then makes incredibly stupid claims with no backup evidence",
