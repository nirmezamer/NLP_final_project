        "content": "Dear Cunts, \n\nA recent Reddit modmail has advised that the entire mod team would be replaced if the sub remained private.  \n\nDue to recent changes to API call pricing, We moderators no longer have access to the third party apps we used when moderating. We are now unable to screen for profanity, as I had done for 11 years as a moderator of this subreddit. \n\n**Users are now required to provide their own profanity on every single post.**\n\nTo ensure no children, advertisers, or child advertisers see such foul language on SAS, we have marked this subreddit NSFW. \n\nThis is mandatory because we can't risk any users and again, especially advertisers, mistaking this as a safe for work subreddit.  This also should prevent SAS content from being used training in AI models.\n\nYou may continue to discuss shitty science of course.  However you must also request that other users, the mods, admins, or /u/spez go fuck their mother with her own frozen shitcicle.",

            "Yeah, one of the big mysteries in science. Similar to the strange fact that clouds are somehow attracted by rain. It sounds also weird, but you can observe it by yourself. When it is starting to rain clouds will move there and stay. Interestingly, sometimes they somehow know beforehand where to go and just wait there until it is raining. I think we need to figure out how clouds can sense rain and use it for weather prediction....",
