Add this to the safe zone recycler nerf last force wipe, and people who genuinely suck at PVP despite their best efforts are the ones who are going to be punished the most. I know quite a few people who play on PVP servers but rarely PVP, and instead run a shop or provide some other type of service (farming, art, hotel, etc). If you make the grind too difficult for them, they're probably going to switch to PVE or stop playing all together, removing some of the diversity that makes PVP servers interesting.",

        "content": "I see this site advertised EVERYWHERE and have even played there myself quite a bit over the years (as of today I am level 175\\~).\n\nToday, I was banned for \"reward abuse\" which an admin (Apollo) explained was due to my having not played plinko (or other games/risks/etc) long enough before withdrawing rewards. He specified that I \"do not have to play with it until I lose\" but that I can't just collect it, clear the wager requirement, and withdraw. I apologized and said, having been informed of that, that I would refrain from doing that again and asked about what wager amount/type of wager/etc. I need to comply with the rules. \n\nFast forward like 6 hours later and I am banned all over again. In the 6\\~ hours leading up to this 2nd ban I had not played/deposited/withdrew whatsoever. I work from home and don't play during \"working hours\" (though I do claim rains and bonus codes if I see them pop up on my 2nd monitor).   \n  \nThis time, a new moderator (Obscurity) decided to reply after making me wait over an hour and said that \"Apollo clearly stated that what I was doing was wrong\" and that the ban was legitimate and permanent before inviting me to make a new account to start over as a level 1.\n\nI don't know about the rest of the community here but this is insanely unscrupulous and shady behavior in my book. Not expecting to get unbanned (being insulated from such a place is probably for the best anyway) but I hope that some people at least see this and have a chance to avoid being taken advantage of/admin abused.\n\n  \nScreenshots of the original chat with Apollo: [https://imgur.com/a/RyAgdcg](https://imgur.com/a/RyAgdcg)\n\nI don't have the link for the transcript with the moderator because I haven't received an email of it yet and I closed out of the page because I was pretty sure he was intentionally being snarky with me to get a rise out of me at that point. I will add it if I wind up receiving that transcript though.",

If you didn't play anything, and you've received one warning, there's no reason for them to perm your account.
