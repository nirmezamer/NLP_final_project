        "content": "So this was a very interesting way to have spent my Friday night haha. \n\nAs a recap, I called my cat, Susan, the most beautiful girl in the world in front of my girlfriend, Liz. Liz got upset and left, and blocked me on everything.  For those interested, there\u2019s a picture of Susan on my page. \n\nFirst, I\u2019d like to say thank you for the comments\u2014I had been kind of beating myself up over the whole incident but yeah, an adult woman being jealous of a cat is not the kind of energy I need in my life. Also I just gotta say I did get a good laugh out of some of the comments but I can assure you all I have a perfectly healthy human-cat relationship with Susan. \n\nI spent the day just kinda going about my life. Around 10, I got a text from none other than Liz herself. She asked if she could come over and talk to me. \n\nFor a tiny bit of additional backstory/context: I am bisexual and polyamorous. These are both things about myself that I am VERY up front about, especially with people I\u2019m romantically interested in. When Liz and I met, we bonded over our appreciation of shitty cartoons. She expressed interest first, and I told her my deal. I knew she was bi since we met, and when we sat down to have the conversation that started our relationship, she told me she was in an open relationship with her last partner and was down to do it again. Which, in retrospect, I feel I should\u2019ve been more cautious about, but what can I say, when you see someone through rose-colored glasses, the red flags just look like flags. \n\nBack to tonight, though. \n\nI was torn on having Liz over, because a big part of me is just done, but on the other hand, she is someone I care about. So I gave her the okay to come by for a talk. When she came in, I could tell she was really upset, so I had her sit down and I got her some water. \n\nI don\u2019t want to share too much of what she told me, but there was more to her jealousy of my cat than I originally thought. She opened up about her ex. He was the one who initiated being open, he found another girl to date, he started spending more time with this other girl, and whenever he was around Liz, he\u2019d either be texting her or talking about how great she was. He ended up leaving Liz for this other girl. Liz also said she wants to keep dating me, but she doesn\u2019t want to be polyamorous. \n\nI will say, I did feel a bit of guilt hearing this, because had I known, I would\u2019ve dialed back the verbal love of Susan in front of Liz a little bit. Although I do love Susan more, Susan is indeed a cat. Cats don\u2019t understand language the way humans do, so I\u2019m sure words of affirmation are low on her list of love languages. Meanwhile, Liz is a human who can understand language, and words of affirmation mean a lot to her. \n\nBut, the situation with Susan and the conversation with Liz opened my eyes to the fact that we\u2019re not compatible. I\u2019ve tried monogamous relationships a few times, and a majority of them (meaning 2 out of 3) ended because I\u2019m just not wired for that. I have not and will never cheat on anyone I\u2019m dating, I want to make that perfectly clear. \n\nSo, I told Liz that, although I care about her and wish her nothing but the best, I can\u2019t be what she needs. She cried, but said she understood. \n\nWe had popsicles\u2014I know from experience that having something cold and sweet can be extremely helpful when having big emotions. I did end up telling her about my original post on here, and I let her read it. I was scared to do that, because I know it didn\u2019t paint her in the best light. But she actually laughed and confessed that she felt a little unhinged at being jealous of a cat. I also asked her if I could make an update, and she said it was okay. Our conversation was a lot more in-depth than what I shared (seriously, if there\u2019s a villain in this story, it\u2019s her ex-boyfriend), and she asked that I not share a good majority of it. She gathered a few random things she had at my place, and then she left. \n\nAs for Susan, she spent the entire night nestled between us. Liz was petting her a lot, too. \n\nI feel this is probably the best way this situation could\u2019ve ended. I don\u2019t know if Liz is going to remain a part of my life in any significant capacity, but I truly hope she does well and is able to heal. I\u2019m going to text her best friend tomorrow and ask them to check in on her. \n\nTL;DR: My (now officially ex) and I had a good conversation, we both got some closure, and I wish her well. ",

        "content": "I (26M) have a cat, Susan (7F). She is the absolute love of my life. I\u2019ve had her for five years, we had an immediate bond, she\u2019s been with me through thick and thin. I may be biased but she\u2019s also a very pretty cat. She\u2019s a brown and orange calico with a white belly and legs, and she has a very pretty face. I compliment her all the time because I love her so much and I want her to know how much I love her even if she can\u2019t understand English. \n\nMy girlfriend (25F), who I will call Liz, and I have been together for about two months now. She\u2019s not the biggest cat person, and Susan is very shy so it\u2019s taken Susan a bit of time to warm up to Liz. She\u2019s not aggressive to Liz or anything. She just hides when Liz comes over, and occasionally she\u2019d peak her head out to see if Liz was gone yet. Lately, Susan\u2019s been coming out more when Liz is over, and she\u2019s even started going to Liz for pets. \n\nNow, whenever Susan comes out when Liz is around, I do turn my attention to Susan so that she has a positive association with Liz. I\u2019ll stop and pet her if she\u2019s close enough, or I just say \u201cHi, pretty girl!\u201d when she peaks her head out. \n\nThat\u2019s not to say I don\u2019t give Liz ample attention when we\u2019re together. I\u2019m seldom on my phone around Liz. I give her lots of physical affection and compliments when appropriate. \n\nYesterday I had Liz over and we were watching Family Guy together. We were cuddling and just zoned out on the couch together when Susan came out and climbed in my lap. I started petting her and telling her how much I love her, as I usually do. \n\nHere\u2019s where I fucked up: As I was petting Susan and talking to her, I told her she was the most beautiful girl in the world. Liz got up and went to the bathroom, and I didn\u2019t think much of it, even when she was in there for a while. When she came out, she was clearly upset. I asked her what was wrong, and she accused me of being a weirdo who loves his cat more than the \u201cactual human woman\u201d sitting next to him. I was honestly kinda dumbfounded because 1. We haven\u2019t gotten to the \u201cI love you\u201d stage yet and 2. It\u2019s my cat? And I honestly do love Susan more than Liz. Which is something I knew I shouldn\u2019t say in that moment. But also I wasn\u2019t about to lie, or be pressured into saying something I\u2019m not ready to say yet. So I sat there, just staring at Liz for a moment until she huffed, grabbed her keys, and left. \n\nAfter about an hour, I went to text her to see if she made it home alive, only to find she had blocked me. I was upset, but Susan is incredibly empathetic to me and came running to sit with me. \n\nAs of now, Liz still hasn\u2019t unblocked me so I guess I\u2019m single again? Good riddance I guess. \n\nTl;dr: my girlfriend accused me of loving my cat more than her and probably broke up with me. \n\nUPDATE: I posted a picture of the most beautiful girl in the world (Susan) on my profile!

She had been sick for awhile, and in that time my cousin had found some necklaces at my moms house and brought them to me. \n\nOne of them was a skinny silver capsule, maybe an inch and a half long. My cousin insisted it was an \u201cintention stick\u201d, like where you write on a slip of paper and roll it up inside the pendant.

I start freaking out internally because the ashes were HER MOM\u2019S. I thought she\u2019d be horrified, maybe even offended. \n\nBut instead, she started laughing.

My mom would have too.

        "content": "Happened two days ago but I thought it was a funny facepalm your moment. Altogether pretty wholesome for a TIFU but thought I would post anyway.  (TL;DR at the bottom)\n\n\nA bit of backstory- my inlaws have a longstanding tradition where every year they and their highschool friends rent lake houses on the same lake and have parties, bonfires, boat rides, skiing, tubing, the general lake vacation activities. \nOver the years, their group has grown with having kids, kids bringing significant others, and now the kids bringing kids of their own.\n\n\nThe past 3 years all the grandbabies got matching outfits or shirts for a group picture, this year was my time to shine. I offered to make some custom shirts with my cricut for the 7 littles that will be there this year. I have my heat press vinyl, I have my computer, and a cool idea in my head and set to work.\n\n\nI run to the local big box store to pick up bright colorful shirts for my design. Problem is all the bright colorful shirts have ugly designs already on there. My options are black and white. Ugh. I check the craft section where there's usually a couple of options of plain shirts for this same purpose. No luck... But there is a tie dye kit. Bingo! I'll dye the white shirts all fun and bright. Cool game on!\n\n\nI set to work folding, twisting, rubber banding, and patiently wait for my toddler to wake from her nap so we can do this fun arts and crafts project together. I figured she could pick the colors and possibly with my guidance, she could squirt it on the shirt. \nFast forward to this actually playing out.\nI set up in the grass in my back yard to avoid staining anything, and start squirting the colors my daughter picks out onto the shirts. It's working great!\nI see a lot of excess dye in the grass so I moved to a fresh area for each shirt while my daughter runs around shouting colors and running back and forth handing me bottles. She's having a blast! \n\n\nMy husband comes to the yard to check on progress, and notices tiny footprints all across our concrete patio. And asked why I was dying her in the process.\nI look up from my masterpieces and realize my daughter has been running through and kneeling in the excess dye in the grass. The bottoms of her feet were black and large splotches are up her legs, it was adorable. We finish our project and I decide to clean this kid up.\n\n\nThe more I scrub the dye off this kid, the more it's looking like awful bruises. The poor girl looked absolutely battered. We're due to hop on a plane in a couple days and I'm trying to figure out how best to dress her to cover her legs so we don't get funny looks and possibly get cps called on us for having a bruised and battered child. Then the realization hits me... I don't have to worry about someone in the airport... I have to worry about the pediatrician the next day. I'm googling ways to get dye off skin and tried everything. It's looking worse and worse every time. Defeated, I give up and settle for just explaining and hope they realize that it's not bruises and my child is very loved and not abused.\n\n\nFast forward to the next day at the doctor. The nurse gives my daughters poor legs a look and I immediately splurt out 'she was in a tie dye accident!' the nurse looks at me as if to say 'huh?!' and I tell her 'before anything- I swear it's not bruises all over her legs and feet- we were tie dying shirts and she decided to play in the work area resulting in her legs looking like that. She gave a quick once over to my daughter and agreed that when you look closer, it definitely looked like dye but not with a quick glance. \n\n\n\nTL;DR: tie dyed a bunch of shirts for a family vacation resulting in my toddler being dyed and looking like a battered and abused child right before a doctor visit making me think they were going to call child protective services on me\n",
