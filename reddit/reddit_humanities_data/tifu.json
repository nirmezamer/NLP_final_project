        "content": "I work as a server in a small restaurant and I'm pretty sure everyone knows that whenever a customer doesn't finish their meal or ask for it to be boxed up, we obviously throw it away. But for the past few weeks or so instead of throwing the food away after my customes are done with their meal, I have been eating the leftovers remaining on their plates.\n\nWe are not allowed to do this so I just quickly scarfed it down when I returned the plates to the back and no one was looking. It was going okay until I suddenly got sick, turned out that I had Hepatitis A. It's been awful, I couldn't hold down food for days not to mention that I have been looking like a minion for a week now.\n\nI had no choice but to report it at work and I also decided that it was a good idea to come clean about how I probably got it which almost got me fired. I'm lucky that I got away with only a warning but l also can't work for the next two weeks. I guess it's the consequences of my own actions. At least I still have a job.\n\nTL:DR I ate customers leftovers, caught a contagious disease and almost got fired.\n\n\n",

        "content": "I want to preface this post by saying that I believe that there's nothing wrong with having autism and people with autism can be extremely smart and amazing individuals.\n\nMy 26M boyfriend of three years and I 23F have been going through a lot of issues. To start, our relationship has always been challenging, We dated for two years locally and now we are one year into long distance. We have been talking about becoming a more serious couple, starting a family and living together in the next few years.\n\nWe finally set a date that works best for me to move, this September. Previously we thought it would be sometime early next year but this works out better for his current lease and my current situation. This set him off as it's pretty close, his initial reaction to me moving in September was extremely worried. He's worried about having to change his current routines to fit me into his life and living situation. \n\nHe has several symptoms that I've noticed over the three years we've dated, a few of which have caused extreme problems in the relationship.\n\n* Introvert/ social anxiety when in unfamiliar settings to the point we have to leave\n* Lots of anxiety in general\n* Easily annoyed when disturbed from his routines (Everything is on his time)\n* Complete inability to express feelings and emotions and has a difficult time recognizing or understanding other's emotions\n*  Lack of affection and constantly needs to be asked to show affection\n*  Withdraws in any stressful conversation or situation\n*  Very rigid work/ food/ gym/ sleep routine. \n*  Extreme interest in a highly specific field of academia that he is highly successful in\n*  Struggles with 'common sense'\n\nYou may or may not agree with my conclusions based off of this list. I'm not a doctor, but I have been around him for years and truly think that he may be on the spectrum. We have struggled a lot with his communication and constantly shutting down conversations. \n\n**Here's where I fucked up,** I told him in the most caring and gentle way that I think he may have some symptoms of autism. He became extremely upset and started saying that I think he is a r\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*d. I tried to explain that I don't think that he is dumb and I actually think he is incredibly smart. I tried reassuring him and he said he doesn't want to talk and to leave him alone. I texted him and apologized, I told him it was never my intention to hurt his feelings and that I would love him regardless.  \n\nI don't know what to do about the situation, I know I fucked up. Honestly, I just didn't know how to bring it up.  Or if I was wrong for even thinking this. I feel like shit because I know he thinks I'm a jerk for suggesting it. \n\nAdvice is welcome.\n\nTL;DR: I noticed some symptoms of autism in my boyfriend and brought it up, now he hates me.",

            "I wanna preface this comment by saying I\u2019m not attacking you or meaning to be aggressive in any way shape or form, at the same time what I\u2019m about to say might be hard to read. \n\nThe symptoms you\u2019ve seen him exhibit don\u2019t matter. Simply because, from what you\u2019ve described in your post, he isn\u2019t receptive to that kind of conversation. \n\nIf anyone that has been in a 3 year relationship can\u2019t have these kind of difficult conversations with their partner, it\u2019s a HUGE red flag and sharing a living space with one another shouldn\u2019t be on  the table, let alone have a planned date. \n\nI understand wanting to be patient with him, but if you\u2019re anything like me, you need to be asking yourself this, \u201cam I looking for him to get a diagnosis for him or for me?\u201d \n\nWhen I was going through a similar situation, I kept looking for explanations that would justify the way my partner at the time was treating me. He ended up being diagnosed with bipolar schizophrenia and I stayed with him for way too long because I told myself that the mistreatment was directly related to his diagnosis. \n\nRegardless of his diagnosis and all the logical explanations, I was miserable. On top of that, he became violent, I justified it as he was \u201cdifferent\u201d mentally. Well, I was still miserable, and it wasn\u2019t until he tried to kill me that I snapped out of it. \n\nI am now years later in a wonderful, healthy relationship with the most amazing person I have ever met. We are both able to have any and all conversations that we need, and every time we\u2019ve shared a concern about one another, it\u2019s been addressed in a way that we both feel comfortable with.\n\nI\u2019m typing this to you as a person formally diagnosed with Autism, ADHD, and BPD. I know what it\u2019s like to struggle but I would never excuse treating someone I love poorly because of my diagnoses. \n\nIf your partner can\u2019t be realistic about conversations that matter, put yourself first and get the fuck out of that relationship.",
            "Based on that response, he already knew and got upset because you reminded him. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nETA: As someone with two neurodevelopmental disorders, I genuinely don\u2019t think it should be rude to ask someone else who is definitely exhibiting a few symptoms. You either have it or you don\u2019t. If you don\u2019t, congrats, you got the easier path. If you do, then that won\u2019t change regardless of whether you pay it any mind. \u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s internalized ableism, they don\u2019t want something to be \u201cwrong\u201d with them.\u00a0",
            "Whether or not he has autism is actually kind of besides the point. He wants to delay you moving in together. He\u2019s not showing you the affection you\u2019ve repeatedly asked him for. He won\u2019t partake in serious conversations with you. A diagnosis isn\u2019t going to change any of that. It sounds like there are a lot of needs that he just isn\u2019t meeting - or willing to try to meet.",
            "I\u2019m diagnosed autistic, and I remember being called the r slur a lot at school. It was soul destroying- a way of marking out certain people as something less than human. Kids are also really good at noticing who\u2019s different, even if you keep your diagnosis secret like I did; I swear they make better diagnosticians than a lot of doctors.\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say here is that he probably had similar experiences and is traumatised. Autism is extremely stigmatised and regularly shamed. You didn\u2019t fuck up at all, but society has fucked him up. \n\nPersonally, I think we do best in relationships with our own neurotype. That\u2019s nothing personal, it\u2019s just a fact. Think about whether you want to be with someone like him.",
            "Hey, your list is exactly how my relationship was too. If he\u2019s not autistic, he might be avoidant. This makes a relationship hard if you can\u2019t have serious conversations. I would really consider whether or not that\u2019s something you can really deal with.\n\nGood luck with everything.",
            ">Hey Reddit, I want to spend the rest of my life with someone who won't change and can't communicate with me\n\n![gif](giphy|s239QJIh56sRW|downsized)",
            "I mean, I feel that's besides the point. OP, it just doesn't sound like you're that happy in the relationship. And whether he's autistic is completely irrelevant. \n\nLike, if he was diagnosed would the issues you described bother you less? Do you somehow think a diagnosis would change him? What if he's just afraid of commitment and not affectionate but neurotypical? \n\nI do think he's being a dick by just sulking rather than talking, but if I was in his place then yea... I might be annoyed a partner is armchair diagnosing me rather than discussing actual issues they have in our relationship. \n\nSo like, If you didn't, its worth having a conversation about the things that bother you rather than bringing up autism. But if you did and he reacted the same way then well, tbh time to evaluated whether moving in is a good idea bc it might just be a bad fit for the both of you.",
            "Yeah, offering a diagnosis of a psychiatric condition to someone who didn't ask your advice is almost always a bad idea. As you can see, it didn't help manage the issues at hand and just made him mad. You're also not a professional. I could have told you not to do this.",
            "Regarding his symptoms you described I would guess he is pretty awful as a partner.\u00a0 You are sure you want to have a long term relationship and start a family with him?"

Suddenly, reality snapped back with a jolt \u2014 my wallet was gone, swiped clean by a nimble-fingered thief.\n\nDriven by a surge of adrenaline and anger, I made a split-second decision that would haunt me. Ignoring all logic, I chased after the culprit through bustling streets, dodging pedestrians and ducking into narrow alleyways. Miraculously, I caught up to him and confronted him, demanding my wallet back.\n\nWhat followed was straight out of a clich\u00e9 action movie \u2014 heated words in broken French, a scuffle, and yes, even a baguette swung in defense (though, sadly, not by me).

As for the pickpocket, well, he likely slipped away to pick another day.\n\nLesson learned the hard way: next time, I'll secure my belongings and leave crime-fighting to the professionals \u2014 or at least refrain from swinging baked goods in the pursuit of justice.\n\n\nTL;DR: Got pickpocketed in Paris, chased down the thief like a wannabe action hero, ended up in a French jail cell for my troubles.

There was a group of 6 of us but there were no options for a vehicle with enough seats so we had to get 2, it was me and a friend named chloe in one car then the rest in the other.\r  \n\r  \nThe part where I fucked up was putting in a completely different address and not double checking it with the host,  keep in mind all of us were supposed to go back to the same house.

        "content": "Early last month, I saw a video of a guy using a massage gun on his taint, and he seemed to enjoy it a lot, so I decided to try it for myself (I'm a guy too). I impulse bought a massage gun on Amazon and got it two days later. I opened that sucker up and gave it a go. It felt okay, but it was way better on my dick. I ended up using it again a couple more times over the next few days. \n\nAs the month went on, I noticed a strange feeling in my dick. It was a dull ache at the base of my penis, and it would come and go randomly. I thought nothing of it for a couple weeks, but then I started getting new sensations like shooting pain intermittently. When this month began, I felt the pain spread from my dick to my perineum, then to my glutes and down my right leg and foot. The sensations also became hot, tingly, cold, and even itchy. I knew something was definitely wrong at this point.\n\nWhat's worse is that the tingling sensations spread to my back, arms, neck, head, and even my lips. I promptly went to my doctor and learned I have pudendal neuralgia, which is irritation/damage to the pudendal nerve located in the pelvic and perineum region. I got referred to a PT and got some exercises to help increase my hip and leg flexibility which should help the nerve not be restricted by my muscles and heal faster, but the PT said it could take a full year before I'm better. They're also going to do an internal (read: rectal) check next time if I don't show much improvement to check that the damage wasn't affecting my sphincter muscles. So, while I'm anticipating that awkward exam, I gotta do multiple stretches every day while feeling like bugs are crawling on my skin and biting me, or like icy hot was applied to various parts of my body. I'm not religious, but I've been praying to God this past month cause I'm terrified this could be permanent.\n\nTL;DR: jerked off with a massage gun, got nerve damage and need PT to get better. 0/10, the orgasm was not fucking worth it.",
