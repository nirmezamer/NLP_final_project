        "content": "Tl;dr:  Built and listed the first torrent on the market in Jita, and then it promptly went off and died in Ahbazon, becoming the first torrent to die in Eve.\n\nOne probably nice sunny day at the beginning of June, three of us from Aideron Robotics sat inside and hatched a plan: we were going to build the new Upwell haulers.\u00a0 They were new and shiny and CoolTM, and we could probably make some good money from selling them early.\u00a0 One of us had experience doing this before; he had sold one of the first Hecates ever way back in ye olden days, and all of us were no strangers to industry.\n\nOn Friday before the Equinox launch, Hoboleaks updated with the industry information for building the new haulers\u2026 and we were going to need a lot of reactions materials.\u00a0 Patch notes and dev blogs had said that the new T2 haulers, the Deluge and the Torrent, are built with all-new, never seen before components whose blueprints weren't available till the expansion dropped, so we could not build them ahead of time.\u00a0 But we could get the reactions materials to build the components ahead of time, and Reactions Dude, amazingly, had a stockpile of everything.\u00a0 So Reactions Dude, who wasn't able to be awake at downtime on launch day, simply contracted the entirety of his reactions and mineral collection that he had built, bought, and accumulated over the past few weeks for this project to me.\n\nThe other two of us opted to alarm clock downtime on Tuesday when the expansion launched.\u00a0 We sorted out that I (Hauler Dude) would be responsible for picking up all the new BPOs - a few squall BPOs and all the new component BPOs, and he (Builder Dude) would buy and inject all the new skillbooks for inventing and building the T2 BPCs.\u00a0 Unfortunately, markets promptly ran out of one of the skillbooks, Upwell Encryption Methods, when Hoboleaks updated on Friday.\u00a0 Fortunately, Builder Dude already had Upwell Encryption Methods trained, ironically because Reactions Dude wanted help with Edencom industry several weeks prior.\n\nOn Tuesday of the expansion launch, the servers came up around 11:20 Eve time.\u00a0 I log into the Ytiri NPC station in Jita, buy 4 Squall BPOs, and 15 component BPOs.\u00a0 Two of the Squall BPOs go straight to Jita 4-4 to make some very overpriced squalls.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bvnvkpvf869d1.png?width=699&format=png&auto=webp&s=3abd479bf9edebf7ed4af52bbe7676559916bc1e\n\nThe component BPOs are rushed over to our production site, where Builder Dude and I start building components; and the remaining squall BPOs are sent to our invention site to immediately begin making copies for invention.\u00a0\n\nA couple hours and squall BPCs later, we realize inventing the T2 BPCs is going to take 13 hours or so.\u00a0 \u201cGood thing we started early\u201d gets mentioned a few times, and I move to be in place to pick up the T2 BPCs as soon as they're done to rush them to our building site so Builder Dude can start the production of whatever successfully invents before he goes to bed.\u00a0 Builder Dude and I cook more components, and Reactions Dude cooks more reaction inputs in the meantime.\n\n*Torrent invention results: 1 out of 1*  \n*Deluge invention results: 0 out of 1*\n\nFortunately a secondary invention run succeeds for the deluge, so I move the BPCs, Builder Dude starts building one torrent and one deluge, and we go to bed.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n16 or so hours later, our first torrent is almost ready, with our first deluge about an hour behind, thanks to the secondary invention runs.\u00a0 There's plenty of overpriced Squalls on the market by this point, since they only take 2 and a half hours or so to build in Jita 4-4, but there's no torrents or deluges for sale in Jita yet.\u00a0 Are we the first to list a T2 hauler in Jita?\u00a0 How can we possibly be the first?\u00a0 We're not big industrialists by any stretch of the imagination, surely someone more experienced and prepared will put one up before we do, right?\u00a0\n\nThe Torrent comes off the line.\u00a0 There's still none listed in Jita yet.\u00a0 I put it into my DST - I won't be able to fly a Torrent for another two weeks at least - and carefully, with a sensible amount of worrying, make my way to Jita, taking an extra jump or two to avoid trafficked gates.\u00a0 This is, after all, quite possibly the most valuable thing I've ever moved in a DST.\u00a0 Align, cloak, decloak, warp, heat hardeners, and I've made it.\u00a0 There's still no Torrents on the market.\u00a0 So we have a short conversation and decide to go for it, and list the first ever Torrent on the market in Eve, for 2 billion isk.\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6r20h8x3869d1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5c9d22c37b83820161249726222bb35e9aa100ef\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bvpmmu7s869d1.png?width=1833&format=png&auto=webp&s=427fcbe7c3b3329944916ac034ed00b18005e60a\n\nAnd then we wait.\n\nAnd wait.\u00a0\n\n*\\*ding\\**\n\nSomeone buys our Torrent!\u00a0 For 2 billion isk!\u00a0 None of us can believe it, except we can, because there's the wallet entry!\u00a0\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0ewd8hv5869d1.jpg?width=1079&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6fef148c497894fa328e29aad83753c0f1c694d5\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lshojjun869d1.png?width=1799&format=png&auto=webp&s=94a6a363548262b330bda23bf00b7cac475bafa8\n\nWe're ecstatic, wondering what kind of life this Torrent is going to have, when Reactions Dude points out that the character that bought it lost a few other haulers not that long ago.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g0u0xv77869d1.jpg?width=1079&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7c74228e3716bbfee865825038add703f5781328\n\nWe chuckle a bit, thinking that this character will probably trade it to an alt or sell it to a corp mate or something.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nNOPE: [https://zkillboard.com/kill/118614434/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/118614434/)\n\nOur first Torrent, the first Torrent ever to be listed on the market in Jita and the second to be sold in Jita, lives for 49 minutes after being sold before exploding on the Shera gate in Ahbazon with 1.2 billion worth of T1 1600mm plates in its cargo, and becomes the first Torrent ever to die in Eve. (o7)\n\nWe go on to build more overpriced torrents and deluges, selling a few more of each between 1-2 billion isk before other industrialists finally start to catch up on Thursday and Friday that week, and prices finally fall.\n\nWe ended up selling the following:\u00a0\n\n* 11 Squalls for a combined 992m\n* 10 Torrents and 14 Deluges for a combined 24.2b, with 2 Torrents and 1 Deluge still on the markets\n* Final profit: 17.5 billion and counting\n\nSumming up our adventure in a nutshell, this was a whole lot of fun.  New ships are cool, industry in Eve is cool, and most importantly, successfully building and selling new ships for a lot of money and having fun doing it is very cool.",

Rumor has it that this lancer is still terrorizing MOONPIRE's jump freighters in Ahbazon...",

            "You know, there's something funny and poetic about the race to first being us. I used to be in Calmil for a long time, it seems frogs remain my competition in market pvp despite having been in Rote for a while now (and loving it). I wasn't going to post about this, but I guess you've convinced me without even trying xP\n\nI was just one person though, I didn't have a team and I basically had 1 account's worth of indy toons. I had also missed the fact that encryption methods would be needed and had turned down an offer for DED LP a few days prior - then it turns out I was 4k short, which cost me being first on the Torrent as it took a while to find that LP. As I was hauling both Deluge and Torrent to Jita I saw you listed the first Torrent. I'm still pretty sure I was the first to *sell* both of those ships but I have not spoken to CCP to ask them if I was the first to build the Deluge or just the first to get it into Jita. I built multiple rounds of the ships as best I could so I wasn't able to claim the super inflated price by the end of it but I did build a similar number of ships and I've since moved on to supporting my player group since Skyhook raids have been on everyone's minds as of late and the haulers are perfect support for those. It's nice to see people making money using the new ships and not *just* in selling them lol.\n\nWhen I started this project, everyone was telling me that there's no shot, some Nullsec bro with better bonuses will beat me, but in the end it turned out to be just random lowsec dudes stumbling over each other Three Stooges style who would ultimately milk this for what it was worth. All I have to say is gf and we'll see if the future has similar races and stories involved, but I don't expect a similar race to happen for a long while because this involved a lot of rare elements like rare existing skillbooks, entirely new advanced components, new skillbooks, and sourcing all of them quickly.",
