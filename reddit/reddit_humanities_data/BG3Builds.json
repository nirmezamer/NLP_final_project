Great builds are nice but advice about handling money, taking it slow, and learning the importance of not trying new things really made a difference for me.\n\nCompilations of people's failed HM can also help avoid silly mistakes.",

But u/zanuffas, I have a question:  I didn't see any Druid builds or Druids mentioned for multiclass dips, and they similarly aren't on the class Tier list.    Any specific reason?  Or just a finite amount of time sort of thing?",

            "Heh,  okay so not some deep-seeded hatred or fear of Druid's then.  It was very curious, since everything else was so thorough.   :)\n\nVery nice guides, that seem to cover most of the powerful core builds I've seen around, and at good level of detail.    Wish I'd known about them earlier it would have made sharing core build ideas easier.",

By now, you probably know all the different item combinations and ways to create overpowered builds. If you are looking for a new challenge, look no further\u2014 welcome to Trials of Tav, the roguelike mode mod for Baldur's Gate 3. \n\n\n\n- Like a classic roguelike game, you'll progress from encounter to encounter, starting with nothing but the clothes on your back. As you clear encounters, you'll receive randomized loot that will make your party increasingly stronger. \n\n\n\n- These encounters become progressively harder as you advance and increase your RogueScore, a whole new metric to track your progress.\n\n\n\n- Powerful unlocks like hag hair or tadpole powers will further empower your party and complete your builds. \n\n\n\nIf tons of hours of new gameplay, NG+, 200+ enemies, 38 maps and a formidable challenge is what you seek, you can download the mod here: \n\n[https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/9907](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/9907)",

Even that isn't really a game-breaker and can be compensated for with spells and items.\n\nAll that said, Wood Elves are my personal favorite for the extra movement speed, plus the elfy benefits like reisisting charm and sleep.",

Moonbeam became my BFF and then the dryad and her wood woad are great. Early game I'd use wildshape for extra hp until spellcasting really came online. Late game ice memphits and water elemental became my distance fighters while dryad blocked at least one path with spike growth. Wood woad helped with cleanup while my actual companions could focus on bosses and other enemies. Moonbeam has a small aoe so I could pick off one or two at a time that were caught in spike growth. I had dual scimitars for anyone who could actually make it to me. Late game wildshape was more for out of combat things like sneaking into small spaces or distracting the locals while Astarion lockpicked.",

I just pick the ones that offer summons. They are a combo of druid and wizard spells. You don't have to play with summons at all if you don't want to. I'd suggest looking at the wiki to see the lists you can pick from. There are way too many options to list them here. The elementals/mephits/myrmadons are controllable as compared to things like ghouls and zombies. So, you have more characters to get through in a round, but you can choose their travel paths and actions like you would a companion. They just have a very limited range of actions available."
