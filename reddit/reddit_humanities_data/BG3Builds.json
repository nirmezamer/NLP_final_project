            "Okay, but not gonna lie that's a pretty funny interaction of enchanted equipment. All the other wizards are giggling at that one guy who used these pieces together and royally crippled himself.  Not me; I'm empathetic. But imagine it in Faerun. \"I've got this sweet set of gear and I'm gong to wreck faces.\" And then it blows up in his face.  It's giving me a chuckle thinking about the risks of magic in much the same way that early game Morrowind has a wizard fall from the sky to his death in front of you. He had created a very nifty Scroll of Icarian Flight that increases acrobatics by 1000 for 7 seconds,  and with it one can leap an astoundingly high and long distance.  But the effect wears off before landing,  and so you die on impact if you use that magic without special care. There's cautionary humor there. \n\nAnyway,  I haven't played with Heat, but I bet you could tinker with your build to get it at least somewhat useful. Best of luck.",

Use Bloodlust Elixirs instead of casting Haste on yourself so you don't have to worry about Heat breaking concentration and making you lethargic. Or have someone else cast the Haste.",

See full list in the wiki here:\n\nhttps://bg3.wiki/wiki/Constitution\n\nFor advantage on only Concentration saves, you can use the Elixir of Peerless Focus.",
            "I'm currently toward the end of a HM run with a monoclass GOO Warlock and 16 CON and War Caster have been enough to provide (at least for my standards) an acceptable amount of concentration retention.\n\nIf you really hate losing concentration, there's always the [Robe of Supreme Defences](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Robe_of_Supreme_Defences), which would add your spell casting modifier to all of your saving throws, but it's always felt like overkill to me. Other people have already mentioned various pieces of gear that provide advantage on CON saves or concentration checks which would eliminate the need to take War Caster.\n\nThere are also other ways to improve your chances of keeping concentration. Since the DC of the concentration check is based off damage taken, equipping either of the gloves ([Hellrider's Pride](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Hellrider%27s_Pride) or [The Reviving Hands](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/The_Reviving_Hands)) that provide Blade Ward on your party healer will reduce the difficulty of many of your concentration checks. Similarly, the Bless effect provided by [The Whispering Promise](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/The_Whispering_Promise) (or, you know, Bless), will also boost your concentration saves. General bonuses to saving throws will also help, especially against things like getting knocked prone or being held/paralysed, which will all immediately end concentration without any additional save checks. Similarly, items that just outright prevent these conditions (like [Boots of Striding](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Boots_of_Striding) or the [Ring of Free Action](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Ring_of_Free_Action)) will also help.",

            "The best way to not lose Concentration is to have a +8 or more to Con saves, advantage on said saves and be a half long to reroll 1s. That setup makes it a 1/8000 chance you fail a generic 10DC Con save, though higher DC from higher damage will always be a risk. \n\nIf you're not a halfling, the best you're gonna be able to get is a 1/400 chance to fail via an item that gives advantage on saves like Spidersilk Armour and then pump your saves as high as you can get them via Resilient: Con feat, Safeguard Shield/Absolute's Protector, Ring/Cloak of Protection and then any lategame equipment you can grab. \n\nThe absolute best-case scenario for maintaining concentration is an halfling Paladin with Resilient: Con and the Amulet of Greater Health which would give you +6 Con, +4 Proficiency, +3 Aura of Protection, +1 Ring of Protection, +1 Cloak of Protection, +1 Helm of Balduran, +2 Armour of Agility giving a +18 to Con Saves, Advantage from the Amulet of Greater Health and rerolls on 1s from being a halfling.",
