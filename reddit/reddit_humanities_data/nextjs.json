The app router documentation isn't written well compared to the old pages router.

        "content": "\nI wanted to share my journey with Next.js and Vercel, which I've been using for the past three years. I started learning web development at 16 with just HTML, and I remember feeling overwhelmed with the complexities of installing Node.js, pnpm, GitHub, and resolving dependencies for frontend frameworks.\n\nGrowing up in Singapore, I wasn't allowed to have a credit card, and my teachers discouraged its use. This made exploring cloud services even more daunting, especially with news about people overspending or misconfiguring their cloud setups.\n\nInitially, I didn't like the pages router in Next.js and decided to stick with Flask for development and hosting, using Railway for my database. Managing database migrations was a hassle, but it was my only option at 16. The pages router felt clunky at that time. Eventually, I got banned from Railway, which forced me to migrate to Replit. There, I had to deal with overwriting Linux commands, changing network configurations to keep the app online from the command line, and finding workarounds for unavailable pip packages. It quickly became unsustainable.\n\nAt the time, many influencers advised against using Vercel, so I avoided it. But when Vercel released the app router and one-click deployment, I decided to give it a try for both my app router and Flask apps. It was a breeze\u2014every time I committed code, it got deployed instantly. Migrating my Railway database to Neon was also smooth, thanks to the excellent documentation for Next.js.\n\nIt was easy to transition from the page router to the app router. Influential YouTubers like Coding with Antonio and Web Dev Cody provided great insights into this framework, and I found myself enjoying it more and more. I've been coding with Next.js and Vercel ever since.\n\nI wanted to take this post to express my gratitude to this community and the Vercel team for making things simple and efficient for teens like me to explore new technologies. Thank you!\n\nFeel free to share your experiences or tips if you've had a similar journey. Let's keep learning and growing together!\n\nCheers,  sven",
