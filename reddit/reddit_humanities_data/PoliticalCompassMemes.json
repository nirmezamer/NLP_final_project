            "I finally got around to watching the debate (I shouldn't have), and OH MY FUCKING GOD! I think I might have suffered brain-damage. Trump was just ignoring the questions and going off on Biden on irrelevant matters, and Biden was just uttering a bunch of incoherent nonsense. They didn\u2019t even make any effort to make their cases and simply spent the debate just insulting each other. I've heard more coherent arguments between children arguing on the playground than whatever those two senile fucks were going on about.\n\nAlright, schizo meltdown over. Time to bust out the booze and max out those alcoholism stats.",

He has no shot of winning, and even if he did win he is utterly incompetent now. That doesn't mean they have to vote for Trump. Nobody expects them to.
