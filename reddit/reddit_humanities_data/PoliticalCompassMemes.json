            "Funnily enough, many of the more fringe left-wing\u2014genuine communists and Marxists, not current-thing-supporters or slick establishment liberals\u2014*hate* Wikipedia because it's perceived as having a neoliberal, pro-Western homogeneity slant. Wikipedia is good for things that are objectively true: e.g., mathematics, astronomy, and physics; iffy on history and culture; and should be avoided for any contemporary, controversial political subject.",

Even though it's distinguished from Soviet style communist. \n\nAdd: Sorry I didn't know the word is stigmatization, now I know it. I just felt if they're Marxists who focus on culture study... then they should self identified as cultural Marxist?",

            "I'm sorry but what the fuck is anger-inducing about this, exactly? These are accurate descriptions of these positions and belief? They also have literally nothing to do with what the wojak is saying?\n\nThis is a dumb fucking post and you should probably feel bad for having made it. The page for classical liberalism doesn't call you a fucking fascist nazi, so I genuinely have ***no*** idea why you're drawing these connections to yourself, unless you're actually an alt-right far-right person who believes in cultural marxism.\n\nThe post is truly breaking my brain. I'm starting to think most of you are literally just NPCs who go around finding anything to be angry at.\n\nJust indulge in some reading comprehension.
