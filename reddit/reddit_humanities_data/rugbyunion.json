            "Obviously theres a whole lot of beautiful rugby in this montage, but his first try is just ridiculous. Hes like 85 kilos and he batters his way over the line like a 120 kilo lock. Pound for pound he may be the strongest player Ive ever seen.",
            "To be honest, he did do 2 mistakes : he was countered and sent a kick in the dead zone.\nBut I believe it is just a way to avoid us discovering that he is from krypton",
            "You know how businesses with a monopoly can be forcibly split up I think we should set up a complaint to split up DuPont, Ntamack and Ramos",
            "He's clearly the best 9 ever ( the idea JGP was best in the world is hilarious) and the best player in world right now.\n\nIn my mind he's best player I've ever seen, too",
            "He's just unplayable at the moment. Something else I noticed in this montage was how good Willis looked as well, he's never leaving Toulouse is he ",
            "Only thing missing is a jackal and one of his defensive rushes, but it's scary how well rounded every part of his game is now. Was rooting for anyone but Toulouse to win this year but not much you can do against such class",
            "Side note but I love Lartot and Yachvili commentary soooo much. They're way better than the Canal+ guys.",
            "i think he made one mistake in the game, so a bad one for Dupont :p",
