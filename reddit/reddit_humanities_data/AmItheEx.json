            "in case this gets deleted and the bot didn't catch it:\n\n\n\n\nAm I (26 M) Overreacting by Ending Things with My GF (26 F) After a Fight About Her Not Texting Enough?\n\nI\u2019m (26 M) feeling pretty lost and need some advice. Last Wednesday, June 19th, my girlfriend (26 F) and I had a huge fight and it\u2019s been eating at me ever since. Here\u2019s what happened:\n\nMy girlfriend was busy at work and didn\u2019t text or call me much during her working hours. However, she did text me when she got off and even called me, but I didn\u2019t pick up. When I called her back, I was with my friend on a motorcycle, so we couldn\u2019t hear each other. She told me, \u201cBebe, I cannot hear you. Can we talk later?\u201d (Her hearing isn\u2019t great, so she struggles with low voices).\n\nShe texted me again when she got home, but then there was radio silence. This really upset me. Her family was out of town, so she had to cook and clean after work. She finally texted me again around 9:30 pm when she was done with everything. I questioned her about what she was doing between 7 pm and 9:30 pm, and she got really annoyed, saying she was doing chores and had a headache, which is why she didn\u2019t text me.\n\nHer tone angered me, so I hung up on her, accusing her of always starting arguments. She tried calling me numerous times, but I kept hanging up. She also sent several messages apologizing and begging me to understand that she didn\u2019t mean to sound that way.\n\nMy ego was hurt, and I was firm in my decision that I didn\u2019t want her anymore, accusing her of changing her behavior whenever she\u2019s at the office and suspecting she might be interested in someone else. Despite her many apologies and reassurances, I threatened to block her if she didn\u2019t stop texting me. Her last message to me was, \u201cOkay, I tried my best to persuade you and to save this relationship, but I will not try to contact you in any manner now.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve been together for 2 years, and she\u2019s never cheated or anything like that. Hearing her say that she won\u2019t try to contact me hurt a lot. Now I\u2019m sitting here, feeling regretful and unsure of what to do next. Did I overreact? Should I reach out to her and try to make things right? Any advice would be appreciated.\n\nTL;DR:\u00a0Had a fight with my GF of 2 years because she didn\u2019t text or call much during work, accused her of changing behavior and suspecting someone else. She apologized a lot, but my ego was hurt, and I ended things. Now feeling regretful and unsure of what to do next.",

            "So let me get this straight. She didn't text while she was \\*at work\\*. She texted and called after she got off work, but \\*he\\* didn't pick up. And knowing she struggles with hearing, decides to call her back when he's on a motorcycle with his friend.\n\nShe texted when she got home but had shit to do so obviously isn't calling/texting while she's cooking. Texted him after she was done with that, and he instantly accuses her by questioning what she was doing. Has the nerve to then accuse her of starting arguments, like dude? You started the argument. Then hangs up on her like an asshole as if she did anything wrong.\n\nShe tries to apologize despite having done nothing wrong. He's finally getting the \"communication\" he's been craving but then accuses her of liking someone else because she doesn't text him when she's at work. Yet, he also recognizes that she's not a cheater. He breaks up with her, and she's like whatever, I won't fight for this if you won't. Now he regrets it?\n\nWhat I'm missing here is when did \\*he\\* initiate any text or call? Did he put all the communication responsibility on her and then get upset? Wow. She's good to be rid of him.",

            "I've been In a situation ship for the past 6 years. I was upfront about what I wanted from the get go but things just became very confusing. From the beginning it presented as we were buidling up a relationship but just not ready for that titled yet. By the time I realised what was happening I already loved and was binded with him. I made excuses since he eventually would say he loved me, that he wanted to move in together, that his relationship title aversion was because his ex wife and ex fiance cheating. And finally we got to a point where we were 'exclusive romantic partners'' he told me I wasn't just a fwb or fuck buddy and in my eyes we didn't act that way but I guess I was just naive. \n\nI saw him new years day. I made a mistake and brought up the relationship after he said I was his \"kind of\" girlfriend to a friend. I misread and thought it meant something. He backtracked tho and took back wanting to move in together even tho he told me early that day he wanted to. Things were tense. We saw each other again the next week and he flip flopped again. Made it more about him being stressed with house hunting and that he wanted to get back to the goal of living together. I was anxious and asked for reassurance if he wanted to stop seeing me or didn't love me anymore. He reassured me he still loved me and would never ghost me again and would properly end things if he wanted to end things.\n\nThat was the last I saw him. The last 6 months he's been claiming to be deployed. He still told me he missed me, he loved me, he told me he finally found a house and put a bid on it, that he wanted to spend valentines day with me, etc. Etc. I lost my dad at this time and he reassured me he would be there for me when he returned. It was the one thing getting me through it.\n\nSuddenly I couldn't reach him anymore and my calls didn't go through. I wasn't concerned because he loses service sometimes overseas so I just gave him space and occasionally said I missed him or sent memes.\n\nBut as time passed I got more worried. Well today I got a bad gut feeling and snooped. I found another girl and she had posted a tag with him saying they loved each other and were sharing their baby registry. I don't think he was ever even deployed as she said they had been official since February although he was leading me on still through April. He told her I was just his fuck buddy and we were over. That he only kept talking to me while they were together because I threatened S H if he left me. This just shattered my heart because I never threatened him or anyone ever with that . I just asked him to please tell me if he didn't want to see me again and not ghost me like he had once in the past. I stupidly thought we had moved past that after he saw how much it hurt me the first time and literally promised not to do it again the last i saw him. I'm just really struggling tho, I feel like a big clown. The love of my life is laughing at me with his new love when all i did was trust and love him. I really believed I was loved and meant something for once =(\n\nTldr: ghosted from an exclusive not relationship relationship after 6 years. I feel hurt and betrayed but don't know if I'm even right to\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
