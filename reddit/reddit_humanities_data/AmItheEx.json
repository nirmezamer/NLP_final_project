People are not following the rules about what is acceptable to post here, so I thought some clarification was in order.\n\n* **Posts must be about people who can't tell or accept that they have been dumped.**\n\nPlease do not add posts where people are confused about whether they should dump their partner (see r/relationships etc.) or who's the asshole in a conflict (visit r/AITAH etc.), etc. The matter at hand should be crossposts of users asking questions like:\n\n   * \"she had a baby with someone else and told me 18x that it's over, but I'm not sure: is it over?\"\n\n   * \"he hasn't called or texted me in 7 months and married his yoga instructor, have I been dumped?\"\n\n   * \"I've been served divorce papers and she emigrated to Bolivia, how can I get her back?\"\n\n* **Posts must be about romantic partners, not other types of relationships:** no children ditching shitty parents or vice versa (see r/JustNoFamily etc.) or downtrodden employees embittered by an unjust firing from their crapola jobs (visit r/antiwork etc.). \n\n* **Posts must include the post text:** either the automod will catch it and put it in a comment, you copy-and-paste it into the body of your post, or you paste a link into the body and copy-and-paste the text into a comment. Don't make people have to hunt for the content.\n\nPlease note that all the buzzwords mentioned here - \"crosspost\", \"don't realize\", \"can't accept\", \"romantic partner\" are all contained in the sub's description and have been for a while, so you can't say it was ambiguous or unclear.\n\n***Posts that do not follow these rules will be removed.***\n\nAnd a word about comments: quite a few of you are responding to the OP as if they were the writer of the crosspost. I personally don't care if people are commenting as if the OP were the OOP, but just a reminder: the people crossposting here are 99.9% of the time not the OP of the original post. *Your comments are not reaching the OOPs.* If you still want to respond to the OOP, rock on, but you're just shouting into the void.\n\nHope this helps!",

I honestly think her wife knew it would be a notification sent to her due to how she has manipulated her in the past. She is likely not actually searching Tinder. I mean, why sign up for gold immediately? It's weird. She is likely trying to poke her into coming home by punishing her mentally. All of this over not going to the restaurant of her choice when she first asked. Hopefully she runs far far away from this abusive mess. This divorce should have happened a long time ago when she refused therapy. Edited after noticing the genders.",

Your life is not meant to be spent looking up to someone who looks down on you.",

She wanted that notification to hit OP's email. This is just an attempt to manipulate OP to come home and fight more. Wife doesn't think OP will leave her. I hope that OP proves her wrong on that."
