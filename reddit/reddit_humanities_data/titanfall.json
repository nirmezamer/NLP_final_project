        "content": "Hey there pilots o/\n\nThis is just a quick message to let you know that the Titanfall has moved to https://titanfall.wiki.gg/\n\nThe reason for the move being that _Fandom_, the company that hosts many gaming wikis, has recently been caught up in multiple controversies regarding turning wiki pages into ads, auto-generating incorrect random trivia questions, and making the wiki near unusable without an adblock.\n\nFor more info on Fandom in general check out [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcfuA_UAz3I) or [this Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fandom_\\(website\\)#Controversies).\n\nHence the Titanfall wiki is moving places. At this point also a huge shout-out to /u/The_Sniperstock for orchestrating the move.\n\nYou can follow up on their activity including the following posts:\n\n- Initial announcement: https://redd.it/1aq9sni\n- Announcement of the new wiki https://redd.it/1b1qlxl\n- First update post on the new wiki: https://redd.it/1b4i27x\n\nThat's all for now, give [the new wiki](https://titanfall.wiki.gg/) some love <3\n\nAnd as always, see you on the Frontier, pilots o7",

Like good for you you won by cheating. Want a cookie? That wouldnt make me feel good at all knowing I won because I had hacks. For me the whole point of playing is to get better and win that way.",
