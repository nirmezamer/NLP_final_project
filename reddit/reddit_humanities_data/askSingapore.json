        "content": "My sec sch buddy used to be my best friend. Now, all his relationships are dying off, including our friendship\n\nHe's a banker who takes it all in - whether it be savings, insurance, investment and so on. And he's doing damn well too, always earning 5-digit monthly. Lives in a beautiful condo and upgrading to landed soon. Expensive car. Rolex. Married to chio fellow ex-banker. Got 2 kids\n\nBut he is also an extreme workaholic. He missed out on the last 5 clique meet-ups with the rest of our buddies. When I met him 1-on-1 recently for drinks, his eyes were wet as he admitted most of his friendships are dead now because he can't stop working\n\nHe brings his laptop for vacations. He can't watch movies in the cinema anymore. He has to plan his weekends damn carefully to maximise his time for meeting clients. Despite having in-laws to help + a helper, he isn't bringing his wife to dates, or his kids out to play. He hardly even plays with his kids at home. He's also getting obese due to his high stress lifestyle\n\nAll in all, he admits to me he is slowly destroying his life (and he might already have irreparably harmed his relationships). But he can't help it - he cannot relax or sit still, he simply must work and talk to clients. One time his wife got extremely f-king pissed off with him, he agreed to turn off his phone for 3 hours so he can truly spend time with her. The result? He lost out on a 5-digit commission because client couldn't contact him\n\nAs I sat and drank with him, he had at least 1 call every 10 mins\n\nI had no words to offer him, beyond telling him that money can't buy time, and that he might be an old man before he realizes that his relationships are worth more than his commissions\n\nDoes anyone have any similar stories? Did your friend/family get out of that hole?",

Ive worked weekends and public holidays willingly, but thats because it looked good when they calculated my variable bonus (I could get 25% more just by talking in meetings and typing on computer? Sure!) and my boss was kind enough to offer me 1.5* time in lieu for the public holidays",

Even while attending concerts, I was getting texts and calls every few minutes. I think what I was most upset was not being able to attend a Coldplay concert back then even though I bought a ticket for it 6 months back. Forfeited it didn't get cash back because my schedule was uncertain till a few days before the concert. Couldn't meet friends, couldn't hangout as much with family, friends were sweet and understanding however, came down to the airport when I landed after one of my work trips to catch up with me. And whilst on work trips I was too busy to even text any friends or family regularly. Couldn't hold up any relationship too because schedules to travel were always last minute and uncertain. Had depression towards the end of that crazy year, then came COVID lockdown which I was so grateful for. Finally got to stay home, be around my family, do some cooking and hav time to myself. After that crazy period decided to move to a different industry and have been remote working since. Flexi hours and heaps of leave days. No complaints",

My helper has been fortunate thus far, with little of the war spilling into her hometown yet. However, a Burmese painter who was working on my house a while back, struggled with the effects of the war.\n\nHe started the day with a huge smile of his face, a jovial person all around. A couple hours later, he received news that his village has been bombed. I watched over the next few hours as he despaired and his eyes filled with pain from not knowing the status of his family. We told him to take all the time he needed to breathe, to make attempts to get in touch with his loved ones. His employer brought a couple workers later that day to finish up his work, and to console him too (by then it was confirmed his family escaped, but his newly built home was reduced to rubble).\n\nBeyond giving her money, the only thing we can do is to show and display acts of empathy. If she needs to speak to her loved ones, let her do it even if her work is not done. If she needs some time to breathe, pray, or seek help, give it to her. \n\nDepending on her religion, religious communities are a good place to start. There should be a handful of Burmese in Singapore FB groups too. If she belongs to an ethnic minority, it may be possible to find social groups made of that ethnic group."
