Living my golden years, but definitely feeling a bit lonely.\n\nI love travelling to interesting places in Asia, cats, dogs, manga and anime. I would really like to get into D&D - been super hyped about it since I finished BG3. Let me know if you are looking for an extra player and someone to fill a vacant spot in your ongoing campaign.\n\nAlso wouldn\u2019t mind finding some folks to do sports with or just share a cool beer on a warm day.\nThanks for reading & Happy CNY to everyone!\n\nHope the Year of Dragon will bring all redditors some much needed friendships and connections!",

Unless you think consistency = obsession.\n\nMy job is nothing worth talking about. Just the usual 9-6. Supply chain if you\u2019re really interested in knowing.\n\nI like eating good food too so I guess it balances out. Just no spicy.\n\nI *love* travelling, though it\u2019s only once a year. $$$. Been travelling since young so it\u2019s deeply part of my personality. Just recently did my first ever solo trip. Not sure where to go this year.\n\nI also like to just nua at home and just use my phone. Not really into always going out that type so I guess I\u2019m more of a homebody.\n\nActually, I realised my life is kinda boring otherwise. Not that happening."
