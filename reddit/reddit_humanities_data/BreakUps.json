I\u2019m in the same boat. Not really sure what the heck happened since she never told me. But after reflecting and seeing things from her POV I see I have some issues I need to workout. Even if it takes me breaking myself and putting myself back together. It\u2019s what I\u2019ll do. \n\nThen sometimes nothing you ever did wrong and that person just lost feelings. It happens.

        "content": "Earlier this week my fianc\u00e9e/long-term girlfriend (27F) broke up with me (28M), with our wedding approaching in 2 month's time. After 14 years together, she told me she had fallen out of love with me the past few years and that I didn't give her the type of love that she wanted. Although I pleaded with her to reconsider and told her I would change, it was unfortunately too late. It's put us in a sticky situation, where we have a significant amount of funds locked up in the wedding and the current home that we share. I also start my a new job next week, where I told the team that I was planning to get married to the love of my life/my high school sweetheart of 14 years. So I'm not sure how I'm going to break the news to them and I don't know how I'm going to cope. I wanted to create a post in dedication of our relationship and to honour what we had. We've dated since the age of 14, just two young kids not knowing what love is. But she truly taught me the meaning of love throughout the past 14 years. Although she broke my heart and put me in a tough situation, I can't even stay mad at her. Because I care for her so much and was the one who hurt her first. I just wish I had a second chance to fix things because I know every single mistake that I did wrong and voiced it to her, but it was too late. She said these feelings had been compounding on her and the past few years she had to compromise for me, because she loved me. I know this decision has been the hardest decision for her to ever make and I appreciate her bravery. This is also my fault because I know she could never really communicate to me, because she was always in fear that I would be mad. But she would regularly hint at these things and the time apart has made realise what a fool I was. Whilst it may be plainly obvious, I want to let you guys know what I did wrong, so that others don't make the same mistake:  \n\u2022 I was too comfortable in a 14 year old relationship, so I was complacent and I took her for granted  \n\u2022 I stopped putting in the effort to plan dates for us  \n\u2022 I stopped holding her hand everywhere we walked  \n\u2022 I wasn't by her side and support her through her toughest times  \n\u2022 I didn't buy her flowers  \n\u2022 I stopped kissing her goodbye every time I left the house  \n\u2022 I stopped hugging and kissing her every time I see her  \n\u2022 I stopped tucking her in at night and cuddling her to sleep  \n\u2022 I was always on my phone instead of spending quality time with her  \n\u2022 I stopped having deep conversations with her during dinner  \n\u2022 I stopped taking her to watch my basketball games, even though she was my biggest fan  \n\u2022 I refused to participate in the hobbies that she enjoyed, even though she would always happily do what I enjoy  \n\u2022 I declined to watch her favourite shows/movies. On occasions where I didn't decline, I'd just end up on my phone  \n\u2022 I didn't help her with planning our wedding, whilst she had to do balance it with her stressful workload  \n\u2022 I stopped reminding her and reassuring her that she is the most beautiful and amazing girl in my life  \n\u2022 Every time I made a snack in the kitchen, I stopped offering some  \n\u2022 When our dog peed inside the house, I would blame her  \n\u2022 I just made too many excuses in our relationship\n\nThere's countless more things, but I wanted to be extremely harsh on myself. Because I haven't been up to a standard that she deserved. It's not that I never did the above things for her in the past, it's more that I just stopped doing it. I wanted to spend the rest of my life making it up to her, because I truly love her. She is the most wonderful person in this world. She's kind. She's smart. She's absolutely stunning. She made me feel at peace. She reassured me when times were tough. She made me strive to grow my career. She devoted half of her life and saw the best in me. \n\nI'll forever hold onto the idea of having her, because she was the best thing in my life. I don't regret our relationship, I only regret letting the best person I know, walk out of my life. I have nobody else but myself to blame. So to everyone in relationships, I know you can get complacent/comfortable in long-term relationships but please don't give up on your significant others. Don't live your life with regret like me, knowing that you'd never be able to make it up to them. Try your hardest for them and maintain that spark. Let them be the motivation that keeps you going. Count your blessings everyday and thank god that you have them in your life. Reassure them and support them through their darkest hours. Hug them whenever you get a chance. Hold their hand wherever you go. Make each other better. Spend quality time with them and don't waste your time being glued to your phone. Recognise when they need help and be there for them no matter what. Stop making excuses for yourself and seize every opportunity that's given. Love them with all your heart.\n\nWhilst others have told me to never give up on her and t o pursue her, she's already made up her mind and has started organising the logistics of our separation. I hope that one day we cross paths again and the flame from 14 years ago reignites myself. But I know this is the outcome that I deserved. \n\n",

            "I\u2019m so sorry that things went down this way. Unfortunately, this is how some relationships end. One partner gets too comfortable and stops showing up in ways they used to in the past. It\u2019s common and it happens. I\u2019m nowhere NEAR the length of 14 years but it is outstanding to hear that you guys were together for that long, being high school sweethearts. I can\u2019t begin to imagine all the \u201cstorms\u201d you guys had to weather and fights to stay together. \n\nI don\u2019t know if she\u2019ll rethink her choice since she\u2019s felt like this for a while and comprised for you. Maybe she will, with time apart and that\u2019ll make her decide for sure to walk away or maybe give it a go again but with changes, one thing I\u2019ve learned from this sub is that people who were together for a decent amount of time sometimes still end up talking after the break up and things slowly pick up but that isn\u2019t after some time apart and definitely doesn\u2019t happen a lot. She may just be extremely burnt out with your behavior and your attempts to make things better, to her are probably just a plain old \u201cim good thanks\u201d, maybe..I don\u2019t know. \n\nBut it\u2019s good that you see what you could have done better. It does show that you have compassion and you can be committed to change and showing up better in the future either with her or someone else. Hold onto that OP. Some people just blame their partner for everything, but the willingness that you have taken to acknowledge your faults. That\u2019s definitely worth a lot. At least to me it is. Remember though, relationships require TWO people. I\u2019m not saying she did 100% of the damage but it\u2019s two people. Hinting at things is good but I don\u2019t know, was it enough? I mean yes, now that the relationship is over, you have the shades lifted and you can see what happened but did you guys ever have a conversation about how she felt or started to feel prior to the break up? \n\nWork on yourself, take it day by day. Some say distract yourself and stay busy. Which may help some people but do what works best for you. Feel the emotions you\u2019re going through. 14 years is a long time. Assuming you were each other\u2019s firsts for EVERYTHING, you both naturally have a heavy attachment to each other. Even if she\u2019s mentally checked out. I\u2019m sure it hurts her and stings a lot. Of course in time she may want to try again or maybe she won\u2019t. But right now you should focus on yourself and try to handle this situation the best way you can. Don\u2019t act impulsively. Don\u2019t beat yourself up too much, acknowledge your mistakes and learn how to show up better. \n\nIt\u2019s going to hit hard. Your going to feel sad, your going to be angry, you might even go through a small stage of depression. You\u2019re going to blame yourself. You might even resent her a little bit, may not feel like it now but it happens. I blamed myself for a lot of my relationship issues and now I still do. It hurts, but you learn that dwelling on it does NOTHING. You can sit on it all you want. But you have to make these changes. You have to want to change, not for her but for yourself. You\u2019re going to go through it all. I can\u2019t tell you how long it\u2019ll take to feel better, but I can say it does, and that everyone\u2019s healing time length is different. Don\u2019t rebound. Don\u2019t start hooking up with everything, don\u2019t drink to numb the pain. Don\u2019t do drugs to escape. Don\u2019t do any of that unhealthy stuff. Turn Pain into medicine. Don\u2019t worry about telling your team about what went on between you and your ex. It\u2019s not anyone\u2019s interest right now but your own. How will you cope? I personally always recommend a therapist. I have one and it makes things easier for me. I work out, it helps burn off anything that would bother me at night and leaves me tired. Helps my body get into shape as well.  But anyways about the therapist, I would do it and look for one now since you still have your head on your shoulders. Start journaling and dotting down how you feel, if you prefer an app I use \u201cDay One\u201d on the AppStore, it\u2019s got a blue ribbon on it. Helps me out a ton. Do some things that make you happy for a bit, it\u2019s still gonna fucking hurt. But it takes it away even if it\u2019s 0.01%. Spending time with friends, a hobby, goin on a walk, even just recording yourself talking about how you feel helps. \n\nMost importantly I\u2019m going to assume this was your first relationship. If I\u2019m wrong disregard this. Being that this was your first relationship, it\u2019s hard to get everything right on the first go around. Even being together for 14 years. It can still be hard, especially if you haven\u2019t had any other relationships at least to compare the good and the bad. Or even if you don\u2019t have a working relationship to base yours off of. And when I say \u201cworking\u201d I mean a couple who is healthy, who can act as a role-model for you guys. A lot of the time we spend time thinking \u201cI don\u2019t want to end up like that couple\u201d when sometimes we should frame our thinking to \u201cI want to be like that couple\u201d (of course assuming they are a healthy relationship) \n\nYou got this man. I\u2019m sorry if my advice wasn\u2019t the very best, but I hope there was something in there you could take away. We all make mistakes. Remember it\u2019s your first time Living."

I think the biggest thing you should reflect on is if you will resent her for her actions. If it bothers you (which is a very valid feeling) then I would stay away.\u00a0",
            "Sex is different to everyone.  I can't do it without caring about the other person,  but others can.  It never feels good to hear about your ex having sex and I would recommend not asking for that information while you're trying to heal from a breakup.",
            "Sex for me is a very personal and intimate, so I personally wouldn't try to work things out with someone that goes out and starts fucking the moment they're single. Its a way of coping with a loss and it's pretty common, but its just a total no go for me. That shit would be on my mind constantly.",
            "Hey man, I don't think there's one answer to this. But if I were to put a bet on it, I wouldn't consider her having sex with someone else \"moving on\" necessarily. If people had to be \"moved on\" or \"over\" their partner before having sex with someone else then cheating or threesomes would never happen. I would say, she probably felt exactly how she said - she was lonely and wanted some physical contact from *somewhere*. It makes sense.\n\nAnd at the exact same time, it makes sense that it hurt you. You don't need to understand what happened there in order for your feelings of hurt from that to be valid. The reality is, she had sex with someone else right after a breakup. Regardless of reason, that would hurt most people. It doesn't need to make sense, and it's fair that you feel that way, and also she's probably telling the truth about why she did it. All of those things can be true at the same time. I wish you well, and I would express to her how you feel. We expect logic to line up with our feelings, and sometimes it doesn't. Logic and emotions are two separate things, and if it hurt you that she slept with someone else, then it hurt you that she slept with someone else. It doesn't need to be deeper than that. But if you guys are talking again, I'd express how you feel to her.\n\nI feel for you and wish you well man \u2764\ufe0f",
            "Aye OP.. If I were you. Just drop her.\n\nLike ask yourself \" do you really want to slam that after she got with other dudes?\" Idk man to me... Respect and love yourself to walk away. Let someone else deal with her.\n\ud83e\udd37",
            "Fuck anyone that moves on that fast. I\u2019m so sorry, I am pretty sure my ex has already slept with someone too after one week. It kinda makes it easier to move on when you realize they are for the streets and there is 100% someone better coming to you eventually.",
            "My ex started to date a guy a week and a half after we broke up. We had just broken up after being 16 years together. \n\nIt's insane how quickly that can ruin your relationship with your ex. It did with mine. We actually had a pretty nice friendship going within that week and a half. And two weeks after she told me she was dating this guy she comes home (I still hadn't moved without yet) at 5:00 in the morning after a \"date\" with the guy. She technically didn't come home yet as his car was blocking mine as I was getting ready to go to work and they were too busy to notice me standing there waiting for them to finish making out. \n\nFrom that moment on (sadly because we have a kid together) every text message is either yes, no, or the shortest response possible. I also explicitly told her that I have zero desire to see or hear from her. To text only. \n\nWhat this taught me was that what kept her around the 16 years was the convenience of being with me. The sex, paying her bills, the restaurants, etc. I was easily replaced as soon as those things slow down. She wasted half of my life. My late teens, All of my 20's and half of my 30s. \n\nIt's hard to come to that realization because that part that still has feelings for her tries to grab the wheel and steer. There's that side to you that you just have to put a figurative pillow over its face and snuff it out. It was hard for me and it is also going to be hard for you. Just stay strong. \n\nWhat the 5 months that I've been single has taught me was that same impulsiveness that she has to just sleep with men carries over to the rest of her life and she's never going to feel content. She will be miserable. Even if sex comes easy to her, she knows deep down that man will have sex with anything that allows them to. She won't find a connection because all she will find is guys I want to use her body.  Never showed her that you're miserable if you choose to keep in contact. \n\nSorry for the long response, but this is something I am living through right now as well.",
            "Same exact thing happened to me. She slept with her \u201cfriend\u201d and coworker 8 days after breaking up with me. We dated 3 years.",
            "As a girl who\u2019s been through her fair share of post-BU hookups and dates, I can confidently tell you she doesn\u2019t love you. She has codependency issues.\n\nI had a recent fallout with a man who is my world and I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of being around another guy, let alone kiss or go any further. That\u2019s when I knew I really love this man. I still have latent attachment and codependency issues. What\u2019s different this time around (compared to my previous relationships) is the idea of hurting him \u2014 cuts me deeply.\n\nI realize that the previous guys I\u2019ve broken with, I THOUGHT I was devastated because of love for them. It turns out, I was just incapable of being alone and used other men\u2019s company out of fear and selfish reasons.\n\nWhen a woman loves and respects a man, she can\u2019t mentally picture herself next to another dude - no matter how much pain and anguish she\u2019s in. \n\nYour ex doesn\u2019t love you."
