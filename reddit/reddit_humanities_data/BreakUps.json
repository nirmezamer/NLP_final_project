        "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI just experienced the shock of my life\u2014my girlfriend of 2.5 years suddenly broke up with me. We met while teaching English in a foreign country, and these past two years with her have unquestionably been the best of my life. She brought me out of a really low place, and we shared countless incredible experiences traveling and exploring together.\n\nShe has always been very expressive about her love for me, constantly telling me how much she loves me, how she never wants to lose me, and how happy I make her. These heartfelt conversations continued until very recently. In fact, we had a small argument not long ago, and she messaged me afterward to say how amazing she thinks I am and how she never wants to lose me, apologizing for the argument.\n\nBut today, she walked in, asked me to sit down, and broke up with me. The reasons are complicated, largely related to her future plans and current mental state. I am absolutely devastated beyond belief. I can\u2019t even begin to describe the feeling, but I\u2019m sure many of you understand.\n\nWe live in an apartment with a 2-year lease, and we've only been here for 6 months. I\u2019m staying, while she will move in with her parents for a while. The walls are covered with photos of us and our life together, filled with so many incredible memories. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to keep living here. How am I supposed to wake up every day in the bed we've shared for years? How am I supposed to use our kitchen appliances, knowing all the awesome memories we\u2019ve made cooking together?\n\nI am devastated, terrified, hurt, and bewildered. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you.",

It\u2019s almost 3 months after the breakup of a 2 year relationship for me and I\u2019m still in a rut I\u2019m finally starting to climb out of. Similar situation with how my partner expressed so much love, shared so much hope for the future, heartfelt conversations constantly, then broke up out of nowhere. \n\nThe best thing I\u2019ve found is to talk, talk to friends, family, journal, do not hide or ignore your feelings. Pretending to go on like everything is okay/bottling up your feelings will cause you so many future issues that will likely take longer to get out of then if you attempt to process through things now. It\u2019s okay to distract yourself and stay busy but do not try to be constantly busy to where you can\u2019t even think about things anymore.

While she was collecting her clothes, she started crying and said it was hard for her. She also said that I had become much more attractive, mentioning my \u201cglow-up.\u201d This led to us having really passionate sex multiple times, and she stayed for 5 hours. The next day, she texted me saying she had \u201csex flashbacks\u201d and sent nude pictures of herself, wanting to meet again.\n\nI told her it wasn\u2019t a good idea for us to see each other again as I wanted to move on. She said she understood and that maybe our paths would cross again in the future.

            "As some have already said I doubt you will hear from her if she's blocked on everything.  I also think she might feel it would be disrespectful to you to reach out after (from the sounds of it atleast you've already told her no in that department since the breakup).  Have you considered reaching out to her to check on her?  Maybe don't go in balls blazing asking to get back together but see how she is doing and feeling ATM.  Did you ever have a chance in the end of the relationship to discuss why said incidence of cheating happened?  If not that could be a topic to help you either move on or begin healing the relationship.  I can only speak to the female perspective but if I were in your shoes I'd want to give things a chance given the amount of time and effort that had already been put into the relationship.  That being said though I would just be cautious and consider both her feelings and yours in your decision.",

If you really love her, learn to process your emotions and communicate, sadly telepathy doesn't work with humans.\n\nTalk openly with her and take things slowly. Wishing you all the best."

As I'm getting my bearings, trying to figure out what the hell is going on, someone touches my shoulder. I don't remember who it was, but it was some divine otherworldly being. He told me that he knew I was always so sad, that I lost the woman I loved, and that it wasn't my fault. Anyway, I'm gonna cut to the chase. Long story short, he asked me if I wanted to look at a different reality, where I'm still with her. I said yes, so he showed me. I was indeed with her. We were in our house, cooking dinner together, making a list of things we need, ya know normal stuff. He told me that we got married, and that we were living together. I could hardly believe it. And just when I thought things couldn't be better, a kid comes rushing from out of one of the rooms. My daughter! We had a kid together! It was so beautiful. I watched myself hug my wife and child, smiling and as happy as can be. We had a home, a life together, and we were happy. We were so happy! The last thing I remember before I woke up is asking the being, if she was happy. If I did right by her, and if things continued to work out. He told me that we would be married for 67 years, with great great grandchildren, and we grew old and finally died together. I woke up crying a lot, like I still am as I'm writing this. It seems that in this life, in this reality, we weren't meant to stay together. But at least I have some sense of closure in knowing that I was good to her in another life. We met each other in another life, and lived it thoroughly together. That's something. We are happy together, in another reality. I can live with that. It still hurts, not having her in this life, but at least we managed to work it out in another lifetime. \ud83d\ude0c",

I can vividly remember what her voice sounds like, it's so soothing to the souls. \n\nThe person I fell in love with and was meant to spent the rest of my life with doesn't exist anymore.

        "content": "Earlier this week my fianc\u00e9e/long-term girlfriend (27F) broke up with me (28M), with our wedding approaching in 2 month's time. After 14 years together, she told me she had fallen out of love with me the past few years and that I didn't give her the type of love that she wanted. Although I pleaded with her to reconsider and told her I would change, it was unfortunately too late. It's put us in a sticky situation, where we have a significant amount of funds locked up in the wedding and the current home that we share. I also start my a new job next week, where I told the team that I was planning to get married to the love of my life/my high school sweetheart of 14 years. So I'm not sure how I'm going to break the news to them and I don't know how I'm going to cope. I wanted to create a post in dedication of our relationship and to honour what we had. We've dated since the age of 14, just two young kids not knowing what love is. But she truly taught me the meaning of love throughout the past 14 years. Although she broke my heart and put me in a tough situation, I can't even stay mad at her. Because I care for her so much and was the one who hurt her first. I just wish I had a second chance to fix things because I know every single mistake that I did wrong and voiced it to her, but it was too late. She said these feelings had been compounding on her and the past few years she had to compromise for me, because she loved me. I know this decision has been the hardest decision for her to ever make and I appreciate her bravery. This is also my fault because I know she could never really communicate to me, because she was always in fear that I would be mad. But she would regularly hint at these things and the time apart has made realise what a fool I was. Whilst it may be plainly obvious, I want to let you guys know what I did wrong, so that others don't make the same mistake:  \n\u2022 I was too comfortable in a 14 year old relationship, so I was complacent and I took her for granted  \n\u2022 I stopped putting in the effort to plan dates for us  \n\u2022 I stopped holding her hand everywhere we walked  \n\u2022 I wasn't by her side and support her through her toughest times  \n\u2022 I didn't buy her flowers  \n\u2022 I stopped kissing her goodbye every time I left the house  \n\u2022 I stopped hugging and kissing her every time I see her  \n\u2022 I stopped tucking her in at night and cuddling her to sleep  \n\u2022 I was always on my phone instead of spending quality time with her  \n\u2022 I stopped having deep conversations with her during dinner  \n\u2022 I stopped taking her to watch my basketball games, even though she was my biggest fan  \n\u2022 I refused to participate in the hobbies that she enjoyed, even though she would always happily do what I enjoy  \n\u2022 I declined to watch her favourite shows/movies. On occasions where I didn't decline, I'd just end up on my phone  \n\u2022 I didn't help her with planning our wedding, whilst she had to do balance it with her stressful workload  \n\u2022 I stopped reminding her and reassuring her that she is the most beautiful and amazing girl in my life  \n\u2022 Every time I made a snack in the kitchen, I stopped offering some  \n\u2022 When our dog peed inside the house, I would blame her  \n\u2022 I just made too many excuses in our relationship\n\nThere's countless more things, but I wanted to be extremely harsh on myself. Because I haven't been up to a standard that she deserved. It's not that I never did the above things for her in the past, it's more that I just stopped doing it. I wanted to spend the rest of my life making it up to her, because I truly love her. She is the most wonderful person in this world. She's kind. She's smart. She's absolutely stunning. She made me feel at peace. She reassured me when times were tough. She made me strive to grow my career. She devoted half of her life and saw the best in me. \n\nI'll forever hold onto the idea of having her, because she was the best thing in my life. I don't regret our relationship, I only regret letting the best person I know, walk out of my life. I have nobody else but myself to blame. So to everyone in relationships, I know you can get complacent/comfortable in long-term relationships but please don't give up on your significant others. Don't live your life with regret like me, knowing that you'd never be able to make it up to them. Try your hardest for them and maintain that spark. Let them be the motivation that keeps you going. Count your blessings everyday and thank god that you have them in your life. Reassure them and support them through their darkest hours. Hug them whenever you get a chance. Hold their hand wherever you go. Make each other better. Spend quality time with them and don't waste your time being glued to your phone. Recognise when they need help and be there for them no matter what. Stop making excuses for yourself and seize every opportunity that's given. Love them with all your heart.\n\nWhilst others have told me to never give up on her and t o pursue her, she's already made up her mind and has started organising the logistics of our separation. I hope that one day we cross paths again and the flame from 14 years ago reignites myself. But I know this is the outcome that I deserved. \n\n",

I was nowhere near your 14 years and a marriage so I don\u2019t know what it feels like but thats truly heartbreaking. Im glad you recognize the mistakes on your part but just remember it takes two to tango. Take these, learn from them, grieve and grow my friend. Godspeed \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",
            "I\u2019m going through a very similar break up. First of all please, do not just blame yourself. It\u2019s very good if you\u2019re able to reflect on your mistakes, but pretty sure she also had some. Communication is very important. You cannot blame yourself not being able to fully adapt to her communication style. If she was afraid to tell you what she wants, while you you\u2019d have listened to her, then it\u2019s more of a compatibility issue. Which neither she or you, my ex and me could have realised because of our lack of experience. If you wish to have a chat, I\u2019m here.",
            "Thank your taking the time to read my post and also going into great detail with advice. I really needed something like this.",
            "I\u2019m so sorry that things went down this way. Unfortunately, this is how some relationships end. One partner gets too comfortable and stops showing up in ways they used to in the past. It\u2019s common and it happens. I\u2019m nowhere NEAR the length of 14 years but it is outstanding to hear that you guys were together for that long, being high school sweethearts. I can\u2019t begin to imagine all the \u201cstorms\u201d you guys had to weather and fights to stay together. \n\nI don\u2019t know if she\u2019ll rethink her choice since she\u2019s felt like this for a while and comprised for you. Maybe she will, with time apart and that\u2019ll make her decide for sure to walk away or maybe give it a go again but with changes, one thing I\u2019ve learned from this sub is that people who were together for a decent amount of time sometimes still end up talking after the break up and things slowly pick up but that isn\u2019t after some time apart and definitely doesn\u2019t happen a lot. She may just be extremely burnt out with your behavior and your attempts to make things better, to her are probably just a plain old \u201cim good thanks\u201d, maybe..I don\u2019t know. \n\nBut it\u2019s good that you see what you could have done better. It does show that you have compassion and you can be committed to change and showing up better in the future either with her or someone else. Hold onto that OP. Some people just blame their partner for everything, but the willingness that you have taken to acknowledge your faults. That\u2019s definitely worth a lot. At least to me it is. Remember though, relationships require TWO people. I\u2019m not saying she did 100% of the damage but it\u2019s two people. Hinting at things is good but I don\u2019t know, was it enough? I mean yes, now that the relationship is over, you have the shades lifted and you can see what happened but did you guys ever have a conversation about how she felt or started to feel prior to the break up? \n\nWork on yourself, take it day by day. Some say distract yourself and stay busy. Which may help some people but do what works best for you. Feel the emotions you\u2019re going through. 14 years is a long time. Assuming you were each other\u2019s firsts for EVERYTHING, you both naturally have a heavy attachment to each other. Even if she\u2019s mentally checked out. I\u2019m sure it hurts her and stings a lot. Of course in time she may want to try again or maybe she won\u2019t. But right now you should focus on yourself and try to handle this situation the best way you can. Don\u2019t act impulsively. Don\u2019t beat yourself up too much, acknowledge your mistakes and learn how to show up better. \n\nIt\u2019s going to hit hard. Your going to feel sad, your going to be angry, you might even go through a small stage of depression. You\u2019re going to blame yourself. You might even resent her a little bit, may not feel like it now but it happens. I blamed myself for a lot of my relationship issues and now I still do. It hurts, but you learn that dwelling on it does NOTHING. You can sit on it all you want. But you have to make these changes. You have to want to change, not for her but for yourself. You\u2019re going to go through it all. I can\u2019t tell you how long it\u2019ll take to feel better, but I can say it does, and that everyone\u2019s healing time length is different. Don\u2019t rebound. Don\u2019t start hooking up with everything, don\u2019t drink to numb the pain. Don\u2019t do drugs to escape. Don\u2019t do any of that unhealthy stuff. Turn Pain into medicine. Don\u2019t worry about telling your team about what went on between you and your ex. It\u2019s not anyone\u2019s interest right now but your own. How will you cope? I personally always recommend a therapist. I have one and it makes things easier for me. I work out, it helps burn off anything that would bother me at night and leaves me tired. Helps my body get into shape as well.  But anyways about the therapist, I would do it and look for one now since you still have your head on your shoulders. Start journaling and dotting down how you feel, if you prefer an app I use \u201cDay One\u201d on the AppStore, it\u2019s got a blue ribbon on it. Helps me out a ton. Do some things that make you happy for a bit, it\u2019s still gonna fucking hurt. But it takes it away even if it\u2019s 0.01%. Spending time with friends, a hobby, goin on a walk, even just recording yourself talking about how you feel helps. \n\nMost importantly I\u2019m going to assume this was your first relationship. If I\u2019m wrong disregard this. Being that this was your first relationship, it\u2019s hard to get everything right on the first go around. Even being together for 14 years. It can still be hard, especially if you haven\u2019t had any other relationships at least to compare the good and the bad. Or even if you don\u2019t have a working relationship to base yours off of. And when I say \u201cworking\u201d I mean a couple who is healthy, who can act as a role-model for you guys. A lot of the time we spend time thinking \u201cI don\u2019t want to end up like that couple\u201d when sometimes we should frame our thinking to \u201cI want to be like that couple\u201d (of course assuming they are a healthy relationship) \n\nYou got this man. I\u2019m sorry if my advice wasn\u2019t the very best, but I hope there was something in there you could take away. We all make mistakes. Remember it\u2019s your first time Living.",
            "9 of the points you listed I (M27) also didn't respect enough in a five-year situationship when she (F24) started to lose her deep feelings three months before the actual break-up. She didn't communicate it directly in the mistaken belief that she could lose me, also only gave hints...\n\nDamn, it really hurts to see and I can feel your pain and sadness. As u/Senior-Flounder1254 (THANK YOU for your really great post) said: I think women tend to burn out one day when they see men like us can't appreciate or aren't able to put in more effort DURING the relationship.\n\nDid you try to change some things when you were in the relationship but you only changed for a short time? Could be a reason why she doesn't trust you to change now...\n\nIt's going to be a hard and rough time, knowing it could have been different so easily. I don't even want to try to imagine how hard it must be to lose a 14-year-relationship when I already suffer so badly from a 5-year-wannabe-relationship. But as already mentioned in the other comment: Focus on yourself as much as possible and on finding happiness in your life and your own future. It hurts so much to accept it. I already try to do it since almost 2 months. Grief a lot and as often as you want to. Don't let anyone tell you to stop or that it wouldn't make sense at some point anymore. Grief and Work. For as long as possible. For as long as you need to.\n\nLove is one of the most important things in life. And love from or for another human is truly one of the best feelings a human possibly can ever get. But enhancing the love for yourself will always be the best and most necessary act a person has to do, even if it won't be the most satisfying.\n\nIf you need someone \"random\" to chat anonymously about your story, feel free to dm me."

What you can change now is learn and correct mistakes you'd made, then you can better offer yourself who you are to the next healthy relationship. Have someone who loves that NEW YOU. You have this learning opportunity from the heartbreak, don't waste it. \n\nThe dumper didn't offer anything as much, they gonna lose out until they meet someone like you. If that someone is not as good, they'd settled in mediocrity. If that someone is as good as the NEW YOU, do you think they will stay with your ex? Your ex has no chance to learn because they chose to walk away easily. \n\nChange what you can control -- YOU and YOUrself.\n\n",

            "What if he didn\u2019t tell me why he lost feelings for me so I don\u2019t even know what went wrong?",
            "I was on both sides and did my best everytime no matter who was the person and how challenging the relationships were. Usually people show their true nature in hard times. If issues could be potentially solved, but they left, it's them who didn't want to put effort and your worth is not defined by their fears, traumas, cowardness. However every situation is personal and no one is perfect. So yeah I would agree that sometimes breakup can open our eyes and helps us analyze our actions/decisions since your mind is fogged in relationships. But be a better version for yourself and your family/friends at first!",
            "Not true. I gave my all to this girl who I just left, I mean really gave everything I had. I thought I she was going to be the one I married, but I had to leave.\n\nHer emotional availability, hot and cold nature due to trauma, unwillingness to change or communicate and the inability to consider anyone else but herself just got to be too much",
            "Yes all relationships are the same, love is a monolith, and there's no way anyone was told 300,000 times that they were phoning it in before their dumper left.  \ud83d\ude44",
            "I\u2019m just gonna be taken advantage of again next time, just in slightly new ways. Why bother changing or trying again?",
            "Exactly this. I\u2019m going through it as well. All he said was that, with all the massive changes that have happened in his life, he didn\u2019t feel he could give time/energy into a relationship. No other reasons and it sucks not having closure and feeling like they didn\u2019t tell you the truth. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this. Just take one day at a time, it\u2019ll get easier, I promise.",
            "my person left me to better herself and hopes i better myself. told me love is there and will be there. i want her back but how my mindset is that i cannot love her if i cannot love myself. i don\u2019t even remember who i was before i dated her. perhaps when i sort it out things will fall into place wether she\u2019s next to me or not",
            "Self reflection. I\u2019m not blaming you or anything of the sort I promise. But do some self reflection and assess where you could have went wrong on your own issues. Did you have some small insecurities that were protruding? Any sort of negative actions? Even if you answer no to both it\u2019s always good to sit down and reflect on your own actions. I\u2019m in the same boat. Not really sure what the heck happened since she never told me. But after reflecting and seeing things from her POV I see I have some issues I need to workout. Even if it takes me breaking myself and putting myself back together. It\u2019s what I\u2019ll do. \n\nThen sometimes nothing you ever did wrong and that person just lost feelings. It happens. But what we can learn from that is that no matter what you\u2019ll always have yourself. Not in a negative way. But you only have control over your own feelings. You are always going to be your own person.",
            "It doesn\u2019t matter. Feelings are irrational and you can\u2019t change someone else\u2019s",
            "Nothing is the same, you or me. There is no way to describe every situation. If what i said resonates well on you for you to breakthrough your situation, great. If not, you can take it as a pinch of salt. I hope i interpreted your responses correctly.\u00a0"
