            "That giant beam in the background is giving me Brainiac vibes. But he looks just fantastic, I love the design on the boots, the shade of blue and the colors selected. The S-sheild just looks incredible on him.\n\nEdit: Typos",
            "Need to see it in action - seems a but loose fitting??",
            "Not what I was expecting but looks brilliant. \n\nTake it this means they\u2019re going to start filming some Supes scenes outside/publicly now and didn\u2019t want it spoiled\u2026",
            "Gotta be honest, not the most flattering shot of him. He looks like a tired dad dressing up for his son's birthday party."

            "The Suicide Squad, Peacemaker s1, and Blue Beetle happened in the DCU timeline, but those films/show themselves aren\u2019t canon because they take place in the DCEU. You can watch them for more context, but CC-onwards is the only media that counts and will be the only media referenced by everything else. When people meet Waller, they\u2019ll talk about CC before anything else. Peacemaker s2 is a separate story from s1. The Blue Beetle animated series will be the adventure other heroes know about when they meet Blue Beetle.",
            "Either reading literacy is dead, or you guys are just jumping on the latest talking point to criticize the new universe. It's funny to see \"comic\" fans, who can tell you the difference between hundreds of variants and worlds over 70+ years of stories, can't see how this new set of films can soft reboot.",
            "James Gunn: \"It starts with Superman. We'll explain how characters who came before fit in once the new shows and movies come out.\"\n\nFans: \"Comic books have never been so confusing.\"",
            "He's been very clear that it's a reboot. New viewers can start with the new content.",
            "Na, OCD (and impatient) comic fans are the ones making that chart \n\nGunn knows the answers, sure, and most people don\u2019t even know what the questions are",
            "I think we nerds tend to overestimate how much your average non-nerd cares about continuity. The explanation will amount to \"And Harley Quinn is here too!\" and that'll be enough. Honestly, I like a bit of canon-collage myself, but that'll be enough for me too. Gimme a half-decent DC film and I'll swallow however much canon contortion I need to if that's what it takes to make it happen.",
            "for me its explaining how batman is seasoned and has a child while superman is young and just started",
            "This is why a) announcing the reboot when they still had DCEU movies in the pipeline was a huge mistake, and b) they should've shifted Flash again and ever so slightly tweaked the ending so that would've been the universe reboot movie and it actually had an in story reason for it. It would still be confusing for some audiences, but I think with the MCU and Spider verse movies audience now get the concept of it being another universe, but some plot points and actors carry on now.",
            "Whatever happened to the days of \u201cI\u2019m here, it\u2019s me, deal with it\u201d when it went from Terrance Howard to Don Cheadle in Iron-Man 2? Can\u2019t it just be all the events are canon except what directly references the old DCEU? Is that not the obvious thing that\u2019s going on? Why does it need to be explained beyond that?",
            "Most of Peacemaker S1 will be canon \nThe last episode when he meets The JL will not. Just like TSS took certain elements of Suicide Squad and ignored the rest. It ain\u2019t that deep."

            "They've made an intentional effort to move the relationship more in that direct in recent years. \n\nIt made Lois unlikable the idea she's cheating on Clark with Superman. It's much better that Lois likes Clark. Superman & Lois' Sam Lane has a fantastic quote \"You may have fallen in love with Clark Kent but you MARRIED Superman\" and that's where the drama is.",

            "I\u2019ve always disliked the idea that Supes puts either Clark or Superman first because it inherently devalues the identity that ends up as the \u201csecondary\u201d one as just a job. The \u201creal\u201d version of him is the one that mediates between all his identities IMO. The person we see him as in front of his closest friends is someone who chose to be- and loves being- both Clark and Superman.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s *that* person that I want Lois to truly fall in love with. I don\u2019t mind what path she takes to realizing that (though tbh just like you I prefer when she likes Clark first and foremost rather than falling for Superman through aesthetic alone). But ultimately as long as it\u2019s clear that she truly understands and loves the \u201csoul\u201d at the center of Supes/Clark when they truly get together, I\u2019ll be happy.",

            "I do agree. After a long time, I am interested in seeing the romance between Lois and Clark come to life. I think Lois figuring out that both are the same will be a plotline as well.\n\nEdit: I initially liked the pairing of Cavill and Amy's Supes and Lois, but they kinda got nothing to work with that would show their romance developing. They went from barely knowing each other to dating and then engagement within 2 films with like 5 mins of screen time.",

            "Absolutely! It would be incredible to see Lois in love with Clark Kent, even without knowing that he is Superman."
