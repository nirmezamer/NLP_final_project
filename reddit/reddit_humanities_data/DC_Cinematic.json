            "The Suicide Squad, Peacemaker s1, and Blue Beetle happened in the DCU timeline, but those films/show themselves aren\u2019t canon because they take place in the DCEU. You can watch them for more context, but CC-onwards is the only media that counts and will be the only media referenced by everything else. When people meet Waller, they\u2019ll talk about CC before anything else. Peacemaker s2 is a separate story from s1. The Blue Beetle animated series will be the adventure other heroes know about when they meet Blue Beetle.",
            "James Gunn: \"It starts with Superman. We'll explain how characters who came before fit in once the new shows and movies come out.\"\n\nFans: \"Comic books have never been so confusing.\"",
            "Either reading literacy is dead, or you guys are just jumping on the latest talking point to criticize the new universe. It's funny to see \"comic\" fans, who can tell you the difference between hundreds of variants and worlds over 70+ years of stories, can't see how this new set of films can soft reboot.",
            "for me its explaining how batman is seasoned and has a child while superman is young and just started",
            "This is why a) announcing the reboot when they still had DCEU movies in the pipeline was a huge mistake, and b) they should've shifted Flash again and ever so slightly tweaked the ending so that would've been the universe reboot movie and it actually had an in story reason for it. It would still be confusing for some audiences, but I think with the MCU and Spider verse movies audience now get the concept of it being another universe, but some plot points and actors carry on now.",
            "He's been very clear that it's a reboot. New viewers can start with the new content.",
            "I think we nerds tend to overestimate how much your average non-nerd cares about continuity. The explanation will amount to \"And Harley Quinn is here too!\" and that'll be enough. Honestly, I like a bit of canon-collage myself, but that'll be enough for me too. Gimme a half-decent DC film and I'll swallow however much canon contortion I need to if that's what it takes to make it happen.",
            "Na, OCD (and impatient) comic fans are the ones making that chart \n\nGunn knows the answers, sure, and most people don\u2019t even know what the questions are",
