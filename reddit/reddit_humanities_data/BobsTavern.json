Neither are ran by the mods of this subreddit just to be clear, but we want to share them as potential resources.\n\nu/Studstill's Discord is new and only caters towards Duos (https://discord.com/invite/rdTZYNPx6h)\n\nu/Silver-Ad-9717's Discord is a general Discord with a channel for Duos (https://discord.gg/z8SsbKu4GD)\n\nThese Discord links were verified as functional as of June 8th, 2024. Please reply to this post or DM me if the links die and we'll get them updated.",

Like adjust the text to be something like \"Discover a Hero Power from a hero that was not in this game\". That way, the player that was willing to take the hit for what they feel is a strong late game HP can at least be sure no one else will get the same benefit for 0 to 3 gold.",
