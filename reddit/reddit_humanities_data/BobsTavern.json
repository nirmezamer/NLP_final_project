Neither are ran by the mods of this subreddit just to be clear, but we want to share them as potential resources.\n\nu/Studstill's Discord is new and only caters towards Duos (https://discord.com/invite/rdTZYNPx6h)\n\nu/Silver-Ad-9717's Discord is a general Discord with a channel for Duos (https://discord.gg/z8SsbKu4GD)\n\nThese Discord links were verified as functional as of June 8th, 2024. Please reply to this post or DM me if the links die and we'll get them updated.",

Before combat begins, the game knows the exact outcomes and has assigned all the next opponents etc. Having any sort of choose mechanic would delay/break that for everyone."
