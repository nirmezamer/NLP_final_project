Wish everyone the best and lock in for mid terms !\nEdit : if you are like me and felt really disappointed, an early decision means nothing, everyone ends up in the same place. lets not be too hard on ourselves :)",

Some may go out on Thursday or next Monday but most (95% of admissions) will go out on Friday. If you dont receive an update within these days, you can expect a rejection or final decision by the end of May (May 31st).",

        "content": "# [Programs of Study are one of:](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/hbahbsc-requirements)\n\n* **Specialist** Program: a sequence of between 10.0 and 14.0 credits in one or more disciplines (note that some interdisciplinary Specialist programs may require up to 16.0 credits). Specialist programs must include at least 4.0 credits from 300+ level\u00a0courses, of which 1.0 credit must be at the 400 level.\u00a0\n   * **Some programs don't offer a specialist. You will need to check.**\n* **Major** Program: a sequence of between 6.0 and 8.0 credits in one or more disciplines. Major programs must include at least 2.0 credits from 300+ level\u00a0courses, of which one 0.5 credit\u00a0must be at the 400 level.\u00a0\n   * **Most programs offer a Major.**\n* **Minor** Program: a sequence of 4.0 credits in one or more disciplines. Minor programs must include at least 1.0 credit at the 300+ level.\u00a0\n\n# What combination do I need to graduate??\n\n* Students usually have a combo of something like this to graduate:\n   * 2 Majors (English major + Philosophy major) **OR**\n   * 1 Specialist (English specialist) **OR**\n   * 1 Major and 2 Minors (Economics major + English Minor + Computer Science Minor)\n* These are  the bare minimum requirements. You could do a specialist, 1 major and 1 minor if you wanted to, but its going to be a lot of work.\n\n# Ask yourself:\n\nWhat do you want to major/specialize in?\n\n[https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/listing-program-subject-areas](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/listing-program-subject-areas)\n\nFind the programs you want to do and then scroll down until you see something like for example this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w7fqkrqke59d1.png?width=1874&format=png&auto=webp&s=794d6c489ca76a07b8bae9066e48fff10ccbe5f6\n\nWhen you click on the one that you want to do, you can see what course combinations to take and all the info you need.\n\n# Open Enrollment and Limited Enrollment Programs\n\n* Open enrollment means that if you just took the an x number of credits of courses in your first year, you can just enroll in it without needing any pre-reqs or marks\n   * Examples: Philosophy, Math, etc\n* Limited enrollment means if you want to apply for the program, you need to take x, y, z courses and have a good/high average in those courses\n   * Public Policy, Economics, Criminology, etc\n\n# Course Load:\n\nFirst year students are typically encouraged to the take normal/full course load which is 2.5 FCEs (credits) per semester which would be 5.0 FCEs for the full academic year.\n\nCourses are worth either 1.0 credits or 0.5 credits.\n\n* 1.0 credit courses are called FULL YEAR COURSES.\n* 0.5 credit courses are called SINGLE SEMESTER COURSES.\n\n**Question**: HOW DO I KNOW IF A COURSE IS 0.5 CREDITS OR 1.0 CREDITS?\n\n* If the course has H1 at the end of the course code, it is 0.5. If it has a Y1 at the end of the course code, it is worth 1.0 credits.\n\n# Select Courses\n\n* Use the [timetable builder](https://ttb.utoronto.ca/) alongside the academic calendar that details your program requirements and courses you need to take.\n* Switch the faculty/division to arts and science and the session to Fall-Winter 2024-2025.\n* After, you can filter by department/subject area (this is the place where you would put what program you are interested in like Economics, or Philosophy or Biology)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gibf0dbbe59d1.png?width=1892&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d531337c02d9d7a2f9fea8567812fc52e1f75dc\n\n* Plan out your courses through this timetable planner after reading through the academic calendar and figuring out what courses you need for whatever program you want to do.\n* **MAKE SURE YOU TAKE PRE-REQ COURSES FROM OTHER PROGRAMS TO FILL OUT YOUR TIMETABLE IF YOU HAVE SPACE SO THAT YOU HAVE A BACK UP IN CASE YOU DONT MAKE THE LIMITED ENROLLMENT PROGRAM YOU WANT.**\n* Make sure you download/save your timetable after you make it as it doesn't auto save and will reset if you refresh it.\n\n# Acorn\n\n* Now that you have your timetable with the courses you need/want to take on ACORN, navigate to the \u201cEnrol & Manage\u201d tab and add your selected courses to your cart.\n* ADDING COURSES TO YOUR CART DOES NOT ENROLL YOU IN THOSE COURSES.\n* YOU WILL GET OR YOU MAY ALREADY HAVE GOTTEN A COURSE ENROLLMENT DATE AND TIME on the main page of Acorn.\n   * MAKE SURE YOU ARE PREPARED TO MANUALLY ENROLL IN THE COURSES RIGHT WHEN IT OPENS OTHERWISE YOU MIGHT NOT GET THE COURSES YOU WANT.\n\nThats basically it. You can comment if you have any questions but most of your questions can probably be answered if you read the above.",

            "The market is tough and the mass immigration does not help either. \n\nCompanies have opted to hire people from referrals only since there are too many resumes. And people lie on the resume and it costs them money for background checks. \n\nSo do networking and get referred. \n\nOther than that my only suggestion is, continue to improve your skills and make sure that it is visible. I am talking about getting linkedin, twitter, and your own website. Even youtube will help your branding and visibility. \n\nIt might be a good idea to do masters while you wait for the market to improve. But maybe it wont cause canada is planning to increase their immigration since they believe there is a labour shortage. \n\n\nOr you can do it like me and just leave the country lol.",
            "Indirectly it does.\n\nA lot of the mass immigration is occurring through diploma mills, the students that graduate from these schools meet the requirements on paper but in reality they dont, companies know that and will never hire them.\n\nIt doesnt prevent them from still applying to these same jobs, leading to the other mentioned issue where companies only hire from referrals as a way to filter applicants.",
            "It's really not hard to filter for the top ~5 universities in Ontario.\n\nGraduates from UofT CS are not competing with graduates from Fanshawe College in CS. There is zero overlap there.\n\nThe CS job market is just really bad currently, and diploma mills are definitely not the reason why lmao"
