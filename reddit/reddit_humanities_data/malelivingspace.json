It feels like I have many things but at the same time it feels empty. It\u2019s probably something to do with all the empty white spaces, but I\u2019m interested in ideas/thoughts/advice..\n\nThe front is too crowded with shoes, I\u2019m considering shoe storage boxes to replace the space where the mirror is.\n\nI\u2019m also triggered by the 4 frames being level with the top of the TV. I previously had a small TV and the positioning was perfect, but now there\u2019s a larger TV I\u2019ll probs move these slightly higher.\n\nWould love to hear what ideas you\u2019d have, things you\u2019d do differently, opinions on my space currently - positive and negative \ud83d\ude42 Cheers",

            "Maybe two shoe racks. One by the front door for shoes you wear regularly and one in a closet. If there\u2019s not room in those places then just next to the TV stand. There\u2019s also shoe storage you can hang on a door. The Jordan\u2019s can stay since they look cool. Also some small indoor plants, and maybe even outdoor plants for the balcony. Looks good, but the shoes just make it look cluttered",
