Matching shams. 1 decorative colorful pillow.\n\n\nAmazon has wireless rechargable sconces. I'd get warm white bulb ones and stick 2 in there, one on each side of your pillows.\u00a0Then you have some mood lighting vs a blaring overhead light.\n\n\nAre you hanging clothes where the hangers are? Is so disregard this- but id get a neutral landscape print and hang centered on that wall- like a mountain scape or something. Large- not puny. It'd open the space up a lot visually making it feel bigger.",

            "That's not a bedroom. \n\nBut it could be a bed nook if you can manage to dismantle the closet built-ins and refinish the walls so there are no traces of the closet. That would be an instant improvement. Then, use the closet doors elsewhere and hang some heavy drapes or something. Or don't if you don't need privacy. I mean, is this closet in a bedroom or is this in a studio/efficiency apartment? Some context would help. At any rate, there's not much you can do with the built-ins in place except to get a solid bedding as u/Constant_Orchid3066 suggested. The sconces would be a nice touch too.",

A 56 inch flat screen mounted on the wall. I'd have my wifi rooter in here for a solid internet connection. The room would be sound proofed and painted black.

I.e. a laundry hamper that doesn't show the laundry inside. decorate boxes/baskets that you can put some of the smaller things into so they're not all in view. I am a huge \"keep flat surfaces clear + clean\" person. \n\nalso, lamps. i say this on 100% of the comments i make on these threads but for some reason men have no sense of lighting LOL. Floor lamps, desk lamps, whatever works- but warm light at various levels. NEVER BIG OVERHEAD LIGHT.\n\nI love your view so much.
