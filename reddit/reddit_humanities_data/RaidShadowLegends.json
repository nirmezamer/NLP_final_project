Congratulations, it belongs here! Feel free to post any type of showcase as a reply to this thread. \n\nAll individual \u201cshowcase\u201d posts will be removed. \n\n**Why this thread exists**\n\nAll individual \u201cshowcase\u201d posts will be removed, in an effort to keep the subreddit less cluttered and promote more discussion on the main page.\n\n**But I pulled \u201cX\u201d and I don\u2019t know what to do with them!**\n\nThe first step to try is searching for the champion's name using the search bar above. There are already a great deal of discussions on the subreddit that provide useful guidance in how to make the most out of a particular champion. Additionally, there are a ton of great content creators who make videos about Raid, if that's how you prefer to learn.\n\nIf you\u2019re still unsure, you can make a post that includes the champion name in the title and include a brief description of what you\u2019ve found and what you need help figuring out.",

        "content": "Hi folks! On Thursday, July 4th, we're planning to launch a Champion Fragment event with a new Champion - **Packmaster Shy'ek**.   \n\nFaction - Orcs \n\nRarity - Legendary \n\nType - HP \n\nAffinity - Force  \n\nPackmaster Shy'ek is a unique type of Champion who thrives when surrounded by his loyal hounds.  As a mighty pack leader, Shy'ek excels at gathering hounds to his side, enhancing his abilities in battle. He is a versatile Champion, useful in both PvP and PvE content. With Packmaster on your team, new players will be able to utilize hounds for clearing early content more effectively, and seasoned players can experiment in the Arena or form new teams against the Hydra. Shy'ek's pack consists of Terrorbeast, Goremask, Hound-Spawn, Hellfang, Fellhound, and Stitched Beast. When at least one hound joins him in the battle, his skillset gains additional benefits.  \n\nWithout his loyal beasts, Shy'ek's A1 has a chance to land a Decrease DEF debuff on the enemy. His A2 allows Packmaster Shy'ek to tank and absorb enemies' damage with the help of Taunt, self-heal, and occasional Shield. A3 will increase allies' Turn Meter and place Block buffs, so you will find it useful for speed teams in the Arena. And his Passive will boost the whole team's damage against the target enemy.  \n\nWhen Shy'ek is joined by at least one member of his pack, his A1 additionally commands his hound companions to launch a coordinated attack on the target. His enhanced A2 will make buffs protected, and Block buffs debuff from his A3 becomes irresistible. Additionally, the hounds will launch a counterattack whenever Packmaster is attacked, further enhancing his passive ability.  \n\nBy the way, if you're not impressed with his current roster of loyal hounds, just wait\u2014Packmaster Shy'ek is always on the lookout for new members to add to his pack, and who knows what beast will join his side next.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sollyp95cb9d1.png?width=1786&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d01be39d2ac8df81e38d9dc995ce93ff168cce3\n\nWhat do you think about Packmaster Shy'ek's skill set?   \n\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1dqlpok)",

            "Woof!\u00a0\n\n\nIn the past they've done guaranteed events for fusion partner champs. Ultan was winnable from some tournament, Kaja from a deck, Alsgor from ancients. Wouldn't be surprising if they dropped some sort of event to acquire a brand new legendary hound champ that will pair amazingly well with the fusion.\u00a0",
            "What's up with all the fusions being Force affinity? This is like 4 in a row.\n\nGonna need to see what new hound they are adding and if it will be attainable before really understanding this fusion I think",
            "What are the odds that there\u2019s a new legendary hound that can be earned in the new clan wars?\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s the only way any of this makes any sense\u00a0",
            "Uh, okay. It's certainly an... interesting kit. I suppose he's got some good things going for him. He's got hex with an additional damage bonus, taunt, block buffs, irresistible and protected if he's go an ally with him. Would be an excellent kit for hydra on its own, but considering he's essentially taking up 2 team slots to get his full value, and that the champion you have to put in that slot is pretty much useless except possibly, if I'm being very generous here, Fellhound... I struggle to see a use for him that makes him worth using.\n\nBut yeah, that last paragraph is just pure BS. \"Hey guys, this is absolute trash, but maybe we might do something about it at some unspecified later date \\*wink wink\\*. Wouldn't want to miss out on that, right?\". If they are true to form, it will be a new champion announced as a quasi-fusion halfway through the main fusion like the previous partner fusions have been, or maybe it'll just be a far more egregious 10x event or something. Or it's just a big joke and there'll be no saving grace to be found. Can't have us able to make informed decisions, now can they?",
            "Not super great or anything but for most people without relying on shard pulls the likely options of block buff champ for hydra is uugo, deliana, sun wukong, ostrox, fenax and umbral. This champ brings very reliable block buff (no problem with affinity or poison cloud), basically will never die, will mischief tank, boost speed via aura and turn meter and as chef kiss keeps mischief head permamently hexed. Those are all properties that make hydra auto team much smoother and less likely to fail.\n\nNo way is this champ useless and I would question anyone who voted such.",
            "I'm zigging while y'all homies can zag. Hydra lead: brings the aura and the TM boost spam, block buffs, hex and 2 turn UNREMOVABLE Taunt (fuck off 3%) on a 3-turn cooldown, any way you can reduce that and it's permanent taunt uptime which means your champions can't be consumed. Throw a single Felhound in the team for big damage and provoke set where he'll be ally/counter attacking every 3 seconds and things are pretty interesting.\n\nWhen your CC overlords tell you this is way better than you guys think at first glance, you heard it here first.",
            "Seems decent for Hydra tbh, turn meter fill and block buffs for 2 turns that doesn't hit so can't weak hit or get fucked by poison cloud and a Mischief tank so the hex will be on it all the time, would still pair with one champ in cursed set though.\n\nUntil other hounds that can join him get added, the extra champs can just be ignored.",
            "He has 2 turn taunt on 3 turn cooldown. I'll do the fusion just for that \\^\\^",
            "That last paragraph tells us all that Plarium knows this is a bad champ, but they want us to collect him anyways due to the promise of a future buff.  Not a great look.",
            "What if the next free login champ is a hound? Share your thoughts!"

Dont forget the 20% dmg increase, but the real deal is his A2.  \nI, myself, been running an Emic infinity comp. For everyone who odes not know: If taunt is up, no one gets eaten. So if you have 100% uptime of taunt you can go to the trun limit, if the buff does not get stolen.  \nThats the tricky part with emic, you have to have insane resist and preferably protected set.\n\nBut the packmaster just does a un removeable, stoleable or transferrable taunt buff on himself. Thats GG for Hydra.  \nJust pair him up with 2 Painkeepers, shamael and lets say fellhound and youre gtg.

Am I going to be fusing Oella and Ultan of the Shell or Kaja and Timit or Minaya and Khronar or Astralon and Lix? It such a gamble. And how will the \"New hound\" be acquired? I'm guessing a guaranteed event, so will I even have the resources to get that champ when and if it is released?

I\u2019m pulling my 6* awakened Fellhound out of campaign farming and putting him into a provoke set with as much damage as I can stack. PK will be in guardian and 500 resist so that she hopefully doesn\u2019t get provoked when she needs to reset the Packmaster\u2019s A2. Actually just realized Emic\u2019s reset skill has a lower CD so he could fill the slot instead of PK. Then I\u2019ll fill the other slots with Shamael, Gnut, and either Eostrid in a cursed set, Padraig, or Michinaki. Could be cool to see what two taunt champs can do.

            "*\"New Fusion is gonna be a Hydra GOD\"*\n\nYou left out an o. \"Hydra good\" is more accurate I think. You don't need an emic team or Trunda cheese to go to the turn limit. If you're someone who is desperate to build a taunt eam, but don't have Emic or much protection gear then he's a good option. \n\nThe Good  \n\\-Speed aura all areas.  \n\\-25% turn meter fill and block buffs placed.  \n\\-Pretty unique 2 turn taunt on 3 turn cooldown.\n\n\\----------\n\nThe not good.  \n\\-Yeh, he can do what emic does, but you're filling an additional spot with moderately useful doggy on top of the other spots already filled in the emic team.\n\n\\-The A1 ally attack only works for doggies. With those specific doggies, it's not that useful in hydra.\n\n\\-The passive hex only places when hit and only for 1 turn instead of 2, so for hydra you can't place it on decapitated heads (debuff spreader possibly?) and it will constantly be overwritten by your regular hexer. It makes the 20% bonus damage near useless. You would gain more damage from having a hex champion keep hex up all the time than you would from 20% extra intermittent damage on non-decapitated heads. It might be fun outside of hydra.\n\n\\-He's hp based. Personal annoyance.\n\n\\-----------\n\nI'm going for him for \"The Good\" reasons I mentioned above and the possibility of a new dog to be added later, but he's not a \"Hydra God\" imo.",
