I was taken to the hospital in the same taxi with my manager(bhojdeals-food delivery) present but the driver fled the scene after reaching hospital and was later taken in custody. I was gravely injured but idk why i decided to get discharge on request that day. Next day i signed the statement and the driver was released, who claims that whole incident was my fault. At present the taxi owner is reluctant to give any compensation and delaying my medical treatment and cycle repairing. Man has inhumane level of sympathy even after i made his legal process easy as it gets. Seems i have few well-wishers so i am asking u all to give me some explanation on insurance and the compensation process. \n\n1. how much money will the taxi owner or the driver get from insurance?\n\n2. can i later get reimbursement from bhojdeals for my medical treatment when the taxi owner will abandon me?\n\n3. apart from the cycle repairing and the medical treatment, is the taxi owner or driver not liable for any compensation?",
