            "I feel like I would love to have one for 1500 or less, and to get there they can remove really dumb features like the little screen that shows your eyes on the outside.\n\nI think I will really enjoy the Vision Pro 3 or 4. Until then I can't justify spending that kind of money."

The only issue I've had was some of my footage from my drone came out super wobbly - I ran it through Gyroflow (a stabilisation app) and then tried to add extra stabilisation in FCP and it took quite some time. I'm very much an amateur though, making videos for Instagram and youtube. A friend of mine does it for a living - making videos for F1 teams, for example - and obviously he needs something much more powerful for what he's doing.",
