            "Honestly I thought the MacOS section was disappointing. I was waiting for it the whole show and missed the first maybe 3-5 minutes but to see that it was mostly update features from iOS plus maybe 3 more was a bit disappointing, plus the AI of course which I dislike.",
            "Have you done the Vision Pro demo at the Apple store?\n\nWhat price would you pay for the Vision Pro?",
            "I'm glad there's competition. This is good.\n\nI wish there were a viable third competitor. MS really screwed the pooch on that one.",
            "Naw. You can buy just the case for them for $100 usd.",
            "I feel like I would love to have one for 1500 or less, and to get there they can remove really dumb features like the little screen that shows your eyes on the outside.\n\nI think I will really enjoy the Vision Pro 3 or 4. Until then I can't justify spending that kind of money."

Keyboard skins can be used if you also add tiny adhesive dots at the top corners of the display bezel to keep the lid slightly more open to allow a better gap between the display and the keycaps. Dbrand makes some nice skins. Im partial to the carbon fiber look. Should compliment the already dark appearance of your midnight blue model.",

Based on this rate of degradation, I doubt the battery will retain 80% capacity by the time it reaches 1000 cycles, as claimed by Apple. Is this a typical trend? Does the battery degradation slow down as the cycle count increases? How are the batteries of other MBA devices faring?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ixcacvp85i9d1.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b9d396f709c79cb567558548e0f04195516cb42\n\n",
