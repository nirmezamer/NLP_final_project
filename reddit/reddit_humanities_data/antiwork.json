Nevertheless, Generation Z seems to be more highly educated than previous generations, and seems to place even more importance on work-life balance.\n\nI have several degrees in mathematics, economics and corporate finance, and I'd like to find a job that allows me to earn a decent living working 20 to 30 hours a week (of course, I don't expect the salary I would have earned in high competitive and exhausting industries such as private equity or trading).\n\nWhat's your view on this? Should the labor market develop more part-time jobs, move towards a 4-day week... in order to preserve workers' well-being and mental health, and hence their long-term productivity?\n\nEdit: I live in a country with few students loans (especially when you are a top student)",

The working classes are supposed to be everyones aspiration, school leavers are expected to look up to them, and to see what one day they could become, with 4 more years at university. Yeah, getting paid slave level wages, then being focibly taxed almost back to zero. Any money left over, used to pay rent and food. Taxes that are there to pay for millionaire politicians. But without the working class there would be no people to ferry the rich around, to grow and cook their food, to look after their odious parasitic offspring, while they galavant around in private jets poisoning our beautiful planet Earth. The poor of this world deserve must more than the lucky lazy few who are born with wealth, the parasitic royal families of Europe, the tech tax avoiding billionaires, they are the lazy theives on this planet. Why can't we all transition to this way of life ? Move over rich people, other lazy people want to join in.",
