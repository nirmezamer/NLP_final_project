        "content": "# r/CS2 is looking for a Discord server to promote!\n\nHello everyone,  \nSince the early days of our community, we have received a high number of requests for a Discord server to accompany people's Counter-Strike 2 social media experience.\n\nAt one point, we even considered creating a Discord server ourselves, but we came to the conclusion that we should just stick to what we are most familiar with: Reddit.\n\nHowever, we still want to satisfy your many requests and support you in finding new likeminded friends to play and hang out in voice channels with.\n\nBecause of that, we have chosen to give one of you the opportunity to advertise their Discord server right here on r/CS2, in order to unite all CS2 Redditors on one Discord server!\n\n\n\n**You may** [**APPLY HERE**](https://forms.gle/QeFSvULnZDKQ4dv2A)**, but we suggest you read the FAQ first.**\n\n*All applications must be submitted before* *~~May 17th 2024.~~*  \n*EXTENDED DEADLINE: June 25th!*\n\n\n\n# FAQ\n\n**Promotion Method**  \nIf your server gets chosen, u/CS2-Bot will leave a message on every new post in our community, prompting users to join your server. On top of that, your server will be promoted via an animated image within our sidebar.\n\n**Promotion Duration**  \nThe promotion period is indefinite, though we reserve the right to cancel the promotion at any time.\n\n**Discord Server Ownership**  \nOf course, your Discord server will remain yours. We have no intent of joining your leadership or moderation team and neither will we interfere with the way you run the server.\n\n**Obligations**  \nAs r/CS2's Discord server of choice, you have no direct obligations. While we will promote your server, you are not expected to return the favor by promoting this Reddit community within your Discord.\n\n**Boundaries**  \nIf your Discord server is chosen, your status as a member within the r/CS2 community will not change. You will not become a moderator or official representative of this community. You also may not call your Discord server \"*The Official* r/CS2 *Subreddit Discord Server*\" or similar, or officially associate yourself with r/CS2.\n\n**Discord Server Requirements**  \nThere are no strict requirements that your Discord server needs to meet for you to be allowed to apply. We may even select an unestablished Discord server if the concept and application are well done.\n\n**Selection Criteria**  \nThe most important criteria for us are a high-quality application, the innovativeness and ambitions of your Discord server, your activity on r/CS2 and Reddit as a whole, and your standing within the community.\n\n**Exclusion Criteria**  \nWhile it is and will remain entirely up to you how you run your Discord server, there are a few matters that we take very seriously. If your Discord engages in either of the following activities, you are not eligible to apply: Distribution or glorification of cheats or boosting services, racism, misogyny, discrimination against minority groups, illegal activities, copyright violations, witch hunts, Reddit community interference, or Reddit vote manipulation. This list is non-exhaustive.\n\n\n\n# Everything a-ok? [APPLY HERE](https://forms.gle/QeFSvULnZDKQ4dv2A).",

            "well the pros and content creators make a living from playing the game so its only natural that they keep on playing.\n\nwhen it comes to other game you kinda blew things out of proportions since valve made csgo playable in the first place after they took the game from hidden path, but i guess the rest is very much true",
            "Im not trying to defend valve by any means because the lack of content and community outreach is bs. However, cheating has been exceptionally bad the past year in almost every game that doesnt have an intrusive anti cheat.",
            "From the fact that low effort threads like these are posted every other hour, I suppose I must be in the minority as I actually really enjoy CS2 and do find it a substantial improvement in many ways over CSGO, the problem is what are we to do with the cheater epidemic?  Anybody with half a brain would look at this situation and be like, \"Ok, over here we have fuckloads of cheaters completely ruining our game to the degree we are losing both players and profit, and over here with Faceit we have an effective anti-cheat...what if we packaged the Faceit anti-cheat in with CS and solved this cheater clusterfuck dumpsterfire?\"  Personally I'd rather Valve have their own in house kernel level anti-cheat because Faceit is owned by the Saudi Arabian government who don't exactly have a great human rights track record but I mean if it would solve this cheater problem I don't care if the tech comes from North Korea just make it fucking happen already.",
