        "content": "# r/CS2 is looking for a Discord server to promote!\n\nHello everyone,  \nSince the early days of our community, we have received a high number of requests for a Discord server to accompany people's Counter-Strike 2 social media experience.\n\nAt one point, we even considered creating a Discord server ourselves, but we came to the conclusion that we should just stick to what we are most familiar with: Reddit.\n\nHowever, we still want to satisfy your many requests and support you in finding new likeminded friends to play and hang out in voice channels with.\n\nBecause of that, we have chosen to give one of you the opportunity to advertise their Discord server right here on r/CS2, in order to unite all CS2 Redditors on one Discord server!\n\n\n\n**You may** [**APPLY HERE**](https://forms.gle/QeFSvULnZDKQ4dv2A)**, but we suggest you read the FAQ first.**\n\n*All applications must be submitted before* *~~May 17th 2024.~~*  \n*EXTENDED DEADLINE: June 25th!*\n\n\n\n# FAQ\n\n**Promotion Method**  \nIf your server gets chosen, u/CS2-Bot will leave a message on every new post in our community, prompting users to join your server. On top of that, your server will be promoted via an animated image within our sidebar.\n\n**Promotion Duration**  \nThe promotion period is indefinite, though we reserve the right to cancel the promotion at any time.\n\n**Discord Server Ownership**  \nOf course, your Discord server will remain yours. We have no intent of joining your leadership or moderation team and neither will we interfere with the way you run the server.\n\n**Obligations**  \nAs r/CS2's Discord server of choice, you have no direct obligations. While we will promote your server, you are not expected to return the favor by promoting this Reddit community within your Discord.\n\n**Boundaries**  \nIf your Discord server is chosen, your status as a member within the r/CS2 community will not change. You will not become a moderator or official representative of this community. You also may not call your Discord server \"*The Official* r/CS2 *Subreddit Discord Server*\" or similar, or officially associate yourself with r/CS2.\n\n**Discord Server Requirements**  \nThere are no strict requirements that your Discord server needs to meet for you to be allowed to apply. We may even select an unestablished Discord server if the concept and application are well done.\n\n**Selection Criteria**  \nThe most important criteria for us are a high-quality application, the innovativeness and ambitions of your Discord server, your activity on r/CS2 and Reddit as a whole, and your standing within the community.\n\n**Exclusion Criteria**  \nWhile it is and will remain entirely up to you how you run your Discord server, there are a few matters that we take very seriously. If your Discord engages in either of the following activities, you are not eligible to apply: Distribution or glorification of cheats or boosting services, racism, misogyny, discrimination against minority groups, illegal activities, copyright violations, witch hunts, Reddit community interference, or Reddit vote manipulation. This list is non-exhaustive.\n\n\n\n# Everything a-ok? [APPLY HERE](https://forms.gle/QeFSvULnZDKQ4dv2A).",

            "I feel like they've probably abandoned the whole operation thing with the development and release of CS2. remember the \"season\" tab in the premier menu? I feel like they'd be more likely to release a \"Season 2\" with a case and other shit rather than an operation, which hasn't been mentioned or touched since 2021",
            "At what point did Valve take over development fully from hidden path entertainment?",
            "Why would they do anything? the pro scene plays on LAN and with anticheat anyway.\n\nAnd the rest of the players still throw money into steam and cases and keys, you are part of the problem everyone.\n\nJust stop paying, stop playing and show them we care more than those incompetent fucks at Valve",
            "I\u2019m a huge fan of both CS and TF2. However, I started playing both games long after content drops stopped being consistent. I\u2019ll be getting my 5 year coin next week, so that\u2019s my benchmark. \n\nI wish I was around to play those games back when valve cared about them. \n\nI wish I could go back and be excited that a new operation was going to drop in a week or two, while i spent my time waiting for the new operation by playing with the new weapons that valve, my favorite game company, added to team fortress 2. Valve, the company that cared, that made half life, that had all the cool game sales on their all-in-one launcher, that had so many collabs with other games and brands, that had Gaben, who were the \u201ccool guys\u201d of the gaming industry, with the new flashy gun skins and new maps and missions and cases and such. To keep ranking up with a matchmaking system that wasn\u2019t completely broken and unclimbable, to do that while still getting to play my favorite maps. And when I got too impatient for competitive CS, I could go to TF2 and press one button and queue into a fun, working server where I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about cheater bots. All the while not having the experience get at all stale because I knew that new content was always going to keep coming so I\u2019d never get bored.\n\nI yearn to go back to a time I never was a part of, but I miss nonetheless. I know it existed, and I missed out on it. I know that Valve used to be the company that cared. I know they can be that company again, but how do we get them to?"

The only way to dodge that is paying. My friends are not always online. \n\nSo basically i need to pay a 3rd party to get even and cheater free matches. I payed for some months but im sick of it. Also to say that faceit doesnt deserve any money they are also a horrible company. \n\nI uninstalled some days ago. I cant believe cs is in this state for so long already. Valve dont deserve us as players. Any other competitive game suggestions? \n\nHow do you handle that state of the game? Am I the only one feeling like Valve makes me leave?",

            "It isn\u2019t worth ur time. Apex has hackers. Warzone has hacker. Pubg is ok but temp bans everyone based on reports for 24 hrs at a time. Valorant is actually quite decent. Siege has so many hackers it\u2019s unplayable. En no game is really in a good state.\n\nThis patch yesterday seemed to fix my trust back to extremely high so premier at 21k is playable again. But idk every day I grow closer to quitting online gaming. Companies are so incompetent at managing the situation, letting hackers use a spoofer or smthing to just get back into the game while shadow banning legit players who has to wait out days to a week. Even cs low trust is basically a shadow ban. We are just relying on systems that function off of stats and report volume rather than actually finding new ways to detect cheating software.",

            "Personally I have given up. Valve is shitting the bed too hard with CS2. They promise a more stable game, all we have a fps drops and rubber banding, they promise more content with Source 2, all we have is Dust 2 in the pool again, they promise VAC live all we have is hacks vs hacks.\n\nThey make almost one billion from cases alone and clearly are not willing to invest in the game. They even seem to have forgotten that there is a season system\n\nI switched to the V recently, I regret CS gameplay which is better imo, but at least developers really care and communicate well with the community. There is new content constantly and the meta is quite dynamic as well",
            "I mean FACEIT is full of cheaters at the moment.\nOver the last 2 days I have played against 4 super obvious cheaters (One guy got 7 smoke kills without info/steps in 2 rounds)\nI'm trying to close in the gap to lvl 10 but keep getting overrun by new accounts with 22+ average spamming insults in all chat during the whole game",
            "I've been playing for 20+ years and in this time I took some long breaks and this is what I'm doing now too, gonna take a break until the game gets fixed",

            "It\u2019s a very problematic when it comes to cheating, I mean it requires some efforts to even install and adjust proper cheats, but why? Why people can\u2019t just play in their own ranks and enjoy the game but it has to ruin the others\u2019 experiment totally making the game undesirable.   This is just shocking that at least one-sixth of players are believed to be cheaters or at least has cheated in their games. \n\nI am honestly losing my hope to even play games and do something useful than watch 45-60 minutes of getting assraped by blatant cheaters. It\u2019s waste of time.",
            "Yes, give up. I already have. People who will tell you to keep playing here are either valve ass-kissers and/or have investments made in skins. As of now the only option is to give up on the game if you want valve to get their shit together and fix the hot pile of shit that is cs2 right now. And yes, I AM expecting fuck ton of downvotes!
