However, the amount of (rule violating) PnL porn posts has gotten out of hand... and  the quality of most borderlines cringe level flexing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo a refresher on our rule #8 in the sidebar:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>8.No Gain / Loss (P/L) Porn  \n>  \n>We don't care how much money you made or lost. Context is everything, and the details matter!  \n>  \n>Do not post your P/L Porn here unless you're prepared to give a detailed account of your strategy and all factors that went into generating said P/L. You must also give context to account size, and risk tolerance. Showing off 3000% gains and hiding that it was on a $100 account grossly misrepresents yourself, and we will have none of it here.  \n>  \n>**This also applies to Prop / Scouting firm challenges.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Read the above rule... starting tomorrow there going to be timeouts for anyone not meeting rule 8's post requirements... and any 2nd offenses will result in a strict ban.\n\n(we are not wsb.. measure how long your dollar sign is over there if you need that kinda validation) \n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd regarding the influx of prop challenge PnL posts specifically:\n\nLadies and gentlemen,...I hate to break it to you, but while passing a prop challenge is a good achievement for a developing trader, it's not exactly worth \"dunkin' on them fools\" level energy...\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's fine and getting a firm's certificate saying you passed can represent a major milestone in your trading journey.  ... .but consider that it's only a step closer to getting paid, not yet getting paid out.. you're posting a demo PnL with added difficulty from structured rules to follow.\n\nWanna flex your prop challenge pass?\n\n* Show us how you nailed the execution of your strategy and didn't error trade your way to a fail\n* Show us a trade that went south quick and  how you handled it\n* Show us your biggest mistake, or most silly mistake, and tell us what you worked out to avoid it going forward.\n* Read rule 8 again and also include the context, general idea of the strategy, risk you set on trades, etc...\n\nFlex the stuff that will bring you closer to a payout. Post the stats, post the context (plan, method, etc..) and tell us about why you're sharing it...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

I would think this of all markets see's 1 mil as a grain of sand. I think FX grinds out 260 trillion each year.
