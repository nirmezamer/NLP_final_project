            "If you drive long enough, you start to recognize these situations as high risk situations. You have to assume every car you\u2019re around is going to do something stupid. Assume the truck driver doesn\u2019t look over his shoulder and starts moving over. Would he see you if he\u2019s looking forward? Not in his blind spot, no. So you have three options. Accelerate to be in front of him. Coast down so you end up behind him in case he moves over. Or just be ready to hit the brakes if he moves over. After he moved into the first lane, you have to assume he won\u2019t stop. It\u2019s very basic defensive driving. I\u2019ve been driving 15,000 miles a year for about a decade now. Not one accident because at this point these situations are pretty much ingrained in me to stay away from. Part of it is just luck, but I\u2019ve avoided a lot of potential accidents, even if I was completely in the right. Graveyard is full of people who had the right of way. \n\nTake this as a learning moment between the heavy roasts and the experience itself. You weren\u2019t wrong, but you were certainly not right.",

            "In many states if either party contributed to the accident, then they are liable for the accident.  The Mercedes driver looks to be the one who caused the accident, but it could be argued the truck driver sped up to prevent the merge and wasn't moving forward in the passing lane.  They both could be deemed at fault and liable for damages.  \n\nIMO both were being dicks and paid an unfortunate price.   Worse, they put others at danger too.",

They literally announced they'll do something stupid so let them be stupid in a way that doesn't involve a lot of stress.\n\nThey may get a new truck and trailer but it surely won't be worth the pain and paperwork."
