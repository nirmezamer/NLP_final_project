            "There is a double yellow line for a reason. A cop would pull him over immediately (usually). If there is a mishap he will automatically be at fault. Really a boneheaded stunt.",

            "Arguably, filming a screen with your phone affected more people negatively",
            "unfortunately it seems that double-yellow lines are being put down everywhere these days, for no real reason.  There are many 2-lane roads near me, some with broken lines or a solid and broken line, with plenty of sight lines in one direction, or both.  But when the road gets repaved, they slap down a double yellow line with no thought to sight lines or what actually should be there, based on the road's original engineering.  There's a mile-long section on my way to work, dead straight and flat, that used to have a single broken line.  Got repaved last year, and now it has a double yellow the whole way.\n\nObviously doesn't apply to this situation, as it's a curve and should have a double yellow line.  But it's unfortunate that they're being put everywhere now.",

Even if you didn't hit the white SUV, there's a couple of cars ahead of them moving at a similar slower pace. Slow down earlier, and there isn't an accident here.",
            "Both are to blame. But, you were driving too fast considering the activity surrounding you. \nHad you been driving at a slower more appropriate speed - you should have been able to stop and avoid hitting the other idiot."
