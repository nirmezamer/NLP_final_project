            "This is awesome. Love how much the CFB25 team cares about the little details that make college ball special. I doubt EA ever loses the exclusive NFL license but hopefully the Madden devs feel some internal pressure from CFB25 to get their shit right!",
            "To not have things like this in Madden is just lazy tbh. They are doing this for over 100 teams \u2026You mean to tell me Madden can\u2019t do it for 32.",
            "Absolutely amazing. This is what a football game should be. Madden seems soulless compared to this",
            "Madden: \"You will get 15 second intros of two RBs playing catch & like it!\"\n\nI'm not even asking for much, just add every team's TD song and maybe third down sound effects.\n\nEdit: NCAA 25 is going to have cheerleaders! Madden hasn't even included the Dallas cheerleaders since 2012",
            "It looks incredible and the presentation blows madden out of the water. The mascots, the animals, the fan interactions etc is just perfect. I especially love how the fans do the teams signature signs in the stands too. And having white outs and black outs is a very nice touch.",
            "Madden has had almost 20 years of exclusive access to the NFL license, and they've never come remotely close to capturing the feel of the NFL like College Football has with this presentation. \n\nWhat the hell have they been doing? I hope they're embarrassed.",
            "After watching this, unless you don\u2019t like CFB or are a diehard NFL fan, there\u2019s no reason to get Madden this year. This will more than satiate the football fix.",
            "At this point, if Madden doesn't rival this level of presentation I'm not even going to bother.",
            "I really only care about pure gameplay, everything else is auxiliary to me, so it\u2019s kind of surprising to see everybody clamor around like college football is gonna be the next big thing when they really haven\u2019t addressed some of Madden\u2019s fundamental issues. I could give a damn about the stadiums or the noise or the crowds when I can\u2019t throw a realistic ball.\n\nBut who knows. I could be wrong. It is true that Madden has no soul compared to this.",
            "The game is still gonna be an attribute crawling pay-to-win madden re-skin. But can\u2019t deny they\u2019re doing cool things madden was too lazy to for all these years"

            "Aside from the fact that CFB didn\u2019t start from scratch. They\u2019re still using the frostbite engine and code from madden.",
            "Sports games shouldn't be yearly releases. There should be one every 3 years or so with roster updates and such in between. But the share holders overwhelming wealth and profits would suffer\ud83c\udfbb\ud83d\ude25",
            "Not me",
            "I wasn\u2019t going get NCAA because I\u2019m not a college football fan but I am a football and from what I\u2019ve been seeing being mentioned about this game has me believe this is not a madden game dressed up as ncaa so I definitely can\u2019t wait for this to drop",
            "As long as people keep buying it then they'll keep up the same crap. They make so much money from MUT that they probably think \"if it ain't broke , don't fix it\".\n\nFans need to rebel if they really don't like it just like they did with WWE2K20. 2K literally cancelled that year's game to work on a whole new system.",
            "I've only seen one review on youtube but the channel said that \"it doesn't play/feel like Madden.\" I am super skeptical. I'm hopeful but very wary to believe that the same company that has showed it just doesn't care about its customers and is using an engine that has performed poorly is suddenly going to produce a game that is above average.",
            "Madden is one of the worst coding jobs in EA. You\u2019re not allowed to create or innovate; only maintain a mess that no one knows how to fix",
            "This should be flipped. NCAA devs should be Squidward because they have to start from scratch therefore taking longer. Madden devs basically copy and paste therefore being done quickly",
            "You give those Madden devs 3 years the game will still stink. They lack talent and are incompetent.",
            "I like how people are trusting ea to make a good football game when we know their track record. 3 years, new dev team, blah blah blah. I don\u2019t believe the hype."

            "It\u2019s impossible for me to play Superstar as anything but a QB. I always just hog the ball and it feels unauthentic as fuck.",
            "Got something like 4200 yards and 50+ TDs as a rookie RB. Won MVP, OPOY and ROTY. I always tell myself, \"I'm limiting my touches\" but I never do. I'm the running back bro, why am I calling the plays?! \ud83d\ude02",
            "I average about 250-300 ish yards on All-Madden as an 82 OVR lol",
            "That\u2019s only 31.6 yards per carry. I\u2019m surprised it\u2019s that low, tbh. Feels like it should be higher.",
            "I play on All-Pro and still put up record seasons as a rookie. Hopefully the mode is fixed in 25. It's always had problems, ranging from changing positions to deleting all progress randomly.",
            "This is exactly why I *do* play on Rookie difficulty\u2026",
            "Or was that just an average game against the Jets?",
            "Lmao I averaged about 220 a game on all-madden, could retire before the end of my rookie contract and be first ballot hall of fame\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",
            "Same here. I miss when it was like NCAA 14 and you had to earn the ability to change plays and even that was limited to 20 a game. Hope they bring that back this year.",
            "That's why I mainly play Corner or Linebacker, helps the authenticity factor of things"
