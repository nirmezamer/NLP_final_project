I've searched the threads and seen some reports that leaving the public service and electing to receive the transfer value locks the majority in private annuity but others seem to suggest being able to access the funds immediately. Most seem to suggest a portion is paid cash and the majority is locked in until retirement. For those who did receive the full value in cash, is it a question of penalties versus reinvesting in an annuity? I can't see how they would stop you canceling the annuity once it's outside the PS pension plan.",

Unfortunately, the event was compromised by deliberate, unauthorized, inappropriate, and derogatory material.\n\nThis occurrence goes against our commitment to fostering a safe and respectful workplace for all. The Beyond Allyship event was intended to be a safe space and we are deeply sorry for any undue stress or harm this may have caused. We were excited to host a workshop that celebrated the perseverance and resilience of the 2SLGBTQIA+ community and we deeply regret that it was marred by this homophobic, transphobic, and racist incident.\n\nIt\u2019s very important that this department offer safe spaces for this community and that its members feel supported by allies they feel comfortable with. Despite the appalling occurrence, it did not deter us from regrouping and proceeding with the workshop.\n\nFor anyone affected or requiring support, we encourage you to seek help through the Employee Assistance Program. Counselling services are available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\n\nThank you for navigating through this incident with us and for reaffirming our shared commitment to creating an inclusive and supportive workplace for all. Once again, we sincerely apologize for what transpired.\n\nPlease know that we are taking this very seriously\u2014your safety and privacy are our top priorities. We are actively investigating the breach and hope to have a resolution soon.\n\nAs your Deputy Ministers, we want to make it clear that we unequivocally condemn these harmful behaviours and are committed to ensuring it does not happen again so that we may ensure a safe and respectful workplace for all employees.",
