The government-created Social Studies curriculum for Grade 3 involves a lot of discussion on cultures around the world. Admin told them that they can't talk about the student's understanding of other cultures on the report card, which means they can't comment on the kid's understanding of the curriculum. Admin's reason: it might offend parents to learn their kids are learning about other cultures. But admin still wants report card comments on student learning in Social Studies...",
            "        Not a teacher or a student or even really academically inclined, but I have a question! I worked at a restaurant where we hired a virgin cook who used to be a k-2 teacher (over 6 years). She confided in me that the reason she  quit was her entire kindergarten class one year couldn\u2019t read, so she asked to be moved up to first grade the next year. When next year came, the kids still didn\u2019t know how to read. The following year she was involuntarily reassigned to be a second grade teacher, where she found that still, all the kids in the grade could not read. She was very specific that they literally could not look at letters on a page and know what they were. \n\n        My question to you all is, is this indicative of your collective experience with this age group? What about later in life? Do the kids eventually figure out how to read? Do they require intervention? It just boggles me that there are children at a 0 reading level cause if true I feel that reflects much more on the parents in society than the teachers. Who doesn\u2019t teach their kid to read? Is it generally part of elementary school curriculum to teach children how to read? I dunno I\u2019m rambling at this point"

I don't think we need to police girls in tank tops and boys in shorts (I've seen it happen) but I do think that we should be modeling and teaching kids that different places have different dress codes. You don't get to show up to your office jobs in a F21 crop top that looks like a bra if you're a girl and you don't get to wear a shirt that says \"bad B\\*\\*\\*\\* P\\*\\*\\*\\*\" if you're a guy. I think kids can dress to express themself without looking like they're going to strip clubs and this doesn't mean we're \"slut shaming\" or being sexist, it just means we're trying to teach kids that the way you dress impacts the environment and we want an academic learning environment, not a party or a beach club. No, I don't think they need to be in suits and ties or skirts but there is a middle ground. ",

            "I think whatever the dress code is, it should mirror what we expect in everyday life as adults.  I have this conversation with my tween all the time.  She wants to wear a dirty black t-shirt and ripped jeans to a fancy brunch.  I explained to her that dressing for the place and company is important and respectful when you get older.  I asked her how she would feel if I showed up to pick her up from school in a skimpy bikini.  It's not appropriate to the situation.  It is the same as if I went to work in my pajamas.  I don't care as much about girls' shorts being too short as them understanding what is/isn't appropriate in each social situation.  It's a life skill to me.",
            "As an Australian I\u2019m quite happy with our school uniforms. Most schools have a few options for combinations of shirts, pants, shorts, skirts, jumpers and outerwear for cold weather. There\u2019s a healthy second hand market and school will give vouchers if families can\u2019t afford the uniform. Schools in low income areas are usually really good at making sure even new clothes are cheap. \n\nEveryone shows up in more or less the right thing and we get on with it. \n\nBonus is if you\u2019re in public on a weekday afternoon and you see a bunch of kids being ratbags, you know which school to email to complain.",

            "I teach in Sweden and it\u2019s practically illegal to have a dress code in schools. There were some but last year news of a principal measuring a skirt with a ruler got out and now it\u2019s completely banned by the department of education. The only you can say is: no underwear showing and no offensive language/drugs/alcohol. Honestly, since, the kids stopped caring, and most just wear jeans and t shirt.",

            "I taught at a school with a uniform only dress code. It was put in place to avoid wearing gang colors and causing problems. In that, it succeeded. The bangers still tried little things to get around it (colored shoelaces, length of belt hanging loose), but we didn\u2019t have any problems within the school. *Outside* of school was a whole other deal.",
            "I went to a military school, so uniforms everyday. it was fine. I actually liked them.",
            "Probably not that unpopular. Like many things at school it is something we get assigned to do with no support that causes conflict and takes time away from other things. Uniforms are good too.",
            "The issue with the dress code is how easily it slips into discriminatory behavior- i.e. unfair standards held against young women and girls, disproportionate enforcement of it against girls with particular body types etc. If you get rid of that problem, I\u2019m all for a dress code. I\u2019m all or nothing: uniforms or no dress code. School uniforms are underrated imo",

Apparently, all these brilliant politicians just don't understand why so many people are either choosing to leave the profession completely for not even enter it.\n\nAt a recent hearing, the main reason given for the teacher shortage is the low salaries that teachers earn. For a profession that requires a bachelor's degree, certifications, and licenses, the pay is just shit. \n\nOne teacher that was speaking to the committee told them that the only reason he can be a teacher is because his wife makes more money than he does. Another\n\nThe committee that the only way he can pay his bills as a teacher is to have a second job. \n\nNow that a Senate committee has heard all this, do you think there's going to be any changes? Most likely not. They'll spend 9 months to a year compiling the information and creating a report. That report will be presented to the Senate and then be filed away somewhere never to be seen again.\n\nhttps://news.yahoo.com/extremely-low-pay-cited-u-214254809.html",

            "Ok so I live in a high cost of living area of SoCal and new teacher pay typically starts around $65k with a masters and credits. Additionally, it takes ten years of steps to break $100k; which is still not enough to live comfortably in the HCOL area my school is in so I have to commute. \nFor perspective, most homes in the area are selling between 1-1.5million. \n\nThe qualifications to get me the job include: a 4 year bachelors degree, a two year credential program, a two year masters degree, 6 months of unpaid student teaching, passing the sets of CBEST exams, the CSET exams, RICA exam, and CalTPAs. Also applicants must have a very clean criminal record (I shoplifted a hat when I was *16* and the CTC initially rejected my credential. It took almost 6 months of appeals to get it through). \n\nAll in all I spent over 8 years and *tens of thousands* of dollars to work in a career field in which I will never be able to afford a home and the general public respects less and less. \n\nIf I want to claim 100% of my pension I need an insane *40* years of service! My benefits are slowly becoming more expensive as the union negotiates away pieces of the benefits package year after year, trading for COL raises that don\u2019t nearly match inflation. \n\nAt least there is job security, right? Nope. One of my nearby districts just laid off over 100 teachers. \n\nTo make things worse, my working conditions become exponentially worse every year as the special education field continues to devolve into a litigious nightmare and administration gets weaker and weaker.\n\nI don\u2019t know why any sane person would choose this career field.",

            "It\u2019s not JUST low pay. It\u2019s how we are treated, the workload and the expectations put upon us. We are blamed for all the problems with students/society.  They expect miracles from us, yet treat us like we are children, force curriculum and standards that we know will not improve student learning, and talk like we are lazy whiners because we get 2 months off. All of this coming from politicians that barely work a few months a year. Then, add low pay, and who the hell would want to do this job??",

In order for municipal employees -- including teachers -- to see their pay even approach annual increases that professionals in the private sector can ask for, the people need to vote for those funds.\n\nSo long as the general population determines the funding of education, educators will remain a second class of citizen. Just run a comparison on the cars in the faculty parking lot vs the cars the student parking lot.",
            "Given that education is a federal interest but largely controlled at the state and local levels there is little the federal government can tangibly do about teacher pay. The federalist system creates a hodgepodge of fiefdoms - aka local school districts - and all are funded somewhat differently with different tax bases and a variety of GSA funding mechanisms from various states. The Senate will just spend money conducting hearings and probably publish a report like they did in the 1960s with the Kerner Report on Civil Disorders but it won't change the fundamental nature of the problem.",

During the time I was in her class I was heavily depressed, hurting myself, and thinking of not being here anymore. Each time I walked in her clasroom she consistently asked if I was okay or how I was doing. Even though I always lied and told her l was fine, she never stopped asking, even when she received the same answer every day. It was a small gesture but it made me feel like someone cared about me and saw that I wasn\u2019t ok. It also made me feel less alone and her class became a safe space for me during that time. Now because I graduated during covid I didn\u2019t get to thank her and she left my school soon after. I recently found her LinkedIn and I\u2019m thinking of messaging her to thank her because I really do need to thank her since I don\u2019t know if I would be here without her.\n\nDo you think it is appropriate to reach out to thank her and tell her what I\u2019ve told you here?",

            "Definitely! Not only will it make your former teacher\u2019s day/month/decade, it will reinforce to the teacher how important those little acts are for her current and future students.
