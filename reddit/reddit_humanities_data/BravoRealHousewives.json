            "The downfall of housewives was social media and GIFs! \n\nHousewives was great, TRULY great, when folks weren\u2019t worried about going viral, becoming a meme, or interested in becoming GIFable.",
            "Ok maybe a controversial opinion, but there are two moments for me that spelled the end of the housewives that we loved.\n\nFirst way Erika Jane coming on the show and setting the precedent that every woman should have glam and look red carpet ready at all times, doing your own hair and makeup won't cut it any more. This by default led to more produced storylines, more manufactured drama and less vulnerability. All series eventually became too Hollywood.\n\nThe second is Phaedra getting fired after that horrible lie she made up. Atlanta and New York were always the lightest and most funny series for me. I absolutely agree that Phaedra should have been let go for that but let's be honest, ATL never recovered and every remaining housewife learned how quickly you can fuck it up for yourself. This led to more self production and self conscious behaviour. Everything therefore became robotic and the wives were terrified to let anything play out organically in fear that something be taken too far or some major storyline would pass them by.",
            "These women had great personalities for reality tv.  But that can only last for so long, reality tv can only remain \"fresh\" for a few seasons (see how potomac went from beloved for it's lightness and authenticity, to falling prey to the same toxic formula as the rest of the franchises).\n\nThrough their fame and the support they received from fans, they got high on their own supplies and viewed themselves as better than the other women or better than the shows themselves, which made them extremely boring, annoying, and in some cases downright sad.\n\nThe only one i could see staying and being fun for a few more seasons (maybe 1 or 2 more) was lvp.",
            "I only agree about Nene. After all this time she's the one that lives rent free in my head. I always feel so sad that she doesn't get paid per meme, because that would be one hellofa Trump Check.",
            "Agreed! \n\nI mean, at least the housewives that brought us here. The formula makers themselves!\n\nSadly, those ladies all grew toxic and just don't have a place anymore. \n\nLVP could return but she's gonna have to get some new material. Over on VPR she's still making jokes about trouser snakes and sex with Ken only on birthdays\ud83d\ude44",
            "The downfall was social media and parasocials getting involved! The podcasters, Jeff Lewis  etc. \n\nlike why as a podcaster are you team Ariana or team Theresa and pushing storylines???",
            "Who is the second one?",
            "Hard disagree agree about Vicki, she was the worst",
            "I hate to admit it bc I'm not a Monique fan, but when Monique left Potomac too",
            "Nene, yes. Bethenny, maybe, the blondes were already getting played out. The other two leaving didn't change things for the worse imo. Vicki NEEDED to be checked with her firing and S15/16 would've still had problems with her there. LVP's leaving got us Garcelle/Sutton which in my opinion have been way better than latter seasons LVP."
