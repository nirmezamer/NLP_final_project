            "I still stand by the fact that housewives hasn\u2019t been the same since Erica fucking Girardi introduced all the housewives to \u201cglam\u201d.",
            "No, it\u2019s when these ladies got so big for their britches that they thought they *were* the show and became no fun to watch. \n\nVicki and Nene especially were torturous to watch in the final few seasons they were around.",
            "The downfall was social media and parasocials getting involved! The podcasters, Jeff Lewis  etc. \n\nlike why as a podcaster are you team Ariana or team Theresa and pushing storylines???",
            "I only agree about Nene. After all this time she's the one that lives rent free in my head. I always feel so sad that she doesn't get paid per meme, because that would be one hellofa Trump Check.",

            "Who is the second one?",
            "Hard disagree agree about Vicki, she was the worst",
            "Nene, yes. Bethenny, maybe, the blondes were already getting played out. The other two leaving didn't change things for the worse imo. Vicki NEEDED to be checked with her firing and S15/16 would've still had problems with her there. LVP's leaving got us Garcelle/Sutton which in my opinion have been way better than latter seasons LVP.",

He reminds me of that Jeremy Meeks dude \u201cHot Felon\u201d who was married and his wife stuck by him while he was incarcerated, paying for everything and taking care of their kid; and, as soon as he got an opportunity to make some real money and fame, he dropped her like a bad habit. \n\nMoral of the story, don\u2019t ever take care of a man financially; every single woman I know that has was NEVER met with the same energy in return. No loyalty whatsoever, these men are for the streets.",
