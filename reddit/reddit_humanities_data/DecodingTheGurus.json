Join Matt and Chris as they embark on a multi-part journey through the diverse biomes of Dr. K's content and try to ascertain the meta.\n\nIn this first episode, Matt and Chris take a critical look at a 2019 video in which Dr. K discusses his views on Ayurvedic medicine, the problems with Western medicine, and the unacknowledged scientific evidence for Ayurvedic claims. We consider whether the evidence provided matches the rhetoric and relive youthful follies as we immerse ourselves in the all too familiar water of complementary and alternative medicine discourse.\n\nSo join us as we learn about the universal mind and single type of depression proposed by modern medicine, how a tripartite classification is actually incredibly individualistic, how the shape of your nose and kink in your hair predicts the food you should eat and the quality of your bowel movements, and the surprising benefits of drinking elephant milk.\n\nIn Part 2, we will delve into Dr. K's recent discussion/debate over Ayurvedic medicine with Dr. Mike, another popular YouTube doctor. And finally Part 3 will focus on the dynamics of Dr. K's long-form, somewhat controversial, mental health-themed interviews with influencers.\n\n**Links**\u00a0\n\n* [Dr. K's Healthy Gamer GG website](https://www.healthygamer.gg/)\n* [Healthy Gamer GG- Ayurveda Pt. 1: Gunas, Cognitive Fingerprint, Personality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BEdhS9-cno)\n* [Science is Dope: Should we adopt Ayurveda | An Indian's response | Dr. Mike vs Dr. K](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDDcmQiOGrc)\n* [List of Studies mentioned in the episode](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e73BJE0QKeWoHLkm7FFZyAMeYqhHmBvNX_w1dE4YK68/edit?usp=sharing)\n* [Simon Singh's court case that Chris mentioned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Singh#Chiropractic_lawsuit)\n* [The Iced Coffee Hour: Harvard Psychiatrist on How To Get Ahead of 99.9% of People (Starting NOW)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-XDOnSSUzI)\n* Some of Matt's related papers: 1) Thomson, P., Jones, J., Browne, M., & Leslie, S.

            "Had to pause it at 1:15 mark because they are actually on something I know a good amount about and to say Matt is spot on with his discussion about multiple intelligences and learning styles being bullshit. I was really into Howard Gardner's multiple intelligences approach to education in the 2000s and kept up with the evolving literature into the topic into the 2010s when many studies were shown that the whole field was riding on paper thin evidence and was basically b.s., which sucked for me a little since I was trying my best to adapt mine and other teacher's pedogogy to it, but based on the evidence I changed courses.",
            "The question is, will Dr. K use his right to reply.  Right now I'm 50/50.  Dr K. has been getting more heat as of late and he might not be able to ignore DTG if these episodes get a lot of traction.",
            "Did anyone else get annoyed that he kept using the sanskrit for types-of-guy instead of 'fire-type' because saying \"oh, you get tired when you are depressed because you are an earth type soul\" sounds like woo-woo stuff if you just say it all in English?\n\nI'm genuinely curious to get the real scoop about this guys career trajectory because from what I can find online it looks like an improbable amount of failing upwards. Like it just seems improbable to get in to a good medical school with a c grade point average (I believe he said he had c average in undergrad?) since med school admission in the USA is extremely competitive and numbers based where unless your gpa is 3.7+ you can completely forget about it.",

            "What is this \"Western medicine doesn't treat individuals\" nonsense based on? I (in the US) have a relative being treated for type 2 diabetes. They were only diagnosed with that after getting (individual) bloodwork, the doctor confirming that their (individual) glucose/A1c were in a certain range, and then they got dosages of medication based on their individual needs. Over time their medication was adjusted based on their individual response to it.\n\nOh right, that idea came from the same place as the MBTI: someone just made it up.",

        "content": "Last weekend I got really high and I randomly started thinking about making sense of sense making. That episode makes me laugh because of how self indulgent the gurus were and Jamie Weals right to reply episode made him sound like a clown. \n\nHowever last weekend Game B started to make sense to me. I think the basic idea is that the world has changed so much that there needs to be some sort of change in how we deal with problems. For example, without the scientific revolution we wouldn\u2019t have had the Age of Enlightenment which led to the current state of affairs we have now. \n\nTheir belief is the world has gone through another transformation and we need something as impactful as the scientific revolution \u201ca paradigm shift\u201d if you will. We can\u2019t fully describe what that is yet because we don\u2019t know what it is hence why it needs to be described poetically rather than through words.\n\nThe Age of Enlightenment didn\u2019t come out of nowhere, neither did the scientific revolution, they were proceeded by many schools of thought that proceeded them. For example, physics and biology were named after Aristotle works. They existed before the scientific revolution but obviously the scientific method enhanced them. Ie. they were \u201ctouching the elephant,\u201d of a deeper concept but didn\u2019t get to it. Jordan Hall needs to run 70-90 paradigms because they are all hinting to \u201cgame b,\u201d but haven\u2019t captured it. Maybe by combining them all we can discover it. \n\nI am relistening to the decoding the gurus episode now and continue to laugh the same way I did when I first heard it. This doesn\u2019t change my feelings about that ridiculous conversation with 5,000 metaphors, and doesn\u2019t change that \u201cgame b\u201d is probably a useless concept. But I got high, none of my friends listen to this podcast and I wanted to share this with someone. \n\nThanks, hope you guys are all having a good weekend. \n\n",

This is distinct from our current rivalrous Game A civilisation that is replete with destructive externalities and power asymmetries that produce existential risk. Yet Game B is not a prescriptive ideology (or an ideology at all): while the eyes of Game B players may be fixed on the same flag, the hills are multitudes and the flag sits atop each, and no player individually is equipped to map a route in advance.\u201d\n\nIt can be anything you like, man!
