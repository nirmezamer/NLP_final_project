            "It was 2D, still, and as far as I know just the Zeldas. Their might have been links potentially as part of the pattern but I don't quite remember that. Just the four Zelda's doing the same dance pose on a still 2D drawing.",

            "**Hopefully this is the right subreddit to ask this, but I need help finding some Zelda Fanart!**\n\nThe visual description (I don't remember the artist or their social platform): Consisted of Four different Zeldas dancing in a circle-ish/kaleidoscopic pattern (Zeldas were BoTW, OoT, TP & SS possibly), all set against a white background with some sort of pattern.\n\nIf you know the art and the artists, please link it in the comments! I'll be eternally grateful!",
            "Was this 2d or 3d art style?\n\nStill or animation?\n\nJust the Zeldas, or also the Links?",
            "It was a pretty non-descript dance, it's not a trend or anything. I guess the it's like this section of the Bully Maguire Dance in Spiderman 3 (2:11 - 2:13)\n\n\n- https://youtu.be/nasDc3enl5s?si=eePKHC9p0WF-2rqO\n\n\n(this isn't a joke, I apologize lol, this is the most approximate description I can give you.)\n\n\nGood luck!

I don't know how well it would translate to retro wave though.  I think the ALTTP Dark World dungeons would make for a good 80's horror synth.  And the Hyrule Castle theme from BOTW would work really nicely with it's slow build up imo."

            "Depends on how forceful youre being imo lol. But certainly its a franchise worth playing for any gamer who wants to understand the industry/history and they all hold up given some relative grace for the limitations of their era/hardware. The NES games arent necessarily as fun or easy to play as some more modern games but the excellence/importance of the game design remains obvious",

If I end up in end-of-life care I want them to hook me up with a VR headset where those games are playing so I can go out the way I came in.",
            "im playing through OOT currently for the first time as an adult. ive messed around and got far in college and never had an n64 growing. that game has been triggering very specific feelings i had about it when i was little. the world is very mysterious and has tons of layers to peel away. not to mention the ultimate power up from being a helpless kid to a full on adult. it brought up feelings that you only have as a child. strangely complex emotions that dont exist as an adult who knows the world much better now. i actually will have my kids play it. theres a lot to discover and u destined in that game. even the other zelda games i grew up on would age extremely well as a kids first video game.",

Listening to Zelda's words here, my jaw nearly hit the floor, because she literally says it aloud.",
