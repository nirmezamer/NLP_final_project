            "Last year, r/Zelda and r/LoFiHipHop [collaborated](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/12g2fc9/all_rzelda_and_rlofihiphop_are_doing_a/) to make a TOTK Themed Lo-Fi album which raised $500 in support of [Zeldathon](https://zeldathon.com/), an annual fundraiser supporting a number of charities. This year we're doing it again with a twist! In honor of the first ever Legend of Zelda title, released in 1986, Zeldathon has a 80's theme for this years event, so we just have to create a Synthwave Album of all Zelda remixes to fit this theme!\n\n100% of proceeds from the album will be donated through this year's Zeldathon in support of [St. Jude's Children's Hospital](https://www.stjude.org/). Anyone (that means you) can comment their favorite Zelda Song and we'll remix it as part of the album! If you make art or music and want to get involved, feel free to leave a comment and we'll get back to you! \n\nIf you'd like to listen to last years project you can do so here:  https://youtu.be/dMANfEM1nmQ    Thanks all!",
