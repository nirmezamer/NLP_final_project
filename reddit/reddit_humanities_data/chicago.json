            "There are a couple decent gift card deals on Costco.com for members that might be relevant to this thread - $100 (2x$50) in Uber GCs for $80 & $100 (4x$25) in Alamo Drafthouse GCs for $75\u2026 also saw some for Potbelly, White Sox, Nascar & various concerts but I\u2019m not typing all that. Have fun!",
            "I need to rent a car for a day trip. I was considering Zipcar because there's multiple locations within walking distance from me, but then I see from reviews on Reddit (in NYC not here) that Zipcar really tanked during the pandemic and the cars would be gross or not even there when they were supposed to be. Anyone have experience with using Zipcar recently in Chicago and how was it?\n\nFollow up question... or should I just go with Turo or a car rental company? Open to other suggestions.",
            "Hey folks, when commuting with an umbrella, please dont put it on the seat next to you because it makes the seat wet for the next person who wants to sit there. Seems like common sense right? But I saw several selfish clueless people doing it this morning.",

            "How hard is it to ride the blue line in a wheelchair? Do you just park it next to the door? If not, where do you go? My dad will be going downtown with me next month. I'll be with him, so I can help push / stow the wheelchair. He can walk a few steps, so he could move to a seat, and I could collapse the wheelchair to take up less space. I found the list of accessible stations on the CTA website, but not any other rules / instructions for people in wheelchairs.",
            "Great show by Kurt Vile at SPACE last night. Not only was the music incredible, but he literally used a different guitar for each song. Cool collection of instruments! Must be a pain to take on the road and keep them all in tune.",
            "The weather is perfect today. Sunny, cool with a gentle breeze. Can it stay like this all year?",
            "Any recommendations for adult fishing classes (idek if that's a thing) in the city? I always see people fishing at Montrose and it looks fun but I have no idea where to begin learning."

Once I inflate the paddleboard, I\u2019ll need to store the pump and large duffel bag I\u2019ll carry it in. I know I could store this stuff on the board itself and just bring it with me, but is there anywhere that has lockers you can use to keep that stuff in while you\u2019re on the water? I\u2019ll go anywhere I can get to via CTA.",

Going about the medical system in the US has been quite different for me tbh, like scanning one's photo ID. Just very different cause usually where I am from you just give the insurance number and that's it, or just register by writing on paper but everything in the US is done online, even payments. Anyways, any cosmetic dermatology recommendations in Chicago?",

Looking at 15 cars bare minimum in the tow zone right now. That and sketchy dudes without livery numbers asking for passengers."
