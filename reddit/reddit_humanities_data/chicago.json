Asked if they could share the address of the unit so I could figure out commuting logistics, and they replied back with a range of the location (located between the L Line and expressway). Asked again but mentioned if they could provide the intersections instead since I dont have a car and want to figure out commuting, and they just cussed me out in their response. Like wtf?

My boyfriend was a laborer with streets and sanitation, he had some interesting stories to tell. \n\nPeople pulled mattresses out onto porches and balconies, and walking to work at 5:30 in the morning I'd pass them while they slept. \n\nTaking a stroll along a crowded Montrose beach at 10:30 PM under an almost full moon. There were families camped out, kids playing on the water's edge. \n\nAnd ambulances, I remember ambulances.\n",

Lucky for me the 20's courtway apartment already had a place to hang them, as it was the style to have valances between rooms until the 50's. I had to teach the cat how to move the sheet. She wasn't too pleased with the heat. I explained to her many times that her mommy gave her the fur coat, not me.",

            "I was 8 when the heat wave hit. It was obviously the first time I had ever experienced something like that. My mom was in the hospital giving birth to my sister and my dad had my other sister and me at home. We had no a/c whatsoever. However, my mom had 3 high velocity fans, we did the blankets on the doorways and camped out in the living room. All 3 fans blowing on us each night. It's funny, I've never asked him about it, and maybe I should, I wonder how worried he was that he wouldn't let us out of his sight. Every night we all slept on the floor in the living room, I wonder if he slept at all that week.",

We saw the forecast for the pending heat wave and ran to Sears (remember that place?) and bought a window unit for our bedroom, one of the last units remaining. We left our dog in the bedroom during the day when we went to work, then camped in there once we got home. That was some devastating heat!",

Never experienced that before or since. Fucking smelling Chocolate the entire time. That is a plane in Dantes's hell right there. I was a bit happy when I heard that the Factory was closing from that experience 30 years ago. I am repulsed by the smell of chocolate to this day."
