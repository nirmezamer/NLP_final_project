I subscribe to over 10,000 channels so it takes a while to check them all.\n\nIn my own scripts I added a delay for channels that are rarely updated. If there are no new videos since last time it will delay for twice as long as before, up to one year. If there are new videos then it will delay half as long as last delay. This way channels that are frequently updated are checked more often and channels which are rarely updated aren't checked too often: https://github.com/chapmanjacobd/library"
