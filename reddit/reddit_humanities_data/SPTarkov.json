        "content": "Crossposted from Discord...\n\nHey everyone!\n\nIt took a lot of super careful deliberation, and some *really* hard choices, but we finally have a winner for our SPT Logo Design Contest!\n\nYou've probably already noticed, but we have a fresh new logo for the Discord server, and it's already being rolled out across the board for everything SPT related!\n\nSo, onto some stats and the final ranking! We had over **60** submissions, of close to **100** logo designs. Honestly? A lot less meme responses than expected... I don't know whether to be proud or disappointed.\n\nAnyway! We managed to narrow it down to a top 10, and from there we voted to come up with this ranking. I'm going to include the rewards in this ranking, so hopefully it's clear what everyone's won!\n\n# Consolation prize! A shoutout and a big thank-you for making it to the end!\n\n10. nimanul\n\n9. tyvas\n\n8. valeska\n\n7. redlaser42\n\n6. scrob\n\n# Top 5! You're getting your names added to the PMC list in SPT!\n\n5. defonotmaple\n\n4. Panicdots\n\n# Top 3! In addition to the PMC name list, you're also going to be listed as Honored in the SPT Discord!\n\n3. MoxoPixel\n\n2. ShiftedFocus\n\n# And finally, our first place winner, with all of the above prizes as well...\n\n1. Rasdow\n\nThanks so much, everyone, for your extremely professional and creative designs!\n\nAn imgur album with samples from the top 10 logo submissions can be found here: [https://imgur.com/a/yQ8ORUZ](https://imgur.com/a/yQ8ORUZ)\n\n# More information:\n\n**What logos are being used?**\n\nOnly the submission from Rasdow is being used currently. While *any* of the ones in the top 10 are definitely suitable, the SPT Team felt it was best to go with one design for maximum consistency. In addition, the logo design ended up being modular enough to work for a variety of use cases.\n\nA reminder, the logos are licensed as CC BY-NC-ND, which means credit for use is given to \"SPT Team\", for noncommercial purposes, with no derivatives.\n\nAn archive or website page with adopted logos is being considered for release for use in mods, articles, youtube videos, etc. We'll have more information about that in the future.\n\n**Reminder:**\n\nWe've officially rebranded to SPT, so we ask that when referring to the project in any form (mods, social media posts, videos, etc.), please refer to it as such. The old name is gone, and so, long live SPT!",
