            "hi! I have a question about what it really is like to work in HR. I have come to learn over the last few years that I am really passionate about coworker's rights being respected, about improving the culture of the workplace, improving the systems and structures of the workplace, helping people find opportunities for growth, and being available for coworkers to vent their concerns and complaints as wellxas helping mitigate conflicts.\n\nRecently, it's occured to me that maybe HR is a job where i could do these things. But I've heard that HR is very often working for the benefit of the company, and less so to the benefit of employees. Realistically, how often are HR professionals made to prioritize a company at the expense of employees? If I were to get into HR, would I be able to effectively advocate for the interests of my coworkers? Would I be able to help hold employers accountable to labor laws and the such? I've been told by some peers that I would more likely get fired for trying to do that. Does anyone have any insight into this?",

I\u2019d also be curious to know how much of a pay difference I would have in an entry level HR role so any insight on pay would be helpful! I\u2019m not all that concerned with making loads of money or anything, just want to ensure I can still feed myself.\ud83d\ude42"

I by and large have enjoyed working here. \n\nI have been in leadership for 4 years and have a great reputation with those I lead and my co workers . \n\nRecently me and one of my co workers, who is also very experienced went out for the same position! It was on our team and everyone loves us and respects us and it seemed obvious that one of us would get the new role. \n\nInstead our leader picked a close personal friend who has little leadership experience and a TERRIBLE reputation amongst peers, as his next sr leader. \n\nIt has left the team in shock and I am wondering from any HR perspective what can be done? Because it is messed up and our team lead never disclosed to any higher ups that he was friends with this guy, but most people know he is. \n\nNot only did he betray his leadership team and tank morale but he also did something unethical, he never disclosed his deep personal connection to his new hire and he had no real reason but just vague corporate speak as to why he picked the other person. \n\nShould I tell HR? Should I tell his leader? Who is my director? \n\nWhat is HRs advice here? ",

            "I knew the answer from the title, no offense. Being unethical is not, in and of itself, illegal or actionable and in this case, it doesn't even sound unethical as much as it sounds like they simply made a decision you don't agree with.\n\nI don't think you're wrong or lying, to be clear. This guy who got the job probably is a totally underqualified or unqualified slapdick who bullshitted and brownnosed his way into it.\n\nMy advice? Get used to it or get ready for a lifetime of frustration. This happens all the time everywhere and has since the concept of friendship was invented.\n\nHiring/promoting people based on personal judgement is not an actionable offense in the workplace. \n\nAlso, think about this: suppose you were able to get what you want (?) here somehow, someone stepped in and undid that promotion to give the gig to you. How do you think you would be treated given that your boss would know that you were responsible for costing his buddy the job?\n\nEither get over it or find a new job, but if you go with option 2, just remember this is not going to be the last time this happens."

It's a minor suckage that you have to use your PTO for it, but other than that, it's a net benefit for everyone.\n\nAlso, to directly answer your question, it's perfectly legal. When there's a business downturn, a company will often shut down for 1 or 2 weeks at the end of December, and require employees to take PTO or else take unpaid time off. It happens very often. This is a similar thing.",
