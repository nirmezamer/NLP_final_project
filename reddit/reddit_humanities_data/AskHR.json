            "hi! I have a question about what it really is like to work in HR. I have come to learn over the last few years that I am really passionate about coworker's rights being respected, about improving the culture of the workplace, improving the systems and structures of the workplace, helping people find opportunities for growth, and being available for coworkers to vent their concerns and complaints as wellxas helping mitigate conflicts.\n\nRecently, it's occured to me that maybe HR is a job where i could do these things. But I've heard that HR is very often working for the benefit of the company, and less so to the benefit of employees. Realistically, how often are HR professionals made to prioritize a company at the expense of employees? If I were to get into HR, would I be able to effectively advocate for the interests of my coworkers? Would I be able to help hold employers accountable to labor laws and the such? I've been told by some peers that I would more likely get fired for trying to do that. Does anyone have any insight into this?",
            "Hi all, I\u2019m a 26F career changer and am looking to move into the HR field. Any advice would be appreciated! Also currently pursuing the aPHR certification through Coursera, hoping that gives me a leg up",
            "  \nI am currently on my final semester, as a psych major in hungary  \nSpent the past 2 years working as a Talent Acquisiton intern at big companies - current one is a global pharma company, where I am supporting the whole EMEA region. Also spent 1.5 months at another global company as an HR generalist intern, but the team was toxic so I left soon.\n\nMy main goal is to get into an HRBP role, I am really interested in change management, org development, people relations, people and culture and labour law.\n\nMy boss, the Talent Acquisition partner I am an intern for is leaving our company soon, and I may get to replace them, which is an exciting opportunity, having a job right out the gate after uni, with a very nice starting pay and benefits. I like the company, the culture is nice, and they support people in furthering their careers in potentially different directions than their current role. I am wondering if staying here, learning some things for a year or two would be more beneficial for me over going into an HR generalist role straight away.\n\nIf anyone could give me some insight as to what could be better down the line, I'd greatly appreciate it.\n\n\n\nThank you!"

        "content": "Hi everyone!\n\nHoping this is the right sub for this...I\u2019m looking for some advice on how to respond to a less-than-ideal job offer I recently received.\n\nHere\u2019s some background:\n\nI have over 12 years of experience in in marketing, communications and strategy. Last night I received an offer for a position at a company I\u2019m really excited about. The job post was initially written and intended for someone with just one year of experience, with a starting salary of $50,000, but I reached out and pitched myself for a broader, more big-picture role and, after a few conversations, we seemed on the same page. Yesterday they reached out and offered me $52,000, which I\u2019m fine accepting given their current size (small business, but growing fast) and despite it being a significant pay cut from my current self-employed freelance income.\n\nHowever, the sticking point for me is the required 40 hours/week in the office with no flexibility or additional PTO. I currently have a lot more freedom in my work schedule and location, and I know I can deliver results much more efficiently than a less experienced hire.\n\nHere are the benefits listed in the current offer:\n\n* **Benefits**:\n   * Healthcare coverage available after 60 days (company contributes 50% to health insurance premiums)\n   * Paid Time Off (PTO): 10 days earned year two, available on anniversary of hire (earned at a rate of 0.42 days per month)\n   * 6 paid holidays per year\n   * Year-end bonus based on results\n   * 401(k) plan with up to 3.5% match after 12 months\n\nThe only reason I\u2019m considering this position is because I\u2019m genuinely excited about the company and its potential. I believe that if I do my job well, I can help them grow significantly.\n\nHere are the key points I\u2019d like to address in my negotiation:\n\n* Increased PTO (if I'm reading this correctly, I have to work for a full year without any PTO days?)\n* Work Flexibility: Requesting some flexibility in work hours or the possibility of occasional remote work days.\n* Alternative Arrangement for Probationary Period: Considering proposing a part-time/hourly/1099 arrangement for the 90-day probationary period while we figure out what the role actually looks like and ensure it\u2019s a good fit for both parties. (The offer doesn't contain any job description or responsibilities write-up...it's literally just one page with benefits and the salary)\n\nAs mentioned, I\u2019m really excited about this company and the potential to contribute to their growth, but I cannot in good faith commit to being chained to a desk 40 hours a week with no flexibility and this informal offer has me more than a little concerned about company culture. How should I approach this negotiation to increase my chances of success without jeopardizing the offer?\n\nAny advice or insight from the experts would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEdit: typo",

            "Read the PTO carefully, you get 10 days after two years. So you will work 2 years without any vacation days. That would be a no-go for me.",
            "The offer depressed me. The pay is low, there is like nothing I see here impressive and the company doesn\u2019t value their human talent. \u00a0Ask for a lot more PTO and flexibility. \u00a0",
            "$52k and no PTO for a professional with 12 YOE isn't something worth getting excited over. My nanny got more than that last year. That's not a serious offer from a serious company, and I wouldn't be surprised at all if your expectations regarding their growth (and your compensation along with it) go unmet.",
            "I mean they must have some really great marketing and branding for you to be so excited to be part of their team. And to still consider to join despite what in reality is a bad offer. \n\nObviously I don\u2019t know the details but I\u2019m not seeing why you would go for this at this stage in your career",
            "this might actually be the worst job offer I\u2019ve ever seen. it\u2019s insulting. 2 years to accrue vacation time with no mention of sick time? 40 hours a week, in office, for $52k?? this has to be a joke. $25/hour for 12+ years of experience??? in what world is this ok?",
            "I feel like you\u2019re starting at my old job where I had the same lackluster benefits. The increased flexibility will probably be the easiest thing to swing for. What they\u2019re offering in base salary is a lot higher than their original number, so I could see them saying \u201cforget it, we\u2019ll go with someone less experienced and cheaper.\u201d I\u2019m not saying you don\u2019t deserve more or that you shouldn\u2019t negotiate, but that\u2019s the exact mindset the owner of my last job would\u2019ve had. \n\nHow do you see the probationary period benefiting you? If you go part-time I imagine they\u2019ll cut your salary. Are you still going to be freelancing?",
            "Salary, pto, benefit costs are all abysmal.. there is no good part of this offer at all",
            "I would just ask delicately if there is flexibility to any of the benefits/PTO and 40 hours in the office policy.  Frankly, none of this should have been a surprise and should have been outlined or discussed in conversations prior to an actual offer.  Unless you already set expectations about what you are looking for in these areas, you might be surprising them and that could strain the relationship.",
            "It sounds like they still stuck you into that entry level job, they probably think they got a pro for entry level pay.",
            "Be careful - I think it\u2019s a pretty slippery slope to assume they will even alot you the resources you\u2019d need to help them in any significant way with the way this offer reads \n\nPretty garbage proposal all around and I\u2019d reconsider if I wanted to work here - maybe look up some of there competitors and start there to see if they have any openings like this one you can apply for"
