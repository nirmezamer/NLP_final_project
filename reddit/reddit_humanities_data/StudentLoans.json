        "content": "Please read the entire post and links!!\n\nA regulatory change effective July 1 2024 will sunset the PAYE plan and with the exception of consolidated Parent Plus borrowers, income contingent repayment.  Also note that starting July 1, if you are on SAVE for at least sixty months (clock starts July 1), you will no longer have access to \"new\" IBR.\n\n**Who is currently eligible for PAYE?**\n\nOnly Direct Loan borrowers not in default with no loans taken out prior to October 1, 2007 and who have at least one disbursement (which could be a consolidation loan) on or after October 1, 2011 are eligible for this plan.  Note if first entering the plan your income must be such that your payment under paye would not be higher than it would be under a ten year standard/level plan.  PP loans are only eligible if they meet the above criteria and are double consolidated.\n\n**Who is currently eligible for ICR?**\n\nAll non-defaulted Direct Loan borrowers are eligible for ICR regardless of income and loan balance.  PP borrowers must consolidate to access the plan (but no need to double consolidate)  EDIT - i've confirmed that double consolidated PP loans will remain eligible for ICR\n\n**Who should consider ICR or PAYE?**\n\nThe PAYE plan forgives the balance of your loans after 20 years on the plan regardless of loan type.  SAVE forgives at 25 years if you have even a dollar of graduate school debt or double consolidated PP loans.  PAYE caps the payment at no more than you would pay under a ten year standard/level plan regardless of how high your income goes.  SAVE has no such cap.  Therefore borrowers with graduate school debt and/or whose income is high or anticipated to rise may want to consider switching to PAYE to get the assurance of the capped payment amount and/or the 20 versus the 25 year forgiveness.\n\nICR caps the payment at no more than what would be paid under a 12 year term, minus a percentage related to income.  ICR has a 25 year forgiveness.  Borrowers close to either PSLF or IDR forgiveness whose income is high compared to their loan balance should consider ICR as in that scenario, it can often be the lowest IDR/PSLF qualifying payment.\n\n**How do i know if i should switch?**\n\nIt's time to math!  Use the loan simulator tool https://studentaid.gov/loan-simulator/  and see what your payment would be under SAVE, PAYE and ICR.  Determine how long you have before forgiveness under PSLF, if applicable, or the IDR plans.  You may not know exactly but you should have a ballpark idea in your head how long you've been making payments.  Multiply the payment amount in the calculator by how many months you have left until forgiveness.  You likely want the plan that results in the lowest amount.\n\nIt may be that paye has a higher monthly payment for you, but because the forgiveness is five years sooner, and therefore 60 monthly payments less, that paye is the cheaper option over time.\n\n**If i go on paye or ICR now can i switch back to another plan such as SAVE?**\n\nYes - but if you do you will never be able to get back on paye or ICR.  You also must be sure to recertify your income annually to stay on  those plans.\n\n**What if I apply today for these plans and they aren't processed by July 1?**\n\nYou will still have been considered to have met the deadline as long as the application was completed and processed eventually.\n\n**Why are they sunsetting these plans?**\n\nTo simplify the options for borrowers and to avoid a loophole where a borrower gets a lower monthly payment on SAVE and then in year 19 flips over to the shorter forgiveness programs of paye and new ibr.  Note that PP borrowers will not be barred from ICR at any point as long as the loans are consolidated (do not need to be double consolidated for ICR)\n\nMore information about these plans.  https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/plans/income-driven#eligibility  \n\nExample:\nBorrower has been paying for 15 years\nBorrower owes $100K - income of $120K\nSAVE payment is $727\nICR is $1275\nPAYE is $818\n\nBorrower should consider PAYE.  While the payment is higher it will never get above $1085 no matter how high their income goes and therefore their total left out of pocket before the 20 year forgiveness at most will be $65,100.  If they stay on the currently lower monthly SAVE they will pay back at least $87,240 before forgiveness at the 25 year forgiveness.\n\n\nThis is just an example - results are very borrower specific.",

            "The ICR info is extremely important.  I make too much for SAVE to be a reasonable payment so I got on ICR and my payment is only in the $100s per month.  I need to be on this bc I believe I am close to but havent qualified for forgiveness yet - I may need a year or two more.  I had no idea about this being an option and that there was a deadline.  Everyone should look at this option if SAVE wouldnt work for them.",
            "Excellent reminder since we're 2 weeks away from the deadline!",
            "I think Im a prime candidate for switching from SAVE to PAYE: income 160K, graduate loans 200K, and Ive already made 15 years of payments.\n\nI have one concern though: will my interest be capitalized when switching to PAYE? Im seeing conflicting answers to that question when searching. I have ~40K in interest.",
            "Thank you for specifying the part about having an application in by July 1st being what matters, and not the servicer completely processing the application by July 1st.\n\nFrom the DOEd final rules document, I had interpreted it as needing to have the application processed by July 1st.  Internally I thought that would be difficult for servicers to differentiate and carry out, and anxiety provoking for borrowers like myself.  Glad this is not the case.",
            "Do you apply on student aid website? Im going to do this today. I have only what i think is less than a year until my 25 years is up and it will be way less than save but still more than my standard payment by far. Thank you.",
            "Given that the SAVE plan might get struck down, would it be a wise decision to go ahead and sign up for PAYE since it's going to be taken away soon, and then if SAVE doesn't get scrapped to switch back down the road?",
            "Can we count on SAVE payments being cut in half starting next month? The loan simulator is still using the 10%. ICR is *significantly* better for me is SAVE stays at 10% but SAVE is slightly better if my payments get cut in half. Now Im wondering if I should just switch to ICR to be safe",
            "thank you! I am on SAVE and considering switching to ICR. I just want to confirm that is not going to mess me up in any way in terms of counting time in repayment towards forgiveness?",
            "I'm opting to upload my income documentation manually and it says no document should be older than 90 days. However, it says I can upload my w2 which is older than 90 days, will that be an issue if I do that?",
            "What should I do as somebody who was in PAYE, mad the calculations and decided (barely) to switch out of SAVE.\n\nI am am 10 years into repayment, have 200k in debt and thank l, I should just resubmit for PAYE. I can't risk not being forgiven."

        "title": "This Week In Student Loans (politics & current events megathread)",
        "score": 53,
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentLoans/comments/1doot1s/this_week_in_student_loans_politics_current/",
        "content": "It's an election year and there are changes on the horizon (of one kind or another) for federal student loan borrowers, so we have regular politics megathreads. This is the one place in /r/StudentLoans to post speculation, opinion, rants, and general discussion about student loan changes in Washington, student-loan-related litigation, the upcoming election's impact on student loan policies, and to ask for advice about how to manage your loans in light of these actual and anticipated developments.\n\n----\n\nWhere things stand on June 25, 2024:\n\n* **SAVE Repayment Plan Litigation**: On Friday, federal judges hearing separate lawsuits in Missouri and Kansas both held that the Biden Administration likely violated the law when it used its rulemaking authority in 2023 to create the SAVE repayment plan. Our own /u/Betsy514 has a megathread explaining those decisions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentLoans/comments/1dnrbah/court_partially_blocks_further_changes_for_save/). While both courts held that some elements of SAVE are either permissible or immune from challenge at the moment, they both ordered ED to halt implementing elements of SAVE that have not yet taken effect, including all forgiveness under the plan (which can be as short as ten years) and the lower 5% of discretionary income calculation for undergraduate loans. Expect the Biden Administration to appeal both orders soon -- since Kansas and Missouri are in different federal appellate circuits, these questions are ultimately headed to the Supreme Court. \n\n* **Servicer transitions**: As happens from time to time, ED is in the process of moving Direct loan accounts among its servicers. (The bulk of the current transfers are because MOHELA requested that ED move about 1.5 million accounts to other servicers.) These servicer shuffles are a routine administrative matter as ED balances its portfolio among its servicers -- there's nothing that affected borrowers can do to cause or prevent a transfer and it's neither a good or bad sign that your loans are/aren't transferred. Transferring *can* be a small inconvenience; transferred borrowers will usually need to create a login with their new servicer and may need to input their payment information (e.g. bank routing numbers) again. During a transition, borrowers will be unable to make payments or access most information about their loans -- this will not affect your credit, if the transition prevents you from making regular monthly payments, you'll get an automatic administrative forbearance for those months.\n\n* **PSLF Processing Pause**: ED is in the process of bringing the paperwork processing for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) and Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) grant programs in-house. Previously loan servicers received and processed those forms and handled the bulk of the administrative tasks for those programs. [Starting May 1st and continuing into July](https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/streamlining-loan-web-experience), borrowers can still submit their forms for those programs, but all processing is paused while all of the servicers' files are moved to ED and ED stands up its internal processing group. During the pause, borrowers will not see any updates on previously submitted forms and may see incorrect (or no) information where they previously saw PSLF qualifying payment counts or data about previous TEACH grants. Loan servicers will continue to handle all other matters, including collecting payments, changing or recalculating repayment plans, and loan consolidation.\n\n* **2024 Election**: The two major presidential candidates have their first debate on Thursday June 27 and it would not be surprising if student loans policy came up. President Biden has been publicizing his administration's various actions on loans, including [at a recent speech](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C7kmMNttcQH) where he noted that his most high-profile effort -- to forgive up to $20,000 of federal student loan debt for millions of borrowers -- was blocked by the Supreme Court. If it comes up, I would expect Biden to tout his Administration's successes in granting or streamlining forgiveness and other relief for tens of millions of borrowers, promise to continue to defend SAVE and other recent borrower-friendly changes in court, and to attempt to reinstate his $20K forgiveness plan through Congressional action or a different Executive strategy that is more likely to survive in court. For his part, [Trump has strongly criticized Biden's student loan actions](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamminsky/2024/06/20/trump-knocks-bidens-vile-student-loan-forgiveness-plans-suggests-reversal/) but has been less specific about what, if anything, he would do differently to help borrowers. Groups allied with the Trump campaign, including Project 2025, have made more specific proposals focused on repealing most federal forgiveness programs, including PSLF, IDR forgiveness, and Borrower Defense to Repayment.\n\n* **FAFSA Troubles**: Changes to student aid rules by Congress and ED were supposed to make the 2024-25 aid process easier for everyone involved and expand aid eligibility. However, those changes took time to implement and, [due to a combination of delays, administrative complexity, and failures](https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2024/05/01/fafsa-rollout-timeline-key-events/73492356007/), the new FAFSA form [was published months behind schedule and still had issues](https://www.npr.org/2024/06/19/1198912680/federal-student-aid-still-up-in-the-air-for-many). As a result, many students were not able to apply for aid and colleges were not able to calculate aid packages timely (many still haven't). Federal financial aid is important or essential help to most students who are now making plans for the fall -- do they start/continue a degree without knowing how much aid they'll get? Do they afford their preferred school or should they apply to a cheaper alternative? Should they move to a cheaper area, look for a full-time job, apply for private loans...? It will be tough to know exactly how bad the problem is until after it's over and we can see how enrollment changed and how much aid was actually disbursed, but it looks to be quite a mess currently.",

If we cant get forgiveness anymore in SAVE, then those who are ineligible for IBR (old and new) will have no other IDR plans to choose. By continuing with the sunset, the government will effectively take away IDR, including the chance at forgiveness, for those who are ineligible for IBR (and dont otherwise qualify for forgiveness under PSLF)."
