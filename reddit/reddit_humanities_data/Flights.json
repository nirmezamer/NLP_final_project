        "content": "Hi all,\n\nMy Gf and I are looking to fly to Tokyo from London next spring. It seems that BA is much cheaper for our dates. Even with extra legroom seats, BA is 400-600 pounds less for the two of us. Also it doesn't seem we're even able to pick extra legroom seats on JAL.\n\n\nPeople keep saying that BA is horrible and JAL is amazing, is it still worth it even with extra legroom and price different to go for JAL? My Gf is average height (5'4) and I'm a tall guy with shitty knees (6'3).\n\n\nSorry if it's a stupid question, but it's our first long haul flight so wanna make sure we don't endure any more nedlees torture than necessary.

            "For economy class, I wouldn't pay 500 quid more just for JAL. Just take BA with extra legroom.\u00a0\n\n\nDepends what 500 quid is worth to you. 5 outstanding meals in Japan.",

            "More than likely here is what was going on. \n\nThe second round trip was scheduled to operate on Airplane B. Airplane B broke or got delayed somewhere. \n\nSo the airline made the decision to operate the second flight on airplane A because it would take a 30 minute delay rather than wait for it's original airplane B which may involve a 3 hour delay, 3 day delay, who knows. \n\nThis type of thing happens very frequently in the airline business. The schedules are designed with very little room for error. So when too many things go wrong, it is all about minimizing impact. I've had several discussions along the lines of \"do we give one trip a 3 hour delay, or 6 trips a 10 minute delay\""
