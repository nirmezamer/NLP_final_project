        "content": "As the community continues to grow and attract people who are just figuring this all out, we've decided to change the weekly thread focus to be more open and encourage newcomer questions and support. Please use this thread if you are seeking support or have newcomer questions. Want to see if your post topic has been discussed here? Type \"subreddit:cptsd\" after a search term in the search bar (ex. \"friendships subreddit:cptsd\"). Here are some common newcomer questions:\n\n* [DAE struggle with expressing anger?](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/search/?q=anger&restrict_sr=1)\n* DAE struggle with [anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/search/?q=anxiety&restrict_sr=1)/ [depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/search/?q=depression&restrict_sr=1)?\n* [What are emotional flashbacks?

These can also be accessed from the auto mod message that greets any post.\n\n**Keep the rules in mind when you post & comment:**\n\n1. [This is a peer support community. Be a supportive peer.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/peer2peersupportguide)\n2. **Don\u2019t ask for diagnosis, don\u2019t diagnose others:** *Respect that you may not have all of OPs details and even a trained, trauma informed care provider cannot diagnose over the internet. So don't. Assume the context of OP as a CPTSD survivor or supportive partner of a CPTSD survivor.*\n3. No [hate speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech)\n4. Please be mindful about triggering content. Avoid graphic thread titles, and use \\[Trigger Warning\\], NSFW and/or the spoiler tag whenever appropriate.\n5. No [RaisedByNarcissists lingo](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/wiki/acronyms): A lot of folks come from the RBN support community. A lot of us do not. To keep the sub inclusive to CPTSD newcomers and survivors of different backgrounds, use common language synonyms for RBN acronyms. [There are some exceptions.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/subrules#wiki_rbn_lingo)\n6. All content must be CPTSD related: Our lives, our struggles, and our victories with CPTSD.\n7. No Self-Promotion: Don't sell stuff or recruit for studies and projects without explicit mod approval. This thread is an exception; in the Vents & Victories thread, you may self-promote blogs, videos, and other media you created.\n\n**BIPOC**\n\nWe recognize that healing communities such as [r/CPTSD](https://old.reddit.com/r/CPTSD) are not exempt from the insidious impacts of racism, whether overt or covert (for example, invalidating, minimizing, or microaggressive comments made by those with good intentions). In these cases, we encourage users to report the comments as Rule #3 violations. Because of the subreddit's high profile and open nature, this problem will continue to be with us, and we therefore can only promise a \"safe-ish\" environment for BIPOC. Racial trauma will always be on topic here at /r/CPTSD, but BIPOC users that want a more closed space can make use of /r/cptsd_bipoc. *Thank you to the mod team at* /r/cptsd_bipoc *for helping us write this verbiage.*\n\n**Additional Newcomer Resources**\n\n* [Crisis Resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/index#wiki_crisis_support_resources)\n* [Emotional Flashback 1st Aid Kit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/firstaidkit)\n* [Grounding & Containment Tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/groundingandcontainment)\n* [An FAQ Guide to CPTSD](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/faq)\n* [Our Library of Books, Media, and Healing Resources for CPTSD](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/thelibrary)\n* [Common Myths About CPTSD](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/cptsdmythbuster)\n* [The 5-Steps to Find a Therapist Plan](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/quickandeasytherapisthunt)\n* The [CPTSD Wiki Project Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/quickandeasytherapisthunt), while currently under construction, has all of the above information and regular updates on many additional topics you may find helpful in your healing journey",

            "I was forced to watch it as a child. It causes a lot of stress and a bad trauma response from me. Total internal panic.",
            "I can\u2019t stand sex scenes, implied or explicit- I feel sick and flooded with emotions and memories. I can\u2019t and my tolerance seems to have gotten lower with age and therapy.",
            "Me too. Got shit on for setting it as a deal breaker for next relationship. Apparently no one is responsible for my triggers and I'm crazy",
            "I am severely anti-porn because it has high ties to trafficking and is extremely hard to verify consent even on sites that claim to verify users. I know because I was trafficked and separately coerced to do porn, being convinced I wanted to do it.\n\nAs for sex scenes, since someone here mentioned it, I argue showing them in things that you wouldn't obviously expect them in is just unconsensual in nature and that too many rich people likely enjoy that factor.",
            "Same. I was raped and violated as a child and it was recorded then uploaded. It does make me angry, but I hate people who go to sites like pornhub, because I know for a fact that they have videos of people's actual rapes and abuse on there and if someone values their spank bank more than they value the safety of the people they're watching, I hate them.",
            "I turned to it as an addiction when I was in my early teens, I wasn't ready for it, I abused myself daily and no one told me to stop so naturally I thought no one knew but a sense of paranoia come with this kind of secret and a sense of social distancing as well of course. Because it was still an addiction and addiction occurs in place of both healthy relationships and healthy coping habits. So I fed the bad or poor habit and it basically means I cant go a day without actively being triggered because what I see in the real world or even through entertainment ... I would basically try my best to replicate it with adult content. It's very unfortunate and my cptsd has not made it any easier to cope with better habits... I'm well aware I get no benefits but I'm so alone and full of shame to begin with and I can't seem to undo the shame of my entire being or history or place in society enough to shake off this habit. I've no idea what to do.",
            "It is for me, too. Can't stand the stuff. I also cant stand \"breastaurants\". I could talk forever about it. I hate there's a \"demand\" and the \"supply\" rarely truly have autonomy and true power in the situation. Idk. Then another side of me realizes other sell their bodies in other ways even if its a 40 hours 9 to 5. But is it truly consent if it's the lesser of many \"evil\" decisions some need to make to survive. Big sigh.",
            "There's nothing wrong with the sex acts in of themselves due to being human sexuality and thus natural when it comes to consenting adults. The thing that I absolutely cannot tolerate about porn is the capitalistic attitudes about it. Capitalism turns everyone and everything into a commodity and what it has done to human sexuality is just sickening and disgusting. You won't meet genuine people in that filthy business.",
            "Porn has hurt me within relationships more times than I can count. Can\u2019t even look at it anymore without being triggered. Dating porn addicts really ruins you lol",
            "Yeah same. I was coerced into taking nude pictures when I was 12 and were uploaded online. It pains me to know my pics are still out there on some pedophile(s) hard drive. I know it's a trauma response but I'll never be okay with people giving masturbation material to predators."

(And of course: being hypervigilant like that makes me more prone to being triggered.) DAE struggle with this? Anyone have success at believing they\u2019re safe?",

            "I'm feeling pretty safe these days, but it's not a black and white thing. The point of saying \u201cI\u2019m safe now, in the present.\u201d is to remind myself that the feelings don't fit the situation that I'm being triggered by. The feelings fit with a much more dangerous seeming situation than the one I'm dealing with in the present. That's almost always the case for my flashbacks. I think that sometimes they are trying to warn me of some danger that I may not be seeing.\n\nIf you are in some real danger and telling yourself that you're not, then you may need to take some action to make yourself safer.",
            "EMDR was the only thing that helped me break this cycle. I highly recommend it.",
            "I feel like it's always 50/50 for me. Sometimes it works like a charm, sometimes it doesn't work at all. Sometimes it only works for a moment. I think it might depend on the trigger itself, as some of them are more impactful than others.\n\nIf you're in a position to do so, what I recommend is having someone tell that you're safe in the present /to/ you rather than telling this to yourself. A partner or a friend. I find that in certain dire situations I can only believe it and benefit from it when I hear these words said at me by a person who is calm and rational, I believe them because they're not undergoing emotions distorting their reality like I am, so they must be right.",
            "What\u2019s helped me is grounding. I carry a relaxing essential oil with me all the time, and focus on what can I see, smell, touch, and hear. My fibromyalgia flares when I\u2019m triggered, and I have to repeat with slow breaths that I\u2019m safe now. The breaths are inhale for 6, hold for 7, exhale for 8. Exhales always need to he the longest. Sometimes it takes a lot longer to feel okay, but I allow for the feelings to come versus letting them build up. Hope that helps you!",
            "Touching walls or the ground seem to help me regulate when I\u2019m in that state. Does it work all the time,No. Does it make a difference when it does work YES.",
            "I regularly train this when I actually feel safe. Makes it much easier to use when I dont feel safe.",
            "This is helpful. Reminding myself that I\u2019m safe now, but not demanding that I believe it instantly. I think I can get kind of all-or-nothing with those instructions, believing that I should be able to just feel 100% better upon telling myself everything\u2019s okay. Thanks.",
            "I\u2019m in the resourcing/stabilization phase of EMDR now. Really glad to hear this.",
            "You\u2019re right; it does help when someone else tells me it\u2019s my trauma talking. I have a few people who can do that for me."

If you\u2019re looking to avoid benzos, I\u2019d suggest Hydroxyzine. It helped until I developed formication. Indica strains of marijuana, diphenhydramine, magnesium, melatonin and kratom have also helped me chill out.",

I now take Vyvanse in the morning and Trazodone at night to help me get to sleep. The diagnosis is helping therapy as well because I\u2019m in a much better position to understand my past and why my family did the things they did. It\u2019s worth looking into.",

As a result, you get responses like you listed, or people minimize the trauma (\"sometimes parents don't do the best thing, but they still love you\" or some crap like that) to try to fix the issue they see in the situation (that you cut off your family).\n\nIt sucks that, on top of dealing with the aftereffects of your trauma, most normal people aren't particularly safe.",

I don't trauma dump on people but it comes up in anecdotes sometimes, nothing heavy, just stories of my life where incidentally I was a teenager living on my own or just not having any contact with family. When they start making the \ud83e\udd7a face or \"you poor thing\" I will say \"nah, I'm good, therapy and all that\" to nip it in the bud.
