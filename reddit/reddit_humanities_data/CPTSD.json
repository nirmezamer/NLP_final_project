Be a supportive peer.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/peer2peersupportguide)\n2. **Don\u2019t ask for diagnosis, don\u2019t diagnose others:** *Respect that you may not have all of OPs details and even a trained, trauma informed care provider cannot diagnose over the internet. So don't. Assume the context of OP as a CPTSD survivor or supportive partner of a CPTSD survivor.*\n3. No [hate speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech)\n4.

No [RaisedByNarcissists lingo](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/wiki/acronyms): A lot of folks come from the RBN support community. A lot of us do not.

In these cases, we encourage users to report the comments as Rule #3 violations. Because of the subreddit's high profile and open nature, this problem will continue to be with us, and we therefore can only promise a \"safe-ish\" environment for BIPOC. Racial trauma will always be on topic here at /r/CPTSD, but BIPOC users that want a more closed space can make use of /r/cptsd_bipoc. *Thank you to the mod team at* /r/cptsd_bipoc *for helping us write this verbiage.*\n\n**Additional Newcomer Resources**\n\n* [Crisis Resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/index#wiki_crisis_support_resources)\n* [Emotional Flashback 1st Aid Kit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/firstaidkit)\n* [Grounding & Containment Tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/groundingandcontainment)\n* [An FAQ Guide to CPTSD](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/faq)\n* [Our Library of Books, Media, and Healing Resources for CPTSD](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/thelibrary)\n* [Common Myths About CPTSD](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/cptsdmythbuster)\n* [The 5-Steps to Find a Therapist Plan](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/quickandeasytherapisthunt)\n* The [CPTSD Wiki Project Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/quickandeasytherapisthunt), while currently under construction, has all of the above information and regular updates on many additional topics you may find helpful in your healing journey",

            "Me too. Got shit on for setting it as a deal breaker for next relationship. Apparently no one is responsible for my triggers and I'm crazy",
            "I am severely anti-porn because it has high ties to trafficking and is extremely hard to verify consent even on sites that claim to verify users. I know because I was trafficked and separately coerced to do porn, being convinced I wanted to do it.\n\nAs for sex scenes, since someone here mentioned it, I argue showing them in things that you wouldn't obviously expect them in is just unconsensual in nature and that too many rich people likely enjoy that factor.",
            "I turned to it as an addiction when I was in my early teens, I wasn't ready for it, I abused myself daily and no one told me to stop so naturally I thought no one knew but a sense of paranoia come with this kind of secret and a sense of social distancing as well of course. Because it was still an addiction and addiction occurs in place of both healthy relationships and healthy coping habits. So I fed the bad or poor habit and it basically means I cant go a day without actively being triggered because what I see in the real world or even through entertainment ... I would basically try my best to replicate it with adult content. It's very unfortunate and my cptsd has not made it any easier to cope with better habits... I'm well aware I get no benefits but I'm so alone and full of shame to begin with and I can't seem to undo the shame of my entire being or history or place in society enough to shake off this habit. I've no idea what to do.",

Please don't feel pressured.\n\n\nI felt this way for a longgg time until I read better representations in a03 and romance books. It made my mind realise sex/rape were different things.

I hate there's a \"demand\" and the \"supply\" rarely truly have autonomy and true power in the situation. Idk. Then another side of me realizes other sell their bodies in other ways even if its a 40 hours 9 to 5. But is it truly consent if it's the lesser of many \"evil\" decisions some need to make to survive. Big sigh.",
            "Honestly, if you're single and want visual stimulus for self pleasure, just look for homemade clips from actual couples.\n\nI cant stand the produced stuff, its simply not real and its not healthy.\n\nIf Im in a relationship I dont watch it all or masturbate either.\n\nI'm single now and these days I barely watch even the homemade stuff, I feel less drawn to it the more healed I get.\n\nI think theres a balance, if its affecting your life in a negative way then its not good, but the whole \"no-fap\" thing is the other extreme and not healthy either as its just becoming sexually repressed and building up pent up irritability inside yourself and shaming yourself for normal sexual desires when you inevitably fail that impossible standard.\n\nI think a lot of people could benefit from trying to stick to masturbating without any porn for an extended period of time, even if its homemade stuff it can be not good in the sense that you are getting an unrealistic amount of  visual stimulus and visual angles that you dont get when you're actually having sex, and then when you have sex and dont have that favourite angle you like to watch then you can feel a bit desensitised.\n\n  \nI'm not sure whats a healthy frequency ot self relief for women is but I know for men that after orgasm your testosterone will then rise for a week during abstaining and then after that will go back down, so once a week seems to be the healthy option, and will reduce risk of enlarged prostate in the future and by extension prostate cancer, which my dad has a bit of currently.\n\n  \nSo yeah while I'm single im going with once a week self relief with no porn involved.\n\n  \nAlso to any dudes reading, try not to stimulate with a grip of death lol, thats not what a vagina feels like and you'll desensitise your nerves down there  and i suppose the equivalent for women is using a gargantuan dildo or something lol.",

            "Constant reminders to yourself to:\n\n1.) Never dismiss somebody else's traumas. If you can't relate, that doesn't mean it doesn't matter to them.\n\n2.) Never treat people like they don't matter. Dont use your pain as an excuse to be an asshole.\n\nBeing aware of this stuff basically means you're doing better than a lot of people are. I think a lot of people aren't really thinking about this stuff and tend to react blindly.\n\nYeah, you'll make mistakes and slip up, but as long as you own it and strive to be better, that's what counts.\n\nMy mother always used her traumas as an excuse to hurt me. She claims that she can't change, but that's bullshit. We can always change our behavior. \n\nI try to remind myself daily that my pain doesn't give me the right to be an asshole. It just doesn't.\n\nI can enforce boundaries that may make me appear like one toward other people, but if I'm generally doing my best to respect the time and space of other people... that's good enough for me. \n\nEveryone is fighting a hard battle. I don't want to be one more asshole that negatively affects their day.",
            "I'm tired of my brain fooling me into thinking I need to feel \"bad\" for abusers just because they experienced trauma. Abuse is a choice. Plenty of people experience trauma but don't take it out on others. A waste of empathy. Should spend that energy on myself or people who deserve it.",
            "Compassion. I never developed self-compassion until 2 years ago, and only because of group therapy and being finally listened to. I've since grown it to compassion to others too. \n\nCompatible consists of three parts. Mindfulness, self-kindness, and common humanity. For me, it means being aware and tolerant of your inner world, which required emotional regulation and intelligence. It means recognizing we are all human, and our struggles, while all unique and different on the surface, and very human experiences. It means challenging myself to relate to to myself differently through the bridge statements. Instead of telling myself I love myself, I start small with \"maybe I am a not unlovable.\" That's only some of it.\n\nIt's a long journey that will never end. I think it's that idea that took the longest for me to accept. Not only will I always have a scar, I have a hole that can never be filled. I can never have another childhood and no amount of healing can give me that. But that means I have to do it for myself, reparent myself. Develop the parts that never had a chance, ones I didn't realize was missing, like emotional regulation skills. How I wish there's a nice feel-good answer. Reality is too complex for that.",
            "I can't actually work. I am on disability, and if I earn money I lose my insurance. I'm expected to live on around 7k a year, so that sucks, but the insurance is where it's at for me. My medical costs would be sky high, it wouldn't even be worth having a job because I would have to earn so much just to cover costs normal insurance won't.\n\nAbout 4 months after quiting my last technical job in order to apply for disability I got bored and ended up creating a peer to peer support network.\n\nThat was 6 years ago. We've saved lives. I have never seen a cent from doing any of this, I actually pay a little bit a year to keep it up and running...\n\nI don't think work exactly is what makes someone healthy, but dedication to something, something you wake up for, look forward to... I think that's supposed to be normal, I think we're supposed to be excited for things. I'm excited to run my NPO. I think that's healthy. \n\nI'm also in a band and writing a book with my band mate. He and I have already written a children's book together, and have three more in the works. So I do a few things instead of a job that I think are healthy and am proud of/look forward to.",
            "to me, health is about the ability to connect with other humans. This requires compassion, kindness, love, presence, selflessness alongside personal integrity, and perhaps even above all of that: the ability to communicate these sorts of things towards others through actions and words.\n\n>what makes a good person?\n\nI don't believe in \"good\" people. Seems to me the project of becoming a good person is rooted in one's ego. Makes me think of communal narcissism tbh. True compassion is selfless.\n\n>I\u2019m no fan of capitalism or getting a bunch of material possessions, but I also think we should strive to be able to be self sufficient.\n\nSelf sufficiency is a capitalist idea. It involves laboring in the capitalist machine so that you can afford to pay people for their labor. Before capitalism, we made social bonds with other people and freely gave away our goods and services because of those bonds. No one was self sufficient.\n\n>Like I can\u2019t even help myself. How would I help anyone else.\n\n*I know our dirty hands / can wash one another / and not one speck will remain*\n\nPeople rarely need you to *do* something for them. What they often need is someone to *be* there with them, alongside them. Emotional support. Plenty of people with CPTSD are better at helping others than they are helping themselves. Our self awareness and our knowledge of our own pain makes us capable of bearing witness to the suffering of others. [here is a five minute video explaining how to be there with others](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThZD-kL1I9o)\n\n>So I\u2019m curious what are qualities we should strive for to be more than just a broken person?\n\nstart with self compassion and grow from there. the answers are inside of you already."

It takes practice and patience, but the more you do it the less work it is. Take a good look at your behaviour afterwards + analyse it and when it happens again youll be more prepared.",

I've had a lot of time to marinate but now because I need to get a job I'm starting to strategize how to put myself out there again, which will be trigger central. I sometimes daydream at what awkward, confrontational thing I'd say to a micromanaging manager or a thoughtless coworker. I've started to socialize more after almost a decade and something I've tried is taking a deep breath and excusing myself to the bathroom to do whatever coping mechanism I need. Yell at myself in the mirror, cry, etc. It really is like having a seizure.\n\nThen I come back, grin and bare it, then block them from my life. It gives me a sense of control.

With the people I care most about and who care the most about me (my partner, for example), I ask them to give me a trigger warning before they mention something they know might trigger me.

Well, it wasn't their fault that that topic came up was it? It's just so happens that that's one of my triggers. So in that situation I will do what I need to do to comfort myself and maybe let the people know that they need to do a trigger warning in the future for those of us that have experienced sexual abuse. But if I'm around someone who is constantly triggering because they're just a general dick to be around, I will take steps to remove that person from my life",
            "I feel this.

As soon as I could we talked about it and the result was that she has a better understanding of my triggers and I felt really safe and validated",
            "I know exactly how you feel. As an example, a few weeks ago I was on vacation with some family members and my aunt started speaking to me in an aggressive tone and saying some invalidating things about my mom (her sister) who was abusive to me when I was growing up. I could feel the emotional flashback coming like a hurricane. I felt anxious, incredibly angry, I could tell it was my wounded inner child reliving the pain again. We were preparing to go out so I just started walking faster, told them I needed to be alone and had a drink and a walk by myself on the city we were in. It was actually great - I sat with my feelings, acknowledged my own pain, cried loads, people watched. Later I explained to my aunt that if she ever does something like that in future I will need to remove myself from the situation. Know what your triggers are and come up with strategies of what you\u2019ll do if it happens especially in public, a lot of times removing yourself from the situation is your best bet. At least that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing and it\u2019s been working out great. People who actually care about you will understand."

            "My father yelled loud enough to make me cry but then would just insult and gaslight me whenever I mentioned it or tried to defend myself.\u00a0",
            "Yes, my mom would scream and yell and throw things over small inconveniences. She couldn\u2019t regulate herself. \n\nMy father would get drunk and scream at us. They also yelled when they fought and certainly did not keep their marital problems a secret. But it doesn\u2019t seem like anyone did it to the point of losing their voice or hearing problems, yikes.",
            "Yup, mom and dad are both screamers. I used to be as well until I learned I don\u2019t want to be like them and it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. It took me until my mid 20\u2019s to figure that out.",
            "Everybody yelled.  It was terrifying and I masked my fear... but now...I can't handle yelling.",
            "Yes. All the time. Even now 40+ years later. Then everyone else has to yell to be heard. I leave with a headache all the time. It's very over stimulating.",
            "Yes. Both my parents.\u00a0 Took me awhile to realize not everyone's parents were that loud and angry.\u00a0",

            "Yes but partly because my dad was deaf in one ear.  But when he was mad he could yell pretty darn loud!  My sister was a yeller and my mother was at times. This is carried over to me as well. And about once a year I would yell at my roommate about something and she would look at me like why are you yelling?  But on the other hand I never knew when she was mad at me because she just pushed it down inside. I thought every family yelled every once in a while!",
            "Not screaming, but yeah, yelling, shouting, slamming doors. All the time. I don't even remember the reasons or if it was directed at me or not. \n\nI have such a hard time not doing it myself as an adult, it's so deep seated. In any type of heated conflict, I either stop speaking, or I'm shouting. No inbetween usually."
