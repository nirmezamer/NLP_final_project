            "Is there a good way to spec your character to maximize the amount of skill points/levels you can gain? I dont like to just straight up cheat to make myself a demigod, but i find the current skill cap system a little annoying and i feel like im not progressing after a certain point.",
            "Is there any point to marrying female clan members?\n\nLike, outside of the whole \"give them a chance to have a family\" thing, it seems like there's no upside. You get, what, 10 relations with another clan? You can just bust them out of prison once and get six times that - it doesn't seem worth losing a governor/general/bundleofstats",
            "Sometimes when I turn over command to AI it is super smart. It sends archers up initially, then retreats them behind infantry, and flanks with cav right when the enemy hits my infantry. That works famously. But sometimes they just all charge. Is there a way I can have more control over AI strategy without micromanaging groups? Kind of like how AI lords issue commands to skirmish, flank, etc? New player so maybe these features come with higher skills?",
            "If a garrison is over budget, is there any preference to the type of troops it keeps?  For example will it get rid of expensive troops before cheap ones or vice versa?",
            "Okay so I'm not a native english speaker and I just learned that \"X is with child\" to mean  pregnant is an actual english expression and not just a mistake by the devs",
            "First time having a companion die of old age. He was a governor for a long time due to cultural bonus, and I wanted more xp for governing perks, so I brought him out to fight hideouts and battles. We were traveling after a battle when we got the notification. RIP Grev, tracker of the 66.",
            "Anyone having issues with companions and party roles? Got captured and after recalling all my companions back I wasnt able to reassign them to my parties rolls without talking to them.\n\nEven after going through the dialogue instead of assigning through the clan menu, the slots still show as blank with no one assigned but the individuals still seem to be gaining the appropriate levels so I believe they are still giving their bonuses.",
            "When making the Garrison for my settlement should I go woth high tier troops for better results or like militias you can get from raiding a village and converting their troops",
            "Has anyone figured out a way to alt-tab without pausing the game?",
            "Has anyone noticed that since the last update companions just kinda...walk everywhere? I take them into cities and bandit camps and they normally just walk and are ineffective because they fall back so far."

            "Other than not using the Doctors Oath medicine perk, there isnt anything you can do outside of mods. Noble war parties are really important to a kingdoms survival, so it makes sense that they only have a small chance of dying in battle. \n\nI personally just hunt them on the battlefield. Chasing an enemy army into their castle and laying siege to it puts all of the enemy nobles on the frontlines fighting on foot, those battles are a lot tougher though. But lots of fun."
