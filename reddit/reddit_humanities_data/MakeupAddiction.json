            "Hey everyone!  Guy here, I\u2019ve been mainly using makeup for the past year or two to mainly cover beard shadow (I have the worst genes for facial hair)/have smoother skin.  I\u2019ve been wanting to actually branch out a bit and get into better products/applying makeup a bit better.  \n\nMain questions:\n\nBrands/types for concealer, foundation, primer, mascara and eyeliner, also makeup remover.  I\u2019ve been pretty basic and just use Colour Pop and whatever mascara looks fine to me.-  Also for brushes, sponges etc.  This is the main one for me, lol.  Mainly looking for decent brands and ones that aren\u2019t terrible for your skin if possible :).\n\nOtherwise, cleaning brushes, how to apply stuff/what order.  I think I\u2019ve been doing it right but I also know I could be doing better probably.\n\nAny articles/vids can help too, or any other advice- thanks in advance!"

I tried it during the pandemic, and then again a couple months ago and both times it didn\u2019t look good in the mirror but it looked okay on camera. Not for an everyday look, but something somewhat similar is douyin makeup which I feel translates better to an everyday look.",
            "Because the 'e-girl' makeup style can be very cartoonish with the whole thing around the heavy blush, falsies, intense highlighter on the tip of the nose - Too bold for some tastes.",
            "I used to never wear blush until I tried the e-girl blush placement and it flattered my face shape SO well.",
            "It's so cute but I kind of feel like you have to have naturally huge eyes to get away with it. I don't think it would work well on small, narrow, or hooded eyes.",
            "It gives belle delphine... And for that reason I can't look at it without getting the ick tbh.\nNot a fam about the blush over the nose, the lashes and the laser pointer on the nose highlighter.\nIf that is toned down its a nice soft everyday look",
            "I appreciate over-the-top or costume-y makeup, but the e-girl look feels like it was designed for the male gaze, and that is not my jam.",
            "i feel like most regular people stopped doing this look in 2020, 2021 tops, so the e-girl makeup + e-girl face expression gives only fans model.\n\nhowever i do think it's cute tho and it probably doesnt read like that in real life, specially if you're not forcing doe eyes for a camera like they are",
            "I don't think it's that big of a deal in real life tbh. I mean if you're posting about it, then yea people are gonna share their opinions (often in harshly), but most people don't really notice/say anything if you don't point it out yourself.",
            "Open up most make-up videos and there's always people making fun of the trend. Don't mind the haters.\n\nI like e-girl a lot, and that bottom tutorial is one I used to perfect my e-girl look a couple years ago. It does look cartoonish in real life, but that is how it's supposed to look. I had to do a few different tricks with mine since I have hooded eyes.\n\nMy advice is try it out! I like doing e-girl for concerts, mall trips, or photoshoots. In my opinion it looks fine in synthetic low light, but like most heavy make-up it doesn't do well in natural light. Not an everyday look, but it's fun to play with it.",
