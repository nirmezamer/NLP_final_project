            "Love that pink on you but it looks like you\u2019re \u201ccolouring out of the lines\u201d a bit, so to speak. I think when you already have obvious lip injections it\u2019s better to be a little more conservative with lining, I would keep it only JUST to the outside of your natural lip border and not 1/10th of a mm more. \n\nTLDR: pink looks better but both look overlined",
            "In my opinion, they both suits you well. What bugs me is overdrawing the lips with makeup. With full lips as yours, no need for that. I do not like that look overall, it is always visible unles there are some filters involved and that is not how in-person meeting works.",
            "Just chiming in to say you are taking these comments like a champ! I vote pink!",
            "I love the pink lip, and maybe add a little pink to your cheeks to add a little more color & dimension to your face",
            "I like it much better than the brown!",
            "I know it\u2019s past the hour but for future: you have very feminine and soft features. I would go lighter on the makeup, it would look very pretty. Your current routine is honestly masking your beauty. Too thick in my opinion. I would not line your lips as harshly as you are and stick to the lighter lipsticks like the pink shade. The lip filler is already bringing attention to your lips, you don\u2019t need any more attention through the use of liner.  Light makeup would look beautiful on you. Blush would elevate your look even more.",
            "since your lips are so full, no need for liner imo it looks \"too much\"\n\nif i were you, i would do a cheery lip stain, no liners at all",
            "i\u2019m saying this in the nicest way possible but the filler makes you look older than you really are, other than that i think the pink looks better \ud83e\udd0d",
            "Stop the filler and your absolutely stunning. It's distracting from beautiful deep set eyes. You could do so much with those. That's what drew me in",
            "The pink colour suits you very well, the lip filler is less fortunate though. I know you didn\u2019t ask about that, but that was literally the first thing I saw of you. No disrespect intended. Your lips, your choice.\n\nEdit: specified the colour."
