Fully bonded they both have same health but MFT have quite a bit more stamina. So going by stats alone MFT wins.\n\nJudging aesthetically... I like the bigger size of MFT but I like the shiny white coat of Arabian so I guess it's gonna be a tie. (tbh MFT coat is growing on me)\n\nEquipment can all be the same so let's not even talk about that. (I use panther saddle btw)\n\nMFT wins.\n\nPS: I am almost about to end chapter 2 (third playthrough) if that matters.",

        "content": "\nSo the scene of John Marston recreating his pose on the cover of RDR1 in the epilogue when you raid the Laramie farm was extremely cool and when I first played it, I, like many other people fan girled over it. Years later, ive replayed this game probably over 100 times and there\u2019s a change I really wish they would\u2019ve made. \n\nI wish you killed Micah like this. It would be so cool to have unloaded on Micah and while he is in his dying breathe, he tries insulting John, his family and maybe even Arthur, and John just stands over him with the shotgun, before shooting him like he did with Laramie. Granted, this scene would make no sense if you blew Micah\u2019s head off but maybe they could\u2019ve made it a secret cutscene where if you don\u2019t just unload into Micah\u2019s skull, they will have 1 final exchange as he bleeds out on the floor shot to shit, where John recreates this pose. \n\nI think it would tie into RDR1 a lot more too if they had done this change of killing Micah in this way. And as the final mission it would really spell the beginning of Johns downfall in RDR1, considering killing Micah is what got Ross back on his trail. \n\nDoes anyone else think this would\u2019ve been a really cool change?
