Is that overblown? Well, we catch plenty in some Reddit filters, but we aren't seeing many reports from users on this stuff.\n\nWe do casually browse the sub but if you report rule breaking posts and comments, it's a lot faster than waiting for us to stumble upon it.\n\n* Post links to images, memes, and gifs that **make wrestling fun.** -- that was literally the whole reason the sub was created.\n* Don't be an asshole. Taunting and belittling other wrestling fans is not **making wrestling fun**.\n\nY'all produce some absolute banger memes most of the time and I can not tell you how much I appreciate a great shitpost. We can be that sub 100% of the time if the community helps by letting us know that we've got someone trying to ruin the party before they've already punched 5 holes in the wall.\n\nAppreciate everyone's support on this. Now please, go have fun.",
