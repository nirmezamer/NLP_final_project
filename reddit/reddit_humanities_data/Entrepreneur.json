He is a motivational quote machine.\n\nI see a lot of pictures of him wearing a suit on stage giving presentations too. I assume he's giving a motivational speech of some sort in these pictures.\n\nI once asked him what he actually did for a living, and he invited me to a group Zoom meeting where the rapper Fat Joe was the host. I thought it would be cool to meet Far Joe, but the Zoom meeting ended up having like 50 attendees. Fat Joe just kept talking about \"killing it in 2024\" and shit like that....but I don't actually know what it is these 50 people plan on doing.\n\nMy cousin's husband also does the same type of thing. He is always on stage giving motivational speeches, but to this day I don't know exactly what it is he does \ud83e\udd37\n\nDoes anyone know what exactly this \"motivational speech\" business is?",

We would charge anywhere from 10k to 100k depending on grow size.

He couldn't understand the question because he didn't consider action necessary -- just feeling. Berkshire Hathaway was inspired by the father of fundamental analysis Benjamin Graham.

Hyper focus is great but can make things a little sloppy so I always go back and fine tune my plans after the fact"
