After searching for a long time and trying tools like **TubeBuddy** and **VidIQ**, the descriptions generated were quite poor\n\nThey gave us completely random descriptions that didn't follow the structure of our previous ones and sounded very robotic. I also tried using **ChatGPT**, but since our podcast episodes average about 1.5 hours, we ran into **limitations** and the result wasn't what we expected\n\nSo, I thought, fuck it, I'll try to **create** a **mini app** to write the descriptions the way I do, and that's what I did xD\n\nThe app I created not only generates YouTube video descriptions but also provides a **title**, a **description**, the **main timestamps,** and **hashtags**, all optimized for **SEO** while maintaining the **same tone and writing style** as your previous descriptions\n\nIf you identify with this problem and would like to try the app for **free** to provide **feedback**, leave me a comment, and I'll give you a beta version with no strings attached!",

But when with others that think and act like us its not seen as bragging, its at worst viewed as a strategy session. I love hearing my peers successes. We often hold friendly competitions to see who can hit a certain goal first (winner gets to pay for lunch when we meet next and gets to brag about winning).",

Congrats on the round and keep up the good fight for your company and legacy. You have given everything you ever knew to reach this point, and the outcome just confirms the person that you already knew you were. Super big congrats man.\n\nP.S. When things start feeling too serious I just remind myself were all a bunch of space monkeys flying through the universe and in 100M years well all be a fine mist of dust anyways so its never all that serious. Some people find that disconcerting. Personally, I find it incredibly consoling. Use if useful.",

            "In Australia when I was young, this was called softplay.",
            "The idea is something people would like but I think the logistics and cost are going to be problematic.  You appear to be UK based so the regulations will be different, but in the US the regulations relating to child care mean that you'd be bound to some very expensive things like providing a certain ratio of employees to children (and the ratio changes based on the children's ages), the employees have to have certain levels of education and certifications, you'd need licensing and inspection, etc.  It does vary by area but the overall average cost of just one child in child care is $11,000 a year.  And that's child care that is a much simpler logistical model - you know you have X number of children at your center for each month and need Y employees during these set hours.  Staffing on a part time basis and having variable numbers of children means inefficiencies and juggling.\n\nSo although I think many parents and caregivers (love the sexist assumption it has to be \"mum\" taking care of the children) would like childcare so they could get a hair cut or other treatment, I think it will be challenging to get them to pay the added amount that you'd need to charge to cover the expenses.  If that $50 hair cut becomes a $85 hair cut, will enough people still be willing to pay?",

I was 100% focused on survival lol\n\nAlso, even if I had *needed* to get hair/makeup done for a work event or something in her first few months, I wouldve just had someone come to my home for glam and left her there with grandma or someone because I wouldnt have been able to bring her to the event anyway?",
            "Thoughts? It sounds like an idea which could have been tested and worked out with some phone calls to salons. \n\nI get it. They'll copy. Which is what anybody could do after a half-hour meeting with anybody you'd test this with. \n\nDon't ask. Report back. There's the intrepid, ingenious, boot strappy entrepreneur.

            "Given your goals and time investment, here's a strategy to maximize your efforts. Continue active engagement on Reddit and crosspost in relevant subreddits to build momentum. Start creating valuable content on YouTube, like tutorials or vlogs on entrepreneurship. On Instagram and Facebook, share updates, short videos, and behind-the-scenes content, using stories and reels for more engagement. Build a community on Discord by inviting people from your other platforms and hosting regular events. Focus on quality content, stay consistent, and leverage existing communities to grow your audience. By concentrating on these key areas, you can achieve your short-term goals and lay a strong foundation for long-term growth.",
            "It sounds like you're putting a lot of effort into building your social media presence, which is great! Here are some thoughts and recommendations based on your goals and current activities:\n\n1. **Reddit Progress**: If you're seeing good progress on Reddit and you enjoy engaging there, it's worth continuing to nurture that community. Reddit can be a great platform for building a dedicated audience and gaining valuable feedback.\n2. **YouTube Presence**: Creating karaoke content on YouTube sounds like a fun and engaging idea. YouTube is excellent for building a visual presence and can attract a wide audience if done well. Consistency and quality are key here.\n3. **Instagram and Facebook**: Since you want to increase followers on IG/FB pages, consider posting regularly with engaging content that resonates with your target audience. Use relevant hashtags, collaborate with others, and engage actively with your followers.\n4. **Discord Community**: Growing a Discord community can be more targeted and intimate. Focus on providing value and fostering engagement within your community. Promote your Discord channel across your other social media platforms to attract members.\n5. **Short-term Goals**: Your goals of reaching 50 Discord members and gaining 5-10 new followers per platform within a week are ambitious but achievable with your dedicated time commitment. Ensure your content is compelling and resonates with your audience to maximize growth.\n6. **Cross-posting**: You can cross-post your content on relevant subreddits, Facebook groups, or Discord channels where allowed and relevant. This can help increase visibility and attract new followers.\n7. **Time Allocation**: Given your effective use of time, continue to prioritize platforms where you see the most engagement and growth. It might be beneficial to allocate more time to platforms where you're seeing promising results while experimenting with others to find what works best.\n\nOverall, your approach seems realistic with the amount of time and effort you're willing to invest. Keep monitoring your progress, analyzing what content performs best, and adjusting your strategy accordingly to maximize your growth potential."
