        "content": "Happy New Year to all! We have decided to stop simply referring users here to r/GlobalOffensiveTrade 's whitelist and will instead be mirroring the whitelist of our [discord server](https://discord.gg/csgomarket). This is because we no longer recommend using sites such as csdeals (due to the recent ownership change and continued problems cashing out) or dmarket (due to locking user funds for political reasons, and numerous reports both here and our discord of users still getting scammed out of their deposits) among other sites. Posts asking about where/how to cash out will be referred to this list below.\n\n**The new whitelist is as follows:**  \n[https://www.skinport.com/r/hostile](https://www.skinport.com/r/hostile)\n\n[https://csfloat.com/ref/csmarket](https://csfloat.com/ref/csmarket)\n\n[https://skinbaron.de/en](https://skinbaron.de/en)\n\n[https://swap.gg/](https://swap.gg/)\n\n[https://bitskins.com/market/cs2](https://bitskins.com/market/cs2)\n\n[https://skinbid.com/](https://skinbid.com/)\n\n[https://buff.market/](https://buff.market/)\n\nNote that using our affiliate links for Skinport & CSFloat does not cost you anything, and the 100% of the revenue generated from each sale via these links will go back to the community in the form of regular giveaways and various prizes on our discord server.\n\n**Disclaimer: Use all sites mentioned here at your own risk. Moderators CANNOT monitor 3rd party sites and things may change over time. Also, Valve can change their stance anytime (API keys, 3rd party sites in general, etc.). This whitelist is just our opinion based on past experiences within the community, to exclude scam sites, etc.**\n\nWe have also revised our subreddit rules to allow for the mentioning of Buff163 in the titles of posts once again. The initial reason for this being in place was repeated violations of **rule #10 \"No 3rd party website support\"** (review in the sidebar if you are unfamiliar) -especially how to create an account/got banned/delivery problems/buying or selling balance, etc. This rule still applies, however if useful conversations can be had from mentioning Buff similar to other 3rd parties, then we encourage this. Those of you that made seemingly infinite variations of spelling b u f 1 63 or even buffalo to get around the rule (you know who you are) are not clever, and maybe 1 out of 5 of those posts did not break the no-support rule to begin with.\n\nWe will be leaving the comments on this post open for serious discussion and opinions regarding the change. We are not currently looking to make any new additions to the whitelist at this time.\n\n#Update: May 2024. Buff163 is being removed from our whitelist after a recent change preventing anyone without a Chinese bank account or Alipay to sell on the site. We strongly encourage you not to try to buy buff balance from someone to circumvent this, as it is an incredibly easy way to get scammed. You may still discuss the site freely.",

            "Crashes happen when a bunch of users flood the market at the same time trying to quick sell items. Steam sales used to be great for this as \"flash sales\" used to be a thing so every few hours a new unknown game would be heavily discounted for a limited time and everyone would need quick balance all at the same time and flood the market with items. This effect has got less and less ever since flash sales stopped and we have switched to the market dipping over a longer period of time, go back and look at liquids for the last few years around summer sale, they slowly start going down in price at begining of June, normaly hit the low around start of sale, then slowly climb back up in price and return to June prices around the start of August. Instead of everyone selling skins within 2 hours of each other its now everyone selling skins over a month, it still causes a crash but its less and slower.\n\nOperations are the main source of crashes now becuase everyone wants a pass or to buy operation items and they get the balance by selling skins and items they already have. Nobody really knows when they will drop and everyone wants to buy the pass and get the items right away which means a bunch of items flooding the market at the same time and crashing it. If valve ever gets into a regular schedule for operations then we will probably see this crash move to a dip too as people would anticipate an operation and sell a few weeks before it.",
