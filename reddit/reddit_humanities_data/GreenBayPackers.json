            "Anyone see mike tannenbaum say in a redraft hed take Love #2, only after Mahomes? \n\nI love my man but thats a bold statement",
            "Ami free to say I like the team",
            "ChatGPT is good for some things, but it absolutely mangles anything that needs fine details.",
            "My wife is trying to perfect her cheese and queso dip recipe before the season starts so hopefully itll be perfect by game 1!",
            "Don't be.  To be honest, this country has weathered many storms.  This is just another one.  I've been hearing it's TEOTWAWKI since 1998.  It's a lot of sensationalism.",
            "I can see why though. While last seasons body of work isnt what puts him at 2, I think a lot of it has to do with how he improved. RARELY have we seen a kind of light switch improvement from worst to first. While we can speculate that he may have hit his ceiling once he figured it out, that back half of the season was literally top one qb play.\n\nThat being said, Id still take a handful of guys: lamar, allen, burrow, and, simply because of the rookie contract, stroud. Notably these are all afc guys",
            "I also discovered Mateos salsa recently! Completely agree, for a store bought salsa it is top of the line",
            "I have perfected my homemade \"Chipotle\"\n\n\n\n\nAlso Mateo's Salsa is god tier\n\n\nAlso also\n\n\nMy neighbor asked what i was cooking and if she could have some. Sharing is caring, so I had her make a bowl. Felt good man.",
            "Random thought for Free Talk Friday: I wish we the Packers fanbase could find out why the G-logo at midfield hasn't been painted in with the official shade of green since 2005. In RGB terms, it's R-24, G-48, B-40.\n\n\n-Gridiron Fields Database is my source; a website with the purpose of archiving how NFL fields looked through images."

            "He resembles Aaron so much holy",
            "How did we get so lucky?",
            "The tape he put out is NASTY. Lots of room to get better, but the throws he put out there last year are elite. He has no ceiling",
            "His name isn't big enough to win it this year unless he throws 50+ TDs but he will be a candidate.",
            "That one to Wicks against Dallas was Rodgers all over. The hop into the hip twist with so much more power coming from the wrist than most other QBs. It's so beautiful",
            "To me, he actually looks a bit smoother, and his pocket presence is something else. He threaded some throws last year that I don't know if Rodgers would attempt, with his long held fear of screwing up his stat line with a pick. Now, this could very well be a biased opinion, but what the hell, I'm sticking by it.",
            "Scouting, patience, and Tom Clements.",
            "You dont need a big name to win MVP. You need a big year. Itll go to whoever has a massive season at QB\n\nI dont think itll be Love to be fair, but his name isnt stopping it.",
            "For me in that play its all his pre snap work that gets me excited. The throw was great but he read the D changed the play and scores in like a 10 second window. Absolutely love seeing he can read the D and get us in the correct play.",
            "If Mahomes or Rodgers have close to the same year as Love they will get the MVP.  It's not entirely a popularity contest but it's impacted by that for sure."

            "I understand that is also the first day of training camp. If so and the Pack is heading off to practice (not just meetings) youve got to see the players riding the kids bikes with kids in tow from the stadium locker room to the practice field. And then back later. Not sure what time that would be but look for the crowd of watchers.",
            "Great post.  The one clarification I'd make is the the seats in the original part of the stadium are not steel benches.  They are aluminum, which is much more effective than steel at extracting body heat.  When I was growing up there in the 70s, the best thing about the Sunday Green Bay Press Gazette was how good it was at insulating my ass from the bench.",
            "Damn dude thats some good info right there. I scanned to see if you recommended going to Krolls because I was gonna jump on you if you did haha. Stone Arch in Appleton is pretty damn good too.",
            "I keep saying I'm going to go to one of these but not living nearby makes it difficult.  One day I'll have to make a point to plan a trip.\n\nActivity options:\n\n-\tvisit Lambeau field and the hall of fame (see packers.com for details if you're doing this on game day weekend you should make a reservation)\n\n-\tdepending on the time of year Door county is a nice day trip (check out Wild Tomato wood fire pizza if you go)\n\n-\tThe EAA Aviation museum in Oshkosh is really cool for an afternoon (EAA Airventure which occurs late July is the world's biggest air show)\n\n-\tif you're here during training camp you may be able to watch them practice and during the season you can also catch a game which is fun too\n\nEating options:\n\n-\tnice places: Chives, Chefusion, Plae bistro, and Au Bravo in the Green Bay area.  In Appleton, Carmella's and Rye \n\n-\tpizza: rustique pizzeria\n\n-\tbar food: 1919 and hinterland both near/at Lambeau field.  Draft and Stone Arch in Appleton \n\n-\tsupper clubs (classic WI dining):  Mark's East Side in Appleton (30 min south of Green Bay) is the best in the area.  Great German entrees, steaks, seafood and actually a pretty nice and reasonable wine list in addition to a quintessential Wisconsin full bar\n\n-\tbest cheese curds:  Stone Arch in Appleton (Milwaukee Burger Company is good too)\n\n-\tfast food and frozen custard:  Culver's (for whatever reason their custard is much better in Wisconsin than outside of it)\n\n-\tBBQ:  Parker Johns (best BBQ I've had outside of TX pizza is good there too)\n\nFlight options:\n\n-\tboth Green Bay and Appleton have regional airports to fly into.\n\n-\tMilwaukee is a 2 hour drive away and Chicago is more than a 3 hour drive\n\nStay tips:\n\n-\tif you're going to a game, it's important to make reservations as early as possible as these fill up quickly in all surrounding areas for game day weekends\n\n-\tthe closer you stay to Lambeau the more expensive and difficult to find it becomes\n\n-\tthe area isn't public transportation/ walking friendly so I would recommend getting a car regardless of where you stay\n\n-\tdriving in to the game is very doable, the traffic is manageable before the game and there's ample parking for a reasonable cost on people's lawns or businesses' parking lots\n\n-\tif you do drive in, the drive back after the game is the worst traffic in the state (still not too bad) and it may make sense to wait an hour or two before driving home (many people use this time to visit the Packer pro shop)\n\nGame day tips:\n\n-\tget there early to enjoy tailgating\n\n-\tbring a seat cushion especially if it's cold (the seating is a steel bench).  They do rent cushions with seat backs there but they are old and the backs are obnoxiously large taking away a good portion of the leg space for the people sitting behind you\n\n-\tif you are attending a cold weather game remember there is no bad weather, only bad clothing.  Many retailers locally will carry the proper attire to equip visitors for what could be brutally cold temps. My advice is wear layers and over prepare that way you won't risk your appendages.\n\nTips about tickets:\n\n-\tthere are no tickets to purchase from the Packers directly since all tickets are held by season ticket holders.  This means you'll likely be finding tickets through ticket brokers.\n\n-\tPrices for tickets fluctuate based primarily on how well the Packers are playing.  In other words, the earlier you buy the better because we are Super Bowl bound.  GPG!!\n\nFor fans of other teams:\n\n-\tPacker fans pride themselves as being the friendliest and most outgoing in the NFL.  This means that if you're not a jerk you shouldn't have any issues with wearing your team's colors before, during or after the game.  Locals will, however, ask where you're from and talk your ear off if you let them.\n\nHope you have a great time."
