And I've said it many times, but on that last McCaffrey touchdown Quay once again just guessed wrong and took himself completely out of the middle.  SMDH.  And they are going to count on him to be the man in the middle this season.  He can't shed blocks and just guess and runs recklessly into holes.  McCaffrey just waited for Quay to commit and walked right through the gap he vacated.  We are in trouble in the middle if he doesn't improve significantly.  \n\n[https://youtu.be/NT0gLmJu8jI?t=1466](https://youtu.be/NT0gLmJu8jI?t=1466)",

Jones went off for 53 yards early in the quarter and one more carry for a yard. We absolutely owned them on the ground like nobody else did all year.  And then we just abandoned the run completely.  Jones got 3/4 of our offense output for the 4th quarter on that one play.   \n\nObviously, LaFleur needed to get him the ball more (drink!). \n\nLove didn't play well.  He missed a wide open Jones for a first down.  We got fucked out of a first on an uncalled facemask on Jones at one point that would have been huge.  \n\nI wonder if Jones got dinged (they were working on his helmet)?   They pulled him for Wilson who made a really nice hurdling first down but that was the final carry.

            "If the Reggie's real, that's the one that's going to be worth anything. Favre's image tanked and a signed dirty hat might fetch the cost of authentication. \n\nBut the Reggie could go for $175-$200.",
            "Probably both worth your time to get looked at. Reggie White is always pretty valuable and Favre stuff should go up as time passes, especially a Superbowl hat.",
            "My dad has a ton of cool old memorabilia.  One thing in his collection that I suspect could be worth a lot is this unused ticket to the Ice Bowl:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/UNvANJD\n\nIt was too cold that day for his car to start.  And my mom bailed because of the weather.  My dad hitchhiked to the game instead, planning to sell her ticket to someone outside the stadium.  He was excited and cold and completely forgot it was in his wallet.\n\nFun fact:  He still has the same 4 tickets he has had since the \"new stadium\" (as he still calls it) opened 1958",

            "Where can I find that second hat?",
            "First one is a cool hat but was ruined since it was signed by a Viking.  The second one however might be worth it.",
            "Those Super Bowl hats were ugly. The main reason I never bought one back in the day.",
            "100% agree with this. Favre signs a ton of stuff and will keep signing a ton of stuff cause he has no other income.\n\nWhite\u2019s signatures are super valuable and a limited commodity since he died so young. That\u2019s probably worth making sure it\u2019s clean and stored well, and authenticated if you don\u2019t want to hold onto it.",
            "Thanks for the information. They are both real. The owners of the hats used to be very close to the team and got them signed themselves."
