This subreddit is not endorsed, sponsored,  moderated, or supported by Spotify.\n\nPopular topics include:\n\n* Shuffle  sucks, shuffle isn\u2019t really random, shuffle keeps playing the same  songs, I have a huge playlist and Spotify only plays the same songs. \n* Spotify for android doesn\u2019t work, Spotify desktop doesn\u2019t work, Spotify iOS doesn\u2019t work, Spotify app on different devices don\u2019t work\n* Downloaded songs don\u2019t stay downloaded\n* Sound quality on PS5 is terrible\n* I want to share a Spotify subscription with strangers across the world, will I get caught?\n* I want access to choose my own songs and create playlists, but I won\u2019t pay for premium\n* Why is (artist name)\u2019s music not available?\n* I want to make playlists longer than 10,000 songs\n* Podcasts:  suck, are great, have embedded ads, i do not like their existence, i pay for ad free music why am I getting podcast ads?\n* Spotify Wrapped: where is mine? when do they stop tracking, mine is not accurate, mine included songs i listen to while i sleep\n* The new UI is horrible. The new update is horrible. The new feature is horrible.\n* AI DJ is terrible, not available in my are. \n* Spotify's recommendations are terrible\n* Spotify stopped supporting Car Thing \n* Spotify made lyrics a premium feature, they aren\u2019t accurate, how do I report them?\n* Spotify removed the hearts and I now can\u2019t remember what songs I like",

            "I just wish they'd remove this useless smart shuffle so I can shuffle my playlists in peace again",
            "i'm a very organized person but spotify is not and it annoys me so much\n\nwhy are there identical versions of the same album created all the time? (i'm not talking about clean/unclean versions or deluxes). i hate going through artists pages and seeing i don't have their albums saved, when i really do but it's just another identical version that magically appeared on their profile. or looking at playlists and seeing that songs i do have saved don't appear with a like because it's a different version. PLEASE SPOTIFY is it really that hard to just not duplicate the same versions of songs and albums? or to recognize that it's the same product?",
            "Bro get the like button back on desktop. wtf is that shit... in a playlist, i have to hover on a song, click on the checkmark, scroll to find the Liked song \"playlist\", click on the check mark, then click done??? come on\n\nThe new the add to playlist when i can see everywhere the song is added is nice tho, just get the heart button back (maybe add another button for add to playlist)\n\nAlso, i'm still mad you combined the song and artist column years ago...",
            "This new layout is the absolute WORST incarnation that Spotify has ever put out. It is unbelievable that they would remove functionality like this.\n\nWhy the FUCK can i no longer view the songs/albums/artists in my library at the same time as viewing a list of my playlists????\n\nI can't drag and drop albums onto a playlist anymore without manually searching the album name? and it's not searching my library it's searching the overall spotify collection which means it's going to include songs i exluded from my library.\n\nWHO DESIGNED THIS??????????????????\n\nThey've actually lost me as a customer now. I've been paying for premium for 13 years. FUCK YOU SPOTIFY.",
            "I just want to say that all of Spotify\u2019s UI devs should be fired and just don\u2019t hire any more. You people are idiots who keep pushing out useless UI changes that nobody wants nor asked for that never fail worsen the experience each time. The existence of your jobs is to keep pushing out garbage UI updates. Just leave it as is so it doesn\u2019t get any worse holy fuck",
            "I'm annoyed that clicking the album art (bottom-left on desktop) no longer takes me to the song in the playlist. This was very useful in long playlists. Now I have to scroll through potentially hundreds of songs.\n\nThere are TWO buttons to open the Now Playing panel (the album art, and the button next to the lyrics button), but NO button to take me to the song in the playlist. \n\nIt also no longer takes me back to the playlist if I've navigated away from that page. This was useful to quickly get back to the playlist. Navigating back to the playlist now requires multiple clicks, instead of the single-click it was previously.",
            "im so mad with this new desktop UI oh my god... everyday it gets WORSE! months ago i already accepted the fact that accesing my saved albums list is now a pain in the ass, since for whatever reason its now located in the same left section of the screen i used to check my playlists, fine. later i accepted the fact that the album artwork is now in the same right section i used to check the \"friends are listening to\" tab and i can't see them at the same time anymore, whatever. but now you're telling me THE DAMN QUEUE IS ALSO GETTING MOVED?? WHAT THE FUCK!! the middle section (which is supposed to be the main section) is a waste of space now since it has become useless, it was the perfect place to check my queue and albums and now they just shoved every useful menu in two tiny sections in my screen that already had their respective functions, not to mention the fact that when you make them bigger it looks completely awful. i'm downloading an older version of the app, i'm not doing this shit anymore lol",
            "How do I stop Spotify from playing liked songs playlist automatically in the car? As soon as I start the car and phone connects to my car via Bluetooth it plays the first song in my liked playlist, even when I had another song \u201cpre loaded\u201d from last time I used Spotify. It\u2019s super annoying. Tried to google the answer but it only gives me the answers relating to auto play similar songs which is not what I\u2019m after.\n\nEdit : I\u2019m on an iPhone up to date version of Spotify",
            "Yup bring back the like/heart button. It was so much better for tracking songs, marking/tagging them etc. Binary yes/no. The new auto hiding playlist button is a lot worse.\n\nI would use the heart button to track how far down I had listened in a playlist. Songs I wanted to go back to etc. It was very good just as a visible tag, now there is no way to mark/categorize/comment/tag a song. Very sad."
