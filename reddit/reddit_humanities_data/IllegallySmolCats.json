Please remember, this sub was originally created for kittens and not adult cats that are \"smaller\" full grown cats.\n\nThank you for your understanding. ",

            "Also, here's a few things about the flairs. \n\nA standard issue cat isn't just any cat. This is why we have \"Standard Issue Smol\". Check out r/standardissuecat if you want to understand what they are.\n\nAn \"Orange You Smol\" kitten is from the r/oneorangebraincell club of kitties.\n\nA void is reserved for the smol r/blackcats. That's what \"Smol Void Detected\" means and they're usually all black.\n\nAnother variety is the r/tuxedocats... \"Smol Fancy Tuxie\" is for you. I was going to make it \"dapper\" but apparently that would imply boy kittens and I wouldn't want to leave the girls out!\n\nIf you're \"Curlin' Them Feetsies\" then you'd understand what r/curledfeetsies is all about.\n\nStanding up is not sitting down. The kitty has to be on two legs, not four... see r/catsstandingup for a great display. If your smol is doing this, use \"Standing Up Smol\". \n\nFor the \"Furbidden Purrito\" you would be wrapped up like a burrito! See r/purrito for more examples. \n\nHave you found a r/catloaf yet?? Then you've been blessed with an \"Incredibly Smol Loaf\". \n\nIf you have been the victim of \"Smol Murder Mittens\", you likely won't get much sympathy from r/murdermittens either. \n\nHopefully this clears up any confusion for what the flairs mean. \ud83d\ude3a\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask. There's always some confusion about something. \ud83d\ude39",

            "Could the expecting mamas posts be flaired \u201cconspiracy to produce smol\u201d ?  \nAs long as the OP comes through with a picture of the criminals after they\u2019re out, of course.",
