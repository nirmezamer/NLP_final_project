But I suppose by now Demiurge has replaced the humans on the happy farm with Demi-humans or of Heteromorphic races due to their body being consistently better than of humans in the story. I won't be surprised that by now Olasird'arc and one of his sons is already providing high quality scrolls, since it is stated that scrolls made from Dragons can contain 10th tier spells.",
            "I don't know about encouraging, but he'd tell demiuge to tone it down.",

        "content": "From what I've found and know, I actually really like Suzuki. A version of Ainz who found happiness and acceptance by making new friends he would give his life to save, and Keno who he would die for her happiness.\n  \nAs well as Evileye, it's interesting to see who she actually is and what happened to her, I also find it interesting that she's weaker as Keno then she is as Evileye. When she's Evileye in the main timeline, she's level 50, but Keno is only 34. Perhaps and most likely it's due to her time in the 13 heroes that made her that strong. Still, I like Keno and learning of her origins. Also Suzuki's best friend! \n \nI don't know much of Cure Elim Los Malvar, but I do know he undead, he broke the rules (Tier and wild magic) he's an asshole, and he's the reason why Keno's country is gone. \n \nAlso is the lost country where Evileye took Blue Rose? If she did, does that mean Cure Elim is dead in the current timeline or at least not around anymore? \n \nAlso PDL and Cure Elim, how/do they interact? From what I know of both of them, I feel like PDL wouldn't get along with him. \n \nAnd if you're wondering I don't read it, I can't, reading a book online is nearly impossible for me to focus with. I can do it, it's just a pain to do.",

            "I honestly like it more than the main time line.",
            "It is the best ending that Suzuki could get. It's even shown in ED1, Albedo with outstretched arms full of a black tar-like substance. She represents not just herself, but all of Nazerick, and shows that even if they adore and worship him, accepting it comes at the cost of being isolated forever. Ainz will eventually conquer the world, will find out that none of his friends are with him, and like most undead will either grow to hate mortals and kill them all or he will seal up his tomb and wait out eternity with the creations his friends made that will tie him down with their expectations.",
            "It is the best of the light novels imo, you should definitely read it. Suzuki and Keno were a fun pair to follow.",
            "I love Overlord, but this alternate story was just great, i wish certain fanfic writer took the liberty and wrote about it ",
            "Ah my favorite Overlord volume of the bunch, and it ain't even canon.\n\nI like both Satoru and Keno, and Cure  Elim has some really cool skills even if he is a bit of a dumb-dumb.",
            "Best light novel book ever written. I haven't read much novels, but I just fking know it okay.",
            "It's like the suzuki here is not bound by the thought that he will never have friends like in yggdrasil anymore",
            "Good Alternative Timeline. It has left alot of breadcrumbs for us to follow like the foundation of the Secret Lich Society for example.",
            "Cure Elim is the control group of what a True Dragonlord is. Their goals and power can bypass the existence of kingdoms and all other species native to the new world are inferior to them save for very few equals(So far they are all just True dragonlords). He is aware of his power despite being cowardice but a mere thought of the existence of a player can trigger him, especially with the use of Tier Magic. He isn't arrogant with his capabilities but he has little knowledge of a level 100 Player's might which explains the downfall of the True dragon lords against them."
