        "content": "From what I've found and know, I actually really like Suzuki. A version of Ainz who found happiness and acceptance by making new friends he would give his life to save, and Keno who he would die for her happiness.\n  \nAs well as Evileye, it's interesting to see who she actually is and what happened to her, I also find it interesting that she's weaker as Keno then she is as Evileye. When she's Evileye in the main timeline, she's level 50, but Keno is only 34. Perhaps and most likely it's due to her time in the 13 heroes that made her that strong. Still, I like Keno and learning of her origins. Also Suzuki's best friend! \n \nI don't know much of Cure Elim Los Malvar, but I do know he undead, he broke the rules (Tier and wild magic) he's an asshole, and he's the reason why Keno's country is gone. \n \nAlso is the lost country where Evileye took Blue Rose? If she did, does that mean Cure Elim is dead in the current timeline or at least not around anymore? \n \nAlso PDL and Cure Elim, how/do they interact? From what I know of both of them, I feel like PDL wouldn't get along with him. \n \nAnd if you're wondering I don't read it, I can't, reading a book online is nearly impossible for me to focus with. I can do it, it's just a pain to do.",

            "I liked cure as antagonist here, he behaves like what I would imagine when reading powerful dragon. The whole armor made of undead concept was pretty cool too\n\nI liked the synergy between Suzuki and kenno, she pushes the plot nicely and tho she doesn't do any heavy lifting it's thanks to her that we get to see gamer Suzuki in all his glory\n\nAfter reading it nazarick feels like a shackle on ainz more than ever",
            "Maruyamas Magnum Opus \n\nit\u2019s a shame that there\u2019s basically no chance that the storyline will ever be continued as i liked It more than the original.",
            "I honestly like it more than the main time line.",
            "Cure Elim's fate in the main storyline is unknown. Zesshi and the captain of the black scripture had a brief discussion about whether he still lived or not, and they were unsure. But they seemed to know that *something* happened to him.\n\nLN Volume 4:\n\n>\u201cCould it be a Dragon Lord? The Vampiric Dragon Lord or the Elder Coffin Dragon Lord?\u201d  \n>  \n>The curve of her lips widened, a clear smile. That is, if the look on her face, like a splash of blood, counted as a smile.  \n>  \n>\u201c...Aren\u2019t those two Dragons already dead?\u201d  \n>  \n>He felt a little awkward as he asked that, but she immediately replied:  \n>  \n>\u201cThey\u2019re both undead Dragon Lords, so we don\u2019t know if they were really destroyed.\u201d\n\nMaruyama has also made a statement about his status being secret (for now) back in 2019, but speculates that he would be tougher to kill than in the side-story if he was still around.\n\nApril 2019 Maryuama thoughts:\n\n>Whether or not he \\[Cure Elim\\] really exists in the mainline novels is a secret for now. But if he does exist, his 200 years of study and accumulation mean that he will have fewer weaknesses than in this book.\n\nIn addition, Maruyama also alluded to his unknown status in an interview in 2020, by mentioning how there are things said/believed in New World to be true that are in fact false, and then proceeds to talk about Cure Elim being alive or not as fanfic material.\n\n>Q: Maruyama-sensei, in Volume 7 Chapter 2 \u201dAt the end of the 13 Hero saga, a confrontation with a dragon called the God Dragon\u201d. Regarding this \u2019God Dragon\u2019, is it the Elder Coffin Dragon Lord?  \n>  \n>A: It\u2019s a background setting that\u2019s not going to be talked about, so it can be any opponent you want! By the way, there are things said in this world in general (or believed), when usually in fact the truth is something different. So when you want to write a fanfic, you are free to do as you want! For example \u201dIs the Elder Coffin Dragon Lord truly dead in the main continuity?\u201d\n\nI doubt we will find out about what happened to him in the last 2 volumes though, but here's hoping.",
            "It is the best ending that Suzuki could get. It's even shown in ED1, Albedo with outstretched arms full of a black tar-like substance. She represents not just herself, but all of Nazerick, and shows that even if they adore and worship him, accepting it comes at the cost of being isolated forever. Ainz will eventually conquer the world, will find out that none of his friends are with him, and like most undead will either grow to hate mortals and kill them all or he will seal up his tomb and wait out eternity with the creations his friends made that will tie him down with their expectations.",
            "It is the best of the light novels imo, you should definitely read it. Suzuki and Keno were a fun pair to follow.",
            "Cure Elim is the Elder Coffin Dragon Lord.\n\n**Bonus Volume: The Vampire Princess of the Lost Country**\n\n>\u201cI see. While it feels foolish to give my name to an undead creature of your insignificant stature \u2014 I am Cure Elim, the \u2b1b\u2b1b Dragon Lord.\u201d  \n>  \n>\u201cWhat?\u201d  \n>  \n>\u201cAh, yes... indeed! I am \u2014 the Elder Coffin Dragon Lord!!\u201d\n\nIn the main timeline, according to the captain of the Black Scripture, he is dead. However, Zesshi believes that since he was an undead dragon they can\u2019t be sure that he was truly destroyed.\n\n**Volume 4: The Lizardman Heroes**\n\n>\u201cCould it be a Dragon Lord? The Vampiric Dragon Lord or the Elder Coffin Dragon Lord?\u201d  \n>  \n>The curve of her lips widened, a clear smile. That is, if the look on her face, like a splash of blood, counted as a smile.  \n>  \n>\u201c...Aren\u2019t those two Dragons already dead?\u201d  \n>  \n>He felt a little awkward as he asked that, but she immediately replied:  \n>  \n>\u201cThey\u2019re both undead Dragon Lords, so we don\u2019t know if they were really destroyed.\u201d\n\nWe have never seen Cure Elim and Tsa (PDL) interact. However, Tsa was a member of the 13 heroes but was initially hiding his true nature. He was then forced to reveal his true nature to them at some point.\n\n**Volume 7: The Invaders of the Large Tomb**\n\n>In the past, Tsa had traveled with the old lady and her group by controlling an empty suit of armor as a substitute for himself. Therefore, when his true identity had come out, his companions had been furious about being tricked. The resentment from back then still had not died out, and she was still making digs at him until now.\n\nSince Evileye was a member of the 13 heroes it is not unlikely they would have investigated the destruction of her kingdom.\n\nAccording to legends the final enemy of the 13 heroes was the \u201cDivine Dragon.\u201d\n\n**Volume 7: The Invaders of the Large Tomb**\n\n>Due to their power, stories frequently depicted them as wicked foes, or beings who lent a hand to heroes. The objective of the Thirteen Heroes\u2019 last adventure was the Dragon known as the Divine Dragon. In much the same way, the final adversary of a hero was often one of the Draconic race.\n\nOne fan theory is that the Divine Dragon was Cure Elim and that Tsa revealed his true self to fight him.",
            "Cure Elim is an asshole, yes, but like most powerhouses, they tend to work together (or at least pretend to) against stronger beings, that being the players in this case. PDL was part of that alliance. Not sure if I'm mixing it up with another novel, but as far as I know the True Dragon Lords generally don't interact and try to keep to themselves. PDL probably doesn't like the guy and what he did to those countries, but he won't do anything about it.\n\nMain Timeline Cure Elim's fate is unknown, all we know is that he fucked up a few countries (including Evileye) using a spell meant to defeat the Players, we don't hear anything concrete after that.\n\nThe Slane Theocracy guesses that Shalltear might be Cure, but we don't know if that's because they know Cure is alive somewhere, or if they just assumed that the super powerful undead is probably Cure Elim.\n\nAlso, Keno isn't as strong as Evileye because like you said, EE had to survive on her own and journeyed with the 13 heroes, Keno had Suzuki with him to solve most combat.",
            "Suzuki is slightly better version of Ainz. I love his mainlane version, but there is something special abaut him being more...human? I dunno, meby in longer format it would be boring and generic, but as a one-of it's briliant.\n\nYeap, Kenno is weaker than EvilEye beacuse adventures with \"New Ainz Ooal Gown\" were faaaaaaaaaaaar less dangerous than 13 heroes ones, and any really dangerous situation they ran into was easily solvable by lvl 100 OP bullshit\n\nShotgunning the rest, yea Cure Elim is an asshole, yes there is 99.9% of chances EvilEye escaped with Blue Roses to the ruins of her homeland, but we have no idea is Cure Elim dead, moved somewhere else, in deep slumber hidden, or whatever else you can think of...I might be trippin balls now, but I think it was hinted in some recent-ish intermission that he is still kicking, leading and/orexploiting corupuss of the abyss, and yea Cure Elim and PDL don't get alog",
