        "content": "**ATTN: This post will be updated with new information throughout N7 Day, so please check back as the holiday progresses. If you see nothing here, that does not mean there is nothing more to add.**\n\n     Last updated: 12/07/23 6:11 PM ET\n\n*REMINDER: Our rules still apply on N7 Day, including Rule 3. In fact, today of all days we want to center meaningful discussions and any news we receive. Low effort, non-discussion-driven posts will be removed. Do not make posts just to say \"happy N7 Day.\" These types of low effort posts are distracting. Your posts must be discussion or content centered.*\n\n# Happy 14th Cake Day to r/masseffect!\n\nFun fact: This subreddit was created November 8th, 2009, one day after N7 Day and 3 years before the official creation of N7 Day! The first N7 Day was in 2012. This year the subreddit will turn 14 years old, just 2 years younger than the first Mass Effect. [Happy Cake Day to us!](https://www.deviantart.com/regeener/art/Happy-Birthday-365019290)\n\n[Art by regeener on DeviantArt](https://preview.redd.it/9izg411mnqyb1.png?width=941&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e47b5cf00595f0981da256838cd8b35f12fd868)\n\n# Giveaways\n\n**Edit: Congratulations to the winners** u/Iammeandnooneelse**,** u/TattedUpSimba**,** u/Ricatalano1**, and** u/CanoGori**!**\n\nTo celebrate 16 years of Mass Effect and 14 years of this community, we will be hosting a giveaway and giving away multiple prizes to multiple winners!\n\n**Eligibility:**\n\n1.

YOU MUST REPLY TO THE STICKIED MOD COMMENT FOR YOUR ENTRY TO COUNT! The extraneous comments are taking away from the discussion! I will no longer be warning folks that their entry won't count.

Once prizes are confirmed, this post will be edited with the winners listed.\n4. I will be fulfilling some of these prizes myself, with some of my own money, and much of my own time, so I ask that you be patient with me.\n\n# Discord Party\n\nOur subreddit Discord will be having an N7 Day party! Join us for friendship and festivities all day! [Click here to join](https://discord.gg/r-masseffect-810215970751774741).\n\nWe will also be streaming the Mass Effect animated film Paragon Lost, so check it out if you haven't seen it yet!\n\n# Official Bioware Posts & Announcements\n\n    The below updates are live and timestamped.\n\n* **\\[12:05 PM\\]** Looks like this year, the official N7 Day post is on [EA.com](https://EA.com) instead of the Bioware Blog. [Please see the full post with words from Mike Gamble here](https://www.ea.com/games/mass-effect/mass-effect-legendary-edition/news/n7-day-2023).\n   * There appears to be a secret message embedded in the text as there are random 1s and 0s scattered throughout the post. When decoded, it appears to be the word \"epsilon\" in binary, confirmed by multiple Twitter/X and Reddit users.\n   * Twitter user [@ghostofcody](https://twitter.com/ghostofcody/status/1721942413755761031) says:\n\n>Mass Effect was almost named \"The Epsilon Effect\" in early development. HOWEVER, the literal definition of Epsilon is the 5th letter in Greek Alphabet. Sounds like it will be Mass Effect 5!!\n\n* **\\[12:40 PM\\]** Mike Gamble also previously made [this Tweet responding to a clip of the old teaser trailer](https://twitter.com/GambleMike/status/1721756977557365007).\n* **\\[12:45 PM\\]** There is now a countdown on this web page: [https://www.ea.com/games/mass-effect/epsilon](https://www.ea.com/games/mass-effect/epsilon)\n   * the web page states the below with the countdown beneath it:\n\n>/////ACCESS CODE: EPSILON  \n>  \n>/////TIME UNTIL DECRYPTION COMPLETED\n\n* **\\[1:05 PM\\]** It seems the Epsilon webpage is being overloaded but [the Mass Effect YouTube channel just posted a short clip titled EPSILON of what appears to be a character walking past a bunch of energy cells](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kP_bTLzi3Hw). The description states \"Transmission incoming.\"\n* **\\[1:10 PM\\]** The webpage has updated to now state the below along with a YouTube embed of the video clip.\n\n>/////ACCESS CODE ACCEPTED  \n>  \n>/////SECONDARY ENCRYPTION DETECTED  \n>  \n>/////VJBSVU-XXXX-XXXXXXXX  \n>  \n>/////ANDROMEDA DISTRESS SIGNAL DETECTED  \n>  \n>/////YEAR SENT: \\[REDACTED\\]  \n>  \n>/////AUDIO TRANSCRIPT: ALTHOUGH THEY SHOULD KNOW BY NOW NOT TO UNDERESTIMATE HUMAN \\[REDACTED\\]\n\n* The AUDIO TRANSCRIPT is a line of dialogue believed to have been said by Liara T'Soni in last year's teaser.\n   * However, the final word of that dialogue, believed to be the word \"defiance,\" is redacted in this transcription. The year the transmission is sent is also redacted.\n   * The character appears to be wearing a coat or jacket similar to the silhouette of Liara's default outfit from Mass Effect 3 and the Shadowbroker DLC. The outfit appears to have a red trim or lining at the bottom. When going frame-by-frame, the outside of the outfit appears to be white, gray, or black.\n   * The character also appears to be wearing high-heeled wedge boots with some metallic silver or white and red details.\n* The ANDROMEDA DISTRESS SIGNAL DETECTED seems to confirm that The Next Mass Effect game will bridge the original trilogy and Andromeda.\n* **\\[1:30 PM\\]** [Mike Gamble tweeted \"First packet intercepted\"](https://twitter.com/GambleMike/status/1721953038011908119) and the text above implies a 2nd message.\n   * When moving 7 letters over in the alphabet, \"VJBSVU\" can be decoded to say \"Oculon.\" Oculon was an early development name for the Citadel.\n   * This leads us to a secondary webpage with yet another countdown: [https://www.ea.com/games/mass-effect/oculon-2819-defiance?isLocalized=true](https://www.ea.com/games/mass-effect/oculon-2819-defiance?isLocalized=true)\n   * Text above the countdown reads:\n\n>/////ACCESS CODE: OCULON-2819-DEFIANCE  \n>  \n>/////TIME UNTIL DECRYPTION COMPLETED\n\n* 2819 may be the redacted YEAR SENT as we know that DEFIANCE is the redacted last word. Year 2819 is when Ark Leusinia, Ark Natanus, and Ark Paarchero arrived in the Heleus Cluster.\n* **\\[2:02 PM\\]** The webpage has updated with a [new video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr0YtTJ6o_4) clip titled DEFIANCE which appears to be a direct continuation of the previous clip. This clip shows more of the character, which appears to be female or feminine, wearing a black N7 coat with lit back details similar to N7 armor.\n* The new text on the webpage reads:\n\n>/////ACCESS CODE ACCEPTED  \n>  \n>/////TERTIARY ENCRYPTION DETECTED  \n>  \n>/////CLASSIFIED: REVIEW BRIEFING MATERIALS ON OFFICIAL ALLIANCE COMMS CHANNELS\n\n* This seems to imply yet another, 3rd, message.\n* **\\[2:26 PM\\]** It may be worth noting that Mike Gamble [still has a tweet from last year pinned](https://x.com/GambleMike/status/1589731923127066624?s=20) that reads '\"Although, they should know by now not to underestimate human defiance!' - Liara T'Soni (Doctor, Shadow Broker and <REDACTED>).\" That last part was added by him. There is speculation that Liara may have been the Benefactor of the Andromeda Initiative.\n* **\\[2:35 PM\\]** Bioware retweeted two pieces of commissioned fan art that each have one half of a QR code.\n   * [https://twitter.com/VONHEXA/status/1721943498834825281](https://twitter.com/VONHEXA/status/1721943498834825281)\n   * [https://twitter.com/LazareGvimradze/status/1721958239649018187](https://twitter.com/LazareGvimradze/status/1721958239649018187)\n\n[Art by VONHEXA that has the left half of the QR code](https://preview.redd.it/3b0l2lhbbzyb1.png?width=2096&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d0be9b3e09b6070d9f183fed7e524cbb382fc73)\n\n[Art by LazareGvimradze that has the right half of the QR code](https://preview.redd.it/b6mitfpfbzyb1.png?width=2250&format=png&auto=webp&s=a50252856e0c3c1d8977c1c6c2ce909c0df066e3)\n\n* The full QR code leads to a third webpage with yet another (but longer) countdown: [https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/mass-effect/post-nebula](https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/mass-effect/post-nebula)\n   * The text on this webpage reads:\n\n>/////ACCESS CODE: POST-NEBULA  \n>  \n>/////TIME UNTIL DECRYPTION COMPLETED\n\n* The previous two countdowns were about 30 minutes, but this third one is about an hour and half.\n* **\\[4:00 PM\\]** The third countdown webpage, POST-NEBULA, has updated to include the below text and [a new embedded video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBzbMdw90do). The video is a continuation of the scene from the last two videos and appears to be the final piece of the puzzle.\n\n>/////ACCESS CODE ACCEPTED: POST-NEBULA  \n>  \n>/////WARNING  \n>  \n>/////SECURITY BREACH DETECTED/////CONTACT SYSTEMS ALLIANCE  \n>  \n>/////EPSILON-OCULON-NEBULA\n\n* The N7 character is now revealed, wearing a helmet and N7 coat with a quilted high collar and red lining. They are seen walking through a doorway.\n   * Although blurred, the doorway appears to lead to an outside environment as what look like vehicles fly by. The environment is vaguely reminiscent of the environments shown in the concept arts released last year as teasers.\n   * [There is also a vague silhouette of a ship resembling the one from the Mudskipper teaser](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2F2su0f7p0jqya1.png%3Fwidth%3D1024%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D3dc85e2decfc7601f281d33431f7d9d0820783dd).\n* **\\[4:10 PM\\]** The full video, with all three clips stitched together, is now available, with the description \"Transmission received\": [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XefLOWmcFpY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XefLOWmcFpY)\n   * [Mike Gamble tweeted this video, telling us to \"look closely.\"](https://twitter.com/GambleMike/status/1721997635278831701)\n* **\\[4:12 PM\\]** [Mike Gamble has also tweeted \"Not everything is as it seems,\"](https://twitter.com/GambleMike/status/1721997151751086105) implying there is more to decode.\n* **\\[4:54 PM\\]** Fans are reporting seeing [what looks like a krogan at the beginning of the video](https://twitter.com/TashaOfAsgard/status/1722008065661128717). So far, there is no identification of any reflections in the N7 character's mask at the end.\n* **\\[5:12 PM\\]** [Mike has confirmed the footage is in-engine](https://twitter.com/GambleMike/status/1722010187165544651).\n* **\\[5:13 PM\\]** [Mike Gamble has just posted yet another teaser image,](https://twitter.com/GambleMike/status/1722012172166025591) this time portraying the N7 character and some nightlife environment imagery. The image shows the weapon, coat, and helmet in more detail.\n* **\\[5:52 PM\\]** [A high resolution version of the image has been made available for download.](https://twitter.com/GambleMike/status/1722017167389172097) The nightlife scene clearly shows Angarans, Salarians, Humans, Hanar, Volus, Krogans, and Asari. The image also possibly shows a Geth and male Quarian to the left of him and the Angara. This implies that the Quarian Ark, which held Elcor, Quarians, Drell, Volus, Batarians, and Hanar may have reached Andromeda. Drell and Angarans have been shown before in the Mudskipper teaser image.\n   * **\\[6:15 PM\\]** Some fans are also saying they see a younger looking Krogan in the image, similar to Grunt.\n\n[N7 Day 2023 teaser image](https://preview.redd.it/zfocw9u030zb1.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3f74d18b0879131b51ce2981f32e28b6023922b)\n\n* **\\[5:53 PM\\]** [Mike has confirmed that the art director for the new game is the same from the OT](https://twitter.com/GambleMike/status/1722020852475302201).\n* **\\[7:20 PM\\]** Fans have pointed out that EPSILON-OCULON-NEBULA form the acronym \"EON\"\n* **\\[11:01 PM\\]** [Mike has left us with another cryptic tweet, tagging the dev lead Parrish Ley](https://twitter.com/GambleMike/status/1722081366312149455):\n\n>[@parrish\\_ley](https://twitter.com/parrish_ley) they still havent found the other part. the one i was afraid of them finding. whew.\n\n# Events\n\n* Mark Meer, Jennifer Hale, and other cast members will be reuniting for a virtual \"party on the Citadel.\" It will be hosted on [Jennifer Hale\u2019s YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGf2-KVB8pA) on Sunday, November 12 at 1:00 PM Pacific Time (NOT on N7 Day).

I guess it takes away from his identity as a person with a disability. Its really cool that they wrote the character that way but Im with ya, they probably have the technology to help him!",
            "Jeff isn't worth the investment. You don't need functional legs to fly the SR-2 lol. \n\nAnd that's an entirely Cerberus thing to do.",
            "I'm sure there's some downside to having these. Either the success rate is low, it requires a lot of maintenance, or carries the risk of future mefical complications. There's also the possibility that these exist solely as part of the game's upgrade mechanic, and don't actually canonically exist in-universe.",
            "Yeah, to me it's pretty clear that Joker's condition is easily treatable in Mass Effect's setting. I try to headcanon it as it being something not covered by any insurance and it's very expensive otherwise. But Cerberus likes spending money on Shepard.",
            "You still need to be able to survive the surgery. If you can't survive the surgery for new bones then it makes the new bones kind of a non issue.",
            "So alliance marines have genetic augmentation for combat effectiveness. For joker to do it I would assume it would require an immense amount of money that he just doesnt have on a flight lieutenants budget",
            "I believe some where in the lore Joker turned down trying to fix it, because he believes it might ruin his ability to pilot or he isn't as unique as a pilot if he is like everybody else.",
            "I mean, he tells us if he were born earlier he wouldn't be alive, so Joker is apparently already a medical miracle. Like, being able to hobble around is probably far beyond what people with Vrolicks (sp?) could do even a generation before"

            "Yeah Miranda is the quintessential Ice Queen archetype and her heart gradually melts being around Commander Shephard. She eventually becomes a sweetheart and she comes off much more cool than bitchy.\n\nThat said, it's almost impossible for me to think of her as the second-in-command of the Normandy SR2 and commanding the respect of the crew over someone like Garrus Vakarian, and it's impossible for me not to pick Garrus as the the leader of a team in a choice later in the game.",
