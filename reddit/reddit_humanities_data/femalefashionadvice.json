            "I need help im in my early 20s and middle eastern our weddings are EXTRA i have so many weddings and proposal parties this year and i struggle to find dresses that fits my body and looks good im so tired of wearing things just cuz it looks \"fine\" on my body. When i see something i like on a rack i wear it and it looks awkward on me and weird on my bust or fits awkwardly. I dont have enough time to order online and i get to scared that it will not fit and look bad on my body I always look older than i actually am if anyone has any advice pleaseee im all ears. for context im around 160cm and 72kg and i have a bigger bust and a lot of my fats are concentrated on my stomach (a big part of the problem is dresses arent made for a bigger bust so even when i size up and get it tailored it looks off) what shape dresses do you guys suggest and what are your favorite dress shops to order from?\n\nbtw when i say extra i mean it a lot of people wear gowns\\*",
            "Where can i get petite, not low-waisted plaid straight legged pants in both lighter material (i.e., good for summer but not linen) and thicker (e.g., wool material)? Could not seem to find them in my go-to online stores.",

            "I don't think either are particularly flattering, but the wider are better than the skinny. The tighter fit has some gaping at the waist, but are little too tight across your glutes and lower abs. The wider ones at least fit like a standard cargo pant. If you just need something to wear casually, I'd keep the wider. If they were expensive, I'd return both and keep looking.",
            "Can you see the fabric pulling at the waist? That means they're both too small. If the next size up is also a poor fit, that means you need to look for a different style altogether.",

            "I'm going back to work in person after a few years remote. I found some pants I absolutely love and bought a few pairs but they don't have pockets. I'd love some recommendations on bags that will fit my phone and a few tiny items! I've only ever owned crossbody bags but I want something I can feel more comfortable wearing most of the time. I'd also prefer something that won't look outdated in two years which is why I'm hesitant to get a belt bag/chest bag. Thank you!!",
            "Not exactly a style question but I hope it's allowed. Are there any sites where you can see items of clothing on actual people? Something where people submit images of them wearing photos of clothing so you can get an idea of the fit on different shapes/sizes? It's one of my biggest issues with online shopping, you have no idea what it'll look like on different body types",
