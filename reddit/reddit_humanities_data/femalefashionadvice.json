            "Valentino just surprise dropped the first collection from Alessandro Michelle since he took over as creative director as the last day of Men's fashion week in Milan, and it looks very...... Gucci. Curious what does everyone think?  \n[https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/resort-2025/valentino](https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/resort-2025/valentino)",
            "Commenting what I posted elsewhere, but personally I hate it lol but don't know why because there are plenty of elements there I should love but\n\n-way too many looks/pieces \n\n-not sure where the Gucci ends and the Valentino begins \n\n-I don't like this particular mashup of preppy+boho: like if Queen Elizabeth had gone to Coachella? With details and prints that 20 years ago would have been called \"ethnic\" ...idk it doesn't make me the think the people wearing these things are very likeable or intriguing people, and I think that's what I want to feel when I see a collection, like am I interested in knowing these characters more. In this case, nah not really. \n\n-not feeling all the fur\n\n\nThings I do find interesting: \n\n-the color palette\n\n-the return of early 2000s-2010 silhouettes and colored tights",
            "So many looks!!!\n\nI actually liked a lot of like one off pieces, or a specific thing about a look, like the silhouette of [this coat](https://assets.vogue.com/photos/666f10cc4537ba4afbbdca63/master/w_2240,c_limit/00022-valentino-resort-2025-credit-ola-rindal.jpg), but I can't tell if I actually like the look or even actually like the coat itself?\n\n[This](https://assets.vogue.com/photos/666f10d1c497cb18a470ff8d/master/w_2240,c_limit/00031-valentino-resort-2025-credit-ola-rindal.jpg) is the kind of funkiness that was missing from prep recently though. It feels like the \"old money\" and the \"dark academia\" versions of prep have largely taken over, and it doesn't feel like prep was originally as clean. It's messy, it's collegiate and funky and experimental and there's definitely at least a desire to be counterculture originally that gets stamped out when it turns into old money, and even a little bit erased/whitewashed when it's dark academia. I feel like I've seen [this idea](https://assets.vogue.com/photos/666f10d48d2530d9d4cd54b6/master/w_2240,c_limit/00037-valentino-resort-2025-credit-ola-rindal.jpg) in schools before, is all. That said it of course is still a sendup and not actually messy or accessible, since well...it's valentino lol.\n\nAlso, even though I wrote the above paragraph, the dominant looks here are pretty beige, which I don't care about. Even the fun patterns were largely still neutral (where neutral == the neutral colors of like the us)"

It was originally a $400 dress and I got it for $60 in good condition. I've gotta say...wow, such a disappointment. I'm really glad I only paid $60 for the dress and not full price. The quality...I mean it feels to me honestly like the quality of a decent Target dress I wouldn't pay more than $30 for. And these are being sold for $400?? It is absolutely wild to me. If I had paid $400 for it I would have been very upset considering I have way less expensive dresses that are much better quality. I would expect at that price point for a piece of clothing to be stunning and feel luxurious but it absolutely does not. What expensive brands have you had this experience with? Who is charging obscene prices but not giving the quality they should? \n\nEdit:\nThought I'd add a few brands that at least in my experience are worth full price...I still prefer a sale or buying secondhand though haha\n\nMadewell, LL Bean, Abercrombie and Fitch (a bit divisive maybe, but everything I've bought so far has been great), and for designer Agua by Agua Bendita (I have only had two dresses from them secondhand but the quality is so stellar I think they are worth their full price)",

            "Cannot wrap my head around Aritzia. Aside from a puffer I bought there (I trusted them on that as a Canadian brand and have not been disappointed with it), everything I\u2019ve come into contact with of theirs seems ludicrous. Over $100 for a sweater that\u2019s 80% synthetic, already pilling IN THE STORE, and also hung on a hanger in store so the shoulders are all stretched out and busted? No way.",
            "I don\u2019t know why but my first thought was Sandro. They are selling the French image. It doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t like the thrifted pieces I have but I tried on some of their stuff at Bloomie\u2019s and while I liked the cut and movement of, for example, a dress, it was not worth 500 USD. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if the same thing is going on at Sezane as I only have one blouse from them. \n\nI also like Reiss a lot but I think they are overcharging. Their sale prices are closer to what I think the designs are worth.\n\nAnthropologie is hit or miss. They have some absolute amazing bangers that I\u2019m ok with paying $150. But they have so many little brands under them and inconsistency that I am never sure what I\u2019m going to get, and always go to try on in person. \n\nAritizia is also absolutely worth it for a few staple pieces like the enterprise skirt but they are probably charging twice as much as I feel they should for a lot of things.",
            "Conversely, what brands ARE worth the full\nPrice?",
            "Oh I have a long list. Zara, Anthropologie, Free People, Abercrombie, Everlane, REFORMATION, Aritzia, almost every fashion shoe company. They're out here selling 100% polyester for hundreds of dollars. It has to be a joke. \n\nAt Old Navy, I can easily find 100% natural fabrics for a fraction of the cost.",

            "Every brand that charges more than $80 for a piece of clothing made out of plastic. Or all of those designer bags that cost hundreds  or even thousands and are made in china or Vietnam, are no longer hand made and aren\u2019t even leather.",
            "Honestly? Sezane. I hate to say it. I was obsessed with the brand for a few months, but after getting a few pieces which I'm happy with and love, I can't really seem to justify the price, and the novelty had since worn off. It's to the point where the quality and price mismatch is drastic enough that I no longer shop there. You're mostly paying for the idealized French version of yourself.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0If I had to recommend, the Gaspard sweater and the Chlo is worth its price.\n\n\nBanana Republic and Madewell I think are brands that are great on sale. Madewell and Levis jeans are worth full price, to me. LLL leggings and Nike are also great full price.",
            "Reformation ! Some of their dresses material is so unforgiving and not breathable. But I love their cuts! So much so that I had my wedding dress made by a tailor that used their pattern exactly but with much nicer material and in white."

Identify the decade the style you like is from, then go vintage shopping. \n\nRight now it\u2019s mostly 90s and Y2K in fast fashion. Some 70s boho, 60s minis and 80s fitted bodice dresses etc\n\nThe quality of vintage dresses is amazing. Substantial materials that drape well.
