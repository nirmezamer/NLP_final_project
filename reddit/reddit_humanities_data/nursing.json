        "content": "Okay, so as a follow up post to our last reminder post, there's still some confusion about our no medical advice rule.  It's the first rule of the sub, and we have been very open and transparent that it is not now, has never been, and will never be allowed in this sub. \n\n\n[This piece of music has been hand selected for this message.](https://youtu.be/3GKyMb3glZA?t=30)\n\n\nHi friends, shitposters, lurkers, students, nurses, relatives of nurses, and what have you and so on.  \n\n\n\nWe\u2019re noticing that there\u2019s an increase in medical advice posts recently. \u201cNo Medical Advice\u201d is the first rule for a reason.  There\u2019s significant legal and ethical consequences that you probably don\u2019t want to get wrapped up in. Both asking for and ***PROVIDING*** medical advice is strictly prohibited.  Since there seems to be some confusion about the rule, I'll break it down further here: \n\nNo Medical Advice: \n\n* No - ***adverb*** (a negative used to express dissent, denial, or refusal, as in response to a question or request):\n\n\n* Medical - ***adjective***\nof or relating to the science or practice of medicine:\n\n\n* Advice - ***noun***\nan opinion or recommendation offered as a guide to action, conduct, etc.:\n\nThus, as the rule is written, you are denied from opining or recommending a course of action or conduct as it pertains to the science or practice of medicine. \n\n\nAs a reminder to the rebels that even the strongest among them cannot overcome the power of the mod team, anyone asking for or providing medical advice will be given a 7 day ban.  Further incidents will result in further bans, escalating in duration up to and including permanent.  \n\n\n***ANYONE COMMENTING ON A MEDICAL ADVICE POST ANYTHING OTHER THAN \"MEDICAL ADVICE IS NOT ALLOWED\" OR A SUFFICIENTLY SIMILAR DERIVATIVE OR VARIATION WILL ALSO BE SUBJECT TO ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS UNDER THIS RULE.  THIS POST IS YOUR WARNING - IF YOU MENTION ANYTHING ALONG THE LINES OF \"THIS IS TOO HARSH\" OR \"I WASN'T EVEN WARNED\", THEN YOUR BAN WILL BE MADE PERMANENT.***\n\n\nFarewell and may the karma be ever in your favor.",

Good luck, and I'm so sorry you're dealing with this.\"*\n\nCan I have your permission to post that if there is ever rogue porn on the sub, please? (I understand if not.

They only spoke Cantonese so I did my best with hand motions and signals ..\nAnyways I come in to check on the patient, and they shoo me away signaling he isn\u2019t done with the commode yet, so I come back a few mins later to find the patients wife with her hand up his ass, digging for poop.

Dr P is a great doctor, she has great bedside and is very smart, but she can be tough on nurses. She will write you up if she thinks you messed up and will embarrass you if she feels that you\u2019re being incompetent. \nSo, Dr P is in the middle of rounding on patients, a PN student comes up to her and says \u201chey room 30 wants to talk to you\u201d Dr P says \u201cis it an emergency? What did they want to talk about?\u201d The PN student admitted she didn\u2019t know why the pt wanted to speak with the dr. Dr P said \u201cwell I\u2019m in the middle of rounding but once I finish I\u2019ll go see them.\u201d The PN student says \u201coh well that\u2019s funny.

The student got sent home.\nNaturally it\u2019s all everyone is talking about lol. What do you guys think? I do think Dr P yelling (especially in the hallway in front of everyone) is uncalled for, but if it\u2019s not an emergency, I do think it\u2019s ridiculous to expect a Dr to stop rounding just to see what someone wanted.
