Even burned they stay the same solid shape.\n\nI want my perfect brown bubbly toasted mallows! Like a perfect 4 or 5 here."

            "It's not like Outer Wilds but if you want a combination of exploration that will challenge your reasoning/logic/observational abilities The Witness is a masterpiece. I posted this recently here to mixed reviews in the comments. It's def a \"this game isn't for everyone\" game but if it's for you you'll devour it."
