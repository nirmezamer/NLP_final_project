I'm not here to hate on the creator, nor disvalue what he said, as I do believe that the solution is quite unclear and it's obvious that a lot of people struggled with these sections. However, I do believe there is a solution, and the solution isn't to \"just stealth\".\n\nThe true intended solution, I believe, is to use the Olwks lights as your own light source.\n\nWhen you suppress your light, and they are close enough to see you, they turn on their lantern and walk slower because of that. If your light is off, they keep their light on you to not lose you. If you use that information, you can use the Owlks light to guide you through where you might need to traverse, giving you an easy way to navigate, with minimal \"chase\" going on.\n\nIn the video, there is a quote from an interview that Andrew Cunningham, the video's creator, references many times throughout. This quote alludes that the \"themes\" of the game (or DLC) are present in the solution to the chase sequences.\n\nAs presented, the solution above seems to fit pretty nicely within the themes of the DLC.\n\nImagine the game's themes. The whole problem with the Owlk is they intentionally obscured the Eye of the Universe. They want to live \"in the dark\". Considering the themes of the game, if you are to sneak around and be \"in the dark,\" it's going to be VERY difficult for you. But if you aren't afraid of the threats, and decide to let them illuminate your path, things begin to be a lot easier for you.\n\nThe intent of this post isn't to put anyone down who didn't gather this, nor to give myself a boost on finding this out. It's just something I found on my playthrough of the game which from the sounds of it *many people* did not and struggled with particularly. I'm curious whether other people solved it this way, what other solutions people came up with, what people think about the stealth sections overall, and even how it connects with the lore of the game and the themes of the DLC.",

            "I think the themes and intention behind the stealth sections are laudable.\n\nI think the implementation is less successful. For a game based in progression by information, the sudden skill challenge comes out of nowhere. If this had been a stealth game to begin with, perhaps players would have been predisposed to consider their options more carefully, but the player is not primed for stealth gameplay prior to this moment. Add in the frustration of your natural reaction (conceal your light) leaving you both completely in the dark *and* being the \u201cwrong\u201d response, and I can\u2019t appreciate the message that\u2019s trying to be shown when I\u2019m too busy being upset that I keep failing.",
            "I accidentally figured out that you can ENTIRELY avoid the stealth sections by accident. my thought process was like \"hmmmmmm, I wonder if I activate this and then use one of the boats from a different location maybe I could avoid this\" and it indeed avoided the stealth entirely",
            "The solution seems far more to be the themes of fear of the unknown which they represent, and same with the base game.  If you charge in to either their areas or the anglerfish nest you'll get jumped for sure, it's knowledge that will help you traverse it without issue\n\n  \nIf they spot you they'll charge and boot you out - they spent all this effort not to be found, to cloak their spaceship AND hide everything in secret doors any of them will know on sight, only an intruder would be fooled by, and even THEN leaving a redacted history that looked to be a dead end, with the simulation being an even deeper layer of secrecy, and even THEN hiding the rest behind their own personal presence as a last layer of security... so yeah, they're going to freak out if someone actually shows up and rush to scare you away without looking deeper.\n\nHowever, this goes the other way, if you find them first, and focus your light directly at them, they stop, they hide their own light, they get cautious and start to stalk you instead of charge. You're now a threat to be scared of.  That's how you become the thing THEY are stealthing from, and now their lights are hidden, when you also hide yours, you can now make your trip effortlessly down the paths you've already memorized from previous exploration\n\nOr in more practical terms, find a path with two routes, like the ones leading to the guard of the well, focus your light at him down one path, conceal and then you can waltz down the other - he'll be stalking to where he last saw you.  This works at split paths, anywhere there's an obstruction, and also on stairs with railings (they can't jump, you can)",
            "I think the stealth in the DLC is pretty clunky TBH. I get what they were trying to go for but it's so difficult it feels almost random. I feel like with reduced frights it's easier and works better but I dunno... it's really not that great IMHO. Good thing the rest of it is a masterpiece.",
            "I enjoyed the dark moments after the initial terror I was experiencing.   Once I realized they >!approach slowly when you shine your light on them or vice versa, with a reasonable amount of distance between us!< I used that to my advantage and it worked like a charm.  \n\nI never got over the fear factor when going through the DLC >!(or Dark Bramble for that matter) but it was fun playing tricks with Owlks!<",
            "It's clear to me that they designed their systems with several possible solutions in mind. Or perhaps more accurately the freedom to work with several interlocking systems in order to compose your own solution, without one truly being the intended route.\u00a0\n\n\nI can say that I probably stumbled into an unusual way of solving it, though. One of the first things I did when arriving at that location was to drop all my equipment. I don't remember exactly why I did that but it was probably just me goofing around - deliberately discarding everything because it cracked me up how irresponsible of a course of action it was.\n\n\nThe end result of this was that I learned one of the secrets and could easily determine where to go with the press of a button. So my experience involved a lot of mapping paths ahead of time with that trick. Not what I imagine they expected me to do, but I would still call that a solution.",
            "The biggest flaw isn't that they can't be gamed, but that the game doesn't tell you how or that you preferably should. And that's because the devs want you to interact with them and play a scary game. \n\nAnglerfish were direct, there's a little section where kids play, they explain it, awesome. Owlks, they're a much bigger thing. You interact with them and they'll look at you confused, they'll look around for you, they'll hesitate if you shine your light at them. It's easy to figure out how to manipulate them... It's just scary.",
            "I take 95% of the blame for this myself both due to lack of apparent reading comprehension and bad learning. I initially played on less-scary-mode and missed that that also slows down their \u201cpounce\u201d.\n\nThis led me to SO many loops where I was sure it was just a skill issue. Especially getting past the fireplace. \nI feel many base-game puzzles and even other dlc puzzles DID have \u201cbrute force\u201d solutions, and \u201csmooth solutions\u201d, but it always felt much more clear which of the two I was engaging in. \n\nSquishing yourself into giants deep with an island, landing on sun station, randomly wandering around the QM thoughtlessly until finally landing at the North Pole, etc.\n\nWhen I was doing things like that it was evident that I was cheesing that section, but in the late dlc it seemed as if there were solutions that SHOULD be possible but weren\u2019t cuz I was just not good enough.\n\nFor those of you D&D inclined, it felt a bit like one of those times where you\u2019re just losing the encounter the DM is trying to use to tell you \u201cyou\u2019re not ready yet you\u2019re not strong enough\u201d, but it wasn\u2019t clear enough that was happening.",
            "I suppose I might've been a bit too cocky when I suggested my response was the \"right\" one. I simply mean I believe it's the one intended by the devs, as I think OW has some unique quality to have many different solutions.\n\nThat said, I do think, as you properly mentioned, that this \"true solution\" is not very obvious at all, especially if you're under a time crunch and in an intense chase sequence.\n\nDo you think maybe they should have alluded to this is some way? I'm not sure exactly what they could've done with this, especially as the DLC has the challenge of having zero fellow travellers with you. That was my usual safety net, going back to a fellow traveller and seeing what they had to say about stuff. But I imagine there was definitely a better way to implement this solution to the puzzle than simply, test until you find it out, as it seems many people, in fact, did not find this solution.",
            "This was the intended way, it's a puzzle game before a stealth game.\nThey were scaring the shit out of me so I had to find a way to skip them entirely, and I did.\nAnd one you find the >!drop the artifact to see better!< trick, you cannot be surprised anymore"
