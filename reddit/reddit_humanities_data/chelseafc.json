            "Interesting bit from Palmer on Maresca in this interview:\n\n[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/06/28/cole-palmer-gutted-chelsea-sacked-mauricio-pochettino-euros/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/06/28/cole-palmer-gutted-chelsea-sacked-mauricio-pochettino-euros/)\n\n>\u201cEnzo was the one who put me at right-wing,\u201d Palmer says. \u201cSo from the \\[under\\] 18s I was playing \\[number\\] 10 and when I went to the 23s Enzo played me on the right.\n\n>That was my first full season on the right. He\u2019s a good coach, a really good coach. I think tactically he knows what he is doing. He will improve a lot of the players.\u201d",
            "Palmer played 19 mins and he's got Saka giving press releases.",
            "Newcastle have until Sunday to sort out their PSR issues, the great thing about the Isak news is we\u2019ll get an answer soon.",
            "I woke up and I see two different news on KDH and Chelsea. One of the reasons I hate the transfer windows(I know it's technically not even open) with this new management. Nearly every single transfer rumor seems to get leaked.",
            "People using the Cesc comment to slander Jorginho is so on brand for some of the peeps on this sub.\n\nIt's borderline ignorant at this point. Midfields aren't comprised of just one singular dude! Balance is necessary, especially in a three midfield sustem. Hence you have an anchor that dictates possession, a water carrying 8 to carry the ball to the final third, and another 8 or 10 to be the playmaker and unlock the defense.\n\nSure there are players like Rodri that can do all three but how many Rodris exist?\n\nJorginho was a loyal servant to the club across multiple managers and put up with a lot of bull shit. Only now are the likes of Neville appreciating why a player like him is necessary because England refuses to produce such a skillset.",
            "One omari in and one omari out, which fofana will be THE fofana for us",
            "At the point where I'm excited for the next season, but also so damn tired of no damn stability ever\n\nI hope in the next 2-3 years we hit jackpot on more players like Palmer and build something worthy of being Chelsea",
            "So Dewsbury-Hull and Archie Gray ate included in targets\n\nIt looks like we're okay getting Dewsbury-Hull but idk whats happening with Archie Gray, it was just sorta that one guy that said we were in for him, but I think he'd be a decent buy in that he fits the system as an inverting RB (although I'm pretty sure hes used more like MF anyway)\n\nI think our J. David interest has cooled off, or at least seems like it, I think there's a chance we might  get him and Guiu both, but I feel its more of a precaution if Nkunku doesn't stay fit again",
            "Ugarte leaving PSG after one season. Thank you for giving us Caicedo. \n\nAlso De Ligt is available but astronomic wages.",
            "Also Fab was saying the other day to \"keep an eye on Broja this weekend\" \n\nThis weekend would be the final days Newcastle have to sell Isak at a lower price for PSR purposes \n\nAm I delusional or do I see something funny about to occur"

            "When the game had character and players weren\u2019t afraid of losing possession.    \nGame is so focused on retaining the ball at all cost, players have lost all creativity.

            "Gallagher annoys me with this, same with Cucurella. Feels like they are not confident in passing it forward. Enzo, Colwill, Badiashile are excellent at it",
            "Fabregas was a different breed from the overrated footballers of this new generation.",
            "Everyone gives Jorginho as an example but i think Gallagher is a better example. Easily worse forward passer which is pretty bad considering that he also plays further forward."

        "content": "Chelsea vs Barcelona UCL semi final 2012 2nd leg was the most miraculous and the biggest underdog win ever in Champions league history in my opinion.Perfect comeback to 2009 robbery.\n\nFirstly I must say what a match that was \nAlthough Chelsea had won the first leg but still no one ever gave them a chance against prime time Barcelona. I mean just look at the team Chelsea were facing arguably the greatest midfield trio of all time xavi ,iniesta and busquets with also cesc fabregas at his best.\nA solid back three of pique mascherano and puyol.\n\nOn top of all that Messi at his magnum opus.\nMind u he scored 91 goals that season but he couldn't score a single goal against Chelsea across the both legs.\n\nWith the way the match started Gary Cahill getting injured in the 12th minute and being replaced by bosingwa who isn't a traditional center back.\nThen busquets scoring in the 35 min and in the next 2 minutes John terry with no disrespect to him having a brain dead moment and doing something very silly which got him a red card.\n\nImmediately after 6 mins iniesta scoring again and Barca were in full control of the game until ramires pulled one back with a sublime finish and the game was back on.\n\n\nSo for the second half we were up against this absolute one of the best footballing sides without having any recognized center backs.\nBoth full backs playing as center backs up against the greatest midfield of all time with John obi Mikel and Raul meireles in midfield ( no disrespect to the legends).\nWhat stood out for me in this match was the tracking back of drogba and his defensive contributions and although he didn't got a goal but was very important for the win.\nOverall performance of everyone especially Ashley Cole against Messi , Petr cech with his world class saves and Frank lampard with his all round defensive and attacking display were industrial for the way we countered Barca s attack.\n\n\nLast but not least Torres scoring a late goal to seal one of the best nights ever in the history of Chelsea football club",

            "I was at the game and I\u2019d say it was in my top 3 games I had ever been to. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t necessarily give Drogba his flowers for tracking back as he gave a penalty away in both this game and the final with his badly executed tackles. \n\nI was right in line to see Torres goal however. \n\nI remember the ball being cleared and suddenly seeing Torres sprinting off. With all\nThe chaos I hadn\u2019t noticed he was clear so had to scan for the where the defenders were. \n\nIt dawned on us that they weren\u2019t there. Then 5 seconds turned into about 3 years. \n\nWe all went mad and the Barca fans rained coins up on us. It was like that scene from Gladiator with all the arrows. The coins were shining in the light as they came up. \n\nSo much fun.",
            "That ramires chip goal was one of the best in cl history. Man was a machine. That team used to fight for the badge till death... Lamps, drogba, Terry, cahill, meireles, cech, Cole, mikel, ramires, mata, kalou, Ivanovic etc. Good ol days. \n\nImo perfect comeback was against napoli(consisting of cavani, lavezzi) in the 2nd leg.",
            "That Ramires finish and the Torres goal! One of the best moments for me as a Chelsea fan. What an amazing match.",
            "I live in the states and left for class right after Terry got the red, I was in college at the time. I kept getting notifications on my phone and every time I looked at my phone I didn\u2019t believe it. I went back and watched that game so many times, because I missed the match \u201clive\u201d",
            "I really enjoyed the games against Barcelona. Two peak teams really going at it. While I was utterly devastated about that late Iniesta goal in 2009, I will admit it was a brilliant finish. \u00a0\n\nThis game, the 4-2 game where went went 3-0 up in 20 minutes in 2004 and the Liverpool 4-4 game are my top 3 champions league games. The Alex free kick is quite possibly my favourite ever goal besides that header in Munich.",
            "More miracolous was winning final with Bayern at Allianz tbh",
            "I remember this game so well. One of my favourite ever Chelsea games. We'd had so much history against Barca at that time. Not least the 2009 robbery which was still fresh in the memory. It was so incredibly cathartic winning that game. I remember at the time almost not even caring if we won the final because we'd achieved so much in winning that game. Me and my dad both were crying. It was such an emotional win.\n\nThat Torres goal to seal it was something special too. Not in the actual finish itself, but just how dramatic it was. A simple clearance and then suddenly unexpectedly Torres has it on the halfway line and he's through on goal. It felt like forever for him to reach Valdes. I remember Gary Neville's words \"it's written in the stars!\" which he'd kept repeating throughout the CL run that season, because of our incredible resilience and desire and sometimes luck. Like it was our destiny. Then he rounded the keeper, my heart was in my mouth, and then... Ecstacy.\n\nThe relief, the joy, the satisfaction, the pure elation. Gary Neville's \"ooOoaaAaaaAAARGH\" he was almost like a Chelsea fan in that moment. I think a lot of neutrals were. \n\nWinning the final and how we did it was something special too and obviously all the significance of us actually winning our first Champion League. But that semi final was unique in my feelings and memories as a Chelsea fan and has a very special place for me.",
            "Interesting \nWhat were ur other two top 2 games ?\n\nU are so lucky to experience that live",
            "The penalty in this game was a dive by cesc, pure dive. Didier did have a rush of blood to the head both times lunging in but thankfully Messi hit the bar in this one and petr saved from arjen in the final. Written in the stars. \n\nI can't imagine your experience actually being there for that. My head exploded just listening to it on the radio at home haha. I think those 2 games are my favourite ever moments as a Chelsea fan. KTBFFH",

He could look amazing at times at Ajax in the Champions League, but the step up to the Premier League and having to perform multiple times a week at a certain level was too much for him unfortunately.. We\u2019ve got glimpses, but they were never enough to justify starting him weekly",
