            "Newcastle were ready to sell Gordon to Liverpool but the deal is off. If Gordon is available, Isak is as well. Who knew PSR deadline day is going to be more fun than the actual one",
            "Nizaar reckons the Arsenal sell-on clause for Omari Hutchinson is 15%. So they get \u00a33 mil and we get \u00a317 mil. Seems fair to me.\n\nOur new sell-on clause is 25%.",
            "I woke up and I see two different news on KDH and Chelsea. One of the reasons I hate the transfer windows(I know it's technically not even open) with this new management. Nearly every single transfer rumor seems to get leaked.",
            "Newcastle have until Sunday to sort out their PSR issues, the great thing about the Isak news is we\u2019ll get an answer soon.",
            "One omari in and one omari out, which fofana will be THE fofana for us",
            "As much as Clearlake deserve scrutiny, I\u2019m so glad we didn\u2019t end up with Brexit Jim as owner\n\nAll his C-suite decisions point to someone who\u2019s wholly out of touch",
            "At the point where I'm excited for the next season, but also so damn tired of no damn stability ever\n\nI hope in the next 2-3 years we hit jackpot on more players like Palmer and build something worthy of being Chelsea",
            "Ugarte leaving PSG after one season. Thank you for giving us Caicedo. \n\nAlso De Ligt is available but astronomic wages.",

            "If Alonso took a free kick, it was on target.  The football heritage in this man's blood was real.",
            "Easy to forget how good he was down that left side",
            "So the pov is watching alonso highlights?",
            "It\u2019s Amazing the hate he got, but now he\u2019s left he\u2019s getting nothing but love. I always rated him",
            "Just proves the point that people are easy to start hating players who are here for years. Especially when they were really successful. Alonso got a looooot of hate in his last 2 years here. Same goes with Ivanovi\u0107, seeing current players and looking back to old ones,now they look even better than I thought. Disrespect was crazy. \n\nAlso it\u2019s weird people are fast to bash legends when they are out form, but they give a lot of pass to a big fee signings. Should be other way around.",
            "Wdym what could've been? He won the CL, PL and Europa League. What more could there have been lol",
            "On my FM save I was fucked for striking options and he was available for like 250k so I popped a cheeky bid in with the intention of brining him back to the Bridge and playing him up front. Bastard signed for some Qatari club instead lol",
            "How perfect he\u2019d have been for that chilwell LW experiment Poch ran early last season :/",
            "He wasn't \"born to be a striker\".\n\nThere's a difference between box crashing as a fullback and playing up front where the CBs are taking care of you."

            "He will grow more and more under his supervision.",
            "Does this mean Palmer on the wing rather than at the 10, because he is so so much more dangerous on the wing, it feels like such a waste when he's playing the 10",
            "Palmer on the wings all day long, unless he has caicedo and gallagher behind, he lacks that defensive contribution to balance a team.",
            "Even when Cole played centrally, he would always drift right and overload the right side with Noni.  Whether he plays centrally or right will make no difference cause he's equally as effective in both positions",
            "Oh look marsesca is a tatically adept coach, probably know more than most of us in this sub unlike poch.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter where he plays on paper - he plays in the right half space. If he plays right, you need someone to overlap him, if he start 10/8 you still need a right sided player",
            "The sub assured me that Cole was better centrally and that\u2019s where he would happily play once Olise got here.",
            "Might be a dumb question but has Maresca started the job or not yet? When do the players usually return back to training before preseason?",
