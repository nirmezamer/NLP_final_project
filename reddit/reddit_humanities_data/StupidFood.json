        "content": "---\n\n&nbsp;    \n\n###Introduction\n\nDear readers old and new, welcome to /r/StupidFood.\n\nPlease take the time to have a look around and get to know the place.\n\n**History** : We have been here since spring 2015, although our slightly younger friends over at /r/WeWantPlates have thoroughly outgrown us. What started as a silly idea has morphed into a decent small sub that has regular influxes of subscribers whenever we get namechecked on /r/food or elsewhere. It is the brainchild of /u/Clackpot.\n\n**Content** : Feel free to post your own Stupid Food without worrying too much about quality, if it isn't good enough it'll drop off the front page and we'll all move on. There is no shame in unsuccessful posts.\n\n**Behaviour** : This sub is explicitly both partial and prejudiced, but nevertheless tolerance and consideration are required. Don't get too carried away. Insults and flaming are acceptable as long as they are creative, funny, imaginative, or otherwise thoughtful; but being shallow, boring, unoriginal, or derivative are cardinal sins.\n\n&nbsp;    \n\n\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;    \n\n\n\n###Our philosophy, and the elusive sidebar\n\nFrom time to time there has been some confusion about what exactly this sub is for. The sidebar explains it all in some detail.\n\nRemember, **/r/StupidFood does NOT try to be fair or impartial** in its efforts to poke fun. We will ridicule and scoff at whatever targets we choose, without first asking whether it is justified.\n\nBut many of you will be reading on mobile clients, blissfully unaware of our sub's sidebar and how that describes its ethos. Some of you may even be reading on desktop, *still* blissfully unaware of the sidebar, despite it being just over there ---->\n\nSo, **read the bloody sidebar!** On mobile you may need to click an icon such as an 'i' in a circle. In particular, pay  attention to this comment tucked away under the 'YOUR RIGHT TO TAKE OFFENCE' heading :-\n\n> ###/r/StupidFood is intended to be a somewhat puerile place to poke fun at other people's creativity, ***without regard to whether they deserve it***.\n\nThis is important! Do not expect the court of /r/StupidFood to be a just one. It is here to vent spleens and spout prejudices. It is not meant to be true or fair. It will cheerfully ignore the facts in pursuit of a cheap gag.\n\n&nbsp;    \n\n---\n\n&nbsp;    \n\n###Regarding moderation\n\nThis sub has a light-touch approach, preferring that most moderation be performed by subscribers voting items onto or off the front page.\n\n**Removal:** Items may be removed if they are wholly irrelevant, spam, grossly rude or inflammatory, or for any other reason the mods don't like. Posts which are merely low quality will not be removed.\n\n**Subreddit rules**: [Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/StupidFood/about/rules/) will be added and amended as and when required. Please look at them.\n\n**Bans and suspensions:** May be dispensed for anyone with no interest in the sub's welfare; for crap bots; and anyone else failing to be part of the community. Other contributors will have to try *really* hard to earn themselves a suspension or even permanent ban. /r/StupidFood does not subscribe to big stick policing.\n\n**Overturning decisions:** We're not perfect, we'll get it wrong from time to time. Please [message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FStupidFood) if you feel a decision is wrong or over the top and it will be reviewed.\n\n&nbsp;    \n\n---\n\n^(*/u/Clackpot*, last updated 30th October 2017)\n\n&nbsp;    \n\n\n",

            "PLEASE ban Rick Lax videos and others following his rage-bait formula! They very clearly fall under the \"spam\" category in the sub rules and I think it's pretty safe to say that everyone here is sick of that shit. \n\nIf you don't recognize the name Rick Lax, you will definitely recognize the formula. A model in yoga pants makes something gross, wasteful, and unsanitary in an LA mansion, while the person filming acts amazed and not at all disgusted. Remember that toilet ice cream cocktail video? That's the shit I'm talking about and it needs to stop.",

            "Don't know if this is the right place to ask but did the subreddit ban those over the top ChefClub videos? Feels like ages since I've seen one posted and it stopped around the time I saw people asking for it to be banned.",
            "Lately there\u2019s been an influx of uninformed ppl submitting \u201cstupid cooking\u201d videos that turn out to have more cultural meaning than first glance. Can there be a way to tag those or something? A bit insulting to tag cultural cooking as stupid when OPs are just not informed.",
            "Can we revisit the Chefs Club topic? Perhaps if we are not open to banning the videos we could create a flair. It's oversaturating the sub and is intentionally making stupid food to gain traction.",
            "Thank",
            "Can we get rid of the creepy fetish stuff",
            "im surprised this only had 2 comments before me",
            "Okay so I'm new, but if I check out \"new\" it seems like most of the people posting here are r/lostredditors who should really be posting on r/shittyfoodporn.   Just because you made an anemic looking dish using processed ingredients doesn't mean your food is stupid, it's just bad.\n\nI'm cool with the hands-off approach to moderating (overmoderation ruins many humour subs), but wanted to check if this is the kind of thing that *technically* falls under the rule of \"missing the point\" of the sub, or just something that the sub is used to and decides to ignore since these posts will get downvoted anyways?  Basically, would reporting these just annoy people or should I be doing it when I see it?",
            "I have a suggestion (not sure if this is the right place): That posters be required to leave a \"starter comment\", in which they provide some context as to why their post belongs on \"Stupid Food\".\n\nI've noticed a lot of posts where the majority of comments are just people asking why something is stupid, with no cohesive answer, and I think holding OPs responsible for explaining why something is stupid would lead to higher quality posts and discussions.\n\nCheers!"
