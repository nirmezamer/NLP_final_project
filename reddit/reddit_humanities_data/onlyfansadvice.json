        "content": "Following on from [my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/onlyfansadvice/comments/1bpvdij/12_things_every_of_creator_can_relate_to_which/) yesterday, the feedback was very positive so I will be going ahead with the new flairs for creators who are in the top 2.5% and above.    \n    \n**This will be split into two tiers:**    \n    \n\u2b50\ufe0f Established creator \u2b50\ufe0f    \nThe requirements for this flair will be that you are between 0.9 -2.5%    \n  \n\n\ud83c\udfc6 Top creator \ud83c\udfc6    \nTop creators are required to be 0.8% and below.    \n    \nSome people pointed out that there is a large jump between incomes for someone say 2.5% compared to 0.9% or 0.8% to 0.08% etc. This is true however for the purpose of not overcomplicating things, I think these tiers adequately get across whether someone is making a very decent income on onlyfans and those that are far exceeding a standard income. It's also worth considering that not everyone wants others to know their exact % or income. If individual creators wish to disclose their specific % or income they can do so.    \n    \n**How to verify for one of the new creator flairs:**   \n\n\n1. Fit the requirements stated above\n2. Add the emojis \u2b50\ufe0f\ud83c\udfc6 to the end of your onlyfans bio. (This can be removed once verified).\n3. Write the day's date on a piece of paper along with r/onlyfansadvice and your reddit username. Scrunch the paper up then flatten it out again. Hold the piece of paper up and take 2 photos, one facing the camera and one in profile. Nudity is of course not required, however if you are a faceless creator it must be clear that you are the same person as in your content. \n4. Create a screen recording that shows you going from your onlyfans profile, navigating to statements from the side bar then showing the statements page with the %. Please do not make any cuts or edits to this.  \n5. Upload the photos and screen recording to imgur (or redgifs if NSFW).\n6. Send a [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fonlyfansadvice) containing you onlyfans link and the imgur link to your selfies and screen recording.\n\nI will let you know once the flair has been assigned.    \n    \nPlease comment below if you have any questions.  \n\n\n&#x200B;",

I\u2019ve considered lowering my sub price but I\u2019m worried I will regret it..
