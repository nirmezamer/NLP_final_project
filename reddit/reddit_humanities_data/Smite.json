Because it\u2019s cool to utilize crit and atkspd on her for experimentation but it pointless building strength on her. Her autos feel NICE now with the passive but it\u2019s a shame that she\u2019ll most likely only be practical w magic items.\n\nNeiths sound effects sound really bad compared to smite 1s honestly.\n\nPerformance wasn\u2019t too bad in my experience, my biggest gripe is that certain abilities lack oomph or impact on hit in terms of feed back. Like Hecates 2 could use a better visual queue for it getting stronger and the landing strike just doesn\u2019t feel satisfying imo.",

But it doesn\u2019t let you move left or right with the D pad you have to press a bumper while on the god icon then you can hover over the abilities with the D pad this just needs to be fixed so that controller players can press up on the D pad to bring up abilities then left or right on the D pad to cycle through the info.\n\nI'm on PC btw",

These changes will probably end laning phases much quicker due to how risky it will be to sit in a lane.",

Food for thought.",
            "I get that they're trying to avoid the flack of just making smite again but rereleasing it as smite 2 but imo they really don't need to do that and it really can just be a straight upgrade to smite without needing to change every random aspect of it.\n\nWhy change the no. Of wards? Who complains about that? Why change all the relics and the like to instead be replaced by active items? I like the way it works in smite and that it's different from other mobas. Honestly, while I'm kinda hyped to see the full release eventually I'm not massively excited by the non-graphics and balancing based changes",
            "Yeah it\u2019s a big issue for me with smite 2, I see what others have said, I do like the smoother gameplay when there aren\u2019t various issues, I like the intelligence/strength change, but I really fucking like smite 1\u2019s warding and relic systems. I hate the active system, I dislike having one ward on a long cooldown, I don\u2019t like the removal of various item types, I\u2019m not a big fan of the smaller feeling conquest map in smite 2. I don\u2019t like that I can\u2019t premake builds, or have options for which abilities are on instant/normal cast.\n\nI assumed these would be things they would implement and fix down the line but I\u2019m really starting to wonder if they\u2019re gonna just force the community to live with their ideas.",

Now it just seems like they are throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks.",
            "I think the Base Ward everyone gets needs to have two charges by default, but start with one on cooldown and then upgrade them to either Eye of Providence making them Sentries or Bracer of Brilliance from Smite 1, both would replace the default ward rather than being an item slot.",
            "it should be 2 before cooldown at least. Any decent player buys 2 wards in 1",
            "They're trying to ensure everyone in the game wards. In Smite I'm sick to death of players not warding, it's everyones responsibility."
