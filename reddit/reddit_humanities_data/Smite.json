The answer is nothing but like, yikes.\n\nWishing death upon people, saying kys, running it down. Like I get HiRez is some nebulous company but its a shame that they sort of feed this behavior.\n\nIts only been happening more and more since the revert, more FFs over some dude getting pissy over first blood. A minute or less into the game sometimes. \n\nPlayed 10 games, 8 had someone saying crazy stuff or admitting to feeding so we lose. I know people are fragile but damn."

Aside from being generic and visually unappealing, it is very awkward to use. Its essentially a lame mishmash of Heras Divine Shroud and Aphrodites Back Off (they shouldve just kept Traverse Worlds). I still find Spell Eater to be generic with a disappointing recast animation, but at least it has a unique mechanic. What are some other thoughts on Hecate?"

These changes will probably end laning phases much quicker due to how risky it will be to sit in a lane.",

Food for thought.",
            "I get that they're trying to avoid the flack of just making smite again but rereleasing it as smite 2 but imo they really don't need to do that and it really can just be a straight upgrade to smite without needing to change every random aspect of it.\n\nWhy change the no. Of wards? Who complains about that? Why change all the relics and the like to instead be replaced by active items? I like the way it works in smite and that it's different from other mobas. Honestly, while I'm kinda hyped to see the full release eventually I'm not massively excited by the non-graphics and balancing based changes",
            "Yeah its a big issue for me with smite 2, I see what others have said, I do like the smoother gameplay when there arent various issues, I like the intelligence/strength change, but I really fucking like smite 1s warding and relic systems. I hate the active system, I dislike having one ward on a long cooldown, I dont like the removal of various item types, Im not a big fan of the smaller feeling conquest map in smite 2. I dont like that I cant premake builds, or have options for which abilities are on instant/normal cast.\n\nI assumed these would be things they would implement and fix down the line but Im really starting to wonder if theyre gonna just force the community to live with their ideas.",
            "Plus you can't see the coverage of your ward. in Smite 1 you could see exactly what your ward covered in blue on the minimap. You can no longer see that in Smite 2.",
            "Im gonna be honest, I dont really like smite two. It just a more complicated smite one. I know its in alpha and its not a finished product but I honestly would have been ok with just an updated engine smite. Just a personal opinion, you dont gotta agree.",
            "No wards and jungle is OP? That's just standard smite.",
            "it should be 2 before cooldown at least. Any decent player buys 2 wards in 1",
            "The more I read about Smite2 the more Im wondering if they are just making it up as they go. \n\nNot feeling very optimistic about this game any more, it sounded like they had everything planned out when they announced it. Now it just seems like they are throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks.",
            "I think the Base Ward everyone gets needs to have two charges by default, but start with one on cooldown and then upgrade them to either Eye of Providence making them Sentries or Bracer of Brilliance from Smite 1, both would replace the default ward rather than being an item slot.",
            "They're trying to ensure everyone in the game wards. In Smite I'm sick to death of players not warding, it's everyones responsibility."
