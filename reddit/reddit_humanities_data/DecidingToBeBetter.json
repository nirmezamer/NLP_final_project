            "**Just a few of my thoughts on deciding to be better.** To better personal living you have to discover competence to take charge. In life we have inner coaches, counselors, etc that help us to accomplish things in life. We likewise have helpful authorities in the world who will take the time to help those who find it hard to help themselves. You've a lot of options and resources available to you.\n\nCompetency is earned. An individual with competence will take what they learn and utilize it to solve different states of affairs in their life. A competent individual always sees the new light at the end of every tunnel.\n\nWhen an individual has competence, he or she feels joyous. A joyous individual will consider every incident, experience and so forth in life as something they may learn from; as well this individual won't allow bad weight him or her down. The individual will take the bad; see new light and continue learning from his or her errors.\n\nYou'll have to learn how to suspend judgments of self and other people. You're not the Man in control. Only one spiritual being has the right to call judgment down on anybody. Let this Man take the weight on His shoulders. You might need to pray often to cease judging self and other people.\n\nIt's ok to have views, but when you don't have facts to support your claims, why speak. Too many times individuals suspect, offer opinions, speculate, or jump to conclusions, which has caused major issues in the world. If you don't have facts behind you, or to support what you say, be quiet. Allow somebody else in the world to make the next error.\n\nIf you wish to live happier, you'll need to build your energy. To build energy you'll need to eat right, exercise and take great care of you. You'll need to associate with positive individuals and learn to help others as well as yourself. The more effort you put forth, the more you'll get back from your efforts.",

I see moderating as an opportunity for me to \"serve\", helping others has always given me energy and helped me learn whether that be in work settings or on sports teams. \n\n  \n2.

This involved moderation as well as building/growing the community.   \n3. Are you willing to use the r/toolbox extension?  \nI've never heard of it but I don't see it being a problem. I'll do a quick dive on it after this for my own sanity that it isn't malware/spyware.   \n4. Are you willing to communicate in a moderator Discord?  \nYes!  \n5. Spending about 10 minutes a day, or less, can get most of the usual work done. Is this manageable for you?  \nNot a problem at all, that sounds like the perfect amount of time to not get overwhelmed and sustain ongoing effort.   \n6. Do you have any ideas for improvement of the community?  \n7. Without taking our current rules into consideration, how do you feel about self promotion on r/DecidingToBeBetter?\n\nI feel that anything that can add value to a person seeking help has it's place. That being said, unwanted spam and adding noise can impact a community so balance or organization should be considered. \n\n  \n8. Are you willing to suggest new ideas and help improve current ones?\n\nAbsolutely. That's part of my motivation to do this. \n\n  \n9. How many days of the week are you available to be consulted? / How fast do you typically respond to messages?\n\nNot sure how extensive a consultation would be, but if this is within that 10 mins daily then 4-6 days a week is doable. M-F during the day of EST I can respond pretty quickly, otherwise I would give myself a few hours up to 24 hrs. \n\n  \n10. Why is self improvement important to you?\n\nI've naturally been drawn to this from a young age. I believe because much of the content has an encouraging tone which attracted me especially at a younger age. Now I think that it's a mix of my purpose/goal in life to continuously improve. I agree with Tony Robbins that Progress is what makes us feel alive, thriving and have true moments of happiness. And at a larger scale if you improve yourself you will have more capacity to help others and make the world a better place. \n\n  \n11. What are 3 important qualities in a moderator?\n\nEmpathy, Leadership, Vibes Management\n\n  \n12. Do you work well in a team?\n\nI believe so, but that's probably  a question best answered by my team members lol. But in my opinion yes! In my experience with team sports, sports clubs, closeness to my extended family and having good relationships with my coworkers and even ex coworkers is a testament to this. Not to mention I've been working remotely for 6 years.",

Do you have any ideas for improvement of the community?\nI think it's already nurturing many people and is at its optimum performance level. The best thing is that it doesn't really need any improvement ideas as long as the members are improving themselves and are socially helping.\n\n7. Without taking our current rules into consideration, how do you feel about self promotion on /r/DecidingToBeBetter?\nI think the subreddit is for a purpose higher than one individual self or advertisement or anything like that.\n\n8. Are you willing to suggest new ideas and help improve current ones?\nYes, I am as far as I can.\n\n9. How many days of the week are you available to be consulted? / How fast do you typically respond to messages?\nI'm available all days. I usually respond under 1-10 hours.\n\n10. Why is self improvement important to you?\nIt's a way of life.\n\n11. What are 3 important qualities in a moderator?\nAnalytical skills, Acceptance and being open to new ideas, Cooperation.\n\n12.

        "content": "\nHi. I\u2019m 19(F) and I\u2019ve been working on getting my teeth fixed after years of neglecting to brush my teeth due to my depression. I\u2019ve struggled with depression for many years now, since I was 13/14 and the last couple of years have been the hardest years of my life. One of the most difficult parts of it was struggling to take care of myself and my daily hygiene, showering, and brushing my teeth. I always felt so drained and could never get myself to get the energy to go take a shower and brush my teeth. Brushing my teeth was more difficult for me though.\n\nObviously, over time my teeth started to get really bad, and had cavities on all my front teeth. I became very self-conscious because of my teeth and smiling was one of my biggest insecurities. but the last year or so, I finally decided I wanted to try and improve myself and push myself to take care of my teeth and get myself to a dentist. I was also getting some pain whenever I would eat certain foods and it was painful whenever I did try to brush. So I really had to do something before it got even worse. \n\nSince then I\u2019ve been working on taking care of myself better and I\u2019ve been doing a lot better with brushing my teeth every day. The dentist I\u2019ve been going to has been incredible, very kind, and understanding, and helped me feel comfortable through each appointment I\u2019ve had along with giving me the laughing gas which helped too. At first, I was terrified of going and terrified I\u2019d waited too long and lost my teeth but thankfully I didn\u2019t. \n\nAround September of 2023, I had my first appointment to get my teeth looked at along with some X-rays, and then have two deep clean appointments for each side of my mouth. I spent time with my family in another state for a few months and began my filling appointments when I got back. Since late March I\u2019ve been doing a lot of filling appointments. They started with some smaller cavities in the back and for the last couple of weeks they\u2019ve been working on my front teeth and just had my final filling appointment for my front teeth a few days ago. My teeth are finally fixed!\n\nMy teeth have been looking so much better now and have improved so much. I only have a few more appointments and I\u2019m finally done! I have to get a back tooth removed and a small cavity in the very back filled and then after that I\u2019m done for a while. They did say that I\u2019ll need root canals and crowns sometime in the future but thankfully not right now. But after so many years of struggling and months of dental work, I\u2019ve finally gotten my smile back and this is the most I\u2019ve ever felt proud of myself. \n\nI\u2019ve also been doing so much better with brushing my teeth and flossing every day. While I\u2019m working on it, I\u2019m also doing better with showering more often as well. While I still often feel drained and feel like I have no energy I still try to push myself hard to take care of myself better and keep up with my daily hygiene. And now that my smile is back maybe this is a sign I\u2019m starting to heal and begin recovering from my depression. While my depression still often lingers and comes in waves I hope to get to recovery someday. I often wonder if It will ever go away for me but I hope for it someday. \n",

        "content": "I (32F) have had a shitty life. I was born to 2 mentally ill parents who were the least successful & poorest out of their siblings. Since childhood, I was miserable. I was bullied for being asian throughout childhood when my mom moved us to a predominately white, rich, privileged area.. She was poor & spent all her money for us to live there. I was brought up with no good role models and had no social skills as a child. I had to learn how to be social on my own & have fucked up a lot. I dated men who were terribly abusive towards me.. I lost my virginity to a rape & also caught herpes. My entire life has felt like a struggle.\n\nMy dad committed suicide 2 yrs ago and I felt like aside from me, nobody in my shitty family was really affected by it. I feel like his sisters and their kids have always looked down on us.  I also lost all my things when I put most of my stuff in a storage unit with a messed up door. Basically everyone is rich and privileged in my family aside from my immediate family. I\u2019ve been surrounded by rich, snobby ppl who weren\u2019t inclusive. My cousins are all half white and had everything handed to them b/c their parents were rich. I don't want to feel jealous about it, but I am/ hate that they have all these connections, privilege, and wealth and that I have had to struggle so much whereas they haven't had to.. So I distance myself from my family. I love my grandma who's in her 90s, but whenever she tells me about my cousins & the fancy lives they get to live b/c their parents are super rich, it gets on my nerves. I feel like I talk to her less because I am tired of hearing about it. My dad didn't get along with his siblings growing up so we never became close to any of those ppl.. I've never felt a real connection with them-- they're from a different world than me and it makes me uncomfortable. I come from a strict, stuck up, tough love kinda family that is boring and prioritizes work and making money over everything else. I hope to have my own family one day-- a family that will laugh and have fun together.\n\nI know the only person I am hurting by resenting my family is myself. But I hate them. I find that I complain about them to my friends a lot. Hearing about them from grandma makes me feel insecure. I feel conflicted-- I love my grandma and want a close relationship with her. But she's also treasured by my rich extended relatives who do not care about me. I\u2019ve had instances where I wanted to spend a holiday with her, but they invited her & not me. I don\u2019t want to compete for her attention either. \n\nI have been in therapy basically my entire adulthood. I also see a psychiatrist for my adhd/insomnia.\n\n",

            "personally, i say embrace the anger, channel it into spite, and then use it as motivation to do things that empower yourself: take self-defence classes, get first aid training, do a sport or other kind of exercise you enjoy. look into philosophy and follow concepts that inspire you. use this language to help yourself clearly define what you truly value in life. then, build your goals and plans around those values.\n\nyou could exhaust yourself and burn out your soul pursuing a favourable comparison with your extended family, and you wouldn't be happy for it \u2014 nor would they be impressed. i think you know that already. also, how wealthy you end up is mostly down to luck. it's more sensible to prioritize what matters to you and strive for it. you'll be able to look at their vacation pictures and know in your heart you spent that time doing something you actually found meaningful.\n\nthat being said, if the feeling of resentment is eating you, you need to express it. my advice is get a journal (digital or traditional) and write, write, write about it. then eat a big meal and go to bed. that's just as helpful as a productive therapy session imo.",

I\u2019m in the same situation, with family members on both sides who live these privileged cushy lives while me and my husband have had to work for every little thing we have due to our parents being low on the totem pole/bad with money/having mental health problems. We are so blessed, but it is hard to be unwillingly thrust into the awareness of the imbalances all the time. I was raised with zero social skills too, and didn\u2019t really start to figure out how to get along in the world until I was in my early thirties.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMy random idea, take it or leave it, is to see if your extended family might have a door or connection for you that you might not have considered to help you improve your own life and feel better about yourself/at least get some momentum. With rich people, you kind of have to play their game sometimes, but if you can keep your head above water, and learn how to behave, the connections can pay off.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI just really hope you start to see yourself in a better light.

I read something recently I\u2019m still digesting. The gist is to learn to love the bad and painful things that happened to you because when you \u201cdecide to be better,\u201d it\u2019s these things that will become assets to you in your development. If they didn\u2019t love you the way you wanted to be loved, you learn to fill that void by loving yourself. That love for yourself is infinitely more stable and meaningful than the love these people would have given you, by the sound of it."

That I don\u2019t deserve love. That my partner should go find someone else because of who I am and what I\u2019ve done. ",

            "I suffer with rumination from OCD, something I heard recently and I\u2019ve been repeating to myself when I notice I\u2019m in that cycle:\nDon\u2019t worry about what you might have done, worry about what you CAN do.",
            "Yeah you\u2019ve done terrible things. Maybe said some hurtful words, made someone feel uncomfortable, caused a problem for someone in the moment. But did you kill anyone? Did you hurt someone so bad to the point where they will suffer for the rest of their life? If not, then you have nothing to worry about. If you did, I\u2019m sure you probably wouldn\u2019t be here posting to Reddit. \n\nYou\u2019ve changed. And you\u2019re here, taking the first step towards change. Don\u2019t let your past define who you  are now. It\u2019s not always about how you start, but instead about how you finish",
            "Don't be sorry, be better, that's why you're posting here, so good job taking the first step. In another comment you said you don't act that way any more, and that is essential, but is there anything you could do to atone and earn your own forgiveness? What would that look like? Can you heal the harm you've caused, or make it right, directly or indirectly?",
            "If a friend of yours came to you and told you that they messed up in the same way that you did, what would you say to them?\nWould you tell them they deserve to suffer their whole life? That they don't deserve to be loved?\nI think not. ShiftIng perspective can help. Treat yourself like you would a friend.",
            "What did you do exactly?",
            "Yes would you she\u2019d light on that?",
            "Try to forgive yourself by changing your behavior to counter the past. PLEASE. I WAS LIKE THIS AND IT SABOTAGED MY RELATIONSHIP.",
            "We can only be forgiven by others and by ourselves if we truly change , soooo do that. Read Emily Post Etiquette , listen to the unabridged audio all day every day until you memorize it.",
            "Forgive yourself. If you're still in touch with anyone whom you have wronged, ask for their forgiveness. Now you just be the new and improved you. Simple.",
            "I feel like go to therapy to always self reflect and get guidance on what I can do better."
