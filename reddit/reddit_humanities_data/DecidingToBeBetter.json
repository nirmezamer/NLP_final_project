            "1. Why do you want to be a moderator?\n\nI want to be a moderator because self help/development has been a big part of my life for as long as I can remember so I have an interest and knowledge in the space. I see moderating as an opportunity for me to \"serve\", helping others has always given me energy and helped me learn whether that be in work settings or on sports teams. \n\n  \n2. Do you have moderation experience? If so, what did/do you do?  \nI was a community manager in Discord for a vibrant community of thousands. This involved moderation as well as building/growing the community.   \n3. Are you willing to use the r/toolbox extension?  \nI've never heard of it but I don't see it being a problem. I'll do a quick dive on it after this for my own sanity that it isn't malware/spyware.   \n4. Are you willing to communicate in a moderator Discord?  \nYes!  \n5. Spending about 10 minutes a day, or less, can get most of the usual work done. Is this manageable for you?  \nNot a problem at all, that sounds like the perfect amount of time to not get overwhelmed and sustain ongoing effort.   \n6. Do you have any ideas for improvement of the community?  \n7. Without taking our current rules into consideration, how do you feel about self promotion on r/DecidingToBeBetter?\n\nI feel that anything that can add value to a person seeking help has it's place. That being said, unwanted spam and adding noise can impact a community so balance or organization should be considered. \n\n  \n8. Are you willing to suggest new ideas and help improve current ones?\n\nAbsolutely. That's part of my motivation to do this. \n\n  \n9. How many days of the week are you available to be consulted? / How fast do you typically respond to messages?\n\nNot sure how extensive a consultation would be, but if this is within that 10 mins daily then 4-6 days a week is doable. M-F during the day of EST I can respond pretty quickly, otherwise I would give myself a few hours up to 24 hrs. \n\n  \n10. Why is self improvement important to you?\n\nI've naturally been drawn to this from a young age. I believe because much of the content has an encouraging tone which attracted me especially at a younger age. Now I think that it's a mix of my purpose/goal in life to continuously improve. I agree with Tony Robbins that Progress is what makes us feel alive, thriving and have true moments of happiness. And at a larger scale if you improve yourself you will have more capacity to help others and make the world a better place. \n\n  \n11. What are 3 important qualities in a moderator?\n\nEmpathy, Leadership, Vibes Management\n\n  \n12. Do you work well in a team?\n\nI believe so, but that's probably  a question best answered by my team members lol. But in my opinion yes! In my experience with team sports, sports clubs, closeness to my extended family and having good relationships with my coworkers and even ex coworkers is a testament to this. Not to mention I've been working remotely for 6 years.",

Do you have any ideas for improvement of the community?\nI think it's already nurturing many people and is at its optimum performance level. The best thing is that it doesn't really need any improvement ideas as long as the members are improving themselves and are socially helping.\n\n7. Without taking our current rules into consideration, how do you feel about self promotion on /r/DecidingToBeBetter?\nI think the subreddit is for a purpose higher than one individual self or advertisement or anything like that.\n\n8.

How many days of the week are you available to be consulted? / How fast do you typically respond to messages?\nI'm available all days. I usually respond under 1-10 hours.\n\n10.

        "content": "Hi,\n\nWell, of course life has started... what I mean is I don't feel like I've started living the life I want. These thoughts aren't new, but they resurface every now and then, and hit with a little more intensity as I get older and I worry the door might be closing on opportunities.\n\nIt might be helpful to summarise my life up to now, because I think it's relevant. I'll keep it as brief as I can...\n\n>Primary school (4-11): hated it and was bullied a lot. Only really had one friend there and spent most of my time outside school alone reading about things that interested me. My parents loved and supported me but didn't love each other. There was a lot of arguing as well as silent tension throughout my childhood.\n\n>High school (11-18): still bullied but had a small group of good friends who made it bearable and sometimes enjoyable. Very motivated by my career goals so worked hard and got good grades.\n\n>University (18-20): did not go well. I was extremely lonely and didn't do well academically, both of which came as a shock. Still bullied. I was diagnosed with depression and took a year out to stay with my parents and work while I figured out what to do next. Decided to try the same course at a different university.\n\n>University (20-24): actually started off brilliantly. Met some great people and got good grades. This changed overnight when I didn't adjust well to a sudden but permanent health condition, and became suicidal. I didn't know what to do so just focused on making it though to the next day and keeping up with my studies as best I could. I deliberately isolated myself because seeing my peers have a nice time just made it harder to bear. Made it through but lost all my friends.\n\n>Post uni (24-28ish): no longer suicidal, but felt numb and lonely and unable to engage with the world. The coping strategies I'd developed weren't serving me well and I struggled with work life balance. In hindsight I was still suffering from depression although didn't acknowledge it at the time. I did startup type jobs (interesting work but long hours, high stress, low job security and low pay) which wasn't great, but much better than studying and things slowly improved.\n\n>28-31: started doing better, to the point I felt able to meet people. Joined a hiking group and made some good friends. Also started dating (mostly unsuccessfully, but still). Felt generally optimistic about life finally starting to go in the direction I wanted. The best period in my adult life so far.\n\n>31-32: I ended up in a relationship with someone from the hiking group just before covid. Circumstances forced her to move in with me over lockdown (or so she told me at the time). She turned out to be abusive. The whole thing had a serious impact on my mental and physical health and was a big setback.\n\n>32-now: primarily focused on looking after my health. I was diagnosed with depression and had feeling a sense of being stuck in limbo again. I was lonely as most of my friends are busy with kids and my hiking group became off limits. I tried other groups and picked up new hobbies and sports, but going through the motions with a facade because my authentic self was not in a good place inevitably made it hard to connect with people. I've struggled with work stress, burnout and related health problems but am reluctant to uproot the most secure part of my life and add financial worries to the pile when it might not be the cause of my problems.\n\nI hope this hasn't come across as too self-pitying, that's not my intention. Of course there have been good times and things to appreciate, I've had a few nice holidays and close friendships which I'm grateful for. And I'm not necessarily lamenting missing my chance to have wild parties, sleep around, etc, because (as much as I might want to enjoy it) that's not me, and I wouldn't have found my people that way.\n\nBut I do wish I'd travelled more, met more people, had more relationships, and generally lived a richer life. I know I'm still young(ish) and that \"it's never too late\", and I intend to keep doing what I can to start having these experiences. But our sense of self is shaped by our memories, and I do worry about who that makes me. Having a particularly bad time in my formative years does feel like a burden to carry, and I struggle to relate to people whose life hasn't centred around mental health challenges.\n\nTherapy has helped somewhat - I've realised a theme from a very young age is seeing my own needs as less important than those of others. I did have my own hopes and dreams in my teens, but they fell by the wayside when I started living in survival mode, to the point that I've almost forgotten what they are.\n\nThank you if you've read this far, I really appreciate it :) It helps to just share. But if you have any thoughts I'd love to hear them, particularly if any of this resonates with you.",

I spent most of my life online or stuck in my head, unable to get out of bed. \n\nI feel like I dont have a personality, that Ive lost all the hobbies and interests I once had and its too late to get them back. When someone asks me to tell them about myself I freeze and want to cry. Maybe the most interesting part about me is my medical history. \n\nI try taking some opportunities now, work random jobs, but I constantly feel like NOW is my absolute last chance and that Im running out of time to do fun things and develop any sense of self."

        "content": "\nHi. I\u2019m 19(F) and I\u2019ve been working on getting my teeth fixed after years of neglecting to brush my teeth due to my depression. I\u2019ve struggled with depression for many years now, since I was 13/14 and the last couple of years have been the hardest years of my life. One of the most difficult parts of it was struggling to take care of myself and my daily hygiene, showering, and brushing my teeth. I always felt so drained and could never get myself to get the energy to go take a shower and brush my teeth. Brushing my teeth was more difficult for me though.\n\nObviously, over time my teeth started to get really bad, and had cavities on all my front teeth. I became very self-conscious because of my teeth and smiling was one of my biggest insecurities. but the last year or so, I finally decided I wanted to try and improve myself and push myself to take care of my teeth and get myself to a dentist. I was also getting some pain whenever I would eat certain foods and it was painful whenever I did try to brush. So I really had to do something before it got even worse. \n\nSince then I\u2019ve been working on taking care of myself better and I\u2019ve been doing a lot better with brushing my teeth every day. The dentist I\u2019ve been going to has been incredible, very kind, and understanding, and helped me feel comfortable through each appointment I\u2019ve had along with giving me the laughing gas which helped too. At first, I was terrified of going and terrified I\u2019d waited too long and lost my teeth but thankfully I didn\u2019t. \n\nAround September of 2023, I had my first appointment to get my teeth looked at along with some X-rays, and then have two deep clean appointments for each side of my mouth. I spent time with my family in another state for a few months and began my filling appointments when I got back. Since late March I\u2019ve been doing a lot of filling appointments. They started with some smaller cavities in the back and for the last couple of weeks they\u2019ve been working on my front teeth and just had my final filling appointment for my front teeth a few days ago. My teeth are finally fixed!\n\nMy teeth have been looking so much better now and have improved so much. I only have a few more appointments and I\u2019m finally done! I have to get a back tooth removed and a small cavity in the very back filled and then after that I\u2019m done for a while. They did say that I\u2019ll need root canals and crowns sometime in the future but thankfully not right now. But after so many years of struggling and months of dental work, I\u2019ve finally gotten my smile back and this is the most I\u2019ve ever felt proud of myself. \n\nI\u2019ve also been doing so much better with brushing my teeth and flossing every day. While I\u2019m working on it, I\u2019m also doing better with showering more often as well. While I still often feel drained and feel like I have no energy I still try to push myself hard to take care of myself better and keep up with my daily hygiene. And now that my smile is back maybe this is a sign I\u2019m starting to heal and begin recovering from my depression. While my depression still often lingers and comes in waves I hope to get to recovery someday. I often wonder if It will ever go away for me but I hope for it someday. \n",
