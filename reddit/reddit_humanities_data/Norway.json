        "content": "Important warning: ***Reddit is not an appropriate place to get accurate immigration information.***\n\nHowever, this is a common topic on this subreddit and to help direct people to the proper information, I have updated the previous post to address the most common questions. Please read the entire guide and use the links provided to see out answers to your specific questions. *Any questions you may have that cannot be answered from this guide or the links provided cannot be answered by redditors on this sub* and should therefore be directed to an appropriate immigration expert.st\n\n**Disclaimer: I am not a professional; I neither work for UDI nor am I an immigration lawyer.** I do have an interest in immigration law and have spent a lot of time studying and researching the rules and regulations. What follows is a rough guide only meant to serve as a starting point for the average redditor. With that said:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# So You Want To Move To Norway....\n\nDespite what movies might portray, moving abroad is not just a matter of packing bags and showing up. Immigration is usually a long, often expensive process and there are many criteria that you must meet to be legally resident in Norway. There are three general categories of permits that will allow you to remain in Norway beyond a regular tourist/visitor visa:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|[**Temporary Residence Permit**](https://www.udi.no/en/word-definitions/temporary-residence-permit/)|This is your first step. These permits are contingent on you/your reference person meeting certain requirements; are usually temporary; and will need to be renewed (usually yearly, some last longer). You must have this permit if you wish to remain in Norway beyond your visitor visa\u2019s allowed time (ie: >90 days).|\n|:-|:-|\n|[**Permanent Residence Permit**](https://www.udi.no/en/word-definitions/permanent-residence-permit/)|This can be applied for only if you have been legally living in Norway for three years (or more in some instances) with a residence permit that forms the basis of permanent residency; you meet the language requirements; pass a citizenship test; have an income over a certain threshold; and you have not been convicted of a criminal offence. This allows you to stay in Norway permanently (no need to renew. Edit: to clarify. Your PR card will expire, but you do not need to reapply for this type of permit. Renewing the card is akin to renewing your passport. The renewal period is every 2 years for non-EEA citizens and 10 years for EEA citizens).|\n|[**Citizenship**](https://www.udi.no/en/want-to-apply/citizenship/?c=usa)|This is an optional step. You *do not need to apply for citizenship*; however, if you want to, you can qualify for Norwegian citizenship after a period of time (usually >7 years). This has many requirements, [but the biggest is the language requirement](https://www.udi.no/en/want-to-apply/citizenship/citizenship-for-people-who-hold-a-residence-permit-in-norway/?c=usa#link-579). **NB:** While Norway has now allowed dual citizenship, your country of origin may not allow dual citizenship. **NB:** Norway does not do Citizenship based on heritage. One or both of your parents need to have citizenship (and not have given it up previously) in order for you to qualify for citizenship based on birth. There are a lot of complicated rules surrounding citizenship by birth. [Use this to determine if you qualify for citizenship](https://www.udi.no/en/word-definitions/are-you-a-norwegian-citizen/?g=1&stb-for=n&c=usa). **NB:** according to UDI's website, Norway does not offer citizenship by investment (ie: having a lot of money to invest in exchange for residency or citizenship).|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe remainder of this post will focus on the first residence permit (#1) since by the time you are ready for 2 or 3 you will be an immigration pro. How you qualify for immigration to Norway and how easy the process will be depends on a few factors\n\n* Your citizenship (EEA/EU vs Third-Country National)\n* Your education, qualifications, experience,\n* If you have a job offer,\n* Your relationship with a Norwegian national.\n\n# Immigration as an EU/EEA citizen:\n\nIf you are an EU/EEA citizen (or Swiss) you have the right to reside in Norway for 3 months without any other obligations; after 3 months you will need to demonstrate that you are [meeting your treaty rights](https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=457). Those treaty obligations are:\n\n* Be employed (or registered as self-employed),\n* Be a student,\n* Be self-sufficient, or\n* Be a job seeker *actively seeking* work with a *decent* chance at finding work.\n\n**NB:** The last three require you to have **sufficient funds** to support yourself and your family and have **comprehensive medical insurance** for the duration of your stay.\n\nNote: sufficient funds in this scenario can come from any source including a third-country national's savings/income/other documented source (you may need to prove the sponsor has *access* to this money).\n\nThe right of residence for longer than three months *also extends to the EEA/EU citizen\u2019s immediate family* (spouse/partner, children, other dependents), *regardless of their nationality*, so long as the EU/EEA citizen is meeting their treaty obligations and neither the citizen nor the family member is a threat to public policy, security, or health. All of this is explained in the [Directive on Free Movement](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:158:0077:0123:en:PDF).\n\nIt is important to note that people immigrating under this route do not qualify for the benefits found in the [Introduction Law,](https://www.imdi.no/introduksjonsprogram/) which include, among other things, the right to free language lessons.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Immigrating as a Third-Country National (not from EU/EEA).\n\nI am using an applicant from the US as the default here. Your rules may vary slightly depending on your nationality.\n\nYour options for moving are not as simple or easy as above. You should consult [UDI](https://www.udi.no) (Norwegian Immigration Board) or the Norwegian Embassy in your country for the most up-to-date information for your specific nationality.\n\nGenerally speaking you *need a reason* to be in Norway. These reasons are:\n\n1. Family member of a Norwegian national\n2. Family member of an EEA/EU national\n3. A worker\n4. An [undergraduate](https://www.reddit.com/r/Norway/comments/4x3bjs/study_in_norway_in_english_bachelor_undergraduate/) or [graduate](https://www.reddit.com/r/Norway/comments/35mc9b/study_in_norway_masters_degree_programs/) student which has been discussed before. NOTE: As of 2023 it will most likely ***no longer be free for international students (outside of the EEA/EU) to study in Norway.*** Norway is looking to adopt tuition fees for such international students. Prices will be likely determined by the universities. As more information becomes available, this post will update.\n5. Protection [(Asylum seeker).](https://www.udi.no/en/want-to-apply/protection-asylum/protection-asylum-in-norway/) I will not spend time on this; it has its own complicated rules and I highly doubt anyone seeking asylum will be spending their time on reddit. If you are, I really recommend seeking out an immigration lawyer to help you with your application.\n\n# Family immigration with a Norwegian National\n\nThese are most often spouses/cohabitants, but may also include children or parents under some circumstances.\n\nThe process for application is relatively straightforward with a little bit of reading on UDI's website and some document gathering.\n\n1. You must pay the application fee,\n2. Document your identity (passport),\n3. Have a valid marriage licence/certificate,\n4. Have plans to live together in Norway,\n5. Not be in a [marriage of convenience](https://www.udi.no/en/word-definitions/circumvention-marriage-proforma-marriage/),\n6. You must both be over the age of 24,\n7. Your spouse/partner must make above a minimum income threshold per year pre-tax (this number frequently changes. Check UDI\u2019s site). They will need to demonstrate they made a sufficient amount the year before you apply and demonstrate that they are likely to have the same amount the following year. They will need to provide contract of employment, pay slips, and a tax assessment notice. Additionally, they must not have received financial assistance from NAV in the last 12 months.\n\nNote on income sources: under this route of family immigration, it is the onus of the sponsor to demonstrate that they make a sufficient income to support the family. This means that regardless of the financial situation, the sponsor must make the minimum income; the third-country national's income/savings are not taken into consideration in the majority of cases.\n\nThere are other circumstances that may require additional documentation (ie: evidence of military service). Check UDI for all the documents you'll need.\n\nFamily members who are granted residence based on this route will qualify for free language classes as part of the introduction act (link above).\n\n**NB**: the rules may change if you have lived with the Norwegian citizen legally in another EEA/EU country. If this is the case, you may be allowed to choose between family immigration under Norwegian national law or residence card as a family member of an EU citizen (see above). Also see the [differences between the two immigration schemes here](https://www.udi.no/en/word-definitions/the-difference-between-a-family-immigration-permit-and-a-residence-card/).\n\nIf you are engaged to a Norwegian you can apply for a *fianc\u00e9 permit* which will allow you to come into Norway for the purposes of getting married in Norway. You must be married within 6 months. After you are married you will have to apply for family immigration with your spouse (process described above). You can read about [getting married in Norway here](https://www.udi.no/en/word-definitions/getting-married-in-norway/#link-15054).\n\nOnly some people can apply from Norway. Others will have to apply from their home country via the embassy or consulate. Make sure you check with UDI to learn whether you need to apply from home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Workers\n\nThere are many types of working permits. [UDI\u2019s webpage](https://www.udi.no/en/want-to-apply/work-immigration/?c=usa) will outline all the possibilities available to you but the most common are [skilled worker](https://www.udi.no/en/want-to-apply/work-immigration/skilled-workers/) and [seasonal worker](https://www.udi.no/en/want-to-apply/work-immigration/seasonal-workers/?c=usa).\n\n**Skilled workers** are those who:\n\n* Completed a vocational training programme of at least three years at upper secondary school level. NB: there must be a corresponding training programme in Norway.\n* Completed a degree from a university or college (BA, BSc, BE, etc...)\n* Special qualifications that you have obtained through long work experience, if relevant in combination with courses etc. A permit is only granted in such cases in exceptional circumstances. Your qualifications must be equivalent to those of someone who has completed vocational training.\n\nAdditionally, you **must have received a concrete job offer** from an employer in Norway, the job must normally be full-time (UDI will, at the time of writing, accept 80%), the job must have the same pay/conditions that is normal in Norway, and the job you are offered must require the qualifications as a skilled worker (and you must be qualified for the job).\n\nIf you do not fall into this category, you may qualify as a seasonal worker; however this route is considerably more difficult, usually temporary (<6 months), and your employer must prove that they cannot fill the position with a worker from Norway or the EEA/EU. You will need to be employed 100%, you will need a concrete job offer before you apply, and the job must be deemed season or holiday stand-in.\n\nThose citizens who qualify as a skilled worker and who are coming from a country with a visa-free [agreement with Norway](https://www.udi.no/en/word-definitions/persons-who-do-not-need-a-visa-to-visit-norway-/) you may be allowed to come to Norway as a [skilled job seeker](https://www.udi.no/en/want-to-apply/work-immigration/job-seekers/?c=usa#link-6239).\n\n**NB:** You cannot work while you are searching for a job. This means that once you have a concrete job offer, you will need to apply for a residence permit as a worker and you cannot start working until your application has been approved.\n\nIt is very advantageous to have a grasp on the Norwegian language before you arrive. There are some fields which may accept a lower proficiency in Norwegian; however, these careers are few and far between and knowledge of the local language will help with both applying for jobs and acclimatizing to living in Norway.\n\nSome international companies may post workers in Norway. You will still need a resident permit for workers; however, many companies will help with [this process](https://www.udi.no/en/want-to-apply/work-immigration/employees-of-foreign-companies-in-another-eueea-country/?c=usa).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: New rules exist for UK citizens living in Norway. Formerly, UK citizens would be allowed to apply for residency under EEA/EU regulations. Post-Brexit, UK citizens are no longer allowed to apply for this immigration route. Certain citizens may be allowed to excise EEA treaty rights if they arrived and registered by a certain date. For more information, please see UDI's Brexit Information page ([https://www.udi.no/en/brexit/](https://www.udi.no/en/brexit/))",

If you arrive at the border without meeting the requirements your pet may be quarantined, returned to its point of departure, or euthanized (and you will incur those costs).\n\nIf you are flying with your pet, double check that your airline will accept pets in the cargo hold or if they'll need to be shipped separately. Pets may only travel during certain times of the year (there are temperature restrictions that vary based on airline). Additionally, Third-Country Nationals (non EU/EEA) pets can only arrive at two airports in Norway (Oslo, Kirkenes -- Troms\u00f8 allows pets travelling from Svalbard).\n\n[Altinn](https://www.altinn.no/en/start-and-run-business/) \u2013 an over view on how to start and operate a business in Norway.

Very good for Norwegians to also know your rights to free movement in the EEA/EU!!\n\n[Statens Vegvesen](https://www.vegvesen.no/en/driving-licences/driving-licence-holders/foreign-driving-licences-in-norway) \u2013 Norwegian Road Authority where you deal with all things related to your vehicle including licencing, EU control, registration, etc... Some countries have an agreement with Norway that will allow you to exchange your foreign licence (with or without a road test). For those countries that do not have such agreements, you will need to go through the same process as Norwegians to get your licence, which includes mandatory driver training through an accredited traffic school. If you can exchange your licence, you usually only have one year from the time you were granted your residence permit, so it is wise to do that as soon as possible.\n\n[Norwegian Tax Office](https://www.skatteetaten.no/en/person/foreign/) \u2013 You will need to get in touch with these folks if you\u2019re going to work in Norway.\n\n[Helse Norge](https://helsenorge.no/) \\-- A place to see your health information including your patient journal, your electronic prescriptions, change your doctor, etc...\n\n[What to expect when you're buying a house](https://www.reddit.com/r/Norway/comments/15z7ldn/what_to_expect_when_you_buy_a_house_in_norway_as/) \\-- a well-written post by another redditor detailing what you can expect when buying a house.\n\nYou can read about banking [here](https://www.justlanded.com/english/Norway/Norway-Guide/Money/Banking) and [here](https://easynorway.wordpress.com/the-essentials/opening-a-bank-account/). The pages are a little old, but it will get you started. Most common banks include Sparebank1, DNB, Handelsbanken Norway, Sbanken as well as many other smaller savings banks.\n\nOnce you get a bank account, you'll need to get BankID which is critical to accessing many Norwegian services including Statens Vegvesen, Helse Norge, Altinn, etc... BankID serves as a digital signature.\n\nThe most popular telecom companies include [Telenor](https://www.telenor.no/privat/), [Telia](https://www.telia.no/), [OneCall](https://onecall.no/), [TalkMore](https://talkmore.no/). You will need a person number (granted to you once you have a residence permit) in order to get any subscription based phone plan. EU phones will work in Norway and with the EU\u2019s \u201croam like home\u201d directive. Non-EU folks may need to get a pre-paid phone card (kontantkort) until you can get a subscription.\n\nNo matter where you are coming from, I recommend that anyone considering a move to another country look into culture shock. Lots of immigration attempts fail in part because a failure to recognize and address culture shock.\n\nThere was a good discussion about the difficulties of moving to Norway (or any other new country) that you can [read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Norway/comments/j35jhq/a_brutally_honest_post_about_the_difficulties_of/). You can learn about culture shock [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_shock), and [here](https://www.sfu.ca/students/isap/explore/culture/stages-symptoms-culture-shock.html), and [here](http://home.snu.edu/~hculbert/shock.htm), and also [here](https://medium.com/global-perspectives/the-4-stages-of-culture-shock-a79957726164)\n\nWhile it may not be required for most applications, from experience, it is a good idea to **get a certified copy of some important documents from back home**. Getting certified (and potentially notarized) copies of diplomas/transcripts, your birth certificate, divorce proceedings, etc... will potentially save you a lot of time, money, and annoyance as trying to get these things while you are abroad is much, much harder.",

Based on the increasing coronavirus cases throughout Europe (albeit low death rate), what are the chances Norway might re-introduce border restrictions and I won't be able to fly in? Also, once they approve my application all I will get is a letter saying I am good to fly into Norway, would this be enough to show at my port of entry when flying into Schengen? I am from a Schengen visa-free country but I know Europe currently is only open to a very select list of countries, and as I won't have an official residence permit or visa I fear I might be turned down.

        "content": "My family was part of the large Norwegian diaspora that emigrated to the U.S. in the late 19th century. We have a family tradition of making lefse by hand, putting butter and sugar on it, then running outside and finding the closest Swede and throwing it at them (looking at you Karl Knutson).\n\nDo you still carry on this time honored tradition and if so, how much lefse do I pack?",

            "While the sentiment is good, it is way too aggressive. \n\nIt's much better to be passive-aggressive about it. \n\nGo to the Swede and give him a lefse, and tell him you are sorry to hear he is Swedish, and that the lefse might help him eat that week. And that poverty and stupidity are often related, but you know it isn't his fault really - since he is Swedish.",
            "That would be a waste of good lefse.",
            "You can never pack too much lefse! Always be prepared!",
            "What the fuck is this? A false flag CyOps operations from swedes that want free lefse?",
            "Oh well, guess it's time to get the meatball slingshot again...",
            "Hehe, that would be fun...\n\nAh, and I guess that your resident Swede just picks up the lefse and eat it with great delight? It would be a shame to let such good food go to waste... hehe\n\nSo no, we don't, but we wouldn't at all mind to taste your home made lefse, even with Swedes taking part... \n\nSo, pack a lot, and prepare to become very popular sharing it :)\n\nWelcome to Norway.",
            "This has never been a Norwegian tradition. We are not lunatic Americans.",
            "Do Norwegians actually eat Lefse? Or is it a relic from the grandparents when they left Norway and went to USA?",
            "Yes and yes."
