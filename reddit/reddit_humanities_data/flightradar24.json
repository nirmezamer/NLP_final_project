        "content": "# Welcome to r/flightradar24!\n\nOur goal is to keep this a friendly and informative unofficial flight tracking community.\n\nBefore posting, please take some time to familiarize yourself with our rules and our new [Wiki FAQ Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/flightradar24/wiki/index/#wiki_flightradar24_main_wiki_page)\n\nDo you have ideas for improving the sub? Are you a subject matter expert on flight tracking related topic and interested in contributing to the Wiki? Please [message the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/flightradar24) and we'll get back to you!\n\nJoin the r/flightradar24 Discord!\n\nhttps://discord.com/invite/FpVEft54U3\n\n\n# Rules\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Read the pinned post and the FAQs before posting. Many common questions are addressed in the Wiki. If your question is not answered by the FAQs, you are welcome to post.\n2. Be civil and friendly. If you don\u2019t have anything nice to say, don\u2019t say it.\n   1. Don\u2019t insult, flame, harrass, etc.\n   2. There is a difference between constructive criticism and insults.\n   3. No political posts or comments\n   4. Critiques of posts are welcome but may be removed when they cross into  personal attacks. Breaking this rule may result in a ban from the subreddit at the Mod Team\u2019s discretion.\n3. Posts must contain a screenshot from a flight tracking app/website.\n   1. FlightRadar24 is preferred, but others like ADSBExchange, FlightAware, etc, are welcome as well.\n   2. Photos & videos of aircraft are welcome if the post includes a flight tracking screenshot of the aircraft. Photos & videos without a flight tracking screenshot are better suited for /r/aviation and other subs.\n   3. Linking directly to the flight is okay but note that the links usually die as soon as a flight ends.\n   4. Meta posts with FlightRadar24 announcements or other potential items of  interest related to flight tracking are welcome without a screenshot.\n4. Remember that excessive posting starts to look like spam. If you are posting more than a few times a day, barring a significant reason to do to, your posts start to look more like spam than reasonable  contributions. Exceeding six (6) posts in a 24-hour period may result  in automatic removal.\n5. Search and check the subreddit prior to posting. Especially with current events around the world, we frequently see multiple posts of the same aircraft per day. If you are going to post about these aircraft, please search the callsign, registration, etc to see if it has already been posted recently. In the instance of  duplicate posts, the first one posted will be kept up and all subsequent  posts will be removed. In certain circumstances, the Mod Team may create a mega thread to cover big events, in which case any posts related to that topic will be removed.\n6. Fearmongering, baseless speculation, or insinuating something is \"going down\" is not allowed.  Posts should stick to facts and avoid sensationalism. Fearmongering and  speculation in regards to aviation incidents, military flights, etc, are not appropriate for [r/flightradar24](https://www.reddit.com/r/flightradar24) and will be removed. This rule is not intended to cover reasonable speculation about normal aircraft.\n7. Posts must have a clear title explaining what you are showing or the question you are asking. Posts with an unclear title may be removed.\n8. The Mod Team reserves the right to remove any post or comment deemed inappropriate or not suitable for the sub. As with anything, there are always edge cases that don\u2019t fit nicely into one of the other rules. If you feel your post was incorrectly removed, please message the  moderators using the mod mail function.",

        "content": "Welcome to the weekly discussion thread! The goal of this post is to provide a location for questions and discussion about aircraft that don't necessitate their own individual posts, in addition to centralizing discussion about known aircraft that are frequently posted (such as FORTE).\n\nPlease be sure to check out the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/flightradar24/comments/sqfzxn/faq_please_read_this_post_before_submitting/) to make sure your question isn't covered there. If you're looking at a military aircraft in the Ukraine region, you may find some answers in the [original Ukraine megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/flightradar24/comments/sqg9h0/forte12_anybody_ukraine_megathread/). For military aircraft in general, checking the callsign against [this list](http://henney.com/chm/callsign.htm) may yield useful information. In all situations, make sure you search for the aircraft callsign and check recent posts to find any existing discussion.\n\nOtherwise, feel free to post any questions or findings below and discuss with others!",
