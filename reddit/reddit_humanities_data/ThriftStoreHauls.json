If you have a friend who is aware of sewing stuff (or you), check to see if it has the space to be let out before you buy it\n\nEdit: from zooming in it looks like there isn\u2019t any extra fabric to use to let it out. In width around the bust and length :( if someone is more experienced with altering things, could you chime in?",
