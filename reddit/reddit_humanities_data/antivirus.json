        "content": "Hello,\n\nWelcome to r/antivirus's new top-level Announcements post.  Since Reddit has a limit of two (2) stickied announcements per subreddit, this will be a way to provide links to important information like announcements about new rules and moderators, activities in the subreddit, and so forth.  If you are new to r/antivirus, **please take a quick look at them**.  You can even take a look if you are not new here.\n\n**DISCUSSION** | **DATE POSTED** | **DATE LAST REVISED**\n----|----|----|\n[\\[MOD POST\\] We're back in business! and an update on automod rules](https://old.reddit.com/r/antivirus/comments/1bch1l2/mod_post_were_back_in_business_and_an_update_on/?) | 2024-MAR-11 | -\n[News & Updates from your r/Antivirus Mod Team, Q1 2024 Edition](https://old.reddit.com/r/antivirus/comments/1b6vb9c/news_updates_from_your_rantivirus_mod_team_q1/?) | 2024-MAR-04 | -\n[Updates & News from the r/Antivirus Mod Team, Autumn 2023 Edition](https://old.reddit.com/r/antivirus/comments/1708ex3/updates_news_from_the_rantivirus_mod_team_autumn/) | 2023-OCT-04 | -\n[Notes from your Moderators (Summer Edition)](https://old.reddit.com/r/antivirus/comments/vuegt5/notes_from_your_moderators_summer_edition/) | 2022-JUL-08 | - \n[Quick Note from the mod team about spam](https://old.reddit.com/r/antivirus/comments/nq66hn/quick_note_from_the_mod_team_about_spam/) | 2021-JUN-01 | -\n[To the people asking for opinions on a specific file](https://old.reddit.com/r/antivirus/comments/hls4q3/to_the_people_asking_for_opinions_on_a_specific/) | 2020-JUL-05 | 2020-JUL-05\n\nAdditionally, the r/antivirus subreddit operates a bit differently than other subreddits you might be familiar with and normally use.  Here are some tips and tools to help you use it.\n\n*  The subreddit has a [wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/antivirus/wiki) that is regularly updated with answers to commonly-asked questions.  Check it out.  The answer to your question may already be in there.\n\n*  Asking a question about a report on a file or website from a service like Hybrid Analysis, MetaDefender, Triage, or VirusTotal?  You **must** include the actual link to it and not just a screenshot, or your post will be removed.\n\n*  Be kind to each other and be professional in your conduct here.  Personal attacks will not be tolerated and will be dealt with appropriately.\n\n*  Do not ask for copies of hacking tools, malware, or suspicious files.  If someone sends you a chat request or private message asking for a file or offering assistance based on what you posted here, report them to Reddit and notify the mods.\n\n*  Do not post direct links to malicious, suspect, or potentially unsafe files or web sites.\n\n*  Follow [Reddiquette](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439-Reddiquette). This means correctly upvoting and downvoting posts, and reporting posts with dangerous or unsafe advice to the mods.\n\n*  If you work for a vendor of security products, services, or in a related field, you must identify yourself as such, either in the post or with flair.  Also, you may not steer conversations to your products or services, only respond to posts about them to clarify or defend.\n\n*  No low-effort, off-topic, spam, or meme posts.  This includes AI/ChatGPT/LLM-generated text, questions about password manager or VPNs, requests for assistance with non-security related software like autoclickers or MP3 downloaders, and so forth.\n\n*  No requests for assistance with pirated software or media.\n\n*  Posts may be removed and threads closed at any time based on the moderators' discretion\n\nThe complete list of rules for the subreddit can be found [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/antivirus/about/rules/).  Read them before posting.\n\nQuestions, comments, feedback on this post?  Just reply here. Thank you.\n\nRegards,\n\nAryeh Goretsky  \n*(on behalf of the r/antivirus mod team)*",

        "content": "Hello,\n\nIt's time for a quick update from your mod team!\n\nIn our [previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/antivirus/comments/1b6vb9c/news_updates_from_your_rantivirus_mod_team_q1/), we talked about changes made to the subreddit to restrict accessibility and discoverability after an increase in spam.  We are comfortable with how the subreddit has been operating, and will be removing those restrictions.\n\nBecause that means an influx in new posters, we are making some additional changes to the subreddit.\n\nTo begin with, in order to ensure our community is helpful and easy to navigate, posts must have descriptive titles that summarize their main topic.  Posts with titles that don't clearly indicate the subject matter may be removed.\n\nAdditionally, we will be trying new types of rules in the AutoModerator to see if they have the desired effect, including:\n\n*  Rules that will attempt to answer common questions.  The topic will be left open in case the question is not answered or other members have more to contribute.\n\n*  Posts with a vague title or other problems will be removed, but the AutoModerator will specify that you are welcome to try again. A  title should indicate to someone with the same question whether your post is related.\n\n*  New spam filters, and the AutoModerator will not invite you to try again. \n\nAs with any changes to automoderation, there's the possibility we might have gotten something wrong, so we'll be monitoring these closely to ensure they are working as designed.  However, if you come across an AutoModerator rule that seems incorrectly applied or otherwise out of place, please use the 'Message the Mods' function to let us know so we can investigate.\n\nQuestions, comments or suggestions about how we use automoderation in the subreddit?  Ask them here!\n\nRegards,\n\nAryeh Goretsky  \n*(on behalf of the r/antivirus mod team)*",
