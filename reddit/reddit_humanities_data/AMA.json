People will stay in poverty because they like who they work with or don\u2019t want to do the footwork of getting a higher paying job. If you are good at selling yourself and have a good SOUNDING (keyword is sounding) resume then you should always be looking for higher paying employers.",
            "100% this is why I made this. Most important thing: keep your head up. If you have a good work ethic then you should be proud of that and excited for the future. If not, that is the first thing you should work on. Focus on your motivation and the good qualities that could pull you out of this and not the struggle. NEVER focus on what others (ie: parents, other relatives, life long friends) could do for you and haven\u2019t. When I would focus on the struggle or what others are failing to do for me I would let myself be bummed out, that\u2019s when I would stop trying. The last time I was homeless I tried something different, I put my stuff into a storage unit, kept working out, kept myself clean, kept doing acts of self care and kept talking to women. I would look at the things I enjoyed about my lifestyle rather than what I hated. This mindset is what allowed me to be open to opportunity and growth. The other thing is that I always looked for opportunity and growth, could recognize opportunity and would always jump on it. This is vital. I never told myself \u201coh it\u2019s too long of a commute\u201d \u201cit\u2019s too hard of work\u201d or anything that would lead me to believing I can\u2019t. If it was a good opportunity or would teach me something that would land me a better opportunity I never said no. When someone would tell me I couldn\u2019t I wouldn\u2019t believe them, and when someone said I could I would believe them. I had to work for this perspective. I was in a rut for a long time and kept myself there before I realized I could get out. \n\nTLDR: \u201cWhether you believe you can or you can\u2019t, you are right\u201d",

I commuted an hour and 45 mins 1 way for almost 2 years for $17 an hour because I was able to get on the machines and build my skills as an operator. I told everyone I was paid $17 an hour to go to college 2 hours away, rather than looking at it like I made $17 an hour with a hour 45 min commute. If I said no to working on that job I probably never would have got the experience I needed to make it to where I\u2019m at today.",
