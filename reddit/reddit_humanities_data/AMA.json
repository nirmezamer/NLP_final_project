            "I was 11 or 12 and the girl was 14- and the thing I think now, as an adult, is that she must have been being sexually abused by someone older than her.  We even had anal sex, which she was familiar with .  I didn\u2019t have a clue about anything.  I don\u2019t think kids want to just go all in like that without some kind of abuse happening in their lives.  So it\u2019s a lot to unpack.  I don\u2019t necessarily \u201cfeel\u201d like I was a \u201cvictim\u201d.  When I think of it, which is rarely, I almost think she must have been the victim of someone else, and was trying to shift the power , or something.  It doesn\u2019t excuse sexual abusers, but I have a kind of strange compassion for her in that sense.  It\u2019s kind of wild to think about.  I\u2019ll bet a lot of kids need help that they feel that they can\u2019t ask for.  It\u2019s a sickening idea.  I think the way to get your angel wings is to have abuse/bad behaviors/ etc stop with you.   Hurt people hurt people, they say.  But I believe they can also help people- if they learn from their own experiences, and then live accordingly .   \u201cHelping people \u201c can simply mean NOT continuing cycles of dysfunction and/or abuse.",

The one time I had it figured out and was ready her sister caught us. \n\nThis went on until she went on to high school and got a boyfriend. I was devastated because I thought I was her boyfriend.\n\nThis left me a hypersexual adult and prone to unhealthy relationships with women into my 40s. I didn\u2019t lose my virginity until 21 because I was so obsessed with purity as a result of my experience, that it had to be with another virgin. Really I wanted to save it for marriage but didn\u2019t end up doing that. \n\nI\u2019ve finally come to terms with all of it and accepted it as the past. I still have to see her every few years as we were neighbors and our families were close friends. It\u2019s always as if nothing went on.",

Apparently some people drink a gallon of milk a day as a bulking strategy while lifting. It's got a shit ton of protein, fat, and calories. I know some users were talking about sugar but milk has way better macros than candy or ice cream. However at 2400 calories in a gallon, it alone meets the daily calorie need for most people!
