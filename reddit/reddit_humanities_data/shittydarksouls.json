            "Most people enjoying something do not actively go out of their way to post it on reddit. At most it\u2019s one passing tweet. The data is generally skewed to begin with, especially on a sub like this. As of right now the DLC is sitting at 7/10 on Steam which indicates generally positive reception, and this is despite the initial negative scores due to ongoing performance issues (which is a problem) and alleged Chinese anti-hacking.",

But it\u2019s not perfect, and the genuine problems should absolutely be recognised and called out so they can be fixed, or at the very least not repeated.",
            "People usually are negative because they greatly care about something and want it to be the best it can.

Honestly once you get all the fragments the final boss really doesn\u2019t pose that much more of a challenge compared to Malenia.",

Nameless King is an endurance fight, his move-set is simpler than it could be because Fromsoft expect the fight with him to take a long time and that's the major challenge. Learning his moveset isn't super difficult, learning to do it consistently without slipping up for 5-10 minutes is.\n\n2, Even if they were, Elden Ring makes a lot of the enemies 'bullshit' hard, rather than 'well-designed' hard.",
