        "content": "Please understand that this question is asked [EVERY SINGLE DAY](https://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/search/?q=street%20fight&restrict_sr=1&sort=new) on this subreddit. Please refer to rule #3 of this sub. There is no simple answer to this question.\n\nThe answer is as follows:\n\n**Do not get into street fights.**\n\nSelf-defense is not just about hurting an aggressor; it's about avoiding violent people and situations first, and diffusing them second. Fighting is the last resort. There are tons of dangers involved with fighting, not just for yourself, but for the aggressor as well. Fighting can lead to permanent injury, death and criminal and/or civil litigation. Just don't do it. Virtually all conflicts can be resolved without violence.\n\n**Combat sports have been proven highly effective in real life fights.**\n\nIf you want to learn martial arts so you can effectively defend yourself in a situation where all other attempts to resolve the conflict have failed and the aggressor has physically attacked you, your best bet is to have training in actual fighting. Your best bet is a combination of a proven effective striking art and a proven effective grappling art. Proven effective striking arts include, but are not limited to: Boxing, Kickboxing, Muay Thai, Sanda, Savate, Kyokushin Karate and Goju Ryu Karate. Proven effective grappling arts include, but are not limited to: Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Freestyle Wrestling, Catch as Catch can, Sambo and Judo. Mixed Martial Arts gyms usually teach two or more of the above arts and usually a combination of them as well.\n\n**Free sparring and training with pressure and resistance are the hallmarks of a good martial arts school.**\n\nRegardless of which martial art you are practicing, the most important thing is not what you train, but how you train.  A little Taiji or Aikido may be useful for someone encountering violence. Is it the most effective strategy in the octagon? No, but would Aikido or Taiji help prevent street fight injuries? Maybe. Many martial arts can work very well as long as you train to use them properly. You can practice a technique in the air or on a compliant partner every day for hours, but when it comes to a real fight, if you haven't practiced it against a noncompliant partner who is trying to retaliate, it will more likely than not fly right out of the window the second you get into a real fight.\n\n**Don't train martial arts to prepare for a hypothetical fight that will probably never happen.**\n\nTrain martial arts because you enjoy it. Train a martial art that you enjoy.",

            "A street fight starts before you know it started. \n\nA dojo is a safe environment. Do your \"attackers\" try to hurt you or kill you? Do they sneak up on you?\n\nA street fight may involve weapons, knives, guns, bats. \n\nAvoid street fights. \n\nTrain to improve confidence and feel  you can destroy the world. Then bottle it up inside to glow like a fire breathing dragon. \n\nOnly break glass in an emergency / family threatened and no other choice for e.g.\n\nEnjoy your good health and longevity of being able to move.",
            "I'd say a mixture of boxing and wrestling. I don't wrestle, but I'd wish that I did if I ever got into street fights. The wrestlers in my MMA gym always take me down and beat me up when they get sick of me kicking their legs during sparing. lol",
            "im a muay thai fighter for 5 years now and i can easily say if u wanna learn how to defend yourself in the street boxing is the best sport to learn. since in a street fight you are not typically using your kickboxing or muay thai shorts you are typically using jeans or ordinary shorts and you cant really kick that well if you are not comfortable but with boxing you can can fight anytime you could be wearing anything at the bottom and top. im not saying other martial arts are also not effective infact i would say the 2nd best is muay thai esp the elbows is super effective at close range, but for me if u just wanna learn how to defend yourself boxing is my 1st recommendation and 2nd is muay thai.",
            "In my humble opinion, having been a bouncer, paramedic, and executive protection agent. Two years: boxing, Greco/Folk, Judo, BJJ, Muay Thai. Maybe some Kali/Escrima. As far as karate, Kyokushin, Shotokan, and GoJu bring a few things to the table. \n\nBut I would take two years of boxing and wrestling first. Then Muay Thai and BJJ as well as try to pick up some Judo. \n\nWhy I think people should start with boxing and wrestling is more about learning to actually fight and the discipline these arts impart. If you can hang in a solid boxing gym and wrestling room, you're head an shoulders above 99% of the population.",
            "Wrestling. only wrestling.\n\n \n\n1. Double Leg Shot: This is the basic and most common double leg takedown. It involves shooting in on your opponent, wrapping your arms around both of their legs, and driving through to take them down.\n2. High Crotch Double Leg: In this variation, you shoot in on one of your opponent's legs, typically the outside leg, and secure it with both arms, then drive through to take them down.\n3. Single to Double Leg: This takedown involves initially attempting a single leg takedown, and when your opponent defends it by hopping on one leg, you switch to a double leg to complete the takedown.\n4. Blast Double: The blast double is a quick and explosive double leg takedown where you explode forward and take both of your opponent's legs, often lifting them off the ground before finishing the takedown.\n5. Low Double Leg: This takedown is executed by shooting in low on your opponent's legs, aiming for their knees or lower thighs, and driving through to complete the takedown.\n6. Ankle Pick to Double Leg: You start by attempting an ankle pick, where you grab your opponent's ankle, and if they defend it by pulling their leg back, you transition into a double leg takedown.\n7. Slide-By Double Leg: In this technique, you fake one direction, causing your opponent to shift their weight in response, and then you quickly change directions and shoot in for a double leg takedown.\n8. Duck Under to Double Leg: You begin by ducking under your opponent's attack, then quickly coming up behind them to secure a double leg takedown.\n9. Fireman's Carry to Double Leg: The fireman's carry involves getting your opponent's arm over your shoulder and then transitioning to a double leg takedown.\n10. **Knee Tap Double Leg:** In this technique, you shoot for a double leg takedown but instead of driving straight through, you use your head to tap your opponent's near knee, causing them to lose balance, and then you finish the double leg takedown\n11. **Step-Across Double Leg:** Begin by stepping to the outside of your opponent's lead leg, then shoot in for a double leg takedown. This technique is often used to counter an opponent's forward movement.\n12. **Outside Trip Double Leg:** Shoot for a double leg takedown, but rather than lifting your opponent, you use a tripping motion to take them down by sweeping their outside leg.\n13. **Bear Hug Double Leg:** Instead of shooting for your opponent's legs, you initiate this takedown by getting a bear hug grip around your opponent's waist and then driving through to lift and take them down.\n14. **Whizzer to Double Leg:** When your opponent attempts to secure a whizzer (overhook) on you, you can counter by transitioning to a double leg takedown by changing levels and driving through.\n15. **Angle Pick Double Leg:** This takedown involves moving to the side of your opponent and picking their ankle or leg while shooting for a double leg, disrupting their balance and setting up the takedown.\n16. **Fake Shot to Double Leg:** You feign a shot or level change to bait your opponent into reacting, and when they defend against the fake, you capitalize by shooting for a double leg takedown.\n17. **Post and Double Leg:** When your opponent posts or extends their arm to defend a single leg attack, you can quickly transition to a double leg takedown, as their balance is compromised.\n18. **Sprawl to Double Leg:** When your opponent shoots for a single leg takedown, you sprawl to defend it, and as they continue to hold onto your leg, you can transition into a double leg takedown of your own.\n19. **Russian Tie to Double Leg:** Utilize a Russian tie, a grip where you control your opponent's arm, and then use this control to set up a double leg takedown by circling and driving through their legs.\n20.  if you've read this far. go to the gym and do some **SQUATS**",
            "Best martial art in a street fight is the martial art of sprinting & then long distance running. If you can't do those then BJJ is easily number one if you are close enough to make contact with me.",
            "I did a bunch of street fights growing up in the blue ridge mountains in north Georgia, and these are my takeaways.\n\nBoxing is very useful, but you don't have a controlled weight or height when it comes to who you are fighting. The biggest issue is breaking your hand. I was taking boxing as a teen and in a street fight I broke my hand. Worse pain ever and I had to stop boxing for a long while due to the damages.\n\nI didn't do muay thai at the time like I do now, but I did do kick boxing. I would say this was very useful, and muay thai more so as most times no one knew how to react to kicks. Was bumrushed though and knocked over.\n\nLast I did wrestling and to be honest, was the best thing when it came to doing street fighting. Size became much less an issue, and when mixed with good striking made it much more trivial to take someone down.\n\nDespite all of this, I would still stay away from street fights. I have a few broken bones which give me occasional pain and trouble even now. The worst though are the concussions and brain damage as well as damage to my left eye. I started losing vision intermittently in my left eye due to repeated damage, and because of damage to my frontal lobe (previous damage but repeated head hits and hitting my head on stuff made it worse) which has given me some slurred speech that I'm pretty self conscious about.",
