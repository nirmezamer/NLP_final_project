        "content": "Please understand that this question is asked [EVERY SINGLE DAY](https://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/search/?q=street%20fight&restrict_sr=1&sort=new) on this subreddit. Please refer to rule #3 of this sub. There is no simple answer to this question.\n\nThe answer is as follows:\n\n**Do not get into street fights.**\n\nSelf-defense is not just about hurting an aggressor; it's about avoiding violent people and situations first, and diffusing them second. Fighting is the last resort. There are tons of dangers involved with fighting, not just for yourself, but for the aggressor as well. Fighting can lead to permanent injury, death and criminal and/or civil litigation. Just don't do it. Virtually all conflicts can be resolved without violence.\n\n**Combat sports have been proven highly effective in real life fights.**\n\nIf you want to learn martial arts so you can effectively defend yourself in a situation where all other attempts to resolve the conflict have failed and the aggressor has physically attacked you, your best bet is to have training in actual fighting. Your best bet is a combination of a proven effective striking art and a proven effective grappling art. Proven effective striking arts include, but are not limited to: Boxing, Kickboxing, Muay Thai, Sanda, Savate, Kyokushin Karate and Goju Ryu Karate. Proven effective grappling arts include, but are not limited to: Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Freestyle Wrestling, Catch as Catch can, Sambo and Judo. Mixed Martial Arts gyms usually teach two or more of the above arts and usually a combination of them as well.\n\n**Free sparring and training with pressure and resistance are the hallmarks of a good martial arts school.**\n\nRegardless of which martial art you are practicing, the most important thing is not what you train, but how you train.  A little Taiji or Aikido may be useful for someone encountering violence. Is it the most effective strategy in the octagon? No, but would Aikido or Taiji help prevent street fight injuries? Maybe. Many martial arts can work very well as long as you train to use them properly. You can practice a technique in the air or on a compliant partner every day for hours, but when it comes to a real fight, if you haven't practiced it against a noncompliant partner who is trying to retaliate, it will more likely than not fly right out of the window the second you get into a real fight.\n\n**Don't train martial arts to prepare for a hypothetical fight that will probably never happen.**\n\nTrain martial arts because you enjoy it. Train a martial art that you enjoy.",

            "I'd say a mixture of boxing and wrestling. I don't wrestle, but I'd wish that I did if I ever got into street fights. The wrestlers in my MMA gym always take me down and beat me up when they get sick of me kicking their legs during sparing. lol",
            "im a muay thai fighter for 5 years now and i can easily say if u wanna learn how to defend yourself in the street boxing is the best sport to learn. since in a street fight you are not typically using your kickboxing or muay thai shorts you are typically using jeans or ordinary shorts and you cant really kick that well if you are not comfortable but with boxing you can can fight anytime you could be wearing anything at the bottom and top. im not saying other martial arts are also not effective infact i would say the 2nd best is muay thai esp the elbows is super effective at close range, but for me if u just wanna learn how to defend yourself boxing is my 1st recommendation and 2nd is muay thai.",

        "content": "Hey everyone hope you're doing good\n\nSo I did boxing this year and even had 2 smoker fights. It was good and I learned a lot but I see myself more as a martial artist than a boxer so I'm moving on to something else next year. Probably kickboxing or going back to BJJ.\n\nIn fact the trainers were extremely close minded and used to take verbal jabs at other martial arts during drills and all. Like one time we were doing close up body work drills and one of them was saying \"look each other in the eyes we don't turn our back like those MMA clowns\". Lots of remarks like that which I found very silly.\n\nAlso one of the coach - the same one - was rude AF. He shows a combination one time and if you mess it up he yells and screams \"You call that boxing ! I call that garbage !\". Or put his head in his hands and sighs loudly like he's going to  kill himself next. Gives you disgusted looks if you mess up during a drill. When we do footwork drills if you mess up he gets angry and screams like a madman. And after the training session he becomes normal and chill again. \n\nI'm sure people will say I'm soft and should take it on the chin etc. but I trained Judo, Wrestling, BJJ, Taekwondo and some Kickboxing (but without the leg kicks) and no coach ever acted that agressive with beginners. On the contrary they always tried to teach us with good explanation and showed the moves again if we mess up something. My son does MMA for children and the coaches are not like that even with the adult class.\n\nI asked a friend who is an amateur boxer and going to become pro this year and he told me his coach insults him and tells him he should stop boxing and he's just an adopted orphan (he never knew his father) and he told me it's normal because in boxing there are actual deaths in the ring so the coaches do that to toughen you up mentally.\n\nAm I crazy to think it's not ok and it doesn't actually do anything to toughen you up ? It's just garbage coaching IMO. \n\nPlease share some wisdom with me and tell me if I'm wrong because one of the reasons I'm moving on from boxing is this type of coaching attitude which I find over the top. I'm closing on forty year old and have 3 kids I don't need a coach insulting me for a leisure sport activity. Is it misplaced ego from my part ? I find it's just wanting an healthy environment but maybe I need a reality check I don't know.\n\nThanks to all",

            "Different strokes for different folks.  What he\u2019s doing sounds fine, it just might be bad fit for you.  Obviously, not all boxing coaches are like that",
            "You can definitely find tamer gyms that are more professional, and that\u2019s fine if shit talking bothers you. But honestly what you described would not put me off the gym. The fact the coach is chill afterwards just shows that it\u2019s for motivation. Don\u2019t take it so seriously. I\u2019m British and train in Germany. My coach was this ancient German who used to yell all sorts of shit about the Queen at me. I just laughed about it. It\u2019s all in good fun.",
            "All the coaches at my gym are super positive, funny people who also happen to hit hard and move like lightning. Being a good boxer, a good coach, and a total dick are independent qualities from each other.\n\nAre there other gyms in your area?",
            "I mean maybe it's because I was in the Army but I see a lot of coaches online acting hard to \"toughen up\" their fighters and I'm skeptical of the training value. There is certainly a place for harshness particularly if they're a competitor, doing it to survive, or more likely being an idiot.\n\nIf the training isn't hard or valuable then the attitude isn't going to compensate for gaps in training quality. People used to think that hazing rituals or being dick would make your Soldiers/Fighters more capable and it really doesn't work like that, you might get some endurance out of the them but the violent attitude you want is just built by training. On the other hand it's boxing there is culture of 'roughness' that is undeniable. I would just say that if you're a coach or trainer make sure you're coaching or training before you start pretending to be Mighty Mick or R. Lee Ermey.",
            "I'll preface this by saying that I coach TKD to literally all ages (preschoolers to pensioners). I was taught to never\\* do what you're describing. The asterisk is there because the rule can be broken if you have a good relationship with the student in question and you know that they'll respond well to it. I know I can say 'come on, that kick's sloppy' to specific juniors I teach and they'll immediately laugh and correct themselves, but for others they take it much worse. Your coach MAY be taking this too far, or what's more likely is that he's just passing on what his coach did to him because 'that's the way it's done' or because of some other backwards logic. If you feel insulted as a grown man vote with your wallet and find somewhere else to train. Martial arts should be a positive experience, don't surround yourself with people who make it a chore.\n\nEdit: Just reread your paragraph about your amateur boxer friend and holy shit I would personally not stick around with that coach. Being tough mentally doesn't equate to being able to take insults.",
