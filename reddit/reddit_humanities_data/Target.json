        "content": "Good evening, my wonderful team members.\n\nAs we've discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Target/comments/1co136l/pride_2024/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) among so many other threads, we know the Pride 2024 set is A: only making it to 50% of stores, and B: less than stellar, to be very mild. The point of Pride is not just buying rainbow stuff from a corporation, but sometimes that's all the representation someone gets to see. Representation matters, and our queer community matters to me *a lot.* I yell a lot about our lack of field representation, not to mention HQ having a shit system for getting feedback from the field for anything. \n\nLike I did last year, I wanted to make a place for you to share your reactions and feedback - communication restrictions into the field has been a major focus of my team and I on the Pride+ Employee Resource Group \"Inclusion Acumen\" team. (Formerly Team Member Advocacy). A big part of why I want to do this is because of how damaging poor communications can be, and how badly I am trying to force that message into the ears of the people who could do something about it. (Re: damage - last year, when we only found out about product being recalled ahead of set thanks to u/PrinceKido and a few folks. We have a whole ass chain reaction of events since that point, culminating in a fucking Equal ^(Ity) shirt design of all things.)\n\nWhat I did last year with your messages was post them in the Pride Plus Business Council Slack channel, so that all of the people across the enterprise could receive feedback from the field and understand how things were feeling. I anonymized the messages if there were identifying features, left in the cursing, and posted them into a thread with updates in the main channel every single time I put a new batch up. This is the goal again this year - even if we can't force them to suddenly make the collection for 2024 not suck, anything we do to shift the needle towards the right direction is real helpful. \n\nu/128Gigabytes u/JayUnderscore_ u/n1njaunic0rn u/SamNoche u/grumpyoldfartess u/BroIBelieveAtYou u/ElderEmoAdjacent ",

            "Just looked at it.  Super underwhelming.  They were starting to give ace recognition and they yanked it away.\n\n![gif](giphy|gfsQffBnuc6e096brx)",
            "I saw the collection online (and in store today) and... I was vastly underwhelmed. It appears to strive to be so inoffensive and bland that it's actually a joke. By my eye, it looked like more than half of the collection is... for pets. Whoever made the decisions for this year's curation clearly doesn't get what Pride means.\n\nI predict it won't sell and that will just give the higher-ups more ammunition to eliminate Pride from the sales floor.",
            "this shit is ugly af and wont sell and corporate will say \"well its them wokies\" and pull it entirely. it sucks so much as an lgbt team member who routinely has to put up with \"she, him, *they\"* every time i go into work and then to see target not only capitulate last year to alt right nutjobs but then to HIDE pride (at least in my store) and then make it appeal to exactly one demo (parents and friends of lgbt ppl) feels like a slap in the face. target pride was the first time as a child i felt like it was okay to be lgbt and i ROUTINELY wear my first pride shirt ever to target. it sucks that target is less lgbt friendly now then they were in 2015.",
            "My store has a section right in the front, it\u2019s very small. But I can see almost everything from Guest Services. The first thing I saw was the \u201cMovie Star Bird\u201d and the only indication that it was a pride tag. I question a lot of things people buy when they return them, but who tf is going to buy this crap? And a silver car\u2026I walked by it today and it was very underwhelming. The Prince set and DVF were decent, but this is sad. My store seems to have a lot of queer+ TM and Target has a chance to celebrate that. But, per usual, we\u2019re either ignored or whatever this is\u2026tolerated? I don\u2019t know. There was a time when I wasn\u2019t a TM and I always thought highly of this place. But it\u2019s definitely lost its shine and I could feel that when I started November 2023.",
            "As an employee, proud is the last thing I'm feeling right now.",
            "We cut Pride down like crazy this year. \n\nBut GAHDAMMIT if you and yours are Swingers? WE GOT SO MUCH PINEAPPLE SHIT FOR YOUR ASS!",
            "As a member of the community, I personally don\u2019t have an interest in pride month merch, but WOW, this year\u2019s Pride line is disrespectfully small and bland. So low effort it\u2019s hilarious.",
            "I was genuinely, deeply disappointed. The collection is a whimper, a whisper in the back of a loud crowd. It barely counts as a collection at all - I felt like they had more for pets than people. If I can find better, more interesting pride designs at Old Navy of all places, Target has deeply failed. And deeply fail they did, with the 2024 collection.\n\nBut hey, at least bigots know that they can whine and wail and throw tantrums over their eyes being sullied by people who are not them existing and Target will knuckle under and show its belly.",
            "Obviously rainbow capitalism isn't the best, blah blah, but I remember being a younger teen and the only real representation I saw in my world was the Target Pride collection. I'm so disappointed that my store doesn't have it this year, and I'm disappointed in the collection in general. It is so good for kids to see this stuff and it makes me so angry that the homophobes are somehow winning. It feels representative of the general publica opinion on pride too... for fucks sake the first pride was a riot.",
            "My initial reaction to reading the little pride communication they put out on myday was to be kind of pissed they didn't even acknowledge last year's bullshit, but upon further reflection I'm kind of glad they didn't because nothing they would realistically put in that would really be anything other than bullshit. None of the LGBT team members at my store I've spoken with believe target pulled pride last year for TM safety, and most are of the mind that it actually made us less safe because it emboldened people. Moreover... target just really doesn't give a shit about store level TMs, no matter what they say. Our benefits are worse than industry average, the safety culture in stores is nonexistent IME, hours are constantly cut but expectations are always on the rise. Hell, during peak covid, HQ got to work from home, district leads got to check in on us virtually while store and DC still had to show up every day with an unenforced mask policy and a cart wiper who got pulled to do other shit as soon as they clocked in.\n\nThere are  signup sheets in my store for volunteers for local pride events that are completely empty, and I imagine they'll probably stay that way. Nobody at my store wants to represent target at a pride event after last year."
