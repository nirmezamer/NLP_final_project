It took him 1.5 years to make this. Also, the guy has faced some mental issues along the way, show him some love!\n\nAnyhow, as excellent as the video is, spam is never acceptable so I'm going to pin this post for a week or two so y'all can see the video and stop the posts.\n\n\n\n**List of posts banned so far -**\n\n**1. My Top 5 (or any number of) Characters**\n\n**2. Just plain screenshots of any scene without a lot of discussion value.**\n\n**3. The 'To you, x years ago' posts, yes we get it but these posts are uncreative and boring.**\n\n**4. Spamming this video, it's great but the spam isn't.**",
