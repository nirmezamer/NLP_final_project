        "content": "[READ THE SUB FAQ FIRST](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GAdasbv3cjWISHfim1hBfqUyU_-gRqe9IKa2N8HuwkQ/edit). 90% of the repetitive questions we see on this sub are answered there. Even if you don't have an issue covered in the sub FAQ it will likely help you narrow down your question. If you have a question you think should be added to the sub FAQ feel free to message any of the authors of the FAQ.\n\nIf you are troubleshooting, give us all the info we need. For example, it's best to include your year/model, any AND ALL mods, and the specific tune you are running. The more info we have, the better we are at answering questions. We also ask you try to post the question/info in the comments below before posting to the sub as a whole. This will hopefully clean up some of the really repetitive questions.\n\nA few common posts/questions we see everyday.\n\nDoes my engine sound okay? \n\n* 99% of the time the answer is yes. The fa20 sounds like a tractor. It is normal.\n\nAre these numbers on the COBB AP normal? \n\n* A snapshot of your AP with the DAM less than one doesn't actually tell us anything about what is going on. All it tells us is that you had a knock event that your ECU recognized and adjusted for. The most common cause for DAM drop is bad gas. Go get a fresh tank of 93/91 from shell and add a gallon or two of e85 for a full tank. I would also like to point out that knock numbers of -1.41 are super common. They can be caused by your AC kicking on and any other noise really. nothing to worry about.\n\nThis thing on the front of my engine is not spinning with the belts, is it broken? \n\n* That is your AC compressor clutch. It only engages when the AC is on and the compressor is running.\n\nLet me know if you guys want any other common questions added.",

            "One thing I\u2019ve personally considered doing is writing up some info about lifting a VA. I have answered questions about this for a long time on here and on IG, and it seems like a never ending supply of the same couple questions (what parts do you use, what wheels, how to fit 15\u201d wheels on VAs).",
            "How bad is the CVT on the 22 Wrx?\n\nI\u2019m in between the integra a spec and Wrx limited or GT\n\nI blew my leg off while serving at the pleasure, so manual isn\u2019t an option",
            "Is it realistic to find a reliable sub $20k WRX? \n\nIn short I\u2019m coming from an AT GR86, Carvana sent a pretty ridiculous offer and I\u2019d like to have a little more spacious car that\u2019s still fun to drive. I mainly drive for leisure since I work remotely and of course I\u2019m very open to learning manual.",
            "Took my car (2014 wrx hatch) to my local subaru dealership and they were going to change my clutch cause I had a grinding in 3rd gear and they found a bolt that had been snapped where the transmission and engine block meet, a previous shop had sanded the bolt down flush with the motor and overtime the bolt has become one with the motor and the dealership told me they've tried everything and can't get it out, I still owe 19k on this car + about 5k in repairs from a cracked flywheel and rusted hubs and some other crazy stuff they found. Anyways they're telling me I might have to get a new long block if they can't get said bolt out, what should I do?",

            "Idk if anyone has this problem but when I am driving without AC, my car is fine with no issues. But when I turn on the AC I get a hesitation in acceleration just for a second or two. I turn the AC off and it goes away. When the AC is on I get good cool air. I have also noticed the rpm going up when idle with the AC on. (I have a 2017 Wrx).",
            "Just bought a 2016 WRX limited with fairly low miles. Anyone have any experience with wrx lifts? Im thinking about raising it up 1-2 inches but im unsure. The reason is I go camping and some of the roads I would prefer having an extra inch or two of ground clearance on.",
            "It seems like there's a ton of \"I just bought this car, what is this part?\" type questions lately. We're happy to help you troubleshoot, but please please, I beg you, do the research BEFORE you buy the car, not after."
