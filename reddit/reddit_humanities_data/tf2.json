        "content": "If you don't want to read through the whole post, just know this:\n\n#If it's too good to be true, it is.\n\nRandom people who add you out of the blue and immediately ask you for something is a red flag. They try to cast a wide net and add as many people as they can. You might be thinking, it's already bad enough we have to deal with aimbots in our games, but now we need to fight off scammers outside the game too? Sadly, yes. And if you're the type of person who has never seen these scam attempts before, maybe you should keep reading.\n\nThankfully, these scammers are not very creative. The vast majority of them have been using the same scams for years. And yet people still fall for them. Don't be the latest sob story on r/tf2. Here are the most common scams going around today:\n\n#1) Highlander/Tournament Scam [\\(see here for an example\\)](https://i.redd.it/74rxrwlmemk71.jpg)\n\nSomeone will randomly add you and ask you \"which class you prefer to play in Team Fortress 2\". No matter what you respond with, they will follow up that their team is missing a player for their tournament with a kickass prize pool. A variation of this is they will ask you to vote for their team. They might even try to stay topical by saying one of their teammates got covid and can't play. Either way, you will be led to a (fake) tournament site to either sign up or vote for this team.\n\n**How does the scam work?** The site they redirect you to is a fake tournament site, [which might look something like this](https://i.imgur.com/vzxqG3J.png). It exists only to steal your Steam login details. Once you find their team and try to join/vote, you will be redirected to a Steam login page. If you enter in your Steam name and password, your account will get stolen and your items taken.\n\n**How do you know this is a scam?** There are only a few legitimate comp leagues in TF2: UGC, RGL, ETF2L, ozFortress, and AsiaFortress. But even if you're unfamiliar with comp TF2, you should know there's something fishy about someone offering to share such a large prize pool with you with minimal participation. If we look even closer at the site, you'll notice a few things. Many of the \"players\" have profiles related to CS:GO and other real esports athletes, but none that are specific to TF2. You might even notice that many players share the exact same profile pictures. Too bad you can't click on any of their names to check their Steam pages because the site creator didn't think you'd notice.\n\nAnd if that didn't tip you off, take a look at the TF2 tournaments that are supposedly going on. Some players are registered on multiple teams at the same time. [The tournaments page says they are all free to enter, but there is also a monetary prize pool.](https://i.imgur.com/sRvdLkv.png) Where is this money coming from then? Perhaps from a certain bodily part where the sun don't shine.\n\n#2) Steam Admin/False Report Scam [\\(see here for an example\\)](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/scams/2021/03/steam-users-dont-fall-for-the-i-accidentally-reported-you-scam/)\n\nSomeone will randomly add you because they've accidentally reported your Steam account to Steam Support. It was all a mistake, they say, and you should add this \"steam admin\" to sort it out. Once you talk to this (fake) Steam admin, he will either get you to log out of your account and tell him your email address and the verification code sent to your email, or ask for your Steam  username and password. There is even a trading related variation of this scam where your account was reported for \"duped items\", and the fake Steam admin will ask you to send items to a phony trading bot to \"verify\" the items.\n\n**How does the scam work?** This one is pretty simple: once you send your Steam account details or your items to this scammer, they'll be lost. They'll be free to withdraw any items of value from your account and drain it dry.\n\n**How do you know this is a scam?** There is no such thing as a \"steam admin\". [Steam Support also clearly states that \"Steam Support representatives will never ask you for your password\".](https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithAccountStolen#:~:text=Steam%20Support%20representatives%20will%20never%20ask%20you%20for%20your%20password.) \n\n#3) Gambling Site Promotion Scam [\\(see here for an example\\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNdHdxOVXXo)\n\nBy now you probably know how this starts. Someone out of the blue will add you on Steam and start asking you something. In this case he will ask you to help him promote his site through Steam, and in return you will be paid. He will then explain how the payment works. He'll link a gambling site and say he can control who wins the jackpot.\n\n**How does the scam work?** He will pick out a random player on the site, or ask you to pick one out, and he'll make him win the jackpot. Seeing as how he introduced himself as the owner, it's likely that he does indeed have the ability to manipulate the results. However none of the players or roulettes are real. They are all made up and don't link to actual profiles. The scammer will then ask you to bet items of your own and guarantee a win for you. You do as he says and it seems like he made you a winner as well, but of course, you can't seem to get your items back. He might even be cheeky and ask you to do it again. But he has your items and likely will not give them back, even if you ask nicely.\n\n**How do you know this is a scam?** There are no legitimate gambling sites on TF2 today. [They were taken down years ago after Valve was involved in lawsuits about involvement with illegal gambling.](https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/14/12186584/valve-gambling-statement-counter-strike) Anyone trying to peddle a gambling site today is relying on the chance that you don't know this. You might also notice that the gambling sites don't have real players who link to real profile pages, or that the conversations in the chat feed make no sense.\n\n#4) Mannco.store Bot Scam [\\(see here for an example\\)](https://preview.redd.it/237wdqgy2k0a1.png?width=1848&format=png&auto=webp&s=57929f2df8b74d3160dde2f2d026529ec3ed5034)\n\nMannco.store is a legitimate trading site, but it also attracts a lot of scammers who pose as admins or reroute you to fake bot accounts. A trader will add you, usually offering you an incredibly generous deal for your items, but wants to be extra sure that your items are real and you're not scamming them. How ironic. Their reasons will be one of the following: to check the value of your items, to have your items go through a verification process, or to check that your items are \"100% marketable\". Another version of this scam is a phony trade offer posing as a \"deposit request\" from people who might even threaten to delete your items if you don't cooperate.\n \n**How does the scam work?** You will be asked to verify your items through mannco.store. They'll guide you through the steps of adding a mannco.store bot, then you'll receive a new trade offer from an account that appears to be a real bot. [The trade offer will ask for your expensive items with nothing to give you in return.](https://i.imgur.com/HqIPp31.png) They are supposedly going to give your items right back after they \"verify\" them, but they won't. This bot account is a fake. Accept their trade and your items go bye-bye.\n\n**How do you know this is a scam?** Mannco.store explicitly tells you that [their staff will never contact you outside of their own internal messaging system](https://i.imgur.com/4CQk4vc.png). Any invites on Steam or discord from \"admins\" will be scammers. If you're looking to deposit items into your mannco.store account, only accept the trade link generated through their site. And once you do trade with a mannco.store bot, make sure that it's one of the bots from [this list on their website](https://mannco.store/bots), and also that the account is part of the [\"Mannco.store | Bots\" steam group](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/MANNCOBOT). You might recognize a fake bot account because [he'll join the \"Mannco.trade\" Steam group](https://i.imgur.com/XN0cLHi.png) but not the official bot group.\n\n#5) Particle Mayhem Scam (\"Vote for my artwork\" Scam) [\\(see here for an example\\)](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fpd7cle86n7lc1.png%3Fwidth%3D1703%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Df6f0919e2b2d35b8106b9fcc8660490dbf3c7064)\n\nThis scam is pretty similar to scam #1, but it's becoming common enough that maybe people need to be warned about this one in particular. Be wary of ANYBODY who asks you to do them a favor in exchange for payment.\n\n**How does the scam work?** It works the same way as the highlander vote scam. You'll be asked to vote for a custom particle effect in exchange for keys as payment. Now how does he want you to vote for his submission? Why through a fake steam login site, of course. Again this is just the highlander vote scam with a fresh coat of paint. These scammers are already reusing old scam methods.\n\n**How do you know this is a scam?** [\"Particle Mayhem 2\"](https://particle-mayhem-2.tf2maps.net/) is a real community contest created by the TF2Maps.net mapping community. However the official site warns that no one will be asked to log in to vote for any submissions. They even point out that the \"Malibu Sunset\" effect is not one of their official entries. It seems these scammers couldn't be bothered to link an actual submission and instead keep sending out the same fake one every time. The contest is also over and the winners announced, so anyone still trying to get votes for their submissions are either obvious scammers or time travelers. \n\n#\"What do I do if I accidentally logged into a scammer's website?\"\n\nAssuming it's not too late and your account/items haven't been stolen yet, go through the following steps:\n\n1) Change your Steam password\n\n2) Go to http://store.steampowered.com/twofactor/manage and deauthorize all devices from logging in to your Steam account.\n\n3) Go to your [Steam API Key page](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey) and click \u201cRevoke My Steam Web API key\u201d. This will turn your old API key obsolete and generate a new one. This way you make sure no one retrieves data through your Steam account\u2019s API.\n\n4) Reset your [Steam Trade URL.](https://steamcommunity.com/my/tradeoffers/privacy#trade_offer_access_url) This will disallow scammers from sending you trade offers once you made sure they cannot access your account. Make sure to add your new Trade URL to accounts on websites that you trust so you can otherwise keep on trading as per usual.\n\nBut if all else fails, you might still have a chance of recovering your Steam account by contacting Steam Support.\n\n\u00ad \n\nThose are the most common ones I see going around, but there are likely many more. To reiterate, don't trust any opportunity that seems too good to be true. Don't click on suspicious links from strangers. And immediately be very suspicious of random people adding you on Steam asking you for something. If you notice any of the telltale signs above, block the scammer and report their account on Steam. Steam two-factor authentication doesn't make your account bulletproof, especially if you are fooled into giving your Steam info away to strangers.",

            "PSA: There are many scammers out there, many of them with trash throwaway accounts that have \"thousands of hours\" on their account.  There's generally an easy way to find out if the player is legit or not - UNLESS that account they are adding you with has been hacked (please be careful).  **Now for many scam accounts who're fake, you can easily tell by doing this:**\n\nFollow this path:\n\n**View Profile -> Games -> Find their TF2 game listed... and now for the fun part.**\n\n**Click that pretty little list button that says \"View Stats\".**\n\n**Click the (Username)'s Stats.**\n\nand Voila!  Legitimate players will always have hours under their name in many varying classes.  This is VERY hard to mimic, **many throwaway accounts will have 0 hours listed on** ***every*** **single class even if their \"game time\" is listed at 2k+.**\n\n***But please, even if there is a person with some varying hours it may still be a hacked account - please do be careful out there!***",
