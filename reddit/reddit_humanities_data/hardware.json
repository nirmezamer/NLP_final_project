            ">Previously, the customer was responsible for buying and building appropriate server racks to house the hardware. Now, Nvidia is pushing customers to buy individual racks and even entire SuperPods \u2014 all coming direct from Nvidia. Nvidia claims this will boost GPU performance, and there's merit to such talk considering all the interlinks between the various GPUs, servers, racks, and even SuperPods. But there's also a lot of dollar bills changing hands when you're building data centers at scale.  \n>  \n>Nvidia's smaller customers might be ok with the company's offerings, but Microsoft wasn't. VP of Nvidia Andrew Bell reportedly asked Microsoft to buy a server rack design specifically for its new B200 GPUs that boasted a form factor a few inches different from Microsoft's existing server racks that are actively used in its data centers.  \n>  \n>Microsoft pushed back on Nvidia's recommendation, revealing that the new server racks would prevent Microsoft from easily switching between Nvidia's AI GPUs and competing offerings such as AMD's MI300X GPUs. Nvidia eventually backed down and allowed Microsoft to design its own custom server racks for its B200 AI GPUs, but it's probably not the last such disagreement we'll see between the two megacorps.",
