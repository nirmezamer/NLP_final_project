            "Hello! Naka receive ako ng sms and email about sa no annual fee for life but any amount spend siya hindi minimum of 20k. May mga naka experience na ba na ganitong same promo?",
            "Hello, may nakatanggap ba ng JUST FOR U na promo na SPEND ANY AMOUNT then NAFFL na? Legit ba yung spend any amount don?",
            "Got the approval email in less than 10 minutes lmao that was quick",
            "Hello! Ilang araw bago sila mag text na qualified for NAFFL na yung card mo? Kaka hit ko lang kasi ng 20k today and di pa posted yung ibang transactions. Thanks in advance!",
            "Na-approved ako for UB Rewards last February, and the same month na-accumulate ko yung need na 20k sa isang transaction (nagbook ng flight via ceb pac) then until now wala pa din ako narereceive na confirmation na NAFFL na yung card ko. Para naman sa referral gift, may successful refer ako last week of febuary and first week of march pero until now isa palang yung nare-received ko (received promo code last 2nd week of March).  \n\nMay mga nakareceived na ba ulet ng NAFFL message and promo code? Usually tuwing kailan sila nagssend ng message?",
            "Hi everyone. Just wanted to ask kailan po tayo makakuha ng reference no from Unionbank? Applied for a credit card pero yung binigay na reference no. is more than 12 or 7 digits and this from their physical pop up in Ayala Center Cebu.",
            "Hi, I just received a NAFFL email and sms. I've been using UB as (Payroll acct) for almost 2 years and I kind of need to have a credit card but the thing is I'm not sure why I got selected because I don't even store my savings to Unionbank. I used digital banks such as Maya for better interest. \n\nMy question is would my chances of being approved still high even though I don't store my savings to Unionbank?",
            "Hello, pasok po ba sa NAFFL promo spending ang pag bayad ng Sunlife insurance?",
            "UB naman payroll ko pwede kaya ako magrequest sa HR namin ng recommendation para makuha ko to as first CC?  4th month na ako sa work baka sakali lang.",
            "Hello, I have a simplicity credit card and I applied for Unionbank Rewards Platinum Visa last March 2024 and got approved the same day. I swiped around 30K+ installment for an Aircon also already. Qualified po ba sa NAFFL? Thank you!!"

Ito po ang situation:\n\nI have an 18k bill due in a few days and I want to pay it now but instead of 18k, balak ko ibayad sa CC ko ay 50k. Reason is I have an upcoming trip the next month and I want to use CC only.\n\n  \nThis is where my question applies. Next month kasi, meron din ako cc bill sa same card (marami akong nakainstallment) amounting to around 15k ata. And ayoko na sana magbayad next month kaya iaadvance ko na. If i pay 50k now, magkakaroon ng 32k na overpayment. Macocover din ba niya yung next month? Meaning next month, wala na akong babayaran? Or need ko pa rin bayaran yung mga nakainstallment for next month tapos negative lang yung due? \n\n  \nThanks in advance! Sana you can help this noob out huhu",

            "awww ok thanks po. Follow up question, yung overpayment ko po, mafree up niya ba yung current credit limit ko? for example: I have 26k remaining credit limit. Gagawin niya bang 58k yung limit or stay siya sa 26k pero negative lang yung due? Thanks po",
            "You can pay the total balance if and only if you don't have any installments remaining within the upcoming billing  and onwards. If yes, then it's recommended to only pay the outstanding balance and allocate properly to pay also the next month.\n\nYou can terminate the installment and pay it in full in the upcoming bill. However, you need to call their customer service. Do note, it may put added fees to do so.\n\nHence, it's just best to budget your money accordingly instead of paying in advance. Banks will not stop billing your credit card monthly."
