            "Here is my timeline for this card:\n\n\nFebruary 28 - Received email for Just-For-U Unionbank Rewards Card indicating NAFFL with Free 10,000 points* when I spend any amount upon receipt of the card. I applied same day because email is legit from Unionbank\n\nMarch 13 - Received text message from Go21 that my card delivery is being processed.\n\nMarch 18 - Card is delivered to me. \n\nMarch 19 - Activated the card and made the first swipe.\n\nApril 19 - Received congratulatory message from Unionbank that the annual fee of my UnionBank REWARDS VISA PLATINUM Credit Card is WAIVED FOR LIFE. My total accumulated spend up until that date is only Php16,335.20 so I think any amount spend is legit.",
            "i just got the [naffl congratulatory message](https://i.imgur.com/FqzO11b.png) from unionbank, i havent reached even 20k (i\u2019m at 19k tho), this is also my first credit card, i thought i was unqualified based on the t&c. anyone else?\n\n\nedit: \n\ni checked kaskasan buddies on facebook and it looks like they're doing mass naffl approvals.",
            "Hello! Naka receive ako ng sms and email about sa no annual fee for life but any amount spend siya hindi minimum of 20k. May mga naka experience na ba na ganitong same promo?\u00a0",
            "Hello, may nakatanggap ba ng JUST FOR U na promo na SPEND ANY AMOUNT then NAFFL na? Legit ba yung spend any amount don?",
            "WARNING: Unionbank is SCAMMY - hidden charges  \nI got one of their promo cards that's supposed to have no annual fees for life. Our office submitted requirements for us and it was approved.\n\nThis is the gold credit card with the lowest credit limit. I usually just pay for the entire amount through the app,  reviewing the transaction history also there.\n\nBUT today I decided to review the actual PDF of the statement and I saw that there are \"U-Protect\" charges every month. I called their hotline to ask what that was.\n\nThey told me it's \"in case of death UB may give you up to 400k\". So I said I never signed up for this. UB said it's in the terms and conditions. I said it's fine but where is the information about this \"life insurance\" and I never got any email or details about this. How is anyone supposed to claim the supposed insurance? They couldn't answer me. \n\n  \nSo I reviewed past statements and the U-Protect charges are all different also. Ranging from Php80 to about 200 plus. They said that you're charged .36 cents for every 100 pesos you spend. HUHHHH\n\nSo the more you use the card, the higher this \"insurance\" payment will be. The call center agent said yes. it's so scammy and unfair. So they can't reverse the charges anymore. But they can cut the insurance. I can't get the money back.\n\nI had them cut the credit card. You can't even do this in their branches. I was on the phone for more than 2 hours just to do this.  \n  \nTLDR: Review the PDF of your statements. They don't put it in transaction history! Super scammy move to hide this \"insurance\" in terms and conditions. GO FOR ANOTHER BANK.",

            "Hello! Ilang araw bago sila mag text na qualified for NAFFL na yung card mo? Kaka hit ko lang kasi ng 20k today and di pa posted yung ibang transactions. Thanks in advance!",
            "Hello Everyone, I just got approved for the UB Rewards Platinum Visa. I have a few question po.\n\n1. Is the NAFFL promo still ongoing?\n\n2. If yes, okay lang ba na mag purchase ako ng 20,000 worth of items then installment ko siya for 6 months in the physical store for example, counted ba siya kahit mag exceed ng 60 days?\n\n3. Also, counted po ba mga online shops like Lazada, Shopee, Ikea, etc...\n\n4. Since my account is new, and this is my first ever CC, sa UB app po ba, maconvert ko yung single purchase ko to installment?\n\nThank you all so much! \n\nPs. I tried reading the T&C but still I want to know from you guys your experience.",
            "hi, i just received the same credit card after getting the email that qualified for it. When I activated the card in the UB App, My credit limit shows it\u2019s only 15,000 and 0 points. This is my first credit card, what should I do to get the NAFFL and Free 10k points that was offered to me?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8t76acopz5zc1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10a2f940d69c0b8273e76df681b9856c3458d677"

They cannot operate in PH unless BSP invites the companies to work with banks. A certification from MC Visa AMEX also happens. Takes one year to implement. I have no idea in PH but maybe discussions are already happening.. who knows\n\nIts not because of Apple does not want. Its because our banks and central bank do not have the initiative or are too overwhelmed with the requirements.
