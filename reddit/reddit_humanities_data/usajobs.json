            "Thats very strange that they used the phrase you have been selected with as a candidate.  Every referred person is a candidate, you have been selected indicates you are being extended the job.  The HR person didnt do a good job writing that up, in my opinion.  The question about your willingness to relocate without a paid move and your understanding that its not a remote position normally comes when they invite you to interview.  Its understandable that the phrase you have been selected would confuse you, but it looks like they are preparing to interview you, you have not yet been chosen by the hiring authority for the position.  As others have said, youre significantly past the June 3 date, so likely theyve completed interviews by now and you missed the boat.",
            "If you did not respond by the June 3 date, you probably missed the boat. You should answer the question. Edit: SEP and Public Affairs are more than likely not the same manager. Good luck!",
            "Let HR know your intention.",
            "I would send a follow-up email: \"I'm just checking on the status; do you need anything from me?\" Nothing over the top, just a friendly poke.\n\nIt's a strangely worded email, so I would continue pursuing other options in case they're stringing you along. Good luck.",
            "I replied before the June 3 date.  When I replied they emailed me back  thanking me for my continued interest in the position and said theyre currently reviewing resumes and will be in touch soon.  That was about a month ago.  They havent gotten back to me since.",
            "The wheels turn slowly. But you kept yourself in the running. Good luck.",
            "Ok.  The HR person (or likely the secretary or admin of the hiring authority) did a bad job of wording that email.  You have been selected has a meaning and it was misapplied here.  The admin probably took the resumes of those who agreed they would move without a relocation package and didnt mind going to the office and gave them to the hiring authority to review.  The hiring authority didnt want to waste time interviewing people who werent eligible for selection/not willing to accept the terms.  Its been over 3 weeks so although its possible they havent conduced interviews yet, its not likely.  Keep applying, something will work out.",
            "With land management agencies its usually the actual  future supervisor sending these emails, not someone in HR. HR hands over the cert and steps away until the supervisor provides a selection. Ive gotten some weird emails before. Guessing its a new supervisor who doesnt know the lingo yet."

The offer listed my home town as the duty station, which to me confirmed that it was remote since there are no agency facilities near here. When I reached out, the HR rep said that was an error, they now require in-person attendance twice a week. She said they're working on trying to get me a remote waiver but not to hold my breath. \n\nAnyone else ever get an offer where the details differed significantly from the job you applied for, and how did you handle it? Is there some kind of truth-in-advertising rule regarding federal job postings? ",

Ive been hopeful but assuming the worst with the RTO freight train. Got an email yesterday to confirm my address for locality calculation. Theres still hope!",
            "Sounds like the position was changed from remote to telework. Unlikely that youll have any pull in convincing someone to allow you to work fully remote. Being able to telework 3 days a week is better than most federal positions. Either accept that its now a telework position (which telework can be rescinded at anytime) or turn down the FJO and HR will move on to the second choice for the position.",
            "This happened to a friend of mine. The posting said remote. After she accepts the TJO, HR tells her they made a mistake and says it is 2 days a week in the office. She complained to HR several times, and they told her she could take the job with 2 days in the office as that was all they could offer. She wanted this job so badly, it was her dream job, and it was a promotion and a significant raise in pay. She kept being stubborn about it because she had a specialized skill set, one of the really niche healthcare positions. I kept telling her they would give it to someone else if you kept this up. Then she went to the union to get them involved. So she is waiting for the FJO to be sent and instead of an FJO, they send an email telling her the job was being canceled. They reposted 2 days later with 3 days of telework and they ended up choosing someone else. Someone out of the 333 million people in the United States, will have the same skill set as you, the same experience, and work at the same level as you. You are not special to the Government. We are expendable, we are all just a number in a file cabinet somewhere.",

I have been thinking of giving the two weeks notice AFTER receiving my FJO, as anything can happen with background checks, or potential denial of clearance, or offer being randomly rescinded, etc., but now I\u2019m reading that 1. You don\u2019t resign per se as is a transfer? And 2. That your new HR will contact your current HR which can then contact your current supervisor!? Is that true? So he\u2019s gonna know before I receive the FJO? That\u2019s awkward lol. What do people do in this case? Do they give supervisor notice with only a TJO? Also, kinda wild that they coordinate start date with current supervisor if true. Like, respectfully, why are we asking them? Shouldn\u2019t that be a choice between new center and applicant? What if they don\u2019t want me to start until like 3 months? Kinda confused so yeah looking for any more insight. Thanks!",
