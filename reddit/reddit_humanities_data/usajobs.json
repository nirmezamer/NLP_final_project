            "Thanks to u/head_staff_9416 for the incredible effort in making all those many informative posts! \n\nWikis are sort of my thing and I wanted to see what all the info would look like in one place, in a wiki. Thanks to the mods of r/usajobs for letting me in to build that.\n\nThe **wiki is a work in progress** and if you have areas that should be fleshed out or whatever, please let us (or me) know. I have not even finished bringing in all of the information from Head_Staff's posts.\n\nOne of the main reasons I like wiki formatting is that with proper formatting, the table of contents allows linking specific sections, like this:  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/usajobs/wiki/guide#wiki_grades2\n\nSo it may be possible to more accurately target answers when needed.\n\nThe \"Real Timelines\" was my own addition. I am proud of that bit. :) My tiny contribution...\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/usajobs/wiki/guide#wiki_real_timelines",
            "The US Department of Treasury has a weekly \"How to write your Federal Resume\" presentation if anyone wants to join in. I joined one of them and it is very informative. It is for applicants within and outside of the Federal government.\n\n[https://home.treasury.gov/about/careers-at-treasury/career-information-sessions](https://home.treasury.gov/about/careers-at-treasury/career-information-sessions)\n\n**Just a heads up:** The presentation is about one hour and a half but be prepared to stay in for the Q&A session too because there is a lot of good information that also can come out there too, depending on what kind of questions are asked by the participants.",

The offer listed my home town as the duty station, which to me confirmed that it was remote since there are no agency facilities near here. When I reached out, the HR rep said that was an error, they now require in-person attendance twice a week. She said they're working on trying to get me a remote waiver but not to hold my breath. \n\nAnyone else ever get an offer where the details differed significantly from the job you applied for, and how did you handle it? Is there some kind of truth-in-advertising rule regarding federal job postings? ",

            "So where would you have to report to if there\u2019s no agency facility near your town?",
            "Sounds like the position was changed from remote to telework. Unlikely that you\u2019ll have any pull in convincing someone to allow you to work fully remote. Being able to telework 3 days a week is better than most federal positions. Either accept that it\u2019s now a telework position (which telework can be rescinded at anytime) or turn down the FJO and HR will move on to the second choice for the position.",
            "Already accepted the TJO, also trying to use this as leverage with my current agency to get our team made remote since we just lost our most senior staff member for a remote job",

            "I asked a similar question a little while ago. \n\nShort answer: yes there is a significant drop in jobs.\n\nThe funding situation for this year has been abysmal for a lot of different agencies. Multiple entire departments are on hiring freezes. I\u2019ve had multiple postings cancelled on me when I was in the interview process in the past 6 months due to funding issues in a variety of agencies. I\u2019m in the economics/statistics/math field and the prospects are pretty bleak. The best we can hope for is a better funding outcome in the next couple months from Congress, but until then there will be very few postings unfortunately. I feel your pain!",
            "For my job within the USDA, there's a hiring freeze for probably until next fiscal year. Though, we haven't done any hiring since last October due to budget.",
            "i noticed the same thing. id imagine it has something to do with election year. dont quote me on it but if you have any friends that work in fed ask what their 2 cents is.",
            "this is the result of the continuing resolutions and not having a budget for most of the FY. FY resets october 1st, we'll see if the clowns in congress can get their shit together and make a budget, also potentially the election year.\n I know some of the DoD agencies are hiring like normal (big budget), VHA is a crapshoot, I've seen some other agencies according to posts here  slow down on hiring.\n\nMost agency budgets were slashed and or not adjusted for inflation.",
            "There will most likely be a hiring freeze if trump wins as I was impacted the first time he won. My eod was that Feb and it pushed into April. Historically, if the White House is republican there is a hiring freeze. \n\nFor current hiring we are near q4 of fiscal year when folks are out of labor dollars for new billets and with uncertainty of future budgets. We are being to do more with less people. Paying who we have on staff some ot versus filling vacant billets.",
            "during election years, contracts can get hung up. I have noticed it more these past 7 years around June/July time things start to slow down till September then its a mad dash to spend the rest of the money left over and the deadline before end of FY.\n\nThe DoD is gonna start changing more to a commercial based supply chain theory for a better streamlined system.",
            "Current fed and our budget was cut by 10% this year on top of an across the board salary increase of close to 5% with no way of funding it has us in a hiring freeze currently.",

            "I've noticed my agency within HHS is majority posting internal jobs now. Rarely open to the public. We lost some funding and this is coming after a big hiring push 1-2 years ago (when many of my coworkers including myself were hired). \n\nUnfortunately I don't see things improving with federal hiring as the new fiscal year starts in October"

            "I went yesterday. It was a bit rough. I got there at 9:45 and it took 1.5 hours to get in the door. I did stop at FEMA and inquired about Management and Program Analyst positions. To their credit a hiring manager at FEMA actually took the time to thoroughly look through my resume. I didn't get that with any other agency. She said I would be a good for a position but they didn't have one at the moment but she kept my resume and would reach out to me in the future if one opens up.\n\n I applied to one position on site with another agency but after suffering from QR code-induced trauma I left around 2 pm. I didn't want to risk my car getting towed because I had to park at the Walmart parking lot.",

I have project management experience in the tech space but was looking for anything and everything to get my foot in the door.\n\nAll in all, had an interview with FEMA for a web content role, and about 3-4 hiring managers tell me they will reach out to me in the coming weeks for opportunities that will be opening up.\n\nLike u/Blend-In24 said, only time will tell if anything comes out of these.",
            "It was crazy with lots of attendees, but have special entrance so didn't go through normal line. My colleagues were giving TJOs to people. \n\nI was manning a booth across from FEMA. FEMA line not as bad as USCIS or CISA.",
            "I got in line at 9:50 and got inside at 11. Lines got worse for booths as it got later which makes sense. Some booths were fruitful with getting contact information and genuine interest. Others I stood in line for 20-30 minutes to simply be told to apply on USA Jobs. Overall I think it was worth it to meet some hiring managers and hand a physical resume, but time will tell if any offers come out of it.",
            "I got like two offers from USCIS and one from TSA but it was a tiring experience with all that standing plus the building was a bit too cold for me. Not sure what the next steps would be but fingers crossed",

But it consistently seems like there is someone sober is at the wheel contending with a passenger who is high on bath salts who really wants to drive.\n\nWant to make sure that quality people don't end up in the federal government? Waste their time and disappoint them.",
            "I waited at 4 different tables at the FEMA booth just for them all to send me to someone else and eventually tell me there was nobody there who could talk about my series/applications. Wasted an hour and a bit to not do anything but wait around. At least the entry line was pretty short at 1:30\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"
