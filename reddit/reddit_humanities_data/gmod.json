        "content": "TL;DR:\n\nIf your game [looks like this](https://i.imgur.com/5l9rR6w.png) then [buy this](http://store.steampowered.com/app/240/) or [follow this](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=284329110), alternatively here's [a video if you prefer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6fg5-rq4cE).\n\n***\nYou probably just bought Gmod and joined a server only to be greeted by [something like this](https://i.imgur.com/5l9rR6w.png), am I right?\n\nDon't worry, there's actually nothing wrong. I know it looks bad but that's pretty normal, (if you plan on playing Gmod, or any Source Engine game for that matter, you'll run into this a lot) and easy to fix. The most common reason why you're seeing this is that you don't own/have Counter-Strike: Source installed and mounted to Garry's Mod.\n\nIf you don't already own [Counter Strike: Source](http://store.steampowered.com/app/240/) then I'd recommend buying it while it's on sale for the holidays, however, if you don't want to buy and install a game you'll probably never play then you can follow [this guide to get the models and textures for free](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=284329110). Alternatively, if you prefer [following along with a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6fg5-rq4cE) here's one that shows step by step what to do.\n\nA user on our Discord made [a very handy little tool](https://github.com/ITS-NIGHTOWL/CSSource-Texture-Installer/) that will extract the CSS content you need using SteamCMD for you. I highly recommend using it if you're having trouble doing it manually.\n\nIf, however, you already own CSS then:\n\n* Install it\n\n* Open up the game from your Steam Library and play it (At least til you get to the start menu)\n\n* Exit out of the game and open up Garry's Mod",
