            "What exactly is Heavenly Restriction? \n\nI find it confusing that Maki and Toji have no CE, so they can't create curses like other non-sorcerers, but it's not like they don't have the emotions that would create CE. And they didn't choose the restriction unlike other Vows.",

            "In the Shibuya arc, why did Gojo not even attempt to blitz Choso, Jogo, or Mahito after he popped his .2 second domain? It does state that the cursed spirits could've awakened at any moment. Gojo still likely would have had 10 solid seconds to try to dispatch one of them. \nWhy target the transfigured humans that likely would've been out of commission for a very long time after experiencing Infinite Void?",
            "How old are the disaster curses? \n\nMahito is the youngest at couple months, and Dagon is a bit older, but still relatively young.\n\nJogo and Hanami might be around Gojo\u2019s age since curses were getting stronger to balance out his birth. Maybe even younger because they didn\u2019t seem to know who Gojo was. They must not be around that long since they didn\u2019t make any big moves to further their goal of replacing humans. At least, moves that would\u2019ve gotten them registered by jujutsu society.",
            "why did multiple important members of jujutsu high not know that Sukuna could use an open barrier domain? This seems like an actual plot hole/gege forgot moment\n\nChoso knows kenjaku could do it, Itadori has the memories of it + Inumaki was inside of it \n\nThese two things together should at least prompt jujutsu high to be aware of the possibility instead of being completely befuddled.\n\nI find it hard to believe that they didn't discuss this during the month-long preparation considering their plans' depth.",

            "I coukd be wrong but it's apparently cuz of all the binding vows he did + the lack of his other hands",
            "we don\u2019t know what it means in effect, but symbolically it shows Sukuna\u2019s resilience\n\nThe reason Sukuna is so strong is not only because he can make Binding Vows, but because he has so much, he can easily adapt to any disadvantages he faces\n\nHe was weakened in his fights against Maki and Higu (i think it was them) who cut off two of his hands respectively. He adapts to this by stealing what he \u201clearned\u201d from Gojo and using his domain symbol\n\nSukuna will steal whatever he can from whoever he can, and abuse it until he is literally forced by the power system to stop, only for him to trade it for something better. Him stealing Gojo\u2019s domain hand sign because he can\u2019t use his own is a perfect example of this"

            " Yeah, it\u2019s weird that people call shrine boring but wanted Gojo vs Sukuna to not have 10S\u2026like in what world is Shrine vs Infinity better than Shrine + 10S and infinity? Round 1 of the fight is almost how a Sukuna mostly using shrine would fight the battle, but without DE, he couldn\u2019t really do nothing. Sukuna having a cursed tool or application of shrine that somehow can bypass Gojos hyper specific hax would be critiqued anyway",
            "Agreed. People act like Sukuna using Mahoraga is fraudulent but without Mahoraga, the fight wouldn't even last 6 chapters and would be pretty boring. Mahoraga or rather the Adaptation process is one of the key factors as to why Gojo vs Sukuna is so entertaining",
            "Yea the fight would definitely not be as long or fun if not for the shadows.",
            "Fax if there were no 10s the fight would've been finished at the domains.",
            "Sukuna's ultimate motive was to overcome the limitless CT as a whole by making his own CT even better thus Mahoraga and Gojo were really a means to achieve that\n\nRemember when Sukuna called Gojo \"painfully ordinary\" we all laughed at it but looking back it may have been more to it than him simply mocking Gojo cz by that time Gojo hadnt pushed sukuna far enough to  really force and upgrade on his CT\n\nAnd in 236 he remarked how happy he was and he wld never forget Gojo right after improving his CT and finally overcoming the limitless",
            "No matter which way Sukuna won, people (Gojo fans) will always be mad about it. If he was in yuji (let's imagine Megumi didn't exist, a 19 finger yujikuna in this instance) and the fight got to a point where they both didn't have their domains, then Gege gives Gojo 5 more chapters of him styling on Sukuna before Sukuna figuring out the WS then one shotting him, people will still be this mad and question why Sukuna is so smart in the first place. Gege knowing killing Gojo will make his fandom seethe and rage for years to come decided 'Hey, if they are going to be mad, let me find a way to maximize their rage!'. hence we had Gojo seemingly winning for so many chapters, feeding the narrative that he was so much stronger than Sukuna. Then the agenda also raised the egos of Gojo fans, making them even more sure that Gege would never give Gojo the direct L in that fight. They pretty much expected kenny to swoop in and take sukuna and run away or sum like he did with mahito. So when reality (236) hit, it was like a tidal wave came crashing on their perception of the fight. Egos were hurt, minds were bruised, hopes were dashed, and we haven't heard the end of it till now \ud83d\ude16\n\n  \nI imagine if Sukuna had the 10S and didn't use it to fight but still won, there will be crazy agendas like 'the limitless is so complex, even Sukuna knew and couldn't use the 10S to deal with it' and we'll start seeing some absurd infinity+UV scaling cross verse, and no one will be able to provide a good counter argument. But with what happened, it just showed us limitless is still a CT, no matter how complex it is, Maho just needed 4 spins to adapt fully to it. Kinda omega busted.",
            "I feel like  the fight would have been received a lot better if there was just a small extra thing to show gojos Death, Honestly if they had cut kusakabes speech bubble in half while he said gojo wins it would have been better, or the entire manga page having a line through it, (as he cut the world)",
            "I agree. Does that mean mahoraga was made specifically for Sukuna to fight Gojo on down the road?",
            "And yet the fight was still massively underwhelming because it ended out of nowhere. An unsatisfying conclusion sours the whole thing.\n\nThe middle part of the battle where Gojo was fighting against both Sukuna and Mahoraga was fluid and interesting. The problems arise in that, after the climax of the fight where a cool move puts the whole thing in Gojo's favour, we don't restart the momentum with the multiple gamechanging moves in Sukuna's arsenal we just cut to Gojo dead. Sukuna's can now bypass Infinity but he's effectively lost the ten shadows, they're both domainless and Sukuna still has a reincarnation in reserve that should be the start of the second cllimax of the fight, not the abrupt end. If Sukuna's way to bypass infinity which didn't instantly kill and let the fight continue to a more satisfying death for Gojo there would be 1000x less complaints."

        "content": "A common line in other subreddits is \"I refuse to believe that Higuruma didn't encounter at least one cursed tool user\" or \"How did Higuruma not train with at least one cursed tool user during the month timeskip?\" \n\nHowever, I find this pretty easy to believe, based on the following pieces of evidence:\n\n1. There are very few existing cursed tools that already existed within the Culling Game barriers.\n -  No Culling Game colonies were created over the locations of known Cursed Tool stockpiles. \n - Kenjaku lost control of Juzo Kimiya's stockpile, as [Maki was able to access the workshop and take a tool from it.](https://i.imgur.com/0NUVSpu.png)\n - [The Zenin clan has a stockpile of cursed tools, and it was destroyed by Zenin Ogi in Perfect Preparation.](https://i.imgur.com/0NUVSpu.png)\n - Jujutsu High has a stockpile of Cursed Objects in general, due to Jujutsu Society wanting to centralise all cursed objects for safeguarding. This stockpile [may be tied to the Kamo clan](https://i.imgur.com/zTFCqo6.png), due to the fact that the Death Painting Wombs were likely property of the Kamo clan, but are stored in the Jujutsu High stockpile.\n - No colony was created in these locations.\n - Cursed tools worth their while are rare, and expensive as a result: Playful Cloud costs [500 million yen in 2018](https://i.imgur.com/gcpSj1Q.png), which is 4,560,600USD ($5,701,321.82 today, accounting for inflation of USD), at a bare minimum. This is a cursed tool that does not have a cursed technique. \n -  Even though Kenjaku has control of the Kamo clan stockpile, Kenjaku does not have any reason to distribute weapons to the Culling Game players. This achieves nothing. \n - Of the confirmed Cursed Tools that originate in the Colonies, two are part of the operation of a Cursed Technique: [Charles' staff fills with ink as his technique progresses, and is used to initiate his technique.](https://i.imgur.com/rnoKnhE.png) Higuruma's Mallet [is created by his technique](https://i.imgur.com/iZiYo2c.png), and becomes the Executioner's Sword. Kashimo's staff is a religious object, and isn't confirmed to be a Cursed Tool, and shows no indication of being one.\n - If a Cursed Tool is part of a Cursed Technique, then confiscating either the Cursed Tool or Cursed Technique would have the same result, and may in fact be the same thing. \n - Unlike the reincarnated sorcerers, the Cursed Spirits are not reincarnated into human bodies, but had formed contracts with Kenjaku, and retained their possessions. Kurorushi pulls a sword out of his body. It may be part of Kurorushi's Cursed Technique, but if it isn't, then it has retained it from prior to the start of the Culling Game.\n - Reincarnated sorcerers are incarnated into the bodies of ordinary people, who do not have Cursed Tools.\n2. Cursed tools are not easy to create.\n - We've only seen three people explicitly capable of creating Cursed Tools that extend beyond repeated use: [Juzo Kimiya](https://i.imgur.com/mGnI2im.png), [Zenin Mai](https://i.imgur.com/Ze086zC.png), and [Yorozu](https://i.imgur.com/CJqHc5I.png). Note that the last two individuals were only able to create high tier Cursed Tools by sacrificing their life.\n - Tools created via repeated use take more than several years to create: In Miwa vs Maki, Gege notes that Miwa's sword is a ['sorta-cursed tool' created from repeated cursed energy infusion](https://i.imgur.com/oYzIn4E.png). Miwa's sword is broken by Kenjaku with his bare hands. Nanami's Cleaver is another example of a cursed tool created through repeated use, over a longer period of time than Miwa, [but it was only a cursed tool after his death.](https://i.imgur.com/8hphe6G.png)\n4. For many sorcerers, there are reasons not to use Cursed Tools.\n - Modern Jujutsu society has a taboo against the use of weapons overall, which extends to Cursed Tools: Part of the reason for the heavy discrimination against Toji and Maki was because they *needed* to use Cursed Tools. [Naoya looks down on the other Zenin clan members for needing weapons, while pointing this fact out.](https://i.imgur.com/02Bwf45.png) The re-incarnated sorcerers are believed to have [a mindset that revolves around strength and battle.\n](https://i.imgur.com/EqqhHkd.png) It's likely they may have a similar form of taboo.\n - Cursed Tools require weapon training to use effectively, and most Jujutsu High sorcerers involved in the Culling Games only appear to have rudimentary weapons training at best.\n - Many have fighting styles that a weapon is unaccommodating to, such as Yuji and Todo. Using a Cursed Tool would require a total change in how they operate.\n - [Naoya's reasoning behind the taboo is sound: if you disarm a sorcerer who is wholly reliant on their weapon, or break their weapon, they will be helpless.](https://i.imgur.com/QdDnIqr.png)\n - [Against a Cursed Spirit of a significantly lower power than Sukuna, a blow from a Grade 1 sorcerer using a powerful Special Grade Cursed Tool on a weak spot was not sufficient to kill it.](https://i.imgur.com/coTGD7G.png) Even if the tool is worthwhile to use generally, it may not be useful enough to use against Sukuna.\n\n4. Higuruma has no reason to use his domain on a Cursed Tool or weapons user during the timeskip.\n - Maki is immune to his Domain.\n - There's no real training Higuruma can do with Ino, beyond casual sparring, Using his Domain on Ino would not achieve anything.\n - Mei Mei is a weapons user, but it's unknown if her weapon is a Cursed Tool, and she isn't the type to casually spar. Her contribution to training has been enabling switch training.\n - Yuta's sword likely isn't a Cursed Tool, given that he frequently breaks it. His other Cursed Tools aren't relevant to the plan, so he has no need to train with them.\n - Kashimo's staff probably isn't a Cursed Tool, and Higuruma has nothing to gain from training with Kashimo. Kashimo doesn't seem like the type to particularly participate in the training.\n - Kusakabe's sword likely isn't a Cursed Tool. The school of which he is a student is focused on allowing sorcerers who are disadvantage to succeed ('A domain for the weak'). It makes no sense for him to be reliant on a Cursed Tool, and he is able to respond [to his sword breaking by the use of one of his school's techniques.](https://i.imgur.com/XDQdDMO.png)\n - The other sorcerers who don't use weapons already have no reason to start to do so. Their time is better spent refining their skills or overcoming their weaknesses, rather than trying to pick up the effective use of a weapon (a skill that can take several years).\n\nSo, given that Cursed Tools are rare and mostly monopolised by Jujutsu society, it is unlikely that among the 20 sorcerers that Higuruma fought to gain 100 points, any of them had a Cursed Tool. Even if he did fight a Cursed Tool user, it may be that he did not need to use his Domain against them, as the type of sorcerer who is overly reliant on their Cursed Tool is likely one insufficiently skilled to take on Higuruma. During the 1 month time skip, he had no real reason to use his Domain on anyone who uses a Cursed Tool. In addition, sorcerers do not inherently know how their technique works. As of such, it is very easy for Higuruma to have never encountered anyone with a Cursed Tool, and not know this oddity of his technique, given how few battles he has fought, and the conditions they took place in.",

            "Most people in disagreement can\u2019t provide an argument against it, they just don\u2019t like how convenient it is for Sukuna.",
            "Honestly all it would've taken to make the convenience of the plot point better was to show Sukuna actually planning things out.\n\nCurrently Sukuna feels very passive in that encounter, i.e. it felt like he had no agency in what was confiscated and lucked into a situation that neither he nor Higuruma expected.\n\nIf instead Sukuna had monologued about how he saw the domain from inside Yuji, speculated about what would happen if there were multiple cursed techniques in the domain during the confiscation, figured out a Cursed Weapon with a CT imbued would count as a valid target for confiscation, and asked Uraume to drop off Kamutoke after his battle with Gojo, then it would play much better.\n\nWe'd have bought it. He's shown to be obsessive about figuring out the limits of CTs and he has shown himself to be unparalleled in Jujutsu knowledge with the exception of maybe Gojo.\n\nYou could maybe even throw some banter about Yorozu and her love being worthless in there as he sacrifices the cursed weapon.\n\nWithout agency the situation feels contrived because you can almost see the hand of the author carve a path for Sukuna to overcome specific situations.",
            "Sorry, I probably missed it, but I thought Ogi just emptied the storeroom before maki got there so as to set up a trap without her being able to use any of those tools to fight back. I tried to click the hyperlink you put for it, but it just brings me to the juzo kamiya evidence.",
            "Good post but there\u2019s one thing I saw your confused about. In general, a cursed tool is just any weapon that has been infused with cursed energy consistently. Which means that any weapon a prominent sorcerer is wielding is most definitely a cursed tool. Nanami\u2019s blunt blade (while he was alive), Mei Mei\u2019s axe, Yuta\u2019s katana\u2019s are all cursed tools because cursed tools are literally just tools imbued with CE for a while\n\nAnything Maki wields before her power up is also most definitely a cursed tool, since she isnt capable of controlling cursed energy in the first place, all her weapons have been imbued with a decent amount of CE. This means that there are probably dozens if not more of readily available cursed tools for sorcerers to use in the storehouse",
            "I don't care. I just wanted to see sukuna beat everyone without his technique and show them that it doesn't matter what tricks they pull he's still leagues above them. Besides even if higuruman did take his technique ad whip the executioners sword you know with sukuna wouldn't lose. He'd kill higuruma and get it right back because he's him.",
            "The fact that Higurama only found out during his fight with Yuji that he can also confiscate Cursed Energy should have prompted him to experiment with Domain Expansion more. The sorcerers should clearly be aware that not even Higurama knows the true workings of his CT so they should have started thinking what else his domain was capable of and trying it during the preparations.",
            "Good legwork dude. Great read. Agree with you. When I first read the chapter where it doesn't take sukunas technique, I was surprised yeah, but it kinda made sense at the same time. You confiscate objects ya know? Would make sense it takes precident. Didn't think that before hand so I'm definitely not blaming higu for it",
            "You do not need to break it down for the sub, it'll always end with 'I REFUSE to believe.....' so facts don't matter to what you WANT to believe. It's what makes us human. We believe in things we WANT to, not NEED to.",
            "OP, I get what you're trying to do here, and I hope this doesn't come across badly, but if I get a character setting of a \"genius lawyer\" who graduated from Toudai who's known for his intelligence, then I would really expect him to, I don't know, plan a little better? Unless he got his degree from [wish.com](http://wish.com), of course.\n\nThe HS group spent over a month making plans B, C, D in the event of Gojo's death (I have so many comments to say on this, but not the point here), but it's very...telling how most of these plans BCD just, naturally made a bunch of assumptions that they really shouldn't have made if you looked at things logically. Higuruma assuming that his CT would automatically take away inherent qualities such as CT or CE away from the judged, is really quite a huge reach, especially if, as you say, he's a new sorcerer who's supposed to be really really smart, who should've been aware of the limits of his knowledge regarding his own abilities. In fact, we see Higuruma planning for all the different crimes that they can use to charge Sukuna so they can get a definite conviction, but not his thinking about the limitations of his abilities. If he can have doubts about whether they can charge Sukuna successfully, shouldn't he have at least tested his own abilities then before assuming that this will be a surefire success?\n\nI'm sorry but it just doesn't really match up with the character setting. But like I said in a comment above, there's also not much I can do to complain against it, since Gege actually never said explicitly what Judgeman would take away. So of course he's free to fill in the blanks however he wishes, no matter how unsatisfying it can feel to the audience.\n\nEDIT: You also really shouldn't be using Playful Cloud as a basis of estimating the average cost of Cursed Tools, that's also a flawed assumption. We know that it's a Special Grade tool, but not every Cursed Tool is Special Grade. So assuming that all Cursed Tools, or the average cost of Cursed Tools, are all in the same ballpark of Playful Cloud doesn't really make much sense. \n\nAt the same time, I'm not sure why you're assuming that only \"worthwhile\" Cursed Tools would be confiscated. Based on what we know at this point, if used on Zenin Mai, it could very well confiscate one of her bullets. \"Worthwhile\" or not doesn't really, and shouldn't really factor into the equation."

Should Yuji have a blicky? Should the military get involved?   ",

            "This was basically the point of the very short military invasion and the reminder that killing sorcerers without using cursed energy can result in them coming back as a curse with Maki.",
            "Non-sorcerers doing it would be pointless. Unless you can add on Cursed Energy or kill the curse a sorcerer can become, you\u2019re only making the situation worse.\n\nAs for conventional weapons for sorcerers? It depends on the character. Ancient sorcerers just don\u2019t know how they work and probably don\u2019t want to learn based on their mentalities. The Gojo squad more or less picks weapons they like for various reasons. And modern sorcerers\u2026 are (reasonably) scared to. There\u2019s always the factor of \u201cincreasing gun use will increase emotions associated with guns will increase curses\u201d. You stick with the tried and true methods cause any change could be disastrous.",
            "It's pointless. Vengeful curse spirits would come back and kill them and the normal curse spirits would kill them all at night. You need sorcerers.",
            "Kenjaku said it\u2019s smart but that\u2019s because 90% of sorcerers are average. You didn\u2019t see Kenjaku get hit did you? Neither did I.\n\nConventional weapons are cool and all and probably effective but they\u2019re like an agreement between HQ and the government on interventions as those weapons aren\u2019t infused with cursed energy meaning they\u2019d just make the problem worse.",
            "Japan doesn\u2019t have a military for WW2 reasons\u2026Defense force is probably pissing themselves and hiding though",
            "Gege did a horrible job explaining. But yes the leaders of the Japanese government, and the emperor are apart of the jujutsu shenanigans and helped keeping it covered up. The guy who angel and the others save in 209 or 210 (I can't remember) gives a vagueish explanation on why they aren't getting involved and why they haven't in the past. And also kenjaku having a seat at the table is another big reason. He essentially assured that no one would interrupt what is going on. \n\nAlso, despite kenjaku saying this, he later contradicts himself by saying the military never stood a chance against sorcerers and cursed spirits. Proven by the fact that grenades and snipers werent even enough to damage the helicopter head sorcerer (I'm assuming he was around grade 2)\n\nI'd love to give a less paraphrased and more detailed answer to your questions but then I'd have to re-read. \n\nAs for what Japanese military, or defense forces have been doing since shibuya, they've probably been working tirelessly for the population in making evacuation shelters and defending the citezens. Think about the scale of what just happened and how long it would take to make things right. They'd need longer than a month. Most nations in real life could barely deal with covid. They're probably leaving the jujutsu stuff to jujutsu sorcerers",
            "The US military got stomped pretty quickly. Everyone forgot about them\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",
            "Because JuJutsu sorcerers must only be killed with cursed energy attacks or cursed weapons. If not then they will come back as vengeful spirits.\n\nIt was whole reason Kenjaku fooled the US to send their army into the culling games so that it would result in more cursed spirits being spawned.",
            "On the point of having sorcerers with guns, in universe, a lot of them are still minors, so gun laws probably still apply to them (even though they're technically like soldiers). Even if that wasn't the case or we didn't apply that logic, out of universe, it'd be kinda boring if everyone just had a gun, especially if it made things too easy in certain cases, plus it doesn't really fit the aesthetic of jujutsu sorcerers. Their society I'd also ruled by conservative oldheads who may see conventional weapons like that as beng beneath them, like with what Naoya said about those who rely on Cursed tools, so it probably wouldn't be encouraged.\n\nOn the point of using this weaponry on Sukuna, there's two reasons why that isn't a great idea:\n\n1.) Sorcerers and Cursed Spirits can't truly be neutralized without Cursed energy. In the case of sorcerers, they turn into vengeful Cursed spirits, and in Naoya's case, it only seemed to make him stronger, so you could imagine how terrifying that would be in Sukuna's case.\n\n2.) Snipers would have to be situated within Shinjuku in order to keep Sukuna in range (according to the two second research i did confirm the farthest recorded shot of a sniper and the size of Shinjuku) which would obviously put them in danger of getting in his line of fire. He could easily send off an insta-kill slash in their direction the moment they start firing.\n\nAlso, given how Maki was able to dodge a point blank range shot even before her awakening as well as Kenjaku being able to react to a sniper shot as in the panel you've shown, I've no doubt that Sukuna may very well be able to react to the shot before it ever hits him."
