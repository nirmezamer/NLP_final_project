            "\"The unending pursuit begins\"\n\nJoJolion is so fucking back, baby",
            "Seems like Jodio mixing up three letter acronyms wasn't just a one off joke when he was talking about music with Charmingman",
            "I like the part where Jodio explains what the fuck an mri is",
            "Oh my god that last scene is incredible. They effectively got her killed as a mechanism to bring the land to them. I'm glad we are already setting up that using the rock means potential sacrifices being made, and that the gang will be willing to accept progressively worse consequenses to achieve it. This is the best chapter in a while.",
            "The Jodio pose on the cover page is insane. It's like he broke all of his limbs",
            "When they first showed the land registry woman in the hospital I thought it was Holly for a second lol",
            "Stand name discovered: Bags' Groove, a Miles Davis album.\n\nEDIT: Well, not sure whether we should go with song or album...\n\nEDIT THE SECOND: It was actually composed by Milt Jackson (it's jazz). Davis was the one behind its most famous rendition.",
            "Smooth operators shrunk to fit in Dragona's windpipe!! Stand shrinking is back!!!1!",
            "Jodio yelling \"There's a sequence Dragona!\" while Dragona is on the floor dying is so funny",
            "Seems like the greater the price (or harder to get in possession of) of the thing they\u2019re trying to steal is the greater the price other people will have to pay to get it to them. Like the few dollars made it right to them with no worry, that 80k watch had the guy who bought it lose the money he spent and had his girl leave him, and this 50 billion dollar land got someone killed. \n\nI can see this over time leading to something like one of the main characters getting killed off for a extremely large some of cash and completely regretting it. Something like Jodio finally becomes filthy rich like he wanted but at the price of losing dragona, someone Jodio would probably consider to be priceless. Giving him the maximum reward for maximum price.\n\n\nGreat chapter. I know we\u2019re already 16 chapters in but it still feels weird when new characters get introduced"

Even if jotaro didn't know Ratt's precise location, he knew it was somewhere between those 2 identical looking rocks, and we've already seen jotaro defeat an enemy because of 2 oddly shaped looking rocks. So, couldn't he just have star platinum chuck a Boulder at its position like an artillery strike?",

            "Jotaro didn't know it's location tho. Why else would he be asking Josuke if he found it yet? You can't punch away Ratt's dart without poisoning yourself so bringing out your stand is just expanding your hit box.",
            "Because he was training josuke",
            "Because Araki instead wrote the fight around Josuke needing to deal the finishing blow instead of Jotaro. Besides a big boulder would make Jotaro incredibly vulnerable since Star Platinum is too busy lifting it to defend itself.",
            "If Jotaro did that, I guarantee you Araki would write it that the rat dodged it or something. If a bullet going at incredible speeds struggles to hit a rat, than I doubt a large boulder would fare better.",
            "because the two rocks Ratt was between would stop the boulder from landing directly on top of it duh",
            "Because that's not the point of the arc; it's not the story Araki wants to tell. Jotaro (and Araki) was giving Josuke his time to shine.\n\nIf JoJo was just about killing the enemy as quick as possible it wouldn't be nearly as good. You're missing the forest for the trees.",
            "More importantly, why didn't he bring something from house to use as improvised shield? Earlier Crazy Diamond blocked a shot from another rat with frying pan.",
            "Because then we wouldn't have Josuke's cool fucking homing projectile in the final battle)",
            "Actually, Jotaro could have dealt the finishing blow to Ratt even easier than Josuke, but he just let Josuke do it because he was trying to mentor him",
            "I think the point of the rat fight was jotaro training up josuke, making sure he was capable for future fights as much as possible. He could have just crushed the rat, but then the next time josuke was in a bind he'd have to come solve that one too, and so on and so on"
