            "Oh my god that last scene is incredible. They effectively got her killed as a mechanism to bring the land to them. I'm glad we are already setting up that using the rock means potential sacrifices being made, and that the gang will be willing to accept progressively worse consequenses to achieve it. This is the best chapter in a while.",
            "The Jodio pose on the cover page is insane. It's like he broke all of his limbs",

            "Jodio yelling \"There's a sequence Dragona!\" while Dragona is on the floor dying is so funny",
            "I\u2019m really enjoying the pacing here. Jojo is usually infamous for taking its time to introduce new characters. \n\nBut Araki just dropped an entire folder of them on our asses.",
            "I gotta say, November Rain's precision is insane. \n\nAlso really liking the design of the new villains. I like how Araki subverts the expectation by making us think the hat-wearing guy was the stand user, when it was in fact the girl."

            "My name is Kira Yoshikage. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.",

I wanna know about the ways it could develop in the hands of different Hamon Users, how innovative you could get with it. I don\u2019t think we got to see it being used to its fullest potential with Parts 3 + 4 Joseph which is a shame because it\u2019s a versatile Stand that leaves a lot of room for resourcefulness and creativity.",
