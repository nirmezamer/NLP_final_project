So we\u2019ll have to wait and see on that.\n\nAlso will be interesting to see how they structure this. Do they front load this deal to take the bigger hit this year when they have more flexibility and have it decline to lower the hit as Barnes extension kicks in? My concern with front loading is that it could make a future extension harder but given this is higher than initially expected, that should make that less of a concern.\n\nEdit 2: I just realized IQ\u2019s max salary in year 1 is 35.25m, so unless that 175m has a lot of incentives baked in, there isn\u2019t much room for it to be front loaded. It\u2019s either flat or backloaded.\n\nIf we backload this as much as possible, it\u2019s 21% in year 1 and down to 19% in year 5.\n\nIf we make it flat (35m per year), it\u2019s 25% of the cap this year, but down to 17% in year 5.",

His connectivity, off-ball smarts and tertiary shot making will be better complimented this coming season unless injuries ravage again. He can start at off-guard to take defensive pressure off Quickley and Scottie. He can also play alongside Gradey. \n\nYes, ideally he is traded at some point as he is an unlikely long-term fit. But there\u2019s no sense in giving him away for less than his value (which is moderate to a contending team).\n\nEdit: it was VERY cheap to add picks in the 2024 draft. There were surely options to move Bruce, but why trade a decent asset for a mid pick when you can instead fleece the Kings and buy one from the Wolves? Masai probably wants 2025/26 picks for Bruce. Another team may do this in a few weeks when free agency options are limited.",
