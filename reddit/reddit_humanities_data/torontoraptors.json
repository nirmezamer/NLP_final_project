            "Wait we got another 2nd round pick LOL At first I thought just Davion and Sasha were good but then Woj twitted again and we got the 45th pick too and I thought that was a totally fleece. Getting another 2nd rounder is just a masterclass. Kings GM must be mistaken Jalen McDaniels for Jaden McDaniels cause this move doesn't make any sense",
            "At this point, I think the Sacramento FO had a mix-up and think they're getting **Jaden** McDaniels, because this is a huge over-pay for Jalen. If so, they're going to be in for a surprise come training camp.",
            "ANOTHER PICK?! The Trailblazers second round pick could be in the 30s which could be great for the 2025 draft.",
            "god damn what a return for McDonalds",
            "this is an awesome trade for us, even if Davion Mitchell struggled a bit hes still serviceable and a good project to work on, I thought we were gonna be lucky to get a 2nd round for Jalen, but we got all this??? Masai worked his magic",
            "Wait, we got a 2025 2nd as well? That has got to be one of the biggest fleece jobs Masai and Bobby have ever pulled off! They're back!!!",

I thought the situation with the Raptors would have been perfect for him but now it just opens up a spot for other guys to get more minutes which is the good thing.\n\nRaptors 4/5 right now is Barnes (even though he can play the 2/3 as well), Poeltl, Olynyk, Mogbo, Chomche (who will be on the 905 basically all year) and Boucher (who won't see many minutes). Either Mogbo is going to get giant opportunities right away as the backup 4 or the Raptors are going to sign someone.",
