            "Himawari did pretty good in her first real fight",
            "Himawari + Kurama is so lit. She really pulled out the Spiderman responsibility quote and then proceeded to punch the absolute shit out of Jura. Really hope her character continues to become a focus.\n\nBiggest concern right now is that Boruto is seemingly the only character in Konoha capable of not getting low diffed by the villains. Seems like there's gonna have to be some additional power-ups for the other characters, or else it's pretty much just gonna be Boruto vs. everybody from here on out.",
            "Nishi continuing to be included in the action despite being the most useless Jonin imaginable always cracks me up. He took one look at Hidari and shit his pants.\n\nAlso Hidari nonchalantly sticking his hand in his pocket to chidori Sarada from behind was cold af. He may not know who Sasuke is but he's still got the same aura.",
            "Jura saying he won\u2019t forget Shikadai\u2019s name has an eerie resemblance to enemies saying that to Shikamaru when he was younger.",
            "I know it's useless, but I think we can already say Hima is Kage level with one real fight in her entire ninja career lmao",
            "I\u2019m really glad destruction is playing a bigger role this time around. Himawari punching Jura through what seems like a shit ton of hills is a pretty neat way to show her power same with the giant explosion that came in the bijuu clash. \n\nHima\u2019s regeneration seems pretty insane, like from what I understand Jura shot a hole straight through her and she more or less healed it instantly. Same way she did with Inojin. \n\nAlso pretty good feat from Konohamura, I\u2019m surprised he was able to react at all, but he did and blocked the chidori. \n\nThe way Boruto was just a speedline when he flew past Delta and Kawaki was pretty crazy. \n\nI do wonder what we will get to see next chapter.",
            "Time to flying raijin straight to the ihop",
            "Cool chapter overall. \n\nIt looks like Himawari is beyond just a Jinchuriki, probably because Kurama actually reincarnated into her as opposed to being sealed. It almost seems like the two are one being. She's immediately attuned to using Kurama's chakra and abilities, dropping a Biju Bomb off the bat was dope. I definitely think she'll end up being the \"perfected\" jinchuriki as a way to get her towards the level of Boruto and Kawaki. \n\nSasuke's clone is interesting already. Its obvious he doesn't actually have the knowledge or necessarily the capabilities of Sasuke, but he can use Sasuke's attacks. Im wondering if the connection to Sarada is strictly about Sasuke's love for her, or if it has to do with \"perfecting \" his being a clone of Sasuke. I feel like it was very intentional that he only just learned the Sharingan is necessary to perform the Chidori effectively. \n\nKonohamaru having a Wind Style Rasengan variant in the form of a barrier was dope as hell. I hope he gets more. \n\nAnd it looks like Boruto is safely on track to becoming an allie to the Leaf again. Saving Himawari will be helpful, but showing up to save Sarada and likely fight Sasuke's clone is gonne be a big boost to his reputation in the village. Especially with Kawaki essentially AWOL.",

It was an interesting direction and could've brought cool thematic elements. AO was cool.\n\nEida and daemon\n\nKawaki doesn't have too much going on development wise post time skip\n\nNot much world building\n\nJougan is in a weird place in manga/anime canon. I just kinda wish Boruto got and used Byakugan, so the dojustu can be expanded and made relevant again.\n\nHonestly doesn't feel like \"arcs\" are a thing. Not like in original Naruto. And definitely not compared to bleach, one piece, kagurabachi, etc. Pacing is weird, albeit not bad.\n\nKonohamaru is a fraud and jokes aside I'm disappointed ",

            "Im in agreement with Konohamaru, he\u2019s been disappointing not just post time skip but even pre time skip, I feel he had lots more potential.\n\nAs for Kawaki Im sure his importance will grow tremendously as the story progresses, he is fated to have a 1v1 fight against Boruto",
            ">Moving away from technology in general\n\nMate some of the more relevant characters are cyborgs and scientists, even karma is treated like a piece of technology. I legit don\u2019t get how we\u2019re moving away from it. \n\n>Honestly don\u2019t feel like arcs are a thing\n\nWe most certainly have arcs lol. \n\n>not much world building\n\nAgreed",

            "I already knew that from the beginning but the plot and worldbuilding seems kind of empty to me even for shonen standards.\n\n\nSo many characters, so many lore,\u00a0 etc and yet it seems like Boruto universe is being too condensed and getting smaller",
            "Kawaki nit having character growth makes sense in context tho, he is so absorbed in his single goal that even the people around him who \"love\" him are growing tired of him.",
            "Only thing that makes boruto  not as good as Naruto and other good mangas is the art, what disappointing art. Could hope they nail the anime and the story gets darker if they wannt to capture the old audience back",
            "The main thing I miss is focusing a bit on the other Ninja. Boruto is super main cast focused but even in Naruto I never cared about Naruto and Sasuke that much. I always watched for the characters around them.",
            "\"ARCs\"\nWe need them. Right now it feels story is being rushed forward without clarity of where it stands. \nI wish the first 5 chapters of TBV just reintroduced the characters, their growth, how konoha and ninja tech world has changed, the other villages have changed. \nMainly, some more details of the 2-3years of the skip and how it results into the present day characters. \n\nWithout all this, I can't understand who is who and what is it they do or are supposed to do. \nWhere is the focus on some other non MCs? \nNaruto did it so well that we cared about the other characters. But now it's just the few 4-5 people that take up all the pages with no connection to anyone else.",

        "content": "This Omnipotence BS has to end. For 3 YEARS in-universe, Kawaki has basically stolen EVERYTHING from Boruto. And there\u2019s no way this Omnipotence is going to last. Eida WILL somehow end it. She accidentally caused this, she might accidentally, or better yet intentionally, end this. Here\u2019s how it might go:\n\n1. Eida will see how far Kawaki has fallen and Boruto has grown. This will cause her to unconsciously deactivate Omnipotence.\n\n2. Kawaki will bluntly tell Eida that he doesn\u2019t love her. The only person Kawaki truly cares about is Naruto. Heartbroken, Eida undoes Omnipotence consciously or unconsciously to spite Kawaki.\n\nAfter these possible scenarios, Kawaki will have a MASSIVE Villainous Breakdown. He attempts to, or actually does, kill Eida for this. Whether he actually kills her or someone saves Eida is irrelevant. Kawaki will then release a massive attack that destroys the village. He then declares that nothing matters anymore. Everyone hates him and Naruto will likely hate him as well. Boruto and Himawari are the ones who try to sympathize with. But Kawaki will just state that the Era of Shinobi is over and this brings us to the prologue.",

            "I can see Kawaki either slip out once too many, thus causing people to inevitably abandon him; or believe to have killed Boruto, therefore his mission was done (eventual eradication of other threats not required), therefore he unseals Naruto and Hinata.\n\nHaving Eida grow tired of him would also be nice, but it shouldn't be the main factor behind Omnipotence blowing up in Kawaki's face.\n\n...\n\nHowever, since I'm not totally and absolutely against Kawaki (just mostly), I say that if Kishimoto wants to have him be redeemed in the end, then he ought to have Kawaki genuinely learn how to be a decent human being, and wanting to have bonds with people, this before Omnipotence is nullified therefore he is the one to lose everything this time around, and since it would mean something to him in this case, it would be a first step towards his eventual redemption.\n\nBecause it would make him start gain some sympathy points again, instead of just being a complete jerk.\n\n...\n\nAs for what may cause Omnipotence to actually be reversed... that's easy.\n\nJust have a strong enough being use Omnipotence to nullify the one casted by Eida.\n\nAfter all, for a power called **Omnipotence**, it'd be pretty ridiculous to have it be impossible to be reversed, even by another being from the one that used it the first time.",
            "Nahh Edias first use of omnipotence wasn\u2019t undone either and momo hinted that humanity\u2019s mind was prob altered in the past by kaguya too (makes sense given the narrative incongruities around her godhood going bad)\n\nShe gave us the solution and Boruto has already implemented twice; make new memories show them who u are. He did it w sasuke and seemingly mitsuiki\u00a0\n\nNow I do hope Naruto and Hima were unaffected Boruto doesn\u2019t deserve that\u00a0",
            "I think Kawaki will lose people's trust in him while Boruto will regain it like he is doing with Shikamaru, Mitsuki and Ino.\n\nWithout karma being undone, which will be a bigger hit to Kawaki's ego.",
            "Amado has managed to reverse engineer her \"charm\" ability, even not knowing what her power actually was. I think Amado has compelled her to love Kawaki the same way everyone else is compelled to her. Amado understands love is a seemingly unlimited source of motivation. and he will do anything to bring his daughter back. she is already starting to sense something is amiss, her and Mitsuki have a lot in common all the sudden.",
            "at first i liked the omnipotence, for narrative reasons, it put the characters to face a very new and hard problem, and i think that omnipotence should continue for a while, i agreed that it has to end but im not in a hurry, what bothers me is that the very little characters who were not affected by it, they are just weight, completely useless to the grand scheme, also, Sarada has been portrayed like a Damsel in distress and that is irritating, its like her sharingan is just excuse to use shidori and thats all, no genjutsu, no advanced taijutsu, not even an interesting ninjutsu, only chidori and fire balls, its like im seeing the chunnin exam again.\n\nFor the sake of the narrative, Boruto needs to \"turn\" more characters to his side while the Omnipotence is still active, kashin koji and those frogs wont be enough in the future.",
            "What if aida falling in love make her change reality like thats the reason she activated to help kawaki. Se let say she sees in boruto a mature man she likes and cast omnijutsu and return things to normal.",
            "I don't think that's possible. IIRC, she can't undo Omnipotence (stated in c1 of tbv)\u00a0",
            "What my line of thinking is, if Omnipotence did this monkey\u2019s paw business because of Kawaki\u2019s wish (that Boruto was an outsider so no one would care if Kawaki killed him), then does Kawaki have to be the one to undo it?\n\nOr, can Eida try to use Omnipotence again to undo what she did, if she wishes for it strong enough? I can buy a, \u201cOmipotence needs time to recharge,\u201d or she\u2019s still in too deep in her crush to really try to even attempt to undo Kawaki\u2019s wish. \n\nUltimately, I think it will be undone by one of these two, but not any time soon",
            "I like this theory, I'm not the only one who thinks kawaki will destroy the village because undone omnipotence would be a threat to naruto's safety as in unsealing him. Kawaki doesn't give a fuck about the village. Only that naruto gets to live. Even if naruto has to live a miserable existence.",
            "Going by the end of part one, Eida is starting to see Naruto's son in a different light and is sorry for what she did to Boruto."
