            "Himawari did pretty good in her first real fight",
            "Himawari + Kurama is so lit. She really pulled out the Spiderman responsibility quote and then proceeded to punch the absolute shit out of Jura. Really hope her character continues to become a focus.\n\nBiggest concern right now is that Boruto is seemingly the only character in Konoha capable of not getting low diffed by the villains. Seems like there's gonna have to be some additional power-ups for the other characters, or else it's pretty much just gonna be Boruto vs. everybody from here on out.",
            "Jura saying he wont forget Shikadais name has an eerie resemblance to enemies saying that to Shikamaru when he was younger.",
            "Nishi continuing to be included in the action despite being the most useless Jonin imaginable always cracks me up. He took one look at Hidari and shit his pants.\n\nAlso Hidari nonchalantly sticking his hand in his pocket to chidori Sarada from behind was cold af. He may not know who Sasuke is but he's still got the same aura.",
            "Time to flying raijin straight to the ihop",
            "I know it's useless, but I think we can already say Hima is Kage level with one real fight in her entire ninja career lmao",
            "Bro I got so hyped at the \"spiderman\" moment. Himawari basically saying \"with great power comes great responsibility\" at that moment. Plus it's also her showing her will of fucking fire! Can't wait for next few chapter where I'm wondering if Hima will finally learn the truth from her real brother, and they form a 3-man team with Boruto, Sarada, and Hima, and Sumire being the insider in the village.",
            "The size of that beast bomb explosion was insane",
            "In this world there are kids younger than you yet stronger than me - Kakashi to Naruto\n\nHimawari is officially the strongest Kunoichi in the franchise!"

            "Because his existence is a joke. He has arguably the best hax in the whole verse and he gets folded by Kid Naruto and Jiraya of all people. He was the original fraudster before Code and Kawaki",

            "Urashiki had some insane potential/abilities & deserved better writing. Its a shame he was thrown in the filler garbage bin.",
            "Not only did he have one of the most broken rinnegan abilities, but he had the coolest looking rinnegan too. It's such a shame that he sucks.",

            "His abilities are so busted where I honestly can't believe he lost. I genuinely pretend that he doesn't exist.",

            "What jura and hidar will do then drink coffee with konohamaru and talk about art?",
            "so u think that boruto, the only person who can do anything, is gonna leave those 10 tails mfs to terrorize the village to have some play time with sarada and himawari who thinks he killed her dad?",
            "I think it's plausible, but Boruto seems to be in a mindset of, 'I must do this alone,' kind of like where Sasuke was in Shippuden before killing>! Orochimaru.!< I feel like there's going to be a boundary for Boruto to overcome before he even considers taking Sarada and Hima with him. >!Just like how Sasuke formed Hebi/Taka after Orochimaru's death.!<\n\nOf course there's room for something else to happen though!",
            "Doubt it. Neither of them can mask their chakra (Himawari even more so with Kurama so she cant hide from Jura) so if anything theyd be a beacon for Borutos general location",

            "Would be cool. The story is in a \"anything can happen\" state rn.",
            "Not sure were borutos hideout is, jura could track hima like he did in konoha, could expose the hideout",
            "where can i read this",
            "It might be cool in theory, but it would probably cause more problems for Boruto. If he takes Sarada and Himawari with him, it puts all of the attention on him. Konoha would throw a fit at the hokage killer kidnapping the hokage's daughter. Kawaki would probably be relentless and use Eida to reveal his location which would expose his hideout. Jura can sense Kurama so he would also follow Boruto to his hideout. Boruto likes moving in the shadows and this move takes everything away from that. \n\nRealistically he's better off giving them markers so that he can appear whenever they're in trouble.",
            "I feel like he's been on the rise the last chapters and he hasn't taken a L yet...I feel like we've seen every opp cept momoshiki and we've seen him still tense up when karma pops out. I feel like momoshiki is the next angle but I also feel this ten tail business will have boruto n momo meetin in the middle like cyclops n ryu."
