            "Seriously all I want is a minecraft game where an AI system takes a village and makes it a fully fleshed out society that you take part in. Natural \"quests\" specific to the random gen geography, traders, a military, always different every game. \n\nCould be worth another playthrough",

            "This is somewhat different than what you are asking but for some reasons my consoles have always seemed to download slower than any other device in the house. PS4, switch, Xbox x, and stream deck all run well below my actual speeds. I\u2019m probably missing something but just wanted to add.",

With PC, even if you connected it to the tv, you'd still have to load into windows, stretch the mouse, keyboard and controller across the living room, click on a bunch of things etc and there's still this PC look on the screen. A console has a different vibe.",
