    "Abusing Draft Rankings 2024 (ESPN, Sleeper, Yahoo, NFL, CBS)": {
        "title": "Abusing Draft Rankings 2024 (ESPN, Sleeper, Yahoo, NFL, CBS)",

        "content": "Whoa, is that fantasy football draft season on the horizon? I\u2019ve been waiting for this! Let's get into it.\n\n**What do I have for you today?**\n\nA few years ago I began to notice that the draft rooms on sites like ESPN and Yahoo used drastically different in-draft rankings. Because these rankings were the default order of players to appear in drafts, they had a heavy influence on ADP and when players were taken. Since that was the case, I figured it would be useful to know which players in draft rooms were being shown too early or too late in comparison to expert rankings in an effort to find value.\n\nThese sheets compare the ADP and Expert Consensus Rankings (ECR) from FantasyPros to the in-draft rankings from ESPN, Sleeper, Yahoo, NFL and CBS. Since scoring also dictates the rankings, they are then split up between Standard, Half PPR and PPR scoring. *More will be added as the summer goes on.*\n\nIf you\u2019re familiar with these sheets from previous years, welcome back!\n\n# [LINK TO ACCESS SHEETS](https://firstseedsports.com/abusing-draft-rankings-2024/)\n\nDraft rankings update constantly, so I plan on posting here weekly and updating the sheets as often as I can throughout the summer.\n\n**HOW I USE THIS**\n\nLet\u2019s use ESPN PPR as an example. Prior to my drafts (or during drafts if I have the extra screen), I go to the \u2018ESPN PPR\u2019 tab and look down the \u2018ESPNvFP\u2019 column. What this column does is highlight the players that the Expert Consensus Rankings have ranked higher than the draft room on ESPN. The deeper blue colors are the better values, meaning that the experts have that player ranked much higher than the default draft rank on ESPN.\n\nThose ESPN numbers are the order in which players are sorted in ESPN draft rooms, and by default will most likely be drafted earlier because they\u2019re shown to drafters earlier. As an example, WR Amari Cooper is ranked 41st overall on FantasyPros and ESPN has his draft rank at 69 (nice). This tells me two things:\n\n1. Experts like Amari Cooper more than the ESPN draft room\n2. Amari Cooper won\u2019t be on my competitor\u2019s screens for about two whole rounds in comparison to his rank, so I can wait or steal him before other teams even see him\n\nI personally don\u2019t use these sheets primarily as a \u201cdraft this man, experts love him!!!\u201d type of tool, but more to help visualize how my drafts will turn out and what players are valued more in certain spots.\n\nI've also begun collecting these draft rankings to soon put together a trends sheet, where in previous years I just deleted these. I'll have this in the coming weeks.\n\nGood luck everyone, happy to be back, and happy drafting!",

            "This is it folks. This is the meat of early round fantasy draft strategy. It boggles my mind how people continue to underestimate how important draft room rankings are. It's not about some blanket POSITION/POSITION approach - it's all about who you can get where and what combo of players you can feasibly get at what draft spot in the first 3-6 rounds. Mock until you puke and you'll see the trends and get a grasp on what combos you like best.",

            "I've been comparing each site rankings and it's been exhausting, so this is great!  Any way you can make a column of adp that average out the rankings of all the main sites and not just fantasy pros?  That way we can compare each individual site rankings to that as well.",
            "This is good data, thanks for this.\n\nPeople who draft on ESPN overrate running backs sooo much. It's every single year. The counter argument to this is that ESPN is still only 2 WR slots by default. \n\nHowever, 3 WR slots and/or an additional flex spot is arguably more widely accepted now, and I would imagine that the FP rankings are based on that type of roster makeup.\n\nSo while I still do think RB's are rated too highly on ESPN ADP's, there is fair reasoning that they should have somewhat of a bump up compared to most other rankings you might find elsewhere. Obviously assuming your league is still only using 2 WR slots.",

            "Fading RB2 is a winning strategy IMO, and all of these guys can get you that 10 point floor you need when you have studs everywhere else. Having a guy you get at RB20-25 prices that puts up RB10-15 stats is league winning.\n\nGood list. I don't see TD upside with Ekeler with BRob there, but i get the pass catching upside.",
            "Good list.  Nobody's screenshotting a trade for these guys to brag on Twitter, but they def have short-term value.  I think I would put Conner ahead of Zeke in the group you call out in that section.  I think he has more value this year even if he does cede a bit of work to Benson.",
            "I have Mixon, and Ekeler, and Keenan Allen.  Can't give any of them away.  I guess I'll just have to suck it up and go for it this year.  Time to go buy a second QB.",
            "I think Mixon will have a good year, but I wouldn\u2019t call it an improvement of situation. CJ Stroud is more of a lateral movement in terms of QB situation, and the receiving corps between the two teams are probably a wash as well. Maybe he takes a bit of a step as a rusher for the scheme situation you\u2019ve outlined. The problem is what will happen to him as a pass catcher. In 2022 Burrow targeted the RB position 20.3% of the time. The Texans RBs were only targeted 14.2% of the time last year. It could be the case that Mixon is just a better pass catcher than they had available last year and they will change their scheme accordingly, but with 3 WRs looking for targets it\u2019s hard to see them moving extra targets to the RB position this year. I still think he is a valuable RB for contenders that\u2019s worth a late 2025 1st, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re getting him for that in most leagues.\n\nKamara\u2019s underlying metrics have continued to drop each year. It\u2019s possible that an improved offence stops that slide, but at 29 years old he\u2019s firmly in the decline stage for RBs. A healthy Kendre Miller could also eat into the volume that kept him afloat last year, and if Kendre looks explosive and Kamara\u2019s efficiency continues to slip, I don\u2019t see Kamara getting enough volume to be a weekly starter. A new offence that\u2019s more creative and can get guys open down field would also mean less RB targets. I don\u2019t know if Kamara is a great return for a 1st, but if you can get him for a 2nd I think it\u2019s a completely reasonable safety net at RB/flex.\n\nEkeler I\u2019m pretty out on at this point. Backup RB with a rushing QB is risky even if you are an elite pass catching back. At 29 years old you\u2019re hoping that injuries from last year were a one time thing and his explosiveness hasn\u2019t been sapped. Add in that BRob looked very good as a pass catcher last year and the coaching staff has been talking up his ability in that role during OTAs and there\u2019s a very likely path to Ekeler being outright irrelevant for fantasy. I\u2019m not adding Ekeler unless it\u2019s for a 3rd.\n\nI agree on Zeke. Someone needs to get the touches in Dallas. They\u2019re a good offence that will get TDs. Zeke isn\u2019t going to be super efficient, but I won\u2019t be surprised if he finishes the season as a low end RB2 with close to 230+ touches and a surprisingly high TD total.",
            "Is volume the main driver for mixon and Kamara? They both look like they\u2019ve lost a step last year and idk why they\u2019d look any better this year",
            "Sup guys? Win now dynasty teams generally have picks that are expected to be at the back end of drafts in 2025 so I wanted to look at guys you could actually buy for LATE 1sts or 2nds for realistic options for win now teams. I personally feel these guys are decent bets in best ball and redraft at ADP as well.\n\n  \nLet me know what you think!",
            "I\u2019d argue that most of these guys are already on win now teams. Elliott would be the one exception. \n\nI feel like Singletary or Zach Moss fits the bill more of RBs that should actually be available for a win now team.",
            "On board never invest in expensive / first round rb. Too much risk. Although\u2026 I haven\u2019t won a ship in 10 years.",
            "I get stuff like Mixon or Kamara but a late 2nd for Zeke seems like a hell no. As much as he led the Patriots that number is more because the Patriots were awful last year: His 51 catches would have been on the low end of his Cowboys career despite his 65 targets being in line with it. Last time he was on the Cowboys he needed that number of catches and 10 TDs to be valuable (an RB2 in PPG, an RB1 in per game) while he was also averaging 0.7 more yards per rush. He even had more yards per reception most of his career. I'm not even convinced he'll get the lion's share of work over Dowdle, who could be a more interesting looker.",
