        "content": "The Saturday Script is back! Last week we dove into [Running Back 40 Yard Dashes](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/s/MXUB7tpYqr) and if that affects performance. For part 12 of The Saturday Script, we looked at RB RAS. Our analysis revealed that our RAS threshold occurs at a 23.3% higher rate in the top 10 fantasy football Running Backs since 2003 than in the bottom 10.\n\nAll of our research can be found on [our Analytics page](https://brainyballers.com/the-saturday-script-advanced-analytics-for-fantasy-football-stats/). Just comment what theories/myths you want to see verified or debunked and we will! Next week we\u2019re looking at WR data to try to find a WR 40 yard dash time threshold that correlates to increased performances, if there is one. Our current lineup is to evaluate WR RAS, WR Y/A, WR drop rates.\n\nTL;DR Running backs that have better than 7.6 RAS, and who are projected for top 50 in any season, are 23.3% more likely to have a top 10 RB finish than a bottom 10 RB finish (41st-50th place). 2.3 RAS is the critical threshold that is the minimum since 2003. Further, using standard statistical methods to find trends found correlation with the P-Value, but the Rsquared value was so low that it showed RAS is an extremely small factor that predicts success.",

            "Updating now youre right thanks!",
            "And again, thanks for commenting you legend",
            "Yup. I'm adopting the red flag strategy this year. If a player is *awful* at something then I'm not gonna be drafting them lol. \n\nGreat article. Definitely gonna ignore Bucky Irving in all drafts. Wasn't sure how he was ever gonna take much work away from Rachaad White but this cements it",
            "I don't think so. You'd probably get all the mid to bad rookies showing up in some areas. But the research should say \"almost everyone in the red flag area of this stat sucks\" or it's not really a red flag stat in the first place. If historically <1% of players succeed in the \"red flag\" area then I'm not gonna take my chances.\n\nYPRR is also a pretty great encompassing stat because it measures ability to earn targets and produce with them. College career YPRR above 2.0 is the one I follow the most religiously for rookies because it's ridiculously correlated with success. WR BMI is another one, definitely not drafting any WR with a 1st percentile BMI (i.e. Troy Franklin).  From what I've seen there aren't a whole lot more though I'll be adding RB RAS to them now!",
            "Thats exactly what Im hoping to find.\n\nBtw I ran the WR BMI for next week already. If this red flag area is what you follow then Id avoid Xavier Worthy.",
            "Thanks for the heads up! Yeah I was planning on avoiding him. This isn't a stats thing but I pay attention to how WR's protect themselves from collisions with the ground when making catches (credit to AngeloFF for bringing my attention to this) and Worthy doesn't do a good job. You can't keep smashing into the ground over and over and stay healthy, can work for a while but the minor injuries will pile up. Legette also doesn't do a very good job of this"
