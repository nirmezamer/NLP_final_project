The strategy that appeals to me is low-risk and dividends over growth stocks. I've been growing my S&S ISA since 2021, and these pictures are today's snapshot.\n\nI don't have time or energy to do a lot of studying of stocks etc. and opted to follow others on YouTube instead that match my strategy. I've followed TheDividendExperiment (Daily Dividend Pie) when it first started, but I've reached a level of money in my portfolio that makes me anxious simply following YouTube advice. In addition to the Daily Dividend Pie, I've also invested in choice stocks for personal experimentation like DIS and SBLK.\n\nGeneral consensus I've read on Reddit is to simply invest into an S&P500 Index but I wonder if it's the best course of action for me to simply sell everything and buy an S&P500 Index tracker right now, or do I need to selectively sell stock and keep others instead.\n\nI would appreciate any advice, thanks!\n\nPS: I rarely post on Reddit and it's my first time posting here so if I'm making a formatting or general mistake in this post let me know also.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1dr1pu4/stock_market_at_all_time_highs_housing_market_at/",
        "content": "One must wonder why both the stock market and housing market are both at all time highs? The median price of a home sold in May was\u00a0**$419,300**\u00a0\u2014 an all-time record. As we know the stock market is at all time highs as well. Now lets look at what's driving the stock market to all time highs, not hard to figure it out its big tech. Wall St has a love fest with big tech right now. Just buy big tech and get rich right? Not so quick, those of you that remember the [dot.com](http://dot.com) bubble in the 90's remember how that ended. Between March 2000 and October 2002, the NASDAQ fell from 5,048 to 1,139, erasing nearly all of its gains during the dot-com bubble. By the end of 2001, most publicly traded dot-com companies had failed. I was a trader back then and bought many penny stocks that skyrocketed in price during the [dot.com](http://dot.com) boom. Lucky for me I cashed out around the highs before most of them went bankrupt. This brings me to the current AI-boom which I missed out on. I am not saying the AI-boom is not justified. However, the market has already deemed the new winners. Just like it was during the dotcom boom there were winners but many went bankrupt. We shall see how the AI boom evolves, but when a sector is only thing leading the market to new highs history tells us a crash will follow.\n\nNow lets look at housing. I lived through the first major correction in the housing market in 2008. I took my gains from the 90s dotcom boom and invested in real estate soon after. I got lucky and sold most of my real estate right before it crashed in 2008. The stock market and housing market crashes of 2008 trace their origins to the unprecedented growth of the subprime mortgage market that began in 1999. Could we have a repeat of previous events? Right now average people can not afford a home. Why is this? Could it be Wall St has become a major buyer of real estate remembering the government bailed them out last time, who knows. What I do know is what my ole grandpappy used to say, what goes up must come down. Baby boomers own most real estate and will soon be major sellers due to death or downsizing, this is just facts. Right now, boomers have a pretty large grip on the US housing market. The generation accounts for about 21% of the total US population, but they own 38% of American homes We shall see what happens in the future but history always repeats its self.\n\nCHEERS!!  \nMAV",

        "content": "Automated trading is the process of using computer programs and algorithms to automate trading strategies in the financial markets. Instead of manual execution, traders rely on trading robots that automatically analyze the market, make decisions, and execute trades.\n\n# What is the advantage of automating analysis?\n\nFirst, it allows traders to react to market events much faster than manual trading. Platforms can instantly analyze and interpret huge amounts of data, which makes rapid decision-making possible.\n\nSecond, automated trading eliminates the emotional errors associated with human error. Traders can be emotionally stressed, which can lead to irrational decisions. Trading robots work based on predetermined algorithms without the influence of emotion, which increases the discipline of trading and the prospect of an initially working strategy,\n\n**Technical analysis and automated decision making**\n\nTrading robots are based on technical analysis, analyzing historical data of prices, volumes and other parameters. They can automatically make decisions to enter and exit trades based on set conditions such as support and resistance levels, indicators and market trends.\n\n**Automated trading software**\n\nThere is a variety of automated trading software available. Some platforms offer off-the-shelf solutions, including trading robots and tools to incorporate into their own strategies. Other platforms offer APIs that allow traders to create their own programs based on specified conditions.\n\n**Functionality and features**\n\nAutomated trading software can offer a variety of features and functionality. These can include real-time feedback, data visualization, tools to optimize strategies, backtesting and testing capabilities on historical data, and risk and portfolio management.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hse8a28t6b9d1.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e3ec00af513608cae84b06bc88159fde87f1317\n\n**Pros and cons of automated trading**\n\nAutomated trading has several advantages. First, it allows traders to greatly increase their speed of reaction to market events, as robots can instantly analyze and make decisions. Second, automated trading eliminates the emotional errors associated with human error.\n\nHowever, automated trading also has its limitations and risks. Technical glitches, market connectivity issues, and software bugs can lead to lost trades or even financial losses. In addition, trading robots can be sensitive to changes in market conditions and may not always be able to adapt to new situations.\n\nHow to choose the right trading robot or software\n\n1. Consider your requirements and goals\n\nWhen choosing a trading robot or software, you need to consider your individual requirements and goals. Different robots and platforms may offer different features and strategies, so it is important to determine what you need and what best suits your trading goals.\n\n2.  Testing and optimizing strategies\n\nOnce you have chosen your software, it is recommended that you test and optimize your strategies on historical data. This will help you verify the effectiveness of your chosen robot and customize its parameters according to your preferences and trading strategies.\n\n# Examples of successful use of automated trading\n\n**Example 1: Increasing Profitability with a Trading Robot**\n\nOne example of a successful use of automated trading is the case of a trader who was able to significantly increase his profitability through the use of a trading robot. The robot analyzed market data and made decisions about entering and exiting trades based on predetermined algorithms and strategies. This allowed the trader to reduce emotional errors and increase his trading efficiency.\n\n**Example 2: Reducing emotional errors and increasing discipline**\n\nAnother example of the successful use of automated trading has to do with reducing emotional errors and increasing trader discipline. Trading robots are not subject to emotional stress and do not succumb to panic or greed,\u00a0",
