            "I\u2019m a shareholder and avid sneakerhead/Nike fan - I thought I was crazy because I thought their recent lineup was just straight up uninteresting and a far far cry from 90s/2000s which I consider their golden age. But I thought hey, I guess that\u2019s what sells. Well apparently it doesn\u2019t! They\u2019ve lost their way, forgot what made them the powerhouse sports band that commanded Apple-like followings. Stop making bland shit, look to your golden age for ideas or just retro the shit out of them. The Agassi collection is a great example of leading design/tech (what I would give if they retro that collection). Heck, even the older Lebrons were more interesting and the current ones. 23Engineered was interesting a few years ago but that fell off a cliff recently. I\u2019m debating about picking up more shares because this looks like a solvable problem but maybe i have too much faith in the current leadership.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1dr1pu4/stock_market_at_all_time_highs_housing_market_at/",
        "content": "One must wonder why both the stock market and housing market are both at all time highs? The median price of a home sold in May was\u00a0**$419,300**\u00a0\u2014 an all-time record. As we know the stock market is at all time highs as well. Now lets look at what's driving the stock market to all time highs, not hard to figure it out its big tech. Wall St has a love fest with big tech right now. Just buy big tech and get rich right? Not so quick, those of you that remember the [dot.com](http://dot.com) bubble in the 90's remember how that ended. Between March 2000 and October 2002, the NASDAQ fell from 5,048 to 1,139, erasing nearly all of its gains during the dot-com bubble. By the end of 2001, most publicly traded dot-com companies had failed. I was a trader back then and bought many penny stocks that skyrocketed in price during the [dot.com](http://dot.com) boom. Lucky for me I cashed out around the highs before most of them went bankrupt. This brings me to the current AI-boom which I missed out on. I am not saying the AI-boom is not justified. However, the market has already deemed the new winners. Just like it was during the dotcom boom there were winners but many went bankrupt. We shall see how the AI boom evolves, but when a sector is only thing leading the market to new highs history tells us a crash will follow.\n\nNow lets look at housing. I lived through the first major correction in the housing market in 2008. I took my gains from the 90s dotcom boom and invested in real estate soon after. I got lucky and sold most of my real estate right before it crashed in 2008. The stock market and housing market crashes of 2008 trace their origins to the unprecedented growth of the subprime mortgage market that began in 1999. Could we have a repeat of previous events? Right now average people can not afford a home. Why is this? Could it be Wall St has become a major buyer of real estate remembering the government bailed them out last time, who knows. What I do know is what my ole grandpappy used to say, what goes up must come down. Baby boomers own most real estate and will soon be major sellers due to death or downsizing, this is just facts. Right now, boomers have a pretty large grip on the US housing market. The generation accounts for about 21% of the total US population, but they own 38% of American homes We shall see what happens in the future but history always repeats its self.\n\nCHEERS!!  \nMAV",
