            "Ending was crazy",
            "I mostly like the changes to the ending of this episode from the book. \n\nBut I don\u2019t really understand the pseudo-dilemma of making Helena point out the boy from the girl. \n\nCheese even says \u201clook for a cock.\u201d But then they both abandon that idea and try to ascertain if Helena is telling the truth. When they already set up how important it is that they *have* to kill a son for a son.",
            "I wish Erryk had taken the opportunity to point out to Daemon that you *really* don\u2019t want the armed knights who watch over you and your family while you sleep to get it into their heads that they can decide when a member of the royal family should die. See: Praetorian Guard.",
            "Was Helaena saying she was scared of the rats a hint at the rat killer murdering her son?",
            "Am I the only one who laughed at Daemon calling an ancient dragon 'whory old bitch'?",
            "The episode was spectacular with one major blemish in the execution of the finale, though it was still exciting. There are zero guards around the royal quarters? I get that they used the tunnel directly into the floor, but to have zero guards in the vicinity of those bed chambers is crazy. And why was there a whole miniature conflict around choosing the male child? The guard and snake catcher will kill babies but draw the line at identifying the baby\u2019s gender?",
            "So....did they use CGI or a stunt dog? are we just like not gonna seriously talk about this? lmao \ud83e\udd23",
            "So good to have this show back, another cracking episode. But my god that ending was dark",
            "Don't they have locks on doors in this world?",
            "I've been rewatching game of thrones and damn it Joffrey, a throwaway line in your random history lesson for Margaery Tyrell spoiled how this war ends"

            "The costumes in those stills are amazing! Am I wrong, or even Crispin's costume seems a little bit different?\n\nThe still o Daemon in the stairs is probably my favorite. The last one with Corlys is so very nice. And may I applaud Rhaenyra's dress and pashmina in the last pictures?",
