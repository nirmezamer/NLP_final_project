            "Interestingly most drivers in Germany would just make some space, so you can change the lane. At first I was confused, why the car on the left just didn\u2019t give any space and even pushed to close the space in front, until I read the comments.",

            "why is this illegal ?\nhe uses his blinkers and i dont know how much space there is in front of him but it would be legal in my country, seems like a salty police man.\n\nif anything the police van should be fined for not letting him in",

            "Kinda funny that people are calling that move perfectly reasonable and in their country completely legal. Might set stuff in my country in perspective. That move would be quite illegal in Germany, people here also think indicating grants them the right of way. Thats not the case, we ve got the rule that the person who's already in the lane has the right of way (\u00a7 7 Abs. 5 StVO). Exceptions being of course stuff like zipper merging and courtesy.\n\nFunny to see the differences.",
            "I think the dude cut way too close for comfort that's why he is being pulled. I can't tell how much space was out front either."
