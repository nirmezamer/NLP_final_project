            "All threads made. Again incredibly sorry for being late with this today. My brain kept telling me the beta was Friday. Let me know replying to this if there are any issues with the threads or anything.",
            "Someone needs to do the final EOD story chapter with a spear to see what happens.",
            "Some things Im noticing so far that are bother me alot. Anet seems to have a uh how should I phrase this... a messed up relationship with writing tooltips. Range, radius, diameter. Like some skills say its a range of 240 but only hit in a 130, or say they are a 240 but show a 130 and hit in a 300. Range indicators on a couple skills are just wrong, they show your character moving 1200+ distance but you only move 450. I added diameter because thats what I think they mean on some tooltips despite not using that word. Lets not forget the tooltips that go off the top and bottom of your screen (ranger autos, heaven forbid you are untamed too)... or are formatted in a way that leaves me guessing which effect is baseline and which is added in the \"empowered\" state. \n\nIts not the end of the world  (I've been silently fuming at patch notes for years) but like come on anet is it really that hard to write consistent and clear tooltips? Good thing there is a beta :D",
            "So, is the general consensus most classes with spear dont have a use, and it will need more tuning to be valuable?",
            "The idle and melee auto-attack animations looks bad and unrealistic. Just make something similar to the way ffxiv dragoon hold and attack with spear. And generally I think it was bad idea to release same weapon for every profession. They tried to hide same reused animations with fancy visuals but these visuals are often too much and make older weapons look way too minimalistic (yes I know that even without spears there are a lot of reused animations but because of the way they were released it is less obvious imho).",
            "I really hate the idle stance with spear. It makes sense for a species of giant bears...it doesn't make sense for any of the players. It also has a very masculine feel which isn't great for female characters. \n\nI also hate the position your body ends up taking while you're running with your spear out. Again, feels very manly, which I wouldn't mind, if I were a man.",
            "General feedback: PLEASE Anet send a jade bot core tier 10 to beta characters. \n\nI didnt have one available and with my lack of resources and no access to the TP, I dont think Ill be able to get one on any beta character. There are Vit->combat stats on some classes (e.g Ele), which are important for trying out benches.",
            "yes its too slow, abyssal raze takes ages to do dmg + its kinda uderwhelming, procing crushing abyss just takes too long if fighting 1 enemy. Whole thing feels not fluid? (im no proffesional gamer just giving my noobie take)",
            "Why can't the devs seem to develop new weapons well anymore. So strange.",
            "Probably in a small camp here but it's ridiculous people are able to beta test spears in competitive pvp and tourneys."

            "Any new info compared to the PC gamer one?",
            "will i be able to invite friends to my instance even if im offline?",
            ">...the decoration crafting system doesn't use the \"crafting XP\" system. It uses whatGuild Wars 2refers to as \"Mastery XP,\"...\n\nSo does this mean that we'll be able to use up excess mastery points? I assume mastery unlocks will use new JW points, but many people have lots of unused mastery points from all other releases. I'm definitely interested to see how this works alongside acquisition of spirit shards. I hope it isn't one or the other, though. For people that don't have piles of shards already, it would feel hard to decide where all of your XP went.",

            "Can anyone explain the appeal of instanced housing? This game's whole skadoodle is based on passively showing off to others. It's called fashion wars for a reason.\n\nI played Palia and it has the same exact system, yet the housing part gets boring after a week once you realize it's just a doll house simulator that no one else can see unless there's some sort of house display or a housing district. And it doesn't seem like we're getting these.",
            "Im not a huge fan of instanced housing - and if they insisted on it, would have been best to revisit home instances - but at least we finally have a housing system.",

Poobadoo's an elementalist that's either in jail or a free quaggan now, so I'll assume that they mixed the two up or just chose Poobadoo because the character count fit better, or it sounded better. Funnier name + is kinda like Grand Poobah.\n\nOf course, between the two, Poobadoo is guilty of far worse crimes",

The power of the great Poobadoo is too much for mere mortals to handle.  Do not fear him.  Her will take to the great beyond.  Only He will show you mercy in this life, hero.\n\nThe mention of \"Her\" in this passage makes me think of Desmina, mostly because Necromancers used to be devoted to Grenth, but with his absence, Desmina is now \"in-charge\", thus Necros would now follow her.\n\nThis is all just fluff, because the real details in of the part that references the Necromancer's great reverence of Poobadoo.  Now, who is Poobadoo?  If you've done Guild Bounties, he would have appeared as a Quaggan Elementalist target at some point.  What sort of crimes has Poobadoo commited?  He is wanted for multiple harassment and public-nuisance complaints.   \n\nNow, what sort of harassments could this innocent-seeming quaggan commit?  Well, when we interact with him, his line is \"Come closer.  Quaggan wants to lick you.\"\n\nHow does he tie in with Necromancers? What is his relationship with Desmina?
