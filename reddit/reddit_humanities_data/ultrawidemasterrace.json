            "Do you play this in offline / are you already banned for this?",
            "Do you still have to deactivate anticheat for ultrawide fixes to work? It is legitimately the one thing holding me back from a purchase.",
            "Just from small clips I\u2019ve seen the environment looks all the same and not very appealing at all.",
            "The amount of passes this game gets for its technical shortcomings is staggering.  I get it\u2019s a stellar game but the PC port left lots to be desired on the tech side of the table.",
            "I had really hoped that with AC6 natively supporting at least 21:9 that by now Elden Ring (which already *renders* the full 21:9 anyways) would have native ultrawide support, but *noooo*."

        "content": "Was using the G9 for both sim racing and gaming but after only sim racing in VR now, I felt the need to upgrade my display.  And OLED was something I really wanted to try, I can say the HDR and pure blacks vs the VA panel on the G9, the upgrade was indeed worth it. I know the word upgrade is kind of subjective as I indeed did lose screen real estate and the higher refresh rate, the oled feels just as fast if not faster even with the lower 175hz. ",

So the stand is a Atdec AWMS-2-BT75-H-S from Amazon\n\nTop monitor is a Gigabyte g27q (I used to have three of them)\nThe ultra wide is the G93SC\n\nBelow that I made my own desk stand- just a couple bits of oak, some stain and then a cannibalized Ugreen iPad stand that I took the base off and screwed into the wood. \n\nI really wanted the balao riser but the cost was insane",
