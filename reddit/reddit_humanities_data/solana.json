        "content": "Hey Solana community,\n\nI want to emphasize that I'm not here to shill\u2014there's no contract address in this post.\n\nI recently launched a memecoin based on the cool and old internet sensation, Kimbo Slice. In just a few days, we\u2019ve taken the project from a $1k market cap to a $60k market cap. This is a legitimate and honest project without the intention to rug.\n\nIn a space where rug pulls and scams are far too common, I\u2019m committed to transparency and integrity. Our Telegram group has grown to 550 members, and we\u2019re building a small, dedicated team of people who believe in the coin and are invested in its success. However, what we really need now is volume and attention to take our project to the next level.\n\nI've already invested a lot of time and resources into this project. Unfortunately, I've been scammed for about 10 SOL by fake paid calls and marketers. Additionally, I've spent $2k on Dexscreener Trending Ads and around $1k on other Dexscreener ads.\n\nI\u2019ve done most of the work myself, but now I need advice on how to gain more visibility. People have recommended raid groups and paid calls, but I\u2019m looking for more reliable and effective methods. If anyone has advice on what to do next or contacts for legitimate groups that can help, I\u2019d really appreciate it.\n\nThanks in advance for your support!",

            "Hey, props to you on launching. Ive done 3 launches and they are not even remotely easy to do. First one was almost all by myself. Exhausting af bro.\n\nDo you have any kind of marketing budget left?",
            "Its all about manipulation my friend. Nothing more... or big big spending early on the project and timing it Like influencers with all the ads etc. Lining up.",
            "How much initial liquidity did you add to the project when you launched, Im working on a project myself and Im waiting to launch the token myself, would like to do it right and we could help eachother out reaching out to more communities",

            "Thank you! Yes if its a legit project, its really a lot of work. But im good with that as long as we see some progress! Dont mind work. \n\nWell I paid for the whole marketing by my own pockets. I still have budget left but need to really think about how and where to spend it.",
            "Initial liquidity was 5 SOL. Make sure you have everything setup before you launch! Its more work than you think! Also I would suggest to have a good idea, a team around it beforehand and a plan how to market it.",
            "Yeah I hear you. Same approach I had. Learned a lot from my mistakes. Also learned 99% of people who contact you first for calls or marketing are TRASH. Wasted a LOT of money on them. And DEX Screener ads are dogshit. Didnt help me one bit.\n\nI gotcha. Feel free to dm me and we can chat. Im planning on doing another meme coin myself but waiting for the market to pick back up.",
            "Do you think the initial buyers of your token were people apart of your community or mostly bots upon launch were you able to profit some upon launching",
