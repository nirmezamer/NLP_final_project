            "People are being so mean to Erin/Starlight from the boys. We get it you think she ruined her face, she\u2019s ugly now, or plastic surgery is unethical blah blah blah. We don\u2019t know if she already feels like shit because of her appearance. All the incel bullying on memes and the boys subs are tired. What one person does to their face shouldn\u2019t elicit this much discourse and it\u2019s honestly pathetic.",
            "I just watched the Bikeriders, it reminds me of my dad that used to own a Harley Davidson Bike, I remembered he and his friends were having breakfast on our home and those bikes noises were so loud.\n\nThe movie itself, I found it pretty good especially, Jodie Cormer, I felt like her performance anchored the movie.",
            "I feel so stupid right now but there was a salesman from a rival internet company who rang my bell and he was talking about some bullshit like they're changing the distribution of the internet in my house that's why they need to check my router and shit and I actually let him in?? Until I realized that he really just tried to talk me into canceling my current internet contract to get a new contract with his company and I said I wasn't interested and he finally left....but he could've been anyone really and I with my 151 cm completely alone just let this strange man into my home \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I'm still reeling from my stupidity \ud83d\ude2d",
            "Inside Out 2 is pretty good. Not as great as the first one, but good enough to make me cry. I really like Joy\u2019s character development in this sequel.",
            "Years ago working at a call center for theater in NYC Joshua Radin (the musician) called trying to get tickets for Sleep No More. Very hot item back then. It was sold out but I loved his music and recognized the name. I made a joke 'Oh like the singer!' to which he goes 'that's me!' Turns out it was. I freaked out but no one in the call center knew who he was. I spoke to my manager and got him two tickets. He was very grateful and invited me to his NYC concert for free (he put me on the VIP list) and I got to go backstage and say hello, sat at a front table... it was way cool.\n\nI brought cupcakes as a thank you (I didn't make them) and, in hindsight, probably shouldn't have as it probably looked weird... BUT THEY WERE GOOD CUPCAKES.",

I'm trying really hard not to look up spoilers (for once), but I'm looking forward to the high-quality concert shots and campiness like in the Chapters videos. I also apologize in advance for the person I'll become (again) after watching it, because I can never just be *chill* about stuff I like. \ud83d\ude05",
