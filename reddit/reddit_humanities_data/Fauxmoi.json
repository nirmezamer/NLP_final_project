            "Megan Thee Stallion? What happened to the allegations?",
            " I want proper insider tea if possible on why Bailey Bass left Interview with the Vampire. The excuse at the time was because of conflicting schedules with Avatar, but she was thrilled talking about how she was just about to start shooting IWTV when she attended the Golden Globes and the IWTV team says they had to hurry to cast Delainey. To me it feels like the Avatar thing was settled before and it was weird. I don\u2019t think the strike played a huge factor either.\n\nPeople have been talking about Bailey taking a turn towards religion, but it seems unfair as well. Delainey has been wonderful as Claudia, I\u2019m just nosey.",

She said she was in a terrible, emotionally abusive relationship, and I'm wondering if he killed her spirit. If so, I hope she heals and gets back to her old self. I miss her.",

They're super hot and it feels like they are the only people from TVD universe who haven't broken up or divorced\n\nAlso, Stephen Amell and his wife Cassandra Jean. I remember he used to have a more wholesome reputation during Arrow years but it seems he is supper messy so there has to be a lot of tea"

I'm a Colin Farrell fan and keep hoping that he'd get more interesting, artsy roles.\n\nI saw Kinds of Kindness last night and while I did not enjoy it, I was reminded of how much I liked The Lobster and The Killing of a Sacred Deer (both of which starred Farrell.)",

When I worked there, we used to joke that we should change the website name to trumpadelestarwars.com bc we literally only \u201creported\u201d on those three topics for a solid month. Fact checking was a joke. And this was before it was sold to Meredith corp, who just keep it around for the name. They\u2019re just doing what they\u2019ve always done: repeat whatever the current mainstream narratives are on politics. And culture. They\u2019re broke as a joke and will do anything to stay afloat.\n\nEdit: OP, please don\u2019t take this as a personal criticism at all! I didn\u2019t intend it that way. \ud83d\ude42 just sort of a PSA lol",
