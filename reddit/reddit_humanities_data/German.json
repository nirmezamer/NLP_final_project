This problem affects some users and not others, and we do not currently know what the cause is. Indeed, it seems to be a Reddit-wide problem, as users on some other subs are experiencing similar issues.\n\nOne solution that often works is to change the method of posting. For example, if you are currently using the regular Reddit website, switching to [old.reddit.com](http://old.reddit.com) or the app can often solve the problem. If doing this does not work, please continue to feel free to reach out to us.",

            "So I actually personally experienced this issue on a different sub. When I tried to post on that sub using new Reddit on my computer, it did not work, but I was able to post using old Reddit. \n\nI then decided to try making a test post on my iPhone, and the post button appears, so it seems that it would work on my phone too. But it could be that the issue affects different people on different subs differently.",
            "Yes, unfortunately not, and the problem now doesn\u2019t only affect Android users. \n\nThis is also not an issue on the other sub that I moderate, but, as I mentioned above, did happen to me on a different sub (using two different browsers on my MacBook).\n\nI just hope that these workarounds work for everyone."

            "Both sentences are correct. They are pretty much synonyms. My gut feeling says hinunter is more common. I\u2019m having a hard time coming up with a real difference atm but here\u2018s one:\n\nhinunterschlingen: if you\u2018re really hungry and you just gulp down your food without really chewing it: \n*Er schlingt das Essen hinunter, als ob er seit Tagen nichts gegessen h\u00e4tte.*\n\nTheoretically hinabschlingen should exist as well but I\u2019ve never seen it used in this way",
            "There isn't really any difference in meaning; \"hinab\" belongs to a much higher register of speech and sounds so formal that it almost makes you sound like you're a time traveller from the 19th century. In ordinary language better say \"hinunter\".",
            "So basically they are synonyms in your example and hinab is I would say a bit old fashioned but they are both slightly different in their meaning in the sense that they enunciate different aspects. Hinab expresses a focus on the fact that you come from above towards the bottom. While hinunter focuses that you go do the bottom (from the above)...I know it's basically the same sentence but the difference in order is a difference in importance for the message in this case. So both words put the focus on a different aspect of the same thing, hence theyre synonyms yet can have a difference in meaning",
