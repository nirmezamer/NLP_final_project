This problem affects some users and not others, and we do not currently know what the cause is. Indeed, it seems to be a Reddit-wide problem, as users on some other subs are experiencing similar issues.\n\nOne solution that often works is to change the method of posting. For example, if you are currently using the regular Reddit website, switching to [old.reddit.com](http://old.reddit.com) or the app can often solve the problem. If doing this does not work, please continue to feel free to reach out to us.",

But it could be that the issue affects different people on different subs differently.",

            "Everythings correct. German uses lots of commas.",
            "It's certainly an unusually large number of commas - but they would all appear to belong there. The sentence itself sounds a little clunky, though. \"Nach dem Aufwachen trinke ich als Erstes ein Glas Wasser\" conveys the same meaning, for example",
            "Grammatically that's certainly true, but style wise I would rather write something like \"Wenn ich morgens aufwache, trinke ich erst einmal ein Glas Wasser\" to avoid that barrage of commas.",

            "This is correct. You may have been taught in English classes that a comma marks a slight pause, but this is untrue: it serves a grammatical function. Even more so in German, where commas are used to separate clauses from each other whether or not you pause when speaking.\n\nIn this sentence, you start with the subject of the main clause, \"Das Erste\". Here the clause is interrupted by two subordinate clauses: \"was ich mache\" and \"wenn ich aufwache\" -- so they have to be separated from the main clause and from each other with commas.\n\nSo far you have \"Das Erste, was ich mache, wenn ich aufwache, ist...\" and from this point on it would normally be plain sailing: \"Das Erste, was ich mache, wenn ich aufwache, ist das Wordle-Rtsel.\" But in this case the complement isn't a simple noun like \"das Rtsel\", it's a whole clause: \"ein Glas Wasser zu trinken\". And because it's a whole clause, that too has to be separated from the rest of the sentence with a comma.\n\nAnd that's why the word \"ist\" is completely surrounded by commas. It looks weird, but those are the rules.",

            "As long as it's clear what is meant and where it is, I wouldn't bother.

Or instead of *Prifysgol Caerdydd* I would go with either \"Cardiff University\" or \"Universitt Cardiff\".\n\nAs a rule of thumb, look up [your university in the German wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Notre_Dame) and go with whatever name they use."
