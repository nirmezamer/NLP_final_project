            "It will be interesting to see how the Russian military adapts and changes over the next couple months. Despite many units having low morale, the attempted(?) mutiny by Wagner, the deliberate targeting of their artillery assets by Ukrainian counter battery fire, and now the removal of frontline commanders due to political maneuvering, they still keep going. \n\nPeople like to talk in absolutes, like saying the Ukrainian counter offensive is failing, or that the Russian units are under equipped. I think its best to assume that most of us havent the slightest clue what is happening at any given moment. No matter how much information we get in real time, its still a war.",
            "Move over Ukraine, USA got a new old side piece, Israel.",
            "By looking at this and a few other conflicts (Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan) I got to a conclusion that we are hungry of some metrics indicating a win or a loss. We lool at destroyed equipment, expended munitions, eliminated personnel and ground covered.\nBut I still struggle to make sense of those numbers. For example, in Vietnam the losses were indicating a clear upper hand by the US, and yet the outcome was nowhere near where that indication was pointing to.\nDoes anyone have any metric that I have missed that may come to help here? Thank you in advance.",
            "Where exactly did the claim that \"NATO is at fault for the war because it was provoking Russia\" come from? I know about Mearsheimer's lecture on Youtube, but is he the first person to use this argument or did he get it from someone else?",
            "So reports are coming in that Wagner has just been decapitated in Russia. A plane carrying Prigozhin and other Wagner folks has crashed killing all onboard.\n\nI suppose Prigozhin's fate was sealed, but I wonder what happens next now.",
            "What is the likelihood that South Korea sends advanced weapons to Ukraine if North Korea sends ammunition to Russia? Will the use of North/South Korean weapons cause any immediate shift in the battlefield in favour of either side?",
            "Russia indeed throwing those bodies into the meat grinder, now those casualties are on putin's shoulders, but if Ukraine, God forbid, losses, all western world would be guilty and those casualties would be on them. I hope you guys understand what I'm saying, success is never blamed. We better help Ukraine as much as we could.",
            "The result of war is always that civilians suffer.",
            "Are there any theories on how this war ends? I don't understand how Russia can move passed all of these sanctions and Ukraine can still regain ground...",
            "I want to discuss a theory. Since we are getting information that Russian forces are leaving ZNPP, and a deliberate sabotage there has a chance to invoke Article 5 of NATO. Would that be a way out of this war for Putin or if NATO involved a regime in Russia would be a given?"

            "Russia cant beat Ukraine. They certainly cant beat the combined forces of Europe (whilst still fighting Ukraine too).\n\nThats why they stuck to hybrid tactics rather than outright war against EU nations",
            "Russia isn't able to occupy a few territories of Ukraine. How can somebody actually think that it has the capability to threaten Europe and Europe would \"defend\" itself or not?\n\nI'm sure this was the mindset of westerners when in 2003 they were scared about Saddam's WMD and ties to Al Qaeda."

            "The US built its global economic empire as a defense strategy, keeping wars abroad protects Americans, allowing nations to conquer other lands threatens the geopolitical system that has kept America safe and even defeated it's only real geopolitical rival in the modern era the Soviet Union. Allowing belligerent nations to grow in power threatens the security of the USA.",
            "the simplest and most truthful answer is that Ukraine winning will help the west project hard and soft power and weaken the east, which helps cement the dominance of the USD and the American economy\n\nwhen the US loses power and influence abroad, people start looking to deal in other currencies and strike agreements with other nations, it weakens the USD and the entire US economy with it",
            "In what world is letting another country get bigger and stronger than you by letting it absorb more land, people, and resources into it while you sit by doing nothing ever a good idea? If you don't like them now, you definitely won't like them when they become 10x than now. Even if you have no issue right now, issues can always develop in the future, by which you'd have to deal with someone who's 10x than before.",
            "You should tell your dad that his way of thinking is what caused America to eventually get forced into WW1 and WW2.\n\nShutting the windows, pretending everything is fine, while fascists run rampant across the globe, is only going to succeed in delaying conflict. It will come, and the longer you wait to address it, the worse it hurts.",
            "Directly, I don't think it actually helps the US. It does help the US indirectly as it is draining Russia's military and cash far more rapidly than Russia can sustain.  The war is comparatively low cost for NATO.  Generally, the common wisdom is that Russia will run out of equipement by 2026 or so if something radical isn't done to replenish it. Right now, Russia is mostly coasting off the reserves of the USSR, especially in terms of military equipment. If Russia stops now, they could possibly rebuild their reserves of equipment in 10 years or so, if they really go on a focused building program. In a couple more years, it could take them a *generation* to rearm to the level that they were at before the war. \n\nIn general, the current way things are going is good for NATO, since they can bleed Russia of resources, can easily beat any possible investment Russia could economically put into the war, and can do so without risking the lives of their citizens.",
            "If we let Russia take Ukraine, there's a very good chance the Russians will expand further west into Europe where they have various territorial and cultural claims and they may eventually make it somewhere in Europe where the US has strong interests in and will inevitably be drawn into a significantly more costly war, perhaps within a generation. \n\nIn contrast, Ukraine seems to be able to match Russia on the battlefield (when they have US military aid) and are bleeding the Russian military of personnel and equipment--all without the use of US troops and at around 5% of the DOD's annual budget.",
            "Its cheaper to contain Russia in Ukraine than to let Russia grow and contain/combat it at a later stage",
            "Could appeal to American Honor? In exchange for their nukes after the Soviet Union collapse, the US and Russia agreed  in the Trilateral Statement to provide security assurances. If he has any care for American honor or prestige, then helping those who we say we will help is a basic tenet of honor.",
            "I dont think we really need to defend Ukraine if Ukraines own neighbors around Europe wont put in their share. Its always the US that pays the most, while other countries basically sit back and watch, or just act like they are helping. \n\nAs an American tax payer, I would like to see a return on my investment as a citizen that pays taxes. But Ive yet to see ANY return on my investment. Instead, all I see is my country helping other countries out, not its own citizens. We have so many problems in the US, why are we spending $200B to fight in Ukraine? it just doesnt make sense to the citizens, it only makes sense for the politicians and the government. This needs to stop.",

            "This specific place is considered by China & India to be vital for 2 reasons: firstly, it can be used to attack into vulnerable Indian positions in the Siliguri Corridor, which is considered by India to be an unacceptable threat; secondly, it controls the high ground over the Chumbi Valley, which is the shortest/easiest invasion route from India towards Lhasa. It was used by the 1904 British Younghusband Expedition to strike north from India and there are no further natural obstacles between Chumbi and Lhasa that would prevent an obstacle to a modern military. \n\nBoth sides have catastrophic narratives around the area: India says that China could use Doklam to split Indian and Bhutanese forces and drive through to cut the Siliguri Corridor in a few days, while China says that India could use Doklam to seize the Chumbi Valley and drive for Lhasa with the Dalai Lama at the head of a Tibetan uprising and exile army.
