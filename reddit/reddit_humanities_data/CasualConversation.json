            "This is why I don\u2019t play video games anymore. I feel guilty about the hours wasted playing them, I didn\u2019t used to feel that way, Netflix was next that made me feel guilty, so now when I watch things I do something else at the same time like practice guitar or tinker with something, cook, research how to do my next car repair etc. this helps but not all the way. Reddit I try to do in short bursts. I\u2019ve never downloaded TikTok but I\u2019ve used reals and YouTube shorts and I try to stay away from those as well because the feeling at the end is always horrible. I\u2019ve quit drinking at well, it didn\u2019t help anything but I feel healthier, I try to stay productive as much as possible but it\u2019s always an uphill battle and small victories feel like nothing but the losses give me so much anxiety and guilt it tears me apart emotionally so I try my best. I feel lost most the time. And try not to stress the future as much as I can. Doing literally nothing will either drive me to sadness or anger or both. Sleeping the day away is the worst. I have so little free time and sparse and random days off. So I want to make the most of it but usually I don\u2019t. I sacrifice sleep for time for myself. I hate chores but do them because I must and still feel I wish I had more time first longer than a day for just me and what I really want to do. At least I don\u2019t have children I tell myself. I\u2019m grateful I don\u2019t have any chronic pain and I\u2019m still young -ish but more time and money is still the dream. Anyways I guess I\u2019m rambling but yeah I feel guilty when doing nothing.",

I'm a bit worried having a sedentary life again after years of depression, that's why being productive occupies my mind and got used to it to the point I constantly think if there any else I could do.",
            "I've had one of those days today and here I am tonight feeling that guilt come on when I could have done so many other things, but I'm trying to be kind to myself as I've just moved cities so it's been a big change managing that and many other things going on in life right now. Thankfully tomorrow is another day and I'll hopefully have the energy to do everything I didn't do today.",
            "Never feel guilty for doing absolutely nothing when you've already done far more hours working to support yourself and your loved ones. I always take 9hrs of every Sunday and do absolutely nothing. Sometimes I split the hours up amongst the day. But most times I take 4.5 during the day, and 4.5 that night. Pick a day of the week and make that your weekly do nothing day. Start at 4hrs that day. And work up from there."
