        "content": "I (F17) love my little brother (M11) so much. He's genuinely the sweetest and kindest kid ever. He's so calm and patient even though he's only 11. I'm convinced he's a saint or an angel or something. The other day when our parents went to work, I went to wake him up and he reached his arms out to hug me but his eyes were still closed and he looked like he was asleep. I thought maybe he thought I was our mom, but later when I told him about how he hugged me in his sleep, he said, \"I know, I just wanted to hug you\" and I literally felt tears prick my eyes because it was so sweet. We hug each other a lot but it just made me feel so warm inside when he said that. He's just so adorable. I've always taken care of him because he's my little sibling and I love him, but he's also always checking in on me and asking if I'm okay if he thinks I'm not okay. He's so in tune with others' feelings and so emotionally intelligent; he never says anything that could hurt someone's feelings. I feel so lucky to have a brother like him. Sometimes I look over at him or see the way he responds to a situation and want to be more like him. Even though he's younger than me I genuinely look up to him. When I talk about moving out for college in front of him he gets so sad and his eyes get teary and he says he'll miss me. The thought of leaving for college next year makes me so sad because I'll miss him so much. I'm literally crying as I'm writing this post because I just love him so much and I needed to say it.",

I usually did my shopping in the middle of the night it just felt more convenient.plus I just liked having somewhere to wander at night. There used to be people out and about late before now there's barely cars on the road past 10pm. So yeah any other night people miss having stuff to go out and do? This is probably directed at smaller town people. Im guessing big citys like Chicago and NY probably have stuff open late.",

            "Youd be surprised. I lived in Dc for a few years up until last year and many places closed at like 8 I also miss being able to go out and shop at night. It was always so much less overstimulating, plus sometimes you need some snacks at 2 am and now you have nowhere to get them :(",
            "I used to love late night walks and getting a quick snack from a Kroger, CVS, or a Walmart but the latest you can see a store open is 10 pm and it kinda sucks. I'd normally pick up a snack and find a place to just sit and look at the scenery for about 30 minutes or so. I don't walk anymore bc I can't grab something from a store anymore.",

I miss them tremendously :'(( Living in Vegas 10 years you get super spoiled with everything being open 24/7, then you leave to go literally anywhere and good luck finding anything to do or purchase past 9:51pm lol  It's terrible, truly one of the harshest realities post-pandemic, no doubt",

Even at 3am the store would be busy.  Plus I am not one to go to bed early, so late at night, I do things, like an oil change, or notice a light bulb out, or rip a button off a shirt and need a sewing kit.  Walmart was always my option.
