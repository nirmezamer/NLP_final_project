While on an EM rotation, a med student showed up to the work room for her night shift. Confused, an EM resident told her that tonight\u2019s medical student was already here - surely a scheduling mistake. He gestured to a young man in a short white coat with the school\u2019s patch on it. She stared at him closely for a moment then said, \u201cHe\u2019s not a med student. He doesn\u2019t go to this school.\u201d Cue anxious whispering. I hadn\u2019t worked with him, but I turned my attention to his fit: school logo was a patch, not embroidered, badge was fake, etc. He had been in the ED seeing patients and telling people he was in med school both at the hospital and in his personal life. The (real) med students later showed me screenshots from his Facebook page showing him posing in a long white coat, bogus transcripts that nobody who went to med school would ever think were real, photos in the ED with patient info/scans visible, and saying he was a \u201ctrauma surgery intern\u201d whatever that means as a med student. Homeboy got led out of there in cuffs. Not sure what ultimately happened to him in terms of charges but the nerve to just show up to clerkships\u2026 I\u2019ll never quite grasp that mentality. \n\nAny of y\u2019all ever had a fake med student?\n\nEdit: If anyone reading this is a former (or current) medical student impersonator, I think the group would be genuinely fascinated to hear your story and what your overall plan was.

        "content": "Hello friends! I'm finally at the finish line of 9 years of training and SO thankful that it's over.\n\n**First - I'm going to insert my rant**:\n\nOver the last two years of speciality training, the number of times I've wanted to pull my hair out from the phone calls at night.. \"We wanted to make you aware of this patient.\" (For no particular reason other than they get chronic dialysis). \"I need urgent dialysis on this patient\" (Call at 10PM for labs that returned at 6AM). Other \\*clearly\\* non urgent consults at 3AM. Most specialities take home call. This doesn't mean I'm at home, peacefully sleeping in my bed and also get a post-call day after. It means I just finished a 10-12 hour day. Am now having disrupted sleep and still have to work the next 10-12 hours tomorrow. Calls that may seem harmless are not innocuous. I've had 30+ pages in one night. I cannot always fall right back asleep after getting paged. I know that often attendings will make ya'll call but please be the absolute most mindful as possible. If you must call, please be as prepared as humanly possible, know exactly what you're consulting for and ALWAYS speak to your attending before you call me. Particularly in the world of nephrology, I'm frequently consulted by residents for very clear IM issues that do not require speciality level knowledge. Ie - Your attending should be able to answer if your patient needs a bicarb drip.\n\n**Now onto other things:**\n\nNo matter where you are in your training, there are times you are going to want to quit. This job is going to burn you out. Just know that it is (unfortunately) normal and don't be afraid to ask for help. I have gone to therapy throughout the entirety of my training and wouldn't have done it any other way. If you need a break or more sleep, say you need it. No one will advocate for yourself other than you. Do not skip doctor's appointments. Your attendings can be as grumpy about it as they want but ACGME protects trainees. ACGME clearly states in their policies that trainees are allowed to sleep if needed, leave work if they feel they are not able to practice medicine and attending all doctor's appointments. If they say no, report them. Do NOT neglect yourself in an environment where we are brainwashed to think this is normal. You're not a champion for making yourself suffer. The only one that loses is you. Check in with yourself as much as you can.\n\nAlways, alway, always be nice to nurses. Sometimes it can be tough as a trainee because the nurses can be particularly cruel at times. I've experienced more abuse as a female trainee from nurses (not all of them) than my male colleagues. Try to shake it off as best you can because they will make your life harder if you're not. Also, just make sure you're treating other colleagues as good humans in general.\n\nDon't allow any staff to be creepy with you. You are supposed to be feel safe in your work space. GME is there if you need help with this. \n\nYou're going to make mistakes and it's okay. Own it. DO NOT hide it. It will make everything worse if you do.\n\nStart training with little expectations of yourself. You didn't finish medical school one day and then suddenly know all of internal medicine (or whatever residency) on day 1 of residency. Sometimes it might feel like other people around you know more than you. They might, they might not. They may also never sleep or have insane anxiety. Don't compare. You're not inferior or inadequate. We all have strengths and weaknesses. Just try to fill in your own gaps. \n\nMake a support system. Training is one of the few times in life that you sort of have built in friends. Everyone is going through the same struggle. In residency, I always prioritized sleep over social interaction and doing fun things. In fellowship, I learned it's better and healthier to strike a balance.\n\nExercise and eat as best you can. But do NOT pressure yourself or make yourself feel guilty because you're not able to stick to a work out schedule or eat perfectly healthy. It's not reasonable or realistic. Congrats to those who can do it but I find that most of us can't and beating yourself up over it is a waste of time.\n\nTry to maintain contact with family if you're able. There's definitely a balance to strike here because family can also be stressful. I can't speak to what it's like to have children in training and I'm endlessly impressed by those who do. I had days where I was lucky if I did dishes. \n\nLastly, and I cannot say this enough.. **be kind to yourself**. You are doing YOUR best, whatever that looks like.\n\nGood luck everyone out there!",

Medicine can be a bizarrely niche culture.\n* If you visit on weekends there will likely be some where she is in the hospital the majority of the weekend. She can't do anything about this.\n* Residency can be physically taxing. There may be some days where she literally doesn\u2019t have the energy to do anything besides lie in bed.\n* Inpatient months will be the worst for her.
