I am a doctor too. I know things can get quite busy. But at the end of the day, a patient's doctor's notes isn't your personal diary...its meant for somebody else to read it.\n\nI have literally sat at the desk next to colleagues each of us writing and by the time some of them are done making notes...nobody can understand what's written except the original writer.\n\nThis makes follow-up appointments extremely frustrating...because you have no idea what the previous doctor wrote.\n\n",
