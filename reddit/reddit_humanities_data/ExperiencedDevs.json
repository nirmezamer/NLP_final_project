I come from a bootcamp so I know that my coding skills are sub par, and im a girl and very social due to my hospitality background ,but should i just throw the towel and start accepting that im not good a coding and good at more non technical stuff ? I feel so scared to change jobs since i know how bad the market is and since i dont have a traditional education in cs and the fact that i barely made any skill improvements. I also have no mentor in my team since the only developer that was a mentor like to me has now been promoted to architect and no longer works as close to me and the sole 10x developer is a senior who cant stand me. \nI feel like watching tutorials at home only takes me so far and my justified imposter syndrom is eating me up.",

I will check on him, he will paste big chunk of codes in the chat to prove that he's working on it... ask if it's a good approach. I told him as long as it works I am not going to dictate which approach he chose. Later check on him again and he said everything was going great and his code was working. Later when I tested it out, it was not working at all. I can't help but feel very frustrated, like WTF dude?? Is he straight up lying or is he really that dense? \n\nWhat can I do in this situation?

They emphasized a good onboarding process in the interview and mentioned their guide of setup etc\n\n- my team is always stuck in meetings or is too busy locked in, each of the other SDETS is silo'ed to a specific thing and they're a SME of their already specific knowledge\n\nQuestion: How do I dig myself out of SDET and into devops/backend/data eng/datasci?\n\nBackground: (1y devops intern, 1y backend intern, graduated in industrial eng with stats+computing specialization and research with prof so I know a bit about ML/Data Eng, just looking to break through and take a career limiting move in SDET)",

He\u2019s intelligent and can understand things (business or technical) quite quickly and have answers ready. My problem with him is that he pretty much likes to be a one-man army and eventually hogs all the work for himself.  I don\u2019t think I am a bad developer, but if it was a race then I would probably lose to him. But its not a race right ? The fact he wants to do all the things makes me think that I\u2019m in some sort of a race, which is quite frustrating. I\u2019ve talked to him directly about this and it does appear that he\u2019s attempting to share the work. Hopefully stays that way. \n\n\nHave you ever experienced this and how did you approach this ?",

Till now whatever tickets I\u2019ve been assigned, I have completed them based on the same pattern it has been done elsewhere in the code base itself.

I have recently started doing personal projects to get back into backend development because it's more interesting.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n\n\n* How is my 1.5 years of experience seen from a backend hiring manager point of view?\n* What is a good way to answer why I did QA for a year? The real reasons are I got laid off from my first job and I had little motivation to do personal projects. During interviews, I will mention being laid off in a tough market. What else can I say?"

            "I'd say it's often difficult and unnecessary to try to understand the true motives behind things like this. Your manager has his manager, then there's HR, the person in charge of HR, they all can have different opinions on titles, roles, compensation, promotions. Best is to assume the they are all a bit lazy and selfish (and you should be too) and partially in a conflict with each other, and what you are experiencing is a often an unintended result of all of that. It's not like they all had a meeting where they agreed \"hey let's take advantage of this guy\". The sad reality is they often care and think about you much less the you think. There's no point trying to teach anyone any lessons, people generally don't learn or change. Think about what you want, what you're willing to risk, what's best for you, and how you want to achieve that.",
            "What\u2019s your contract and job description say?\n\nSounds like they know the market is tough and trying it on, not a good sign with so many others leaving.\n\nIf the contract says and job description are very different you can try to push back but ultimately you probably need to decide do you want the job or begin looking elsewhere.\n\nThe market is tough with lots of competition for roles in general so think before you jump. Best of luck!",
            "Yes. This is normal. At least in the UK and EU. I\u2019ve been given the responsibilities that, by the definition of roles, would require a promotion. I thought fine, and I\u2019ll get the promotion next time. Nope, I just got \u201cyou\u2019re doing a great job! Carry on\u201d.\n\nMoving jobs every couple of years, is common for a reason.\n\nOnly thing I\u2019d say, is that if this is an area you\u2019re interested in, a year getting to grips with the role might help for the next job.",
            "Get the role title. Look for another company. Don't invest too much in the role. Do not really try to succeed. Fail and accept failing. Do less than half the job your previous coworker was doing.\n\nYou don't have the pay, you don't have the experience, you don't even have a manager that's being positive for you, you don't have the team...\n\nI would make them learn their mistakes. Obviously it's a fighting choice in some way (more passive than active).\n\nSo I would make them rely on me, then I would let them down for the exact reason they refused me anything I asked. They are putting you in that position ignoring the risk?\n\nI am french, we have a history of fighting against gov or \"bourgeoisie\". I've been given shit for years. Then I changed my way of doing things. \n\nFor example:\n\n3 years ago, my manager told me that my contract had specific hours that I should be following. I was starting to work around 10 and was finishing around 5pm. But i was answering and working outside of these hours. I argued that it was not a good idea to push for that. It would backfire. He insisted. I did my hours 9 to 6. Nothing outside. He lost half my work power for seeing me less than 2 hours more a day. The team followed me. In the end, he let us do as we were doing already (and was working neat already).\n\nYour manager is lame, make their manager know by pressing metrics related to their decision. Workers are more important than managers. People tend to forget that. If the work isn't done, the manager's KPI drop, their position too.\n\nEdit: important note, in this fight, you should be prepared to lose your job. That's why you should be looking elsewhere. Teach them, but don't stay around.",
            "It\u2019s kind of both. They have calculated that they can save on one staff salary by putting former staff engineer duties on senior/mid level (not sure what level you\u2019re at). So, you\u2019re likely being used there in that way.\n\nBut they are also not wrong it could go in your favor. Start doing those things too, start interviewing, see if you can sell yourself elsewhere with that experience/duties as staff/principal. If you manage to land such role soon, great, you\u2019ve showed them that they undervalued you. If not, well, the reality leans more towards their arguments then.",
            "Companies will use very trick in the book to try to compensate you as little as possible. It makes most sense from a company's POV to pay you just enough that you don't get unhappy enough to leave. \n\nSo if you come across as someone who just takes what your manager said to you and just roll over like a good little doggie, they'll never give you the salary that they are actually willing to pay for your role.\n\nThis is also why you see often that a new hire makes a ton more for the same role; they really needed someone to fill the role. And the other existing devs never expressed enough unhappiness.\n\nTry resigning. You'll suddenly see they are more than willing to offer a much higher compensation.\n\nCompanies are in no way loyal to employees, and neither should you be in return. It's simply a business transaction and should be seen that way.",
            "Here's what I have done in the past: Tell them you'll do it, but you want a change in job title--this costs them nothing monetarily. Make the title as marketable as you can. Something like \"Lead Architect\" or whatever you feel is best for you. Then find a comparable role at another company that actually pays what that role is worth. Head there.",
            "It's not a corporate bullshit if it's true. You proceed with a role, learning new stuff and getting better. If the current company fails to compensate the extra knowledge and load, you now have this experience for a company that needs you.",
            "I am going to be that guy.  How big can a project be with a team of 3 where two people can do all of the coding? \n\nAnd what does a \u201cstaff architect\u201d actually mean in a small \u201cscale up\u201d company?"

Things happen. The cause of bugs are engineers. We stop shipping on some times of the year when we absolutely need to have our services up.\n\nIf something happens *again*, we go over the first review, we see what recommendations were there, if they would have stopped the second incident.

            "Don\u2019t take it personally, no code review, no testing\u2026 this would have happened to the best of devs",
            "Rushed project with no review? Amazing there are only two known bugs. Congrats!",
            "I had a somewhat similar experience around 20 years ago - my task at the time was to convert data from XML generated by, I think, a SOAP-like web-interface, to some ancient file-format last updated in the early seventies. I did not have acces to any tools that could either read or write that format, only the original spec written for mainframe-programmers. Whenever I thought I had a running version, I'd have to ask my manager to ask the customer to run some queries and test the output.\n\nIt seemed to work for a few months, then suddenly broke.\n\nTurned out I hadn't accounted for the fact that some of the strings in the modern database were longer than were accepted by the mainframe. This wasn't mentioned in the spec, because it was standard for that kind of machine back in the day.\n\nWell, I fixed it, but **my boss suggested that I shouldn't be paid for the fix**, since I was the cause of the bug.\n\nI got extremely upset - this was just the latest in a series of bad experiences - and I told him that I would immediately roll back the code to the previous version, quit, and they would have to pay someone else a lot more to figure out what was happening. He apologized and of course I was paid ... I still quit a short time later though - but let the code stay functional.\n\n  \nAnyways - I don't think either of us handled that very professionally back then. Today, and in your specific case, I would \"apologize\" for the bug, excuse myself with that the project was very new to me, on a tight deadline, and without any way of organized test or review. And then take it as an opportunity to suggest either a more test-driven approach, or as a minimum acceptance-tests or perhaps code reviews with other developers. And stress that since the project is important, we should all be interested that no bugs slip through the cracks, so the more eyes on the finished work, the better. You could even suggest that were you to review others' code, you would also improve your own understanding of the intricacies of the platform or something ...\n\nA bit of a \"humble politicians-ploy\" to suggest improving quality reviews and such!",
            "There's a lot to be said about how this is wrong on so many levels, but you asked about how to salvage this. Let's see. \n\n1. Ask your boss who's responsibility it is to establish and enforce software development processes in the dev teams, processes that maximize effectiveness and mitigate risks.\n\n2. Based on his answer discuss with him where he thinks your role is in all this. Does he expect you to come up with process improvement proposals? Or just small improvements?\n\n3. If his answers are \"I don't know / I don't care / we don't need this / just don't make bugs\" then there's little hope.\n\nEdit: There's a chance he is waiting for someone in the dev teams to step up and help him establish these things, which would make this a great career growth opportunity for you."
