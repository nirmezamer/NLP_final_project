Sexist, racist, or violent language of any kind, directed towards any group or individual, will result in an automatic ban from this subreddit. Hateful language against moderators is loosely permitted. \n\n3. So long as no reddit site-wide rules are broken and the content pertains to /r/berkeley, we the moderators stick by our promise that critical topics involving public figures, the city of Berkeley, and the University, will stay up without any form of censorship. Posts regarding a certain professor, who is a public figure of interest, will continue to stay up.\n\n4. While professors are not part of the personal information exemption, any students or non-public figures implicated in screenshots must have their names and pictures blacked out. Screenshots of comments by professors, while allowed in this subreddit, *cannot* also contain names of students. Doing so creates a safe environment for all contributors.\n\n5. When traffic to this subreddit increases due to drama, automod rules become more strict. Most subreddits have tighter filters for \"high drama\" days, and this subreddit is no different. Posts that have been removed due to heightened automod vigilance were removed automatically, and not due to censorship. All posts are allowed so long as they stick to site-wide rules. If you believe your post was removed unfairly, message the moderators. \n\n6. The subreddit or its moderators are not affiliated with the University in any way. While we do have events involving sometimes Chancellor AMAs, the University has no influence over moderators removing posts. Likewise, no subreddit moderators work for the University in any capacity, nor are we compensated by the University. I am however very much open to being compensated. If you're listening, Chancellor Christ, my Venmo is open. \n\n7. The Cal seal was removed because some people have been accusing moderators of doing the University's bidding when it comes to sensitive topics, and being a part of University staff. Seeing as the Cal seal is protected and not allowed to be used outside of approved cases, but /r/berkeley had it, we were feeding into this conspiracy by keeping the seal on. \n\n8. If you made it this far, we are taking applications for new subreddit logo designs. Post design ideas in the comment section below. Stick to reddit rules and Intellectual Property laws.",

            "This is why its important when you are bullied or abused to go to the police station or call the police (THEY ARE HERE TO HELP YOU) so the law can effectively and legally handle the situation. Other people like school staff will try to protect themselves by not making a fuss or you are not allowed to say exactly who did this to you publicly making it hard for victims to know what to do or stop the harassment or give consequences to the abuser. I know this because its happened to me before a few times and the only thing that stopped it was telling my school counselor or telling the police. Telling my RA, arguing with my teacher, or (in my case) telling my family or even relatives was useless.",
