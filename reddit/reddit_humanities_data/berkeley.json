            "Commuter student housing option!\n\nHi all, for those who may be commuter students atm, I\u2019m looking for a weekday roommate. Someone who is interested in staying in Berkeley during the weekdays for classes, lab, research, or work and likely to be back home or elsewhere for the weekends. Rent would be negotiable since it\u2019s a weekday stay, but I was thinking $400-600/mo for a space in a large shared room that is very close to campus. Cost is negotiable and I\u2019m really flexible. \n\nI used to be a commuter transfer student and wished options like this existed during my first year, so hopefully this can be a useful affordable housing option for someone interested! You can really immerse yourself in being at Berkeley, not worry about traffic everyday, reduce cost of rent, and avoid the commuter student fomo. \n\nIf you would like to know more about the room/home feel free to reach out! I\u2019m preferably looking for a woman or non-binary roommate.",

Sexist, racist, or violent language of any kind, directed towards any group or individual, will result in an automatic ban from this subreddit. Hateful language against moderators is loosely permitted. \n\n3. So long as no reddit site-wide rules are broken and the content pertains to /r/berkeley, we the moderators stick by our promise that critical topics involving public figures, the city of Berkeley, and the University, will stay up without any form of censorship. Posts regarding a certain professor, who is a public figure of interest, will continue to stay up.\n\n4. While professors are not part of the personal information exemption, any students or non-public figures implicated in screenshots must have their names and pictures blacked out. Screenshots of comments by professors, while allowed in this subreddit, *cannot* also contain names of students. Doing so creates a safe environment for all contributors.\n\n5. When traffic to this subreddit increases due to drama, automod rules become more strict. Most subreddits have tighter filters for \"high drama\" days, and this subreddit is no different. Posts that have been removed due to heightened automod vigilance were removed automatically, and not due to censorship. All posts are allowed so long as they stick to site-wide rules. If you believe your post was removed unfairly, message the moderators. \n\n6. The subreddit or its moderators are not affiliated with the University in any way. While we do have events involving sometimes Chancellor AMAs, the University has no influence over moderators removing posts. Likewise, no subreddit moderators work for the University in any capacity, nor are we compensated by the University. I am however very much open to being compensated. If you're listening, Chancellor Christ, my Venmo is open. \n\n7. The Cal seal was removed because some people have been accusing moderators of doing the University's bidding when it comes to sensitive topics, and being a part of University staff. Seeing as the Cal seal is protected and not allowed to be used outside of approved cases, but /r/berkeley had it, we were feeding into this conspiracy by keeping the seal on. \n\n8.
