        "content": "yesterday I was discussing a new food with someone. They said they didn't like it because of the onions on it and I responded \"oh I love onions, I could eat so many lol\". She rolled her eyes at me and told me I'm not special and lots of people like onions. It rlly caught me off guard because it was a weirdly negative way to interpret my love for onions. I never said I'm the only person who loves onions and it was a direct correlation to the conversation we were having\n. That's not the only time I've felt like people judge me for trying too hard to be \"not like other girls\" when I'm just living a normal life. This was just my most recent example. It's rlly interesting and ironic to me that this concept started as a way of normalizing girls being individuals but has now somewhat turned into just another way to bully girls who don't do or say the exact right things at all times. It's so strange to me that simply expressing my opinion warranted such a negative response.",

            "My dad and I don't like pickles so when we go out to eat, we give my mom our pickle spears. She likes them enough to eat both of ours but accepting and eating them doesn't mean anything other than she doesn't dislike them like my dad and I do.",
