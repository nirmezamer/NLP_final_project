(Not that being gay is a burn, and I don't think this kid would think of it that way, we have a variety of sexual curiosities going on as they hit puberty, but the way she turned it on him is the burn).",

This was in front of my female friend at that time who very much liked shopping for clothes, so I told him that there's nothing stupid about wanting to buy clothes, it's just as valid as a hobby as collecting figures (and I do both now! Love me some vintage fashion) and the way my friend's eyes lit up when I said that is something I still remember 10 years later.

            "When Mr Rogers taught me that everyone is unique. I'm completely different from everyone else around me, and they are all just as different too. And that these differences are to be embraced and celebrated. \n\nSo really, there are no \"other girls\" because nobody fits in a mold.",
            "sometime in college? i grew up in a conservative household so i thought doing boy things made me cooler. once i moved out i started to see how dumb it was to strive for male validation and that i was proud to be like other girls, because other girls are awesome :)",
            "I was always the kind of weird, quiet girl in class. I didn't understand the importance that other kids put on social hierarchies and popular vs unpopular. I developed this sense of snobbery around 10/11 because I was \"so much smarter than the rest of the girls, I don't even care about lipgloss and dances, etc etc etc.\"\n\nThat changed around 14, I went on a field trip to a museum (or something, I don't remember), and I got put into a group with 3 of the most popular girls in my year. It was kind of like a scavenger hunt for facts on different topics, and once you filled out your team sheets and handed them in, you had free time to do whatever you wanted to do. I totally expected that they were going to leave me to fill out the worksheets alone. Instead, one of them suggested we assign questions by who was more interested in what topics, split up in teams of 2 to get our answers, and peer review our answers before handing them in. We were the first group to finish and got perfect marks. We had loads of time to have lunch together, walk around different exhibits, chat and discuss, and I realized they were really nice, very smart girls just like me and that my \"ugh lipgloss girls \ud83e\udd2e\" mentality was completely out of line.",
            "Soon after I started engineering school. I was a bit of a pick me/nlog, I was in a class of 40 guys and was one of 2 girls, halfway through the first semester I was like: are these the guys I was trying to impress?\n\n![gif](giphy|to3I2nkywr2PS)\n\nThen leaving my teenage years I realized girls are awesome and what makes us different add to their charm. I came to admire girls I'd look down on before. Somewhere between 19-21 I stopped being a judgmental bitch towards both genders.\n\nI did end up marrying one of the guys I met there though, he impressed me!",
            "maybe i did and i just forgot, but i dont really remember having one when i was younger despite it being common for quite a few little girls\n\ni was always a \"girly girl\" myself, and never really had real resentment for things associated w that esp since i indulged in it myself, neither things associated w/ femininity & women in general who may or may not conform to those things. \n\ni felt kinda distant in friend groups, but not in a NLOG superiority complex way. it was bc i was generally very shy & had anxiety + i was possibly ND which distanced me from... everyone. but i never thought i was *too* different in interests \n\ni was insecure ofc, but i never really projected it onto other girls. my frustration was with the world in general for many reasons \ud83d\udc80",
            "College. When I left a strongly religious environment, I realized my dislike for all things feminine came from warped ideas of what feminity is. I realized I felt \"unique\" because I didn't see myself as lesser or shameful, characteristics I had unconsciously begun to associate with womanhood. And I realized that this diminished view of women suspiciously benefits the authority figures who taught it to me in the first place. \n\nPlus I dormed with a lot of very intelligent, sweet women in my freshman year. They were partiers, academics, athletes, loners, poets, etc. and every one of them was unlike anyone else.",
            "I never had this \"oh I'm so unique, woohoohoo\" attitude. I knew was different than other kids (so also girls), but that was because of my autism. I was the weird kid. Back then I couldn't always handle that, but as time passed on, I embraced it. However, I frown upon people who want to be \"weird\" and start to go over the top in doing that, because I know they're \"faking\" it. Being the \"weird\" one is nine out of ten times not a funny or nice experience. Like, you know you're the odd one out, but there is nothing you can change about it. You will always be the odd one out, no matter how hard you try. And especially at puberty, kids (and people basically) are cruel so it's hell.",

            "I think it was truly when I had a daughter. \n\n\nI have done research for uni\u2019s about racial and gender bias and know that a lot of girls are told to be pretty and put into pretty clothes/hair and then parents will restrict their movements because of these things- which leads toddlers into very different interests, very early.  \n\n\n\n\nSo I didn\u2019t want to do that so I was planning on raising a \u201cnot girly\u201d child. \n\n\nMy neighbor said her mother ALWAYS corrected people\u2019s compliments to her and her sister, \u201cshe\u2019s so pretty\u201d \u201cbut why aren\u2019t you talking about how smart/talented they are??\u201d (Sounded like my responses). \n\n\nMy 45yo neighbor said, \u201cI just always wondered why I couldn\u2019t be smart AND pretty\u201d and it blew my mind open in a way that practicing feminism hadn\u2019t in the previous 10 years. \n\n\nNow my 3yo daughter has a closet full of tutus and taffeta because she likes dressing up. \n\n\nThe answer wasn\u2019t not putting her in dresses, it was setting up a system where I wouldn\u2019t then restrict her movement (buying used clothes so I\u2019m mot mad when the pretty things \u201cget dirty\u201d and putting shorts underneath &c.)",
            "I don't think I ever really did have this phase? I was always bullied and so I took being different as negative rather than the \"pick me\" standpoint. \n\nAs I get older I feel more connection with people around me and my people pleasing empathetically in tuned self just wants to keep helping all the time. \n\nMore than anything, I'm just growing out of the phase of \"I need to meet everyone else around me's expectations\" I think."
