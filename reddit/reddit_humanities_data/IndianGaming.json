            "Alan Wake 2 is completely made for people like me that have severe anxiety, it portrays anxiety very well, and the layout of this game is that you have to solve the case as Saga Amdersson and as Alan Wake being a Writer, changing some little parts of the story makes a lot of difference in the entire story, being alan wake you have to   re-edit the parts of story to make a new story that fits well according to the situation or i say the chapter in order to go ahead, yeah the jumpscares were wild in this game there is a script or a mod that actually disables the jumpscare if you find it weird while playing but although with further it gets more and more predictable. Remedy Games have actually made their games to be in the very same universe (Remedy Games Universe) all these games are made in the very single universe which includes Control, Quantum Break, Ahti was in Control, the cop is actually main protag in quantum break ( i haven't played quantum break till now, maybe someday i get time i'll play it surely)",
