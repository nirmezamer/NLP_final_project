            "Given the latest rumors, the Leafs could bring back Domi and Bert at a combined ~$8-9m. That'd be 12 forwards, 4 defense, 1 goalie (not accounting for RFAs or potential rookies).\n\nLeaves ~$11.5m for two defenseman and a goalie. If they replace Kampf with Dewar, it's probably an extra $1.5m.\n\nObviously tight and not ideal, but there's a path where that's enough for something like Tanev + Roy + Backup Goalie.",

            "Don`t want him. Screams overapy to me someone is going  regret paying him",
            ">Watch him play and dig into more granular data, and you start to see where Zadorov\u2019s inflated confidence of being much more than that stems from.\n\n>Zadorov is 6-foot-6 and 248 pounds \u2014 a man mountain who can impose his will, making him an asset defending the rush. In each of the last three seasons, he\u2019s defended at or above 50 percent of entries, a strong mark. Perhaps more surprising is his puck-moving ability. His exit volume was very high last season and he did so with control 56 percent of the time. He was even better last season, too, and was also strong retrieving pucks. But that\u2019s not all. Zadorov also does a strong job joining the rush, doing so frequently and providing a major boost to the team\u2019s offense. According to Sznajder\u2019s tracking, Zadorov looks like a difference-maker in several key possession-driving areas.\n\n\n>It\u2019s difficult to reconcile why his on-ice numbers aren\u2019t stronger and why he\u2019s rarely trusted in a top-four role when he looks like he can do a whole lot more than you\u2019d expect with the puck for a man of his size. It\u2019s easier to make possession-driving plays lower in the lineup and there\u2019s no guarantee he can still be an effective puck-mover in the top four. But still, he has the profile of someone who can hang. He showed as much in 2022-23 on a pair with\u00a0MacKenzie Weegar, as the duo earned 58 percent of the expected goals and 61 percent of the actual goals over 453 minutes. That was better than anyone else Weegar played with that season \u2014 a list that features\u00a0Noah Hanifin,\u00a0Rasmus Andersson\u00a0and Chris Tanev.\n\n>To get the best out of them, good players need to play with other good players they can trust. Zadorov\u2019s numbers, of course, aren\u2019t going to be as strong with the Troy Stechers and Noah Juulsens of the world. Or with\u00a0Ian Cole, for that matter.\n\n>Zadorov has potential, and while the model would\u00a0hate\u00a0a deal that starts with a five, he looks like someone who really could make the most of it. The playoffs provided inspiration for that with some of the best hockey of his life, in which he had a Net Rating of plus-1.7 over 13 games, the highest among all Canucks defensemen \u2014 a 10.7 pace over a full season.\n\n>He looked like a rockstar in scoring four goals and eight points in 13 games while earning 52 percent of the expected goals and outscoring opponents 8-5. That didn\u2019t come from playing with Cole (49 percent expected goals and outscored 4-3) for 138 minutes. That came from the brief 46-minute window in which he shared the ice with one of\u00a0Quinn Hughes\u00a0or\u00a0Filip Hronek. In that stretch, the goals were 3-1 for the Canucks with 70 percent of the expected goals.\n\n>It goes against every fiber of my being to be swayed by 13 playoff games or a 46-minute sample with top-pair defensemen, but with Zadorov, it goes beyond that given his sterling micro-stat profile. If he gets a real top-four chance with a real partner, I think he takes off and doesn\u2019t look back.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5540984/2024/06/06/nhl-free-agent-defense?source=user-shared-article",
            "I like the player.  I greatly dislike the cost.  He's a 3rd pairing guy who should be making 3M not 5+.  That contact is going to be bad.  I'd rather overpay for an older Tanev",
