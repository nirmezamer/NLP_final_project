            "Cowan is a farm kid, Danford knows how to operate construction machinery\u2026 getting a bunch of rough \u2018n tumble kinda guys these days. Calling it, next pick\u2019s gonna have worked under his dad\u2019s treefelling company or some shit. He\u2019ll be a 6\u20193 defenseman that likes to hit, and he\u2019ll be the most Brad pick ever. We\u2019ll call him Treeliving.",
            "Now, given a) the wide open draft and b) Wes Clark picking lower draft position studs, this might be a moot point, but anyone in the general ballpark of our 2nd that might be of interest? Who looks good to you guys?\n\nOnly name I\u2019m vaguely familiar with is Pridham\u2019s kid.",
            "Day 1 of manifesting Montour and Roy in Toronto on July 1st. I would end the day with the largest smile in Toronto. Our transition defense would be exponentially improved.  \n\nWe\u2019d need to deal with the whole filling out the rest of the line up problem, but there are lots of options.",
            "Askarov being available is interesting. I'd go after him. Maybe this could be our \"Rask for Raycroft\" moment where we get a first round goalie in a deal for someone else and that guy becomes our star for the next decade. Especially if we're running a tandem with Woll and someone else, if we have Askarov as well here and they both split time, we can see who really shines and run with them.",
            "If we don't draft Gerald \"Squancho\" Higgins from USHL Everglades, I will be fuming. Kid is elite.",
            "\"Danforth with the crisp breakout pass to Cowan. Cowan enters the zone with speed, across the slot to Minten! Off the post - but KNIES GETS THE REBOUND! LEAFS WIN! LEAFS WIN! THE DROUGHT IS OVER! THE STANLEY CUP IS COMING HOME!\"",
            "I thought the draft day would be crazy with trades and signings and nothing happened. I don't mean the leafs, but in general.",
            "How long do rounds 2-7 take?",
            "The value that Pridham's kid brings to the organization is phenomenal even if he never plays an NHL game. Make Brandon think twice about leaving when he inevitably gets an offer from another team.",
            "No chance Pridham lasts to our 4ths, but now that we have a late 2nd, we can grab him then.  \n\nFor the 4ths.  I like Romani, he can flat out score.  Would be a solid 4th.  Nathan Villeneuve also might be a good pick, dudes really good.  But maybe he slides because of his 10 game suspension.  Luke misa too is a good shout, don\u2019t think he makes it to the 4th though."
