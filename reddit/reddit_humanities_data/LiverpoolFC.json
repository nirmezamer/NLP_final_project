            "I actually think that if we buy Gordon, someone's moving to RW instead of being sold",
            "Dont care that we have Diaz and Gakpo. I want another scouser and I want to piss off the blueshite",
            "With these Gordon news and us being interested in multiple wingers, it seems that we will sign a winger as a priority. Very interested what Slot has in mind tactics wise.",
            "So if tripper isnt fit for Sunday hell play Konsa at LB a position hes not played at all over Gomez whos actually played it a lot this season masterclass",
            "Feel like this certainly won't be the last we hear about Gordon. We probably refused their initial approach since we don't want to lose Quansah, but a suitable offer from us would presumably be considered. I'm guessing it means Diaz has one foot out the door, unless we plan on using Gordon as a RW which I certainly wouldn't be against. To me it actually feels like having a proper right winger would really help Trents game if we continue to use him inverted.",
            "The PSR hole must be big because just few weeks back Ornatein reported that they are not open to selling Gordon to us and now they have approached us for a deal.",
            "I think we still stand a fair chance for Gordon, seems Newcastle are desperate to make something happen.",
            "We are stacked at LW and dont need another but Gordon scoring against Everton and Kissing the badge in the Derby would make the deal worth it with the amount itd piss of Everton fans",
            "You have to laugh at Newcastle (allegedly) trying to get Quansah as part of a deal for Gordon. When their club is in a pickle over PSR, the idea that they could come out of it with such a promising young CB is laughable. And it would just create more (expensive) issues for us. We've already lost Matip, we need to bring in another CB, not lose someone with that level of potential."
