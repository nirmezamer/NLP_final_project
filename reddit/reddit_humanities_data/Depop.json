            "Definitely a scam. You are way too nice here lol. There's a ton of red flags here but here's how I'd handle this.\n\n\"I'm very sorry if you received your item damaged, however, according to the tracking the item has not been delivered to your address yet. Can you describe the packaging, or tell me the return address on the label so I can confirm if this is the package I sent to you?\n\nFurther, I can not process a refund until I receive the returned item. I suggest submitting a claim through Depop so they can help you with return shipping costs. If you've already bought a shipping label to return the item, please send me the tracking number. Thanks!\"\n\nSomething to that effect. Frankly, I think it's best you suggest they escalate this to Depop since that might scare a scammer away, they haven't even received the item lol. Depop will shut down the claim quickly since they rely on the tracking info\n\nIf they can't describe the packaging or tell you the return address you know it's a scam, and you can respond with:\n\n\"Sorry, since I can't confirm you've received the item, I have to rely on the package tracking information. I am very sorry but I will not be issuing a refund for this reason\"\n\nI think they are looking for a quick refund so being slow and measured in your response is best here. Don't do anything rash and DON'T refund until you get the item back.",
