I have discussed with the rest of the team the potential banning of all political-related posts and the team has agreed with my proposal.  \n\n\nSo, from now on \\*\\*all political-related posts will be removed and the OP may be permanently banned\\*\\*.\n\n\\*\\*An example of what would be removed:\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[I will smack you in the head with the ban hammer if you post this.](https://preview.redd.it/stjugxud83f91.jpg?width=538&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aad1142df8733ea9819ae643b6421bb9e6689606)\n\nI'm not against the cause, my views are not important. I just don't want the subreddit to be filled with political posts, this place is for wholesome/funny content related to our animal friends.",

Im actually considering a wildlife sort of degree in the future so  theres that. This may sound lame but I actually love following rules, as long as they are not stupid. Its more satisfying when you win a game, or make a popular post when playing by the rules. I think its equally important for people to respect and follow rules online, especially since you can say/do just about anything on here. Im always open to communication/direct messages, and I take reports very seriously (as long as they do).\n\nThank you and I hope you consider my proposal.",
