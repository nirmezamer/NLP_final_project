This may sound lame but I actually love following rules, as long as they are not stupid. It\u2019s more satisfying when you win a game, or make a popular post when playing by the rules. I think it\u2019s equally important for people to respect and follow rules online, especially since you can say/do just about anything on here. I\u2019m always open to communication/direct messages, and I take reports very seriously (as long as they do).\n\nThank you and I hope you consider my proposal.",
