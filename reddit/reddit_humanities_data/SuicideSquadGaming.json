            "Im almost max tier but gave up after it got a bit grindy. Im still playing it daily to bump my levels. From what I understand is you need to bump all the characters up to 50 each then that in turn bumps up max not sure if joker impacts those or not as ive barely gotten him to 28. Im playing on PS5 if looking for a coop name should be ClearG88. I also do incursion missions over and over again try to when they have bonus xp events that arent advertised.",
            "Kudos to you. I've managed to grind out around 130 tiers in Fear but some of the incursions are a nightmare with my poison Boomerang build. Especially Knock 'em Dead with all the brutes. Which character do you primarily use?",
            "Im Deadshot all the way! I have banes fury/wrath as my perks atm. Ivys Plants has been the hardest incursion for me so for I think im up to level 51 on incursions for episode 1 just got episode 2 incursions recently."

            "nope, still no news about offline mode. Game further development is canceled there are rumors though that wb is committing to the promised 4 seasons. Majority of the dev team already reassigned to harry potter game.",

            "I got about 20 hours maybe more out the main story haven't played any of the post game. I like comic books I like super heroes and villains and I like looter shooter games keep your expectations in check and you'll enjoy yourself",
            "15-30 hours for the base game. Who knows when you move to the ongoing content afterwords. Depends how you play tho",
            "Alr this seems good for the price I will get it",

Today's games are rushed out the door with promise after promise, and every time consumers, players get screwed over. I'm never pre-ordering another video game ever again after this mess. As an Australian I paid over $120 for this damn game as the deluxe version all the bells and so called whistles. I was hyped, I was excited finally a cool superhero video game. But nope issue after issue, nothing but bad reviews, terrible story, and writing .. unique ideas to combat, but so many other issues, and literally no real end game. So over it ",
            "Game dev team was reduced to skeleton crew and rest of the studio works on the Hogwarts Legacy/ their new game. What chances do you think are there they actually making something as substantial as new modes.\n\nLet get real, new characters and some reskined bosses are probably biggest content drops this game ever going to see.",

It's like playing as spiderman from insomniac's spiderman but in the horizon zero dawn open world with almost no buildings and reduced enemies. (Trying to come up with a good analogy and this is what I could in a short while)",
