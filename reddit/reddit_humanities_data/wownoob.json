            "I absolutely love destro, it was my first class and spec ever in WoW. But the last couple seasons have made me a Demo main. I just really enjoy the simple (to me) flow and it feels more active, and I feel a lot less like I'm waiting on a window.",
            "Id like to see the people that say its easy actually play it.. most dest warlocks have no idea how to chain",
            "IMO, the hardest part of destro is maintaining good damage output while moving and doing mechanics. Luckily warlock has good tools to help with this (demonic circle, gateway).",
            "I have both warlock and hunter and I feel like destro is a step easier than BM.",
            "When people talk about \"easiest\" they're talking about the skill-floor of the spec, rather than the skill ceiling. In essence, how effective you can be while not playing perfectly optimally. No need to get your panties in a twist because it's unsaid that there is still room to grow and show your skill expression on one of the widely accepted easiest specs...",
            "I mean when people are talking about how hard or easy a spec is to play they tend to mean skill floor - how hard it is to be decent at a spec not how hard it is to reach its full potential. Dest has optimisations that take a bit of knowledge of how it functions but when we're talking about the baseline difficulty it really isn't that hard.\n\n That's not a problem either though - there's nothing wrong with playing a spec with a lower skill floor it's just a fact that some are easier to play than others.",
            "To me it just feels like one of those specs, that if you get targeted by anything during cooldown, aka Infernal, its game over and you will never recover.\n\nLuckily on TWW its insanely fun, so couldnt care less, Warlock is an alt and the design changes i like, so much pew pew.",
            "Yep, I mean easiest to simply perform adequately",
            "How long are you targeted for? Infernal lasts quite a while and we have conflag to help with movement. \n\n Id agree that movement is not great for us but not recovering is a bit much",

            "Depends on what tips you need? For starters;Are you new as healer in general? Or specifically holy priest?",
            "I'm gonna switch to Holy Priest in TWW, mainly because that's what I used to play many years ago. I advise you to do practise runs, preferably with people you trust. Get a feel for the various spells and situations in which they are the most effective and try them out.",
            "Are you really 60 years old?",
            "Look into mouse over healing macros. Make sure you use a raid frame that is clear how much health everyone has and that it displays debuff. \n\nProbably best off to look up YouTube videos on how to set up a healing UI, mouse over macros and a holy priest guide.",
            "Holy priest here, same age as you.\n\nIt's not the easiest healer. Less passive aoe healing than druid and shaman.  If I went back I would pick those.",
            "I am kinda new to healer yes. Holy priest specifically. I need to do good otherwise my guild leader gonna kick me.",
            ">I need to do good otherwise my guild leader gonna kick me.\n\nThen you're in the wrong guild. No guild leader worth their salt would kick someone who is learning a new class.",
            "I have a command for you: `/gquit` \n\nThat usually solves the problem with guild leaders forcing you to do something you might not be good at and might not even want to",
            "I know people say that Holy is easy, but I personally dont feel that way. There are still a lot of buttons to press. Its easy in the sense that Holy is generally push button, health bar goes up.  \n\nWith many classes, I feel that they just click with some people. Even though people say holy is easier, I find disc much better. Fewer buttons! Also, the disc healing rotation is very similar to its dps rotstion. \n\nPriest is a good class to play if you want to try healing, because they have two healing specs.",
            "Ye, to second the other comments.. if your GL is going to kick people for not immediately rocking the stars while not only learning a new class, but learning a new role, then fuck them. They're not worth your time. \n\nEspecially when it is essentially off-season, nobody is really pushing or progressing anymore and most players are on break (we've been doing 10 man raids for the last few weeks now, even needing outsiders to fill and last night we even had to pug 2 DPS lol).\n\nMore on-topic; just do it and get your feet wet. I'm kind of in the same boat. I started dabbling with Mistweaver Monk personally and I've kind of become the guilds off-season main healer now, lol. Learn what spells do what, find optimal keybinds for them (make them make sense FOR YOU, nobody has 'the ideal keybind'). \n\nAlso, the most important part of being a good healer is your UI. More important than with any other class. After all, you're not looking at enemy health bars that much, but more so at your own teams raidframes. The need to be easily accessible for you to heal them, while not being in the way, but still visible. There are plenty of guides on YT for you to find what might work for you. Again, this is all trial and error. \n\nFrom there on, the best way to learn is by doing. Luckily Holy priest is a lot more reactive than a lot of other healers, and its currently very strong."

            "your rating hardly matters, you're dps. go ahead and host a key and look at how many dps sign up once you have a tank or healer",

            "You can start your own groups, and you will probably find out why people aren't accepting dps that readily, because more often than not you get some really high 2.5-3k score dpsers queueing for your key looking to farm crests. It will make it a walk in the park, and people will always chose them over people who have the appropriate ilvl, which makes it even harder to get into keys if you don't have super good gear.",
