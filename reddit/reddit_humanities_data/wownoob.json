            "NA/Alliance/Proudmoore/Veteran(put been away a while)/Discord: n0mad5\n\nI\u2019ve been looking for some to level with in Remix MoP. Over 30, but open to playing with most.  It would be nice to have someone to run dungeons and normal raids to get some alts leveled up. \nShared interests would be great, but not required.  I love music of all kinds (not much country though). Some examples: Wu Tang Clan, Pearl Jam, The Midnight. Shows: Arrested Development, Avatar: TLA and Korra, Ahsoka, Andor, Community, Stranger Things.  Outside of video games I like bball, hiking, and trying to be active.  \nUsually evenings work better after kids are in bed.  Thanks!  Good luck everyone.",

Not looking for anyone in particular but if you can teach me something about the game I'll be sure to learn it. I can play most days at mostly any hour.",

My primary servers are Blackwater Raiders (H) and Stormrage (A), but you'll find me on other servers occasionally. I've been involved in heroic raiding off and on all the way through Shadowlands and was really into PvP during the Burning Crusade and Wrath eras.\n\nLife's busier now with a full-time job and family, so my gaming hours are a bit sporadic. Most of my old friends have stopped playing over the years, so I'm hoping to connect with others who are laid-back about schedules and up for diving into any type of content. Looking forward to making some new friends to explore Azeroth with me!",

I've had a mage every expansion that never got anywhere until the one I rolled for df. But still, I kept rotating and leveling new classes.\n\nThen something weird happened. I went to the barber and changed my evoker to a female and toggled auto visage. And it just clicked. I found my main. \n\nMeanwhile, I've flirted with dk here and there but never to high level. For remix, I was messing with the character screen and female panda DK just looked awesome one handing a big 2h sword like a ninja. Then I felt powerful with the visuals and I fell in love again.\n\nWhich is weird because I've tanked end game as a monk, druid, and paladin. But druid and monk especially didn't click with me thematically and I didn't enjoy ret or holy on paladin.\n\nSo I'll main pres/dev and because I hate waiting in queue, my alt next expo is a tank that I plan to flex and pvp with too!",

Played prot warrior and holy priest for the majority of DF, thinking to continue maining holy priest, but damn hero talents for holy suck. \n\nMountain thane for prot looks cool and enjoyable, also tested prot on beta, seems fun.\n\nBut then I also like the choice for guardian druid, both hero talent options seems cool and enhance class fantasy really well I think.\n\nI\u2019m also trying to choose which dps spec to have as 4th warband member, thinking about fire mage now, just because all the casts are pretty much instant, but I dislike lack of heal and defensives mages have, especialy after playing tanks and healer.",

You can buy the latest expansion for $25, and it includes all the previous expansions.\n\n3. Your question may be confusing to me due to a language barrier, but the potential to meet many other players is there.",
            "1. It costs a ton of in-game gold to purchase a WoW token on the auction house (the subscription). As a new player, the time it would take you in game hours would be crazy long. The time you spend trying to do it, you may as well just save money in real life to purchase a monthly subscription.\n\n2. The new expansion (The War Within) is released on 26 August. You can pre-buy it now and it will give you all the previous expansions (including the current Dragonflight expansion). If you are not sure, then you can start for free and level a character from L1-20 to try the game out. Then you can decide then if you want to buy a subscription and then pre-buy War Within, which will give you access to all the expansions right away.\n\n3. There are guilds you can join, and Discord too. At the moment, it is less busy because people are waiting for the next expansion but still players around.",
            "You will not reasonably be able to pay for your sub with in game currency. Especially as a new player with no professions.\n\nIf you buy the new expansions you get all the previous ones and can level to max.\n\nIf you actually want to meet people I recommend a roleplay server. People talk more on there and are friendlier in my experience.",

            ">After how long does it become feasible for someone starting from 0 to be able to purchase game time using only in-game currency?\n\nIf you've never played WoW before, I'd say it's going to take you quite a while to get to a point where you sustain yourself with in-game gold. In order to make money, you have to invest money. And if you don't have any money to invest, you won't make enough either. Simple economics. This works pretty much the same in all MMOs where you can buy game time with in-game currency.\n\nI'd recommend paying for your subscription the old-fashioned way instead. It's less stressful in the long run.\n\n>How does the expansion issue work?\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by 'issue'.\n\n>Is it true that you know many people?\n\nAgain, I don't quite understand your question. If you're asking if it's possible to get to know people, the answer is absolutely. If you're asking if I personally know many people in the game, the answer is no.",
