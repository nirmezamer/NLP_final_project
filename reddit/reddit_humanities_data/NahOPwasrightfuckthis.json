            "What kinda argument is \"because they are anime, so it doesnt matter if they consent\" like oop missed the point of the meme. If oop can't interpret a bad meme, what makes hime think he has the authority to tell someone to cry over anime tropes and touch grass like bro your not cool.\n\n",
            "Why the fuck would I wanna spend my time looking at fake tits in anime? Not to mention half of the time the character is a child and his unrealistically proportioned and always sexualized\n\nNo fuck that shit Im good. Ill stick to my Gay Jojos characters, beating the shit out of each other with stands and Saiki Ks much more quality content",

            "if youre criticizing the logic of these animes its because you dont think the logic would apply irl so they still dont understand what consent is",
            "B-b-but they wanna be creeped on sometimes, theyre hypocrites! Bro thats called consent",
            "so wait are they saying being in a swimsuit is the same thing as consent to stare and ogle all you want?",
            "Something tells me r/memesopdidnotlike makes such posts just to get on peoples' nerves."
