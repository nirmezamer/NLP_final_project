I\u2019m not trying to be a narc, but I really don\u2019t want to be charged with a fine because someone else\u2019s smoke is filtering into my room, so I told the front desk of the problem and gave them my room number. Again, really not trying to get anyone in trouble and I doubt they can do much anyway, but the smell is INCREDIBLY strong and I\u2019m doubtful that it will dissipate, especially if they keep smoking. \n\nHas anyone dealt with this? Has anyone ever been charged because of someone else\u2019s smoking? ",

I was happy with everything; no complaints.     \n\nI just went downstairs to the lobby to check out. I asked for the invoice to please be emailed to me since I want to check out. While saying this, the phone rung and he picked up the phone.     \n\nI just stood and waited. He said for me to write down my email on a sticky note. The phone rung again and he picked it up.      \n\nI just stood there because he hadn\u2019t taken my sticky note yet. The phone call ended and he took my sticky note. Then the phone rung again and he picked it up.        \n\nHe ended on the phone, looked up at me and said, anything else? I said \u201cDid you email the invoice yet? And I want to check out\u201d.     \n\nHe said \u201cI already said 3 times that I\u2019ll email you. And you will need to check out when you\u2019re leaving\u201d. I was really stunned by him being so upset with me. I said I\u2019m leaving right now so I want to check out.     \n\nThen he got annoyed again and said \u201cI already said I checked you out\u201d     \n\nI was just confused because he didn\u2019t explicitly tell me when he emailed me, and he didn\u2019t explicitly state that he\u2019s checked me out. He kept picking up the phone (3x total) so it kept cutting off our conversation, so I wasn\u2019t able to follow along.    \n\nAlso, every time he would pick up the phone, I\u2019d take a step back from the desk & look away to give him some privacy with his call. I also didn\u2019t indicate via body language that I was annoyed or anything. So I was pretty shocked when he got so upset with me, considering I wasn\u2019t even upset ?",

I almost always though say \"excuse me\" will answer and place the person on hold and then return to the guest that's in front of me. The phone ringing is also annoying lol, OP's FDA sounded frustrated, but no reason to get snippy with a very simple request. But yeah no, OP I would say yes, this was rude.",
            "You weren\u2019t really clear. Did you pack up to check out as you were leaving?\n\nYour phrasing makes it seem like you wanted to check out and get an invoice before you vacated the room. Also seems like that\u2019s what the FDA thought also based on what you say he said. \n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for them to process the check outs when they aren\u2019t dealing with the phone and email receipts at that time. \n\nSign up for rewards programs so you automatically get receipts in the future."

            "Book direct with the hotel and they can work with you. Also don't get a prepaid room just to make it easier. Just let the FDA know at checkin that you might leave early and they can adjust it before your desired departure date.\n\nWe have tons of refinery dudes leave early because work gets finished early or they get moved to a different project.

Early outs without enough notice still generally get charged. \n\nCall the hotel you plan on staying at and ask them so you have the best information \u2014 but don\u2019t just pick the first number on Google. You wanna make sure you call the hotel itself and not some 3rd party tryna fool ya.",
            "Call the hotel before you book, & explain the situation.  They will be able to give you the best advice. \n\nCancelation policies vary A LOT depending on the property. \n\nMy guess, however, is that if you mention that your son is military (and this is an area that deals with military/ family a lot) they will be happy to help as much as they can.",

It has been a long time since I had stayed at a Comfort Inn.
