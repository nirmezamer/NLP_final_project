        "content": "I\u2019m staying at a hotel and unfortunately, the smell of weed is pouring out of the vents and my room is beyond pungent with the smell of marijuana. I\u2019m not trying to be a narc, but I really don\u2019t want to be charged with a fine because someone else\u2019s smoke is filtering into my room, so I told the front desk of the problem and gave them my room number. Again, really not trying to get anyone in trouble and I doubt they can do much anyway, but the smell is INCREDIBLY strong and I\u2019m doubtful that it will dissipate, especially if they keep smoking. \n\nHas anyone dealt with this? Has anyone ever been charged because of someone else\u2019s smoking? ",

            "Simply call the front desk and report it, and record the call. Then you won't be held responsible.",

            "Yeah, I ended up going for it. Like I don\u2019t want to be that guy, but my aversion to being that guy is trumped by my aversion to not being charged 200+ USD because someone else is smoking in a fully non smoking hotel.",
            "Don\u2019t feel bad. I\u2019m a total stoner and I never smoke in hotel rooms. Not worth the risk, in my opinion. I would have done the same thing\u2014 I wouldn\u2019t want to get blamed for that",
            "Yeah, part of why I feel bad is I WAS a stoner for many years. However, I never would have smoked in a hotel room myself. \n\nAlthough\u2026if someone had to smoke in a hotel, I do feel like it might be a bit more considerate to use a cartridge instead of a blunt\u2026",

            "Without knowing how and where you book, that\u2019s kind of impossible to answer. \n\nYour best bet would be to book direct at a pay-at-property rate and then if you have to leave early, let them know the day before you leave. Early outs without enough notice still generally get charged. \n\nCall the hotel you plan on staying at and ask them so you have the best information \u2014 but don\u2019t just pick the first number on Google. You wanna make sure you call the hotel itself and not some 3rd party tryna fool ya.",
            "You should book for the 4 that you know that you need and then book 2 one night stays with a good cancellation policy and see how things go and cancel if you need to before it goes into effect. \n\nI d never recommend relying on the hotel to issue a refund and many have policies that penalize from changing your number of days to maximize room utilization numbers.",
            "Call the hotel before you book, & explain the situation.  They will be able to give you the best advice. \n\nCancelation policies vary A LOT depending on the property. \n\nMy guess, however, is that if you mention that your son is military (and this is an area that deals with military/ family a lot) they will be happy to help as much as they can.",
            "Book direct with the hotel and they can work with you. Also don't get a prepaid room just to make it easier. Just let the FDA know at checkin that you might leave early and they can adjust it before your desired departure date.\n\nWe have tons of refinery dudes leave early because work gets finished early or they get moved to a different project. Enjoy your visit!",
            "True! Yeah this is all foreign to me and I don't have money to lose so tryna make the best decisions. Thanks for the insight"

            "Rather than compare brands, I'd look at the specific location reviews for each one, and see which has the best reviews. \n\nMost of those (if not all) are going to be independently owned, and there can be a HUGE difference between the same brand in different locations/ with different owners. \n\nI've stayed at some truly HORRIBLE Quality Inns, and some that were amazing (and the same goes for most hotels in the select service range).\n\nOne more thing-- when looking at reviews, take them with a grain of salt. (But if an issue comes up over and over, it's probably true).",
            "If you are looking in this hotel class, are there not any Holiday Inns or Holiday Inn Expresses? In my experience, they are the better and in similar price range. \n\nIf not, I have never stayed at a Red Lion, but I know that Quality Inn is definitely bad. It has been a long time since I had stayed at a Comfort Inn. I d check TripAdvisor and look at the Traveler Ranking and then focus on the bad reviews and see if it\u2019s consistent issue and if something that you can live with, ie AC was noisy or blood stains and bed bugs.",
            "That's not always going to be your best option. It really depends on the location...\n\nThe H.I. in my town is so bad that when I worked front desk at the Comfort Suites across the street, I got SO MANY walkins from folks who walked away from their room there (without a refund!) and paid again to book a room with me. \n\nBrands vary A LOT depending on location & who owns them.\n\n[Edit: and my CS NEVER had bed bugs, and always won awards for our great reviews and excellent hotel]",
            "Yes, but you have no way to know that ahead of time? Thats why I said to always check TripAdvisor or similar first and read bad reviews to see if they are consistent and intolerable in case it happens to you. I was just saying in general, that is what I have observed.",
            "You are correct. I replied elsewhere that the best option was to check the reviews for the local hotels and judge based on that."
