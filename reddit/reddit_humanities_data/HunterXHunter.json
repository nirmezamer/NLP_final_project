They seem to have rules about who they harm and to what extent. They often let people leave unscathed; Hisoka likes fair fights and the Zoldycks only kill \"professionally\". I dunno.\n\nThen there's Meruem. Although he's guilty of indiscriminate killing, matricide, infanticide, and other callous, murderous acts...His ignorance concerning morality and human nature allows me to forgive him. >!If he had survived and spent the rest of life living a life of nonviolence and good works,!<I think that would work.\n\nOut of the good guys...I hate the fashion styles of Kurapica and Leorio. Kurapica's nen abilities, although very powerful, are not appealing to me. I like Gon and Killua.",

Solid A tier book, and once they got to the Skill Road I was hooked. I'm kinda glad I finished Liveship Traders first since it basically explores >!what Verity did and the entire lore behind the Elderlings and their magic practices with memory stone to craft fake dragons. I probably would've been a bit lost if I finished Farseer first lol!<\n\nAlso now I know why Amber wears gloves in Liveship Traders.
