            "For some reason I thought Shizuku would be higher up (maybe all the cosplays) and didn't realize Machi would be the second most popular Spider (I mean, I voted for her but I probably voted for Peggy as well so my preferences don't say much).\n\nWho the heck voted for Pike lol.",

I'm kinda glad I finished Liveship Traders first since it basically explores >!what Verity did and the entire lore behind the Elderlings and their magic practices with memory stone to craft fake dragons. I probably would've been a bit lost if I finished Farseer first lol!<\n\nAlso now I know why Amber wears gloves in Liveship Traders.
