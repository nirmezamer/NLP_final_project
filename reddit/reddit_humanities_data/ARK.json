            "Tbh I'm happy it's set back and it's not that far back",
            "I'd rather it be delayed to get to TLC and updates it deserves than it comes out half assed like The Center. Abb it a fan favorite map and they better not fuck it up with them beige rocks.",
            "I mean its not that bad. Its just a little over 2 months. Id rather Aberration be of high quality and finished unlike the mess that the center was when it dropped and what it still is now. Anyone who thought it would be coming in august is a bit naive. Aint no way wildcard was gonna release a map just 2 months after center.",
            "Remember when ASE aberration was originally set for an October release and got delayed till December.  The map was supposed to be a spooky halloween treat.  Instead it launched right in to a Christmas event.  \n\nOne of my favorite Ark memories is bounding about on a bright red and green event ravager to the Christmas ark theme picking up drops.",
            "Tell me, did *ANY ONE* of you not expect this? Wildcard has never once released anything on release date. Some not even on the second or third release date",
            "Important question- are the other maps delayed?\n\nAs of this moment, I'm kind of relying on mods for maps for ASA, and can't wait for all the maps to be added again.",
            "at least were getting it",
            "Thats my birthday! I wouldnt mind a bit of Aberration Ascended as a gift from Wildcard. Hope it isnt delayed again.",
            "This is why I stopped playing. They always delay, and people always defend it by saying they would rather them delay than to have bugs. Yet they still have bugs, go figure. Ark 2 where are you? Oh wait that too has been delayed, indefinitely?",
            "Abb is coming out sept 4th? Thats hype as hell"

            "Whats the date of the article? Cuz this is how it was in OG ark",
            "Oh god that brings me back",
            "Even ignoring the fact this is clearly old advice - it's still lacking. Enabling wandering and making sure it's not following you should be two separate steps - enabling wander doesn't turn off following.",
            "How old is the article? This was how it was done in the OG days",
            "This is most likely old back in early ark you needed to have wandering on for mating thankfully they changed that lol",
            "when I first tried breeding rexes years ago I left them on wander around my base and I never saw them again",

            "If they increased the Dunkleo's metal weight reduction to like 75% I'd be more inclined to use it, but 50% is too low :(",

            "Crab and 2  Anky's for the win",
            "I just have real bad thalassophobia and try to spend as little time in the water as possible, which is a shame because I always thought the Dunkleosteus was kinda cool.",
            "If only an argy could carry a Dunk",
            "I understand the argument against the dunkleosteus weight, but you can bring a lot of them and fill their inventories. I use 6 of them with a Mosa to guard them and i can fill an industrial forge and store a lot of stone in one trip.",
            "But how do you deal with the 6 xiphactinus swarming you?",
            "Yeah Im at a point where I use dunky exclusively for metal gathering",
            "My avg stat 210 birth dunky hits 700melee and 5k weight easy, breed 3-4 of them and go to the deep deep ocean on the center. It's like an underwater aberration but with metal, obsidian and crystal.\nEdit:to clarify more. I have a pack of 6 xiphan fish following to kill literally anything and I can get 9k metal on each dunk really quickly and swim them up and back easy.\nEdit #2: I do this on ASA I can't remember if ASE center had all the metal down there.",
            "i actually use my dunkleos more then the anky. I got a base between the small mountains and there's a small lake between them. the lake apparently has ALOT of metal and crystals so I just get my dunkleos and farm that area and in less then 15 minutes I'd be swimming in metal"
