            "I'd rather it be delayed to get to TLC and updates it deserves than it comes out half assed like The Center. Abb it a fan favorite map and they better not fuck it up with them beige rocks.",
            "Ragnarok 2025?",
            "Important question- are the other maps delayed?\n\nAs of this moment, I'm kind of relying on mods for maps for ASA, and can't wait for all the maps to be added again.",
            "Tell me, did *ANY ONE* of you not expect this? Wildcard has never once released anything on release date. Some not even on the second or third release date",
            "Remember when ASE aberration was originally set for an October release and got delayed till December.  The map was supposed to be a spooky halloween treat.  Instead it launched right in to a Christmas event.  \n\nOne of my favorite Ark memories is bounding about on a bright red and green event ravager to the Christmas ark theme picking up drops.",
            "I mean it\u2019s not that bad. It\u2019s just a little over 2 months. I\u2019d rather Aberration be of high quality and finished unlike the mess that the center was when it dropped and what it still is now. Anyone who thought it would be coming in august is a bit naive. Ain\u2019t no way wildcard was gonna release a map just 2 months after center.",
            "Okay, January It is",
            "at least we\u2019re getting it",
            "This is why I stopped playing. They always delay, and people always defend it by saying they would rather them delay than to have bugs. Yet they still have bugs, go figure. Ark 2 where are you? Oh wait that too has been delayed, indefinitely?"

Gains Hydration buff & can share that with nearby allies as well as dousing them to prevent burning debuffs; has a Water stat that it can use to irrigate nearby crop plots & cooking pots. Cools riders on its back, meaning you can deal with hot environments but not so much cold ones. Unlike Pelagornis, it can swim, and is quite fast.",
            "Earth: Sand-Shark Megalodon. I know we already have the Fasilosuchus, but imagine rolling through the dunes with a pack of man-eaters at your side. They would also have the ability to drag themselves across the ground like mud-skippers. \n\nWind: Brontosaurus. Their name means \"Thunder Lizard\", so these guys would have several electric-themed powers. Yes this is just Scientifically-Accurate Raging Bolt. Shut up.\n\nWater: Rock Drake. They'd be worse at gliding and unable to camoflage. But would be able to \"glide\" underwater with 100% momentum retention and have the ability to spit large mucus bubbles. On land these would only slow the target down; albeit significantly. But in the water this would effectively be a chain bola as the target would be completely trapped. \n\nMetal: Leedsycthese. It's a lead blimp. It can fly now. May God have mercy on our souls. \n\nWood: Tusotuthis. A close relative of the Pacific Northwest Tree Octopus, this thing can use it's vine-like arms to snatch up pray as it swings through the Redwood's canopy.",

The saplings grow into sort of temporary turrets when placed and will launch thorns at enemies. Clicking the throw button without holding anything causes the karkinos to plant a healing tree underneath itself that constantly heals up to 3 nearby Friendly's by connecting them with vines. It's normal attacks send roots forward that damage enemies. And instead of jumping it roots into the ground allowing it to glide up walls and increasing its life regen but it cannot attack during this",

Either that or a prowling cat-like creature with said elemental darkness effect.  It's either gonna be a bat-like creature or a cat-like creature, or a hybrid of both; almost like a downscaled Manticore, but with a regular cat tail instead of a scorpion tail.\n\nOn the opposite end: some kind of creature that radiates light.  I'm having trouble thinking of a creature to embody this element; perhaps something like a Pegasus or Unicorn or maybe even an Alicorn.\n\nOn the Earth element: a Bison or an Auroch that seems to be made out of rock, with vines coiled around its hocks, climbing up its legs.  It has to be an animal where \"heavy\" comes to mind upon first gaze.\n\nWind element: it has to be an avian of some sort, and it needs to have the ability to both fly AND weaponize gusts of air.",
