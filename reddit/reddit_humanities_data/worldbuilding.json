        "content": "It's that time of year again!\n\nDespite the several automated and signposted notices and warnings on this issue, it is a constant source of headaches for the mod team. Particularly considering our massive growth this past year, we thought it was about time for another reminder about everyone's favorite part of posting on /r/worldbuilding..... *Context*\n\n\n-----\n\n*Context* is a requirement for almost all non-prompt posts on r/worldbuilding, so it's an important thing to understand... But what is it?\n\n**What is context?**\n\n*Context* is information that explains what your post is about, **and** how it fits into the rest of your/a worldbuilding project.\n\nIf your post is about a creature in your world, for example, that might mean telling us about the environment in which it lives, and how it overcomes its challenges. That might mean telling us about how it's been domesticated and what the creature is used for, along with how it fits into the society of the people who use it. That might mean telling us about other creatures or plants that it eats, and why that matters. All of these things give us some information about the creature **and** how it fits into your world. \n\nYour post may be about a creature, but it may be about a character, a location, an event, an object, or any number of other things. Regardless of what it's about, the basic requirement for context is the same:\n\n- Tell us about it\n- Tell us something that explains its place within your world.\n\nIn general, telling us the **Who**, **What**, **When**, **Why**, and **How** of the subject of your post is a good way to meet our requirements.\n\nThat said... Think about what you're posting and if you're actually doing these things. Telling us that Jerry killed Fred a century ago doesn't do these things, it gives us two proper nouns, a verb, and an arbitrary length of time. Telling us *who* Jerry and Fred actually are, *why* one killed the other, *how* it was done and *why* that matters (if it does), and the consequences of that action on the world almost certainly does meet these requirements.\n\nFor something like a resource, context is still a requirement and the basic idea remains the same; Tell us what we're looking at and how it's relevant to worldbuilding. \"I found this inspirational\", is not adequate context, but, \"This article talks about the history of several real-world religions, and I think that some events in their past are interesting examples of how fictional belief systems could develop, too.\" probably is.\n\nIf you're still unsure, feel free to send us a modmail about it. Send us a copy of what you'd like to post, and we can let you know if it's okay, or why it's not.\n\n\n**Why is Context Required?**\n\nContext is required for several reasons, both for your sake and ours.\n\n- Context provides some basic information to an audience, so they can understand what you're talking about and how it fits into your world. As a result, if your post interests them they can ask substantive questions instead of having to ask about basic concepts first.\n\n- If you have a question or would like input, context gives people enough information to understand your goals and vision for your world (or at least an element of it), and provide more useful feedback. \n\n- On our end, a major purpose is to establish that your post is on-topic. A picture that you've created might be very nice, but unless you can tell us what it is and how it fits into your world, it's just a picture. A character could be very important to your world, but if all you give us is their name and favourite foods then you're not giving us your worldbuilding, you're giving us your character.\n\nGenerally, we allow **15 minutes** for context to be added to a post on r/worldbuilding so you may want to write it up beforehand. In some cases-- Primarily for newer users-- We may offer reminders and additional time, but this is typically a one-time thing.\n\n-----\n\nAs always, if you've got any sort of questions or comments, feel free to leave them here!",

Like that's a real issue when I see people post AMA's about their worlds on non worldbuilding focused subs I go on, they'll just say \"AMA about my fantasy world\" with zero explanation so we kind of have to parse out the context with our questions with is tedious and annoying.",
            "I can see the importance of context, but now I'm imagining someone new to worldbuilding just getting started and showing his starting point, but now needs to provide context by explaining how it fits into his greater world that doesn't exist to fit things in yet. So I feel like someone would have to already have a somewhat built world before getting started here(unless it's a prompt).",
            "My post was taken down, but I felt as though It did meet all the requirements. How can I appeal?",
            " Otherwise, know that context does help facilitate better conversations on this subreddit, so please make sure to include it when you make non-prompt posts. Thanks again! :)\n\nContext is a really critical part of worldbuilding and can make all the difference in the level of feedback you get from the community. Making sure to provide enough of the Who, What, When, Why, and How of a post is essential if you're looking for meaningful conversations to arise from it. Plus, context can help make sure that your post is actually related to worldbuilding and on-topic for this subreddit. If you ever have any questions, don't hesitate to send us a modmail!"

Yet, the world marched on. For the first time in history, we are capable of fielding large heavier-than-air vehicles, powered by the splitting of the atom. We have lost the eerie beauty of dirigibles, replaced by the cold elegance of flying wings riding jet-streams and collapsed Er\u00e8me hurricanes.

        "content": "I had wondered about this a few times now. I'm taking inspiration for clothes and architecture from bronze, iron and medieval Eurasian cultures, some of which had stricter and some much looser rules about nudity and modesty for clothing. For example, more strict areas in recent Islamic culture are very modest to the point where in some places, (women cover their whole bodies aside from eyes)[https://vigile.quebec/uploads/article/picture/91044/e2a578b7f700f1ebc767a4d79d48dc02.jpg]. Meanwhile, the Minoans have many depictions in images and statues of women wearing dresses that expose the entire volume of their breasts including nipples. In ancient Greece and Rome, sports and exercise were at least sometimes (maybe even often) performed naked while statues showing the ideal male figure depict completely nude men sculpted meticulously in marble and likely displayed in full colour (Roman statues were coloured when they were made, but people think they were always a shiny blank white). Nude people were even depicted in ancient Greek pottery.\n\nI was considering what influences to use for different areas of my world, how much clothing they should use based on preference and the temperate to subpolar climate of the valley, and the info that fur coats and feather plumage (most sapients are mammalian carnivores and omnivores like wolves, foxes, lions, tigers, otters, polecats, leopards, bears and fewer humans with the exception of some avians) would make clothing less comfortable or even entirely unnecessary (but I still want to have *some* civilian clothing, uniforms, royal clothing and metal armour). There would surely be some cultures and individuals who wear less during certain events or by preferences, but I don't want to have everyone naked because it *could* look odd next to the grand palaces and modern machinery like cars, as well as making it harder to tell groups apart if I'm only going on regional fur colours/patterns and the features of the occasional human (not as common in the region).\n\n=================================\n\n\nFor your worlds:\n\nHow do you handle this? Where do your cultures fall on the scale of modesty (I'm assuming different standards in different cultures of the same world)?\n\nAre some standards region specific due to separation from other cultures and/or unique environmental conditions (such as a cold region wearing more than other cold regions or a tropical region where villages built around water allow people to run naked) or are standards shared across more than a few cultures?\n\nDo some perform sports, rituals and/or other activities naked or almost naked? Is there a significance to this lack of clothing or is is simply a cultural preference? \n\nIs nudity depicted either sexually, scientifically or just purely artistically in pottery, frescoes, paintings, sculptures and statues? \n\nAre there different standards for men and women (like men being able to show nipples while women couldn't in recent Western history) or do they apply to both (such as not that long ago in some Western countries, I think the USA, where even men weren't allowed to be topless at beaches). Is even some nudity allowed in public, casual settings like markets, or are they restricted to less public settings like bathhouses? \n\nAre the bathing areas separated or shared (like some onsen in Japan ancient Roman bathhouses)? Are they segregated by sex (at least some Roman bathhouses had women use them in the morning and men in the afternoon to keep them separated).\n\nIs there a specific age or stage of life when a society in your world has deemed someone old enough to view nudity? Is it something that is generally hidden from younger members or such activities and artistic depictions seen as normal viewings for families in those cultures (like having parents and kids viewing such sporting events in coliseums or seeing nude depictions on statues around the streets)? \n\nAre such depictions in art and activities more common among upper classes or lower classes? Is nudity more common in the upper or lower classes? How do attitudes about nudity differ or relate between the upper classes and lower classes? How do you think these attitudes and practices would differ in your worlds if they were historically inspired fantasy vs sci-fi?\n\nIf humans are one of multiple or don't exist among your sapient species, how do nonhuman cultures handle nudity? How do the cultures of elves, dwarves, orcs and dragons differ from those of humans in this matter (I'm not going on the assumption that each species shares a singular culture like the culture of hats trope. I'm allowing for answers where each species may have multiple cultures and positions)? If you have a completely custom made species that aren't based on typical fantasy species or animals of Earth(like mine are), how does this topic apply to your species' societies? Does their biology even allow clothes? This can also apply for alien societies whether humanoid in shape or not.\n\nHow is nudity depicted in various media of your world? What are the average attitudes towards the depictions of nudity in these media that exist in your world?\n\n=====================================\n\n\nOut of world:\n\nI don't plan on publishing any stories or hosting any D&D or other games/adventures in my world, but I do plan to eventually draw pictures of it in the future, at least for myself and maybe publishing here if I'm still using Reddit at that time. I'm just worldbuilding for fun and putting modern technology in iron age styled cities so there won't be any serious stories with deep characters.\n\nAs for you, if you do plan on making/hosting games, stories, comics, animations, pictures or whatever else for others to experience, do you plan on showing or describing any of these aspects of your worlds to others or would these remain as more hidden or even secret parts of your worlds?\n\nEdit: Apparently and unfortunately, the links don't work as I expected so I had to remove them.

            "As far as I've come up with in-universe: in the more *developed* parts of my fantasy setting, nudity is only really common in art and a few niche communities or locations (some nobles often have gatherings where they are totally nude, funnily enough).\n\nMeanwhile in the \"less-developed\" parts of the world, individuals tend to wear long clothing that reveals very little skin (depending on the species). This is not for the sake of modesty, this is more of protection against environmental factors such as insects and the elements.\n\nFor a more *defined* example (or maybe even explaination): the nation of Abaryssia kind of requires that people in public cover up. On-stage performers are somewhat exempt from this, as they are permitted to wear less clothing, but not to the point where it reveals sexual body parts (women can't be topless, and both genders still have to cover up downstairs).\n\nAnd this is all I have come up with for now.",
            "i havent delved into this in most parts of Ayia yet, but in Gaton, showing your face is considered intimate, reserved for family, or for the more extreme, sexual partners. How much of the face is covered, how tight the group you show your face to, and the surrounding clothing varies region to region and city state to city state, but generally, in public, at least half of the face will always be covered. Its very much not about being covered head to toe, but the regions bordering other cultures tend to be fully covered to adhere to neighboring modesty standards as well as their own. By the lakes and around the deserts, however, youll often see fully masked individuals topless, as that doesnt really play into their own modesty standards.\n\nThe style of covering also varies, from half face masks to veils and everything in between. \n\nRestaurants as we know them dont really exist, and are instead more akin to a very clean public bathroom, with a series of stalls/booths, separated by door or curtain, and eating in public really isnt very common. depending on who you're talking to, inviting someone for tea or a meal could mean anything from \"i appreciate you and see you as family\" to \"lets bang freaky style\". \n\nBecause of the nature of interactions in Gaton, the language is VERY precise, as facial expressions are non existent.",
            "Most of my creations are Naturists culturally. They just see nothing wrong with it and wear clothes either as protection or decoration.",
            "So my Sub-race of Humans, the Hypnir, as well as the Sun Elves, who are both nomadic people who co-exist in a Grasslands/desert region, are extremely open about their nudity... within the confines of their sweatlodges, which are not segregated by Sex, though they won't hesitate to fight in the nude, if in the rare example, they are attacked while in the sweatlodges.  **This was inspired by something similar from the Aiel, of Wheel of Time**.  \n\nHigh Elves dress pretty immodestly (by human standards) when among close friends and family, within their own family gardens.  For them its a sign of relaxation and trust, there isn't really any 'sexual' connotations with this.  When out and about in 'public' they are far more modest in dress.  \n\nThe Dragorans (High Humans) dress and act very modestly, but are very casual with forms of art, like paintings and sculptures depicting the nude bodies of men and women, and they can be found and seen pretty much anywhere.",
            "Depends on the culture. Some are more scandalized by nudity than others. There's a few that just walk around naked because they don't see the body as inherently taboo or sexual.",
            "People typically dress for their work in Krysa. The major cultural setting would be vaguely Renaissance-esque Europe. A farmer or laborer would wear simple, durable clothing, a teacher or scribe would wear an outfit with plenty of pockets for whatever supplies they needed, & a noble or religious figure would wear rather flamboyant clothing. But overall, showing skin isn't considered taboo. Public nudity is considered a nuisance & a perpetrator will be taken to a watch house & given a warning (as well as some cheap clothing, enough to get them home) & they will suffer a general loss of face in the community. \n\nThe exception is the clergy of a particular aspect of Olaru, the Mother Goddess. The followers of the Fertility  Aspect, Olaru Ambologera, wear, well; to keep it civil: very little. (They'd consider Gerudo outfit Link to be rather modest.) They typically wear just enough to avoid causing problems or for the weather, but a ceremony during a festival or holy day may have them wearing nothing but ceremonial jewelry &/or henna-esque skin dye, or nothing at all.",
            "I handle it in my culture by having everyone walk around stark naked - they're werewolves living in the Mediterranean, so clothing is out of the question...and they like showing off. It works for them, but any Human visiting is likely to be in for a shock - melons and cookies/beans and hot pockets everywhere.\n\nAs for where they fall on the modesty scale, given what I said above they fall under the 'Modesty, what's that?' section. And no segregation of sexes for anything, nor persecution of non-hetero sexualities.",
            "Inside of Krol, the Buw\u00e4r people are very open about nudity. They are covered in thick fur over most of their body and live in a rainforest, so clothing isn't typically needed, though they do wear loose wraps of animal hide over their genitals for added protection in their day to day lives along with woven leaves and vines to help camouflague them during their hunts, and are removed when inside their shelters. Most of their artwork is made using primitive stone tools, and any depictions of a person are done with full nudity. They don't really have any formalized sport, but competition often flairs when engaged in hunting, and it isn't uncommon to see challenges of who can hunt the best with the least amount of protection/camo, resulting in removing their wraps as well.\n\n>I was considering what influences to use for different areas of my world, how much clothing they should use based on preference and the temperate to subpolar climate of the valley, and the info that fur coats and feather plumage (most sapients are mammalian carnivores and omnivores like wolves, foxes, lions, tigers, otters, polecats, leopards, bears and fewer humans with the exception of some avians) would make clothing less comfortable or even entirely unnecessary (but I still want to have some civilian clothing, uniforms, royal clothing and metal armour).

If you have carnivorans that have managed to make cars, they likely also know about germ theory, and will have developed some form of clothing simply for sanitation reasons. And any species that advanced will have encountered war, and will inevitably create armour even if they're already sufficiently protected.\n\nThere's also the fact that a lot of clothes are designed purely cosmetically. The ancient Greek Olympics occasionally are depicted with contestants wearing arm bands or ribbons around their waist with specific designs or colours to signify certain ideas such as their prowess in the sport, their allegiances, ethnicities, etc, and this can easily be reproduced with more elaborate clothing that isn't born out of necessity.\n\n>(most sapients are mammalian carnivores and omnivores like wolves, foxes, , tigers, otters, polecats, leopards, bears and fewer\n\nOtters are extremely promiscuous naturally, so a society that is riddled with STDs might enforce Islamic-inspired modesty standards on their females out of necessity and then gradually or simultaneously develop religious reasons to reinforce belief in the practices. Sapient bear-like people might develop a distaste for their own scent, similar to humans, and utilize underwear with floral or earthy scent producers to help mask their musk.\n\nChanges in migration also dictate clothing choices as well. Sapient foxes might be less inclined towards nomadicism once they discover how to domesticate and breed rabbits, and lose the ability to change their coat after settling in a warmer area. Their descendants might need to relocate to a colder environment generations later and find that their lack of coat change requires them to steal the winter coats of other animals like wolves or bison or moose.\n\nLions might lose their manes through sexual selection, or just the general need to have a larger and grander mane would result in them creating headgear meant to replicate the shape of a mane, such as massive scarves or intricate headwraps. Tigers, similar to Spartans covering their bodies for government meetings, might cover their stripes with neutral coloured cloth when in the presence of other tigers as a way to show passivity and avoid starting fights.\n\nIt might also be a great contrast in your world building to have an advanced civilization that *is* constantly naked. What a way to make your empire of bald eagles stand out in any potential audience's mind by having their completely unashamed nudity juxtaposed to their grand palaces full of silk and other fineries.",
            "In my world, as a rule of thumb, take the nudity expectations for men in the real world and apply to all genders. So you wouldn't expect people to walk around in the buff, but nobody would bet an eye if thry saw a shirtless woman working the fields on a hot day, or relaxing at the beach. Of course, many women still prefer to wear something up top that provides breast support, specially while performing physically intensive activities like sports or sparring.\n\nThere are also some cultures where a higher level of nudity during daily life is commonplace, specially in hotter climates. For example, the basic attire for a wild elf from the \u00c8onean Forest, regardless of gender, consists of a loincloth and jewlery. Other cultures, however, can be far more prudish, like the people from the far continent of Nahast. They expect you to cover at least your torso and legs at all times, despite the hot tropical weather, and only show your body to intimate partners. Wearing clothes that show the midriff is a quite scandalous fashion trend among the youth in the region.",

They do this through \"soft\" actions, such as controlling long distance communication and maintaining economically critical machinery, but also \"hard\" actions such as threatening to bomb dissidents as the sole airborne power in the setting. \n\nHowever, the justification Guild uses, is that they are an impartial force of peace, that enforces order between nations, that without their oversight the kings and politicians would use the technology to wage wars between each other that could quickly escalate in a global bloodbath.\n\nThe Hypocrisy is especially highlighted by the fact that Guild officials are quite happy to be chummy with tyrants, robber barons, and colonial expositors, as long as status quo is maintained, with a rebellion of the downtrodden against an oppressive regime being just as much of a threat to international peace in the eyes of the Guild, as a opportunistic conflict between two states.",

G. banning all sea travel) to give them what they want.",
            "\"We only defended ourselves, and we abolished unfair caste systems that went against basic human rights.\"\n\nKingdom of U Minh after omnomnom'd their way to Delhi. Technically it wasn't wrong since U Minh was in a defensive position, but their \"retaliation\" included \"making the enemy incapable of posing a threat ever again\", and the best way to do so was to cannibalize (read: conquer and socially assimilate) them. On the flip side, U Minh actually abolished caste system and improved living conditions. They kept their words to conquered people. Just that the upper classes like monks and old nobles weren't happy seeing the lower castes got free education, health care and chances to get a decent job.",
            "The realists talk a big game about how the fiction beings are dangerous and need to be destroyed but really they are just bigots who hate joy and fun.",
            "The Eredre Exarchat is one of the successor states of a long gone empire (the Symbiosis). Long story short, mankind is now again divided in a serie of successor states, and the Exarchat want to unite again our specie, pretending to \"decolonize\" every part of the Orion arm (basically, kicking out the influence of non human affiliated specie in the region).\n\nIt would be really nice and all, if the country they aim to \"decolonize\" weren't fully sovereign state with independant policies that found advantages by allying with yesterday's ennemy. On a side note, these polities also developped their own culture, but the Eredre Exarchat wants to revert back to the time where mankind had one unified set of culture. As a result every conquered country sees its culture disappear in the span of a few generations, and load of \"travelling brother and sister\" (read, settlers and colonist) are installed in order to \"help\" the locals to change their mind in case they'd project to reform their past nation.\n\nThey also pretend to rule in the name of a \"central authority\", a politie that entertain the fiction of a united mankind/succession to the Symbiosis (and gave the Exarchat it's titles when they were still relevant), but in fact, are progressively absorbing their territories through a serie of illegal annexations when they get the opportunity.\n\n\"We bring order and peace\" mindset when they're in fact, the biggest troublemaker of the Orion arm.",
            "The shatravatinists were ultranationalist lisians in the late kalaani empire, they were very xenophobic, militarists, authoritarian centralists and expansionists, (they were also monarchists, though the empress and the imperial family were their political rivals) who believed the shatravatin(the \"great minister\", military leader and a noble) was a messianic figure who, by using violence against non-lisian people and making them servants, basically enslaving colonial subjetcs and expanding the empire through war, were all ways ofprotecting the future of the lisian people, who were threatened by a secret anti-lisian coallition who was scecretly  in power (even though the lisians were in power for hundreds of years and pretty much every one in power was lisian), and rebuilding their imperial glory(by eliminating all symbols conected to it, because they were also symbols of the imperial family).\n\nBy the end of the \"petal crisis\" they finally got into power and killed the entire imperial family, claiming they were not the rightful successors to the \"lady above us\"(a divine entity from the lisian religion, who they believe is also the divine form took by the first empress when she died), so they kept monarchy, without having a monarch(and killing everyone who tried to be one) for a big while.",
            "The Republic of Verune was the successor government of the Kingdom of Verune, at the end of the Free Era. This period was characterized by the shift from the idea of magic as a divine right of the nobility to the idea that it is instead inherent among humans. This led to the rise of liberal democracy and the falling out between the ruling elite and the people. \n\nThe Liberation War saw conflict between the nations who have transitioned to democratic governance and the dying breed of monarchical and authoritarian regimes. Verune was the primary power of the former. It began the rhetoric of Verune as THE ally of democracy and self-determination. Seems familiar? \n\nHaving ended in stalemate, the war set in doubts within allied countries about Verune's 'brand' of democracy. Smaller regional and civil conflicts persisted, challenging the idea of liberalism with the desire for security.\n\nAnd so Verune took action. To protect this 'brand' of democracy and maintain its vast empire of alliances, it began military campaigns to intervene and help quell these conflicts in a limited capacity. The largest of which is in a neighboring country, the Kingdom of Estacia. \n\nAnd that is how it came to be, that the Republic of Verune maintained a large active armed force even amidst relative peace with peer nations."
