        "content": "I'm a Chinese student in an international school and studying AP curriculum in SHanghai. I'm really confused which universities I can go to and how could I improve since the application cases in China seems to be so weird. I just finished G10 and going to be in G11 this September.\n\nMy GPA for G10 is 3.79 with straight A except for a C for Biology in the first semester and B- for pre-calculus (I messed up my midterm) and B for biology (I tried hard but I'm really not a STEM guy) in the second semester.  \nMy SAT is 1550 (only taken for once), and TOEFL is looking forward  to a 115+ (I haven't taken one yet).  \nFor APs I only have a 5 for Calc BC for now since I only took that, and I will be taking 8 APs including Eng Lit, Eng Lang, US Gov, Comp Gov, US His, World His, Euro His and Bio next year. I'm pretty confident to get all 5s except for AP Bio.\n\nFor ECs:\n\n1. I've learnt German for four years and have a C1. I can also speak fluent Spanish and French. I have a B2 for French.\n2. I'm the founder and the club leader for our school's MUN club and got several awards and was chair and AD for several times, I also held some conferences with other international schools; There're also several students I teach got awards in several conferences\n3. I founded the IHBB (international history bee&bowl) varsity in our school, but we have only attended one game for now and the result is not that good\n4. I cooperated with my friends to volunteerily teach other students about literature, critical thinking and public speaking skills, and we have a social media account with many articles posted on it\n5. I've also attended CTB (China Thinks Big) and the result is entering National Forum, the research program is about High Functioning Anxiety\n6. I'm currently doing John Locke under the questions of Politics and expecting for a HC. I'm not pretty sure but I'm quite confident for a shortlist.\n7. I'm in Pioneer Academics with the major of Literature for this summer and looking forward to getting an overall A in this program.\n8. I don't have too much achievement on sports, but I'm a national level  athlete for swimming in China, and I can do basically every sports you can imagine. I'm in swimming, ice hockey, and badminton varsity.\n9. I'm quite good at music. I can play piano, every brass instruments, and bass. I can also sing quite well\n\nFor school choices, I don't really have preference. My dream school is Columbia but I think it's impossible for me to get into it so it doesn't really matter. I prefer big cities but small cities are also acceptable for me. I'll also apply for LAC and UK colleges. I'll just give a try for Cambridge and I really want to LSE. I expected to major in Literature or Linguistics since I'm really a big fan of literature and languages. I'm also ok with Politics or History.\n\nI'll be really grateful if you guys can give me some advice on it. Also thanks for reading such a long resume.",
