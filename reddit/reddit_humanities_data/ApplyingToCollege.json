            "Relax. College juniors can't get internships. The idea that you would is a little silly. Just go lifeguard somewhere and have a good summer.",
            "You do not 'need to round out' your application--colleges do not expect you to do a milion things, and in fact throwing a bunch of ECs at the wall to look good is incredibly obvious to AOs and makes it difficult to see what you \\*actually care about\\* and will bring to your college class.\n\nAOs want a balanced \\*class\\* not balanced individuals--they want individuals who have a passion they've excelled in and bring something interesting to the class.\n\nI'd focus much more on taking what you're already involved in and making sure you are an active participant--are there more responsibilities you can take on? a leadership position? \n\nCome application time, it's much more important that you can show how you made a difference in the things you do--whether that's what you list on your resume or your ability to describe problems you tackled in your supplemental essays--then another line item that an AO can't make heads or tails of if you actually made a meaningful contribution.",
            "It's great to see all the diverse activities you're involved in! Since you have a startup invited to a national showcase, you could highlight this experience on your college applications as it demonstrates entrepreneurship and initiative. Additionally, consider reaching out to local businesses or organizations for short-term internships or volunteer opportunities. Even if it's late in the summer, I think there are still good chances to get something. Good luck!",
            "First off, props on the startup gig - thats awesome and is definitely gonna impress admissions. Make sure u milk that for all its worth in your essays.\n\nAs for finding more opps, its never too late to reach out. Heres what Id do:\n\n1. Hit up profs at local colleges/unis. Theyre always lookin for extra hands in the lab, even if its not a formal internship. Shoot them an email introducing urself and express ur interest in their work. Worst they can say is no.\n2. Tap into ur network. Talk to fam, friends, mentors - anyone who might have connections in fields ur interested in. U never know what doors they could open.\n3. Get creative with self-driven projects. Start a blog, build an app, conduct ur own research. Admissions loves seeing initiative and passion.\n\nGood luck and let me know if you have any questions!",
            "Please don\u2019t stress. Colleges do like to see that you are busy, active, and benefitting from some kind of growth, new experience, or challenge.  But that experience or challenge need not involve academic or pre-professional activities.  One option is to lean into and complement activities you already enjoy.  You are a soccer referee, so perhaps you could look into being an assistant coach for a youth team.  You volunteer for a local religious organization, but perhaps you\u2019d also enjoy tutoring underprivileged kids, socializing shelter pups, or teaching seniors how to engage on social media.   In terms of academics, you could sign up for a summer online class that aligns with your current interests. \n\nOr you could seek out some new experiences and interests. Get a PT job working retail, food services, or the like and demonstrate your soft skills.  Seek out a new hobby by taking classes at an indoor climbing gym, learn to play the guitar, or try improv or sketch comedy.  Join a summer sports league.  Or take an online class that you feel you might enjoy but that doesn\u2019t reflect your current academic pursuits: film studies, short story writing, or political theory and the MCU. \n\nYou have many options. Enjoy!",
