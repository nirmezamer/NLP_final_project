        "content": "We have had a pinned post for all self promotion/advertising for a while now. It got over 60 comments. It may be easy to miss some comments there, and so on.\n\nSo I am going to give monthly posts a try. You can post a comment in each monthly thread if you want. Or just comment once. It\u2019s all up to you.\n\nThe subreddit\u2019s rules regarding self promotion, direct advertising, givaways etc won\u2019t be strict here. Basically anything is allowed here. As long as it\u2019s legal, and no spamming (multiple comments can be ok, while spamming would be worse).\n\nPreferably, it should be related to candles, wax melts or accessories (such as candle warmers or candle holders) in some way.\n\nExamples of what you can share here:\n\n* Blogs, vlogs and podcasts.\n* Your website and social media accounts where you sell products.\n* Promote family and friends\u2019s business/products\n* Giveaways, contests and surveys \n\nBut it\u2019s kinda open minded/flexible at the moment. So if you want to suggest people to check out other stores and their current sales, share great resources when it comes to candle making, recommend a candle warmer or anything else, you can promote/advertise it here as well.",

I've never smelled it my girlfriend recently told me that this was and still is her favorite candle so I'm just looking for it but I can't find one anywhere anymore. It was bought from Pepco if that is helpful in anyway because I don't know if it's my country specific store or not l. So if anyone has one, has any idea where to get one or something similar please tell me I would really appreciate the information. Thank you for your time and reading this have a great day/night. ",
