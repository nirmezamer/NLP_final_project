We get about one person show interest per month at best and I just felt like maybe reposting would help us find more people.\n\nNone of us exactly like how some things are handled on this subreddit, so you can use the comment section for your complaints. I would gladly take criticism on what to improve if such criticism is provided. However, expect most of them to be ignored if you have no solution in mind, or harass others for no reason. Remember we are people with lives outside of internet so stuff like this report just upsets more than anything. We can't check thousands of posts that get posted weekly, especially when most of us don't have time to go on reddit daily.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xm8c1xxfp9xc1.png?width=244&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3902aef7d25c1b845d1c660be649f353f92cb4b\n\nIf you are interested in applying, send me a DM with the following (I'm not doing a google doc this time since everyone forgets to check it)\n\n* Your discord name (required for communication, none of us use reddit chat. It's not the greatest way to communicate)\n* Why are you interested in modding this subreddit? Where did you find this post?\n* Are there any rules that you'd change? If so, why? If not, say \"No\"\n* Which problems you aim to fix by being a mod & any suggestions on how you or we could fix them\n* What is some content you would remove from the subreddit? Ex. check the \"hot\" or \"new\" tabs and link an example. Explain why it is bad for the subreddit\n* What is some content you would like to see more on the subreddit? Link an example, maybe a favorite post of yours and explain why it fits the subreddit (if you can)\n* Do you agree with rule 9? Elaborate.\n\nIf you don't know English or are a powermod, do not apply. I think both are self explanatory for a witty text based subreddit\n\nHope everyone has a great day :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",
