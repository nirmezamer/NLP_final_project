With that in mind, if you have a question you've always wanted to ask, but weren't sure if it fitted in this sub, please post it!\n\nThis idea is currently on a trial basis, but we hope it will encourage our members to ask those questions they might not usually - as per the announcement post, sometimes the most basic of questions inspire the most interesting discussions.\n\nWhilst we encourage all users to post their inquiries during this period, please note that this is still F1Technical, and the posts must have an **F1 or Motorsports** leaning!\n\nWith that in mind, fire away!\n\nCheers\n\nB",

I understand that each tyre compound behaves very differently on the track but how different are they, really?

            "No. They're similar enough you'd never be able to tell. Though in case you didn't know there are actually  5 compounds and one weeks soft can be the next week's hard.",
            "Thanks, yep, I know they work within a range, maybe should have asked the question in terms of the difference between the very softest and the very hardest. Still, it's pretty amazing that such small increments of difference have such a big impact on the way a car behaves. Thanks again!",

The budget alone tends to police this, the only differences beyond setup you\u2019ll tend to see is one car getting upgrades first when teams can\u2019t get two sets ready in time.\n\nThe engines are about the only thing that\u2019s mandated to be the same but that\u2019s across every team using a given engine not just within one team.",

            "I think the only thing that absolutely has to be substantially the same between drivers (apart from all the standard components) is the livery design. All the other components can be different (though in practical terms the differences between cars are usually very small and driven by practical manufacturing/spares situations)",
            "Not at all. There's no need for the cars to have the same spec. For example, you can see different cars running different parts for the weekend - e.g. new spec wings, upgraded engines, etc.",
