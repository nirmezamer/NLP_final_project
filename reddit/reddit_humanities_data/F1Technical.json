With that in mind, if you have a question you've always wanted to ask, but weren't sure if it fitted in this sub, please post it!\n\nThis idea is currently on a trial basis, but we hope it will encourage our members to ask those questions they might not usually - as per the announcement post, sometimes the most basic of questions inspire the most interesting discussions.\n\nWhilst we encourage all users to post their inquiries during this period, please note that this is still F1Technical, and the posts must have an **F1 or Motorsports** leaning!\n\nWith that in mind, fire away!\n\nCheers\n\nB",

            "No. The formula is a set of parameters which constrain the design of the car. Teams can make any design they like as long as it fits with the parameters. Some parts are prescribed, i.e., wheels and tires. Some parts are highly constrained to the point they are practically identical regardless of who makes them. Other than that, the teams can go wild.\n\nEven within teams , if that's what you are referring to, the teams could run 2 totally different cars if they wanted, but that's totally impractical from a development point of view\n\nThis [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_regulations) gives a nice overview of the main rules.",

            "The different parts of the engine have different numbers of allowed units per season. The internal combustion engine, the battery, the mgu-k, mgu-h, exhaust, etc. the numbers are different, but the concept is the same. For example, you are allowed 4 internal combustion engines for the duration of the season. Max is already on his 4th. As soon as he puts in the 5th, he will take a grid penalty at the next race event. I believe it's a 10-place penalty for the first offence. However, if those engines aren't destroyed but just a little worn out, he can put back in any of the previous 3 engines with no penalty. So he has 4 legal engines he can use. Once he adds a 5th (and takes the penalty), his pool is now 5 engines to use as he pleases with no more penalties. \n\nIt's very common for teams to exceed their allowable components. They will often strategically take those penalties at tracks like spa and Monza where it's easier to pass and make up the places from the grid drop.",

So they will \u201creplace\u201dan engine if it\u2019s not performing.  If it can be repaired without touching any of the above parts, it can be reused without penalty.\n\nFrom what I can tell, Max is in his actual 4th meaning he has scrapped 3 of one of the components listed above.  I don\u2019t know though if they can use a frankenEngine meaning random parts from the old 3 or not.  I suspect no, it\u2019s a matched set and once a part grenades it\u2019s just done.\n\nI do know that engine number 3 went to Japan for inspection and the news looks hopeless for it being usable again.\n\nI suspect that Honda (or whoever) will build a \u201cfleet\u201d of engines and Max gets the best 4, then maybe Yuki, etc.  I also suspect the differences in 1st to Last just isn\u2019t that significant.",
