        "content": "I'm defining 'meta decks' as \"decks with more than a 1% share of the Modern meta on MTGGoldfish\" -- you can argue with this definition, but it's the metric I've always used to track MTGA's progress towards Modern.\n\nUntil MH3, the number of decks that met the criteria was zero. Without exception, every single deck was missing a critical or semi-critical piece. That's still true of most decks; it may be true of all the decks once the meta settles. But right now, at this very moment, there are three Modern decks that you can play on MTGA with a full un-modified 60 cards.\n\n The three decks are...\n\n  \nBoros Energy: [https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/modern-boros-energy#paper](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/modern-boros-energy#paper)\n\n  \nGrixis Death's Shadow: [https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/modern-death-s-shadow-472#paper](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/modern-death-s-shadow-472#paper)\n\n  \nMardu Midrange: [https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/modern-mardu-midrange-51beeeba-e893-4199-b962-f6e2eb76ff49#paper](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/modern-mardu-midrange-51beeeba-e893-4199-b962-f6e2eb76ff49#paper)\n\n  \nObviously each is missing one or two sideboard cards, so BO3 will still feel a bit different (though not \\*too\\* different, FWIW!), but at least for BO1, you can now be among the very first to play a Modern match on Arena!\n\n(If you want to add me and direct challenge me to a match of Modern, I'm Televangelist#71129)",

            "I just checked a bunch of MTGO Modern 5-0 decks on mtggoldfish, and it's really incredible how many decks are maybe just 1-2 cards off (and relatively replaceable at that). \n\nI'm going to take some of these into timeless and see how they do.",

            "I think you can play more modern decks right now. I'm playing Omnath Beans and it's like 99% the same as the modern deck (pre fury and beans bann obviously)\nRakdos Scam is also there, but you have to cut Reanimate. And UW control cutting Mana Drain.",
            "Somewhat unrelated : some people keep using MTGGoldfish % numbers as representative of tournament decks... but I haven't been able to find what is their algorithm and where their numbers come from. On their Metagame page they mostly advertise the results of MTGO tournaments, so that's where they take the numbers from ??  \n\nBut then, those don't seem to be representative of paper tournaments (why ??), or at least of the decks that are actually winning them : for instance they list Mono-Red Aggro as a whopping 27% of 'meta'... but then looking at this month's Dallas' tournament, there are zero Mono-Red decks in the top 16 (2 Boros Convoke in top 16, none in top 8).",

I had it about halfway finished (mostly common-ish cards) but as of the beginning of 2024 i finally had established 3 historic ranked decks that i thoroughly enjoy playing with back and forth and i didnt have anything to use on the wild cards i was accruing. \n\nSo i decided to start sorting by what i hadn\u2019t collected from this set and started crafting. \n\nBottom line is this game is freaking awesome and im really appreciative to the people who make it especially this mobile game version of it.\n\nI probably will start working on PHYREXIA all will be one here soon, but i thought i would share. \n\n\n\nPS: Why the heck do rares seem more rare than mythic? I spent the last singular month ONLY looking for and crafting rare cards. Ive been done with almost all mythics from this set for a goooood while. Rares are what i mostly didn\u2019t have.
