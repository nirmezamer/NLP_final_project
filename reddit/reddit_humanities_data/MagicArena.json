            "Honestly, I'm stumped. It seems like a bug, but this is a replacement effect with a triggered ability and an ability causing damage to be dealt from multiple sources - it's a complex scenario and it may very well be that this is the correct outcome. I consider myself to have a decent grasp of the rules, but this is weird.\n\nI would ask the /r/mtgrules sub if you don't get an answer here.",
            "It's just bugged.  The wording on Vindicator is the exact same as the wording on a shield counter, and one shield counter prevents simultaneous damage from multiple sources with one application.  The Vindicator replacement should apply one time, prevent 11 damage, and create one 11-damage trigger.\n\n122.1c ... \u201cIf damage would be dealt to this permanent, prevent that damage and remove a shield counter from it.\u201d",
            "Yeah I don't see or can think of any reason it would happen this way in the rules. \n\n(I'm also wondering why you targeted Vindicator with this but that's really beside the point.)",
            "Yeah I can't see any reason why it would trigger that way and I'm combing the rules. Each 1 damage dealt by case of the gateway express is an independent damage source, dealt by that creature, not case of the gateway express. Ie it will benefit from their lifelink/deathtouch/etc, remove a single shield counter, etc. But its also dealt simultaneously, which has some open ended questions about how it would interact with potential mechanics (if something said 'the first time a creature deals damage each turn...' or something like that). But for vindicator it should simply see 11 different instances of 1 damage each, prevent each of them, then put 11 triggers of 1 damage each to 11 targets. So I don't get it",
            "I definitely wouldn't have expected it to trigger the full damage that many times, so it feels like a bug to me, but it could just be a very counter intuitive ruling I guess \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nAlso, I'm not sure why you targeted it, because if it worked as I would expect, they would be able to ping your creatures to death and Vindicator would still survive because the damage would be prevented anyway.\n\nAnd thirdly I'm now wondering if there's any way to use Vindicator and the Case against the opponent to trigger lots of unexpected damage, but Case only targets a creature you don't control, so I'm guessing maybe not unfortunately...",
            "No offense, but why target it in the first place?",
            "[here is an older thread about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/askajudge/comments/17wuwvz/phyrexian_vindicator_with_simultaneous_damage)\n\nSeems like a bug.",
            "This is correct. The ETB is done at once, so the effect is \"11 targets hits vindicator for 11 damage\". Vindicator sees that it was hit for 11 from 11 different targets therefore gets 11 triggers of 11 damage each",

            "It's 11 sources doing 11 damage all at once. So for each source of damage it's preventing 11 damage and the opponent gets to do 11 damage to you. Damage prevention has some interesting corner cases and I think this might be one of them."

            "The benefit is that the cards you get synergize with each other, so they're a good start to building a cohesive deck.\n\nThe drawback is you don't get \"wildcard progress\": for every certain number of booster packs you open, you get a wildcard that can be redeemed for any card of a specific rarity.\n\nSo Jump In is better when you're just starting out and trying to get enough cards to build a deck, but packs are better when there's a specific deck you want to craft.",
            "It's the cheapest way to build your collection from scratch and the cheapest way to get enough cards for some decent decks with a minimum of synergy, so you can start playing in formats like standard.\n\nDoesn't give you wildcards like buying packs would, but you get a lot of cards",
            "I usually play jump in about twice per set release. But it has been quite the hassle to look up which rares you get with which pick.\n\nThe price of entry is so low (the price of one pack), but the rewards are also low. And I find the subsequent games pretty unfun.",
            "Wait jump in updates after every release?",
            "It's not a bad deal, but on the other hand store packs from the latest standard set also give you wildcard wheel progress (1 rare wildcard every 6 packs), has a small change of having a wildcard themselves, and give you gold packs (6 extra rares every 10 packs).\n\nAll this combined to the fact that Jump In also has Alchemy cards makes me recommend buying boosters from the latest standard set to grow a collection instead (right now this would mean Thunder Junction Packs). Keep in mind that commons and uncommons are basically free in the long run.\n\nHaving said all this, Jump In can be fun, so it's a good way to have fun and win cards, and it's a lot less risky than drafting (which if you are good at it's a lot better value).",
            "Edit: I was wrong.",
            "It's not bad for a new beginner, I would caution not getting too crazy with it just yet as standard is about to rotate and there may be new decks on the horizon.  Be a shame to waste your gold now on cards that are about to rotate.",
            "It's worth it to fill in cards from previous sets, but don't solely do jump in. Buying packs from the newest set gets you wild cards. \n\nI've come back to the game and am essentially starting new as my collection has largely rotated out, so I've got a lot of catching up to do. I buy packs mostly, but supplement it with a few jump ins per week.",
