            "Ironically, (in contrast the every previous generation since the beginning of time) younger generations are not going to save anyone.  This is because our demographics are now becoming inverted due to very low birth rates.  Wealthy western and Asian countries will have old populations and older generations that will always wildly outnumber younger generations.  Countries arent getting younger, they are getting older.  The kids arent saving anyone.  Unless they figure out how to grow babies in artificial wombs.",

The decisions made today will effect gen alpha and the type of place they live in the most. The old men soon to die wont live to suffer the consequences of their actions. Our future depends on the older people stepping down from running for office.",

We don't really have young \"boring\" conservatism, we have progressives and nationalists, and the odd radical Libertarian (Which is much more focussed on ancap than whatever American libertarians are smoking). There are some older generations which are conservative, but very rarely the youth, presumably because they're not seeing a state of life they particularly want to conserve and just disagree on how to change it.",
