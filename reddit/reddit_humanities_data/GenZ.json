            "There is a good argument for this. Look at Feinstein, McConnell and now Biden. They are showing signs of significant mental decline. Isn't the retirement age currently 67? Why shouldn't that apply to politicians?\n\nAlso these people are DINOSAURS \ud83e\udd95 \ud83e\udd96 !ANCIENT! Most of them are out of touch and want to hold on to power forever and ever.\n\nAlso these people have been in politics for such a long time because they accept corporate and billionaire bribes and fulfill their every wish. They are useful to the pro-corporate and billionaire lobbies as they typically receive a good rate of return on their funded politicians.\n\nWe need to reform campaign finance and remove corporate and billionaire money from elections immediately! \n\nThen we need term limits! People shouldn't hold power forever and ever. It should be a rotating door \ud83d\udeaa",

Replacing politicians at a mandatory time when they\u2019re all being plucked from the same pool won\u2019t make the changes folks think it will make. I also think that elders DO have a say in the future of our world. It\u2019s their world too.\n\nThat being said of course the issue is that they\u2019re all just predominately rich people who have not allowed anyone to succeed them. There\u2019s no reason it should be all old heads",
            "Maybe not age but mental capacity.\n\nI don\u2019t mean intelligence specifically, like your ability to understand what\u2019s going on. If you don\u2019t know where you are and what day it is, and constantly have issues remembering, nope you\u2019re out.\n\nWhat I mean is compare Regan and Bush SR at the same age. Regan shows mental decline where Bush does not."
