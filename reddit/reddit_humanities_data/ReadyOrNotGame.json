            "As a modder I get it. Itll be painful and the delay sucks, but theres a ton of benefits of switching to UE5.3 and Im excited for the possibilities. I frankly see it as an investment. They could have just as easily stayed on UE4 and released a few maps and guns if they were truly after a cash grab.\n\nVOID has actually been quite communicative with modders behind the scenes. Glad theyre not just pulling a Bethesda and pushing a release with huge breaking changes to mods.",
            "Hard to look at the state of Void/RON after all the years of work and waiting. They really shat the bed and now theyre wiping their hands clean. Probably wont buy their next game, definitely not gonna follow the development for 8 years.",
            "Cool so devs are basically outsourcing their own work to the community and will probably pay out cheaper on a bounty than if they had a contractor/staff to do it. Very trustworthy and normal.",
            "More talking, and still months and months go by with no significant update. L",
            "Still waiting for the game to be finished",
            "So they'll give us hotfixes then no major updates until another \"1.5\" before the end of the year just like what they did back in EA, so expect the cycle repeating again for the \"2.0\" update,",
            "Well, duh! It's summer already so unless you're gonna timetravel it's not gonna release during spring ",
            "Am I missing something what evidence is there for outsourcing? Im not trying to discredit Im just out of the loop.",
            "And again no word about the broken, suicidal extremist AI?..\ni want a swat 4 successor, no ground branch or Five Days in Fallujah, where everyone just always shoots unless i hit them with some non lethal first.",
            "Around when are we expected to see the port to UE5 now that its complete?"

            "For me, its awful in the same way that Ark is awful. It has the bones of a really great game, but it trips over its own shoelaces quite often. Worth playing if the premise suits you, probably not if youre on the fence.",
            "To be honest I think people dont like the difficulty of the game but whats crazy is this game is sort of how shit is in real life shit flips at unexpected moments and whether you are ready or not its here for you I think the game is amazing and love it myself",
            "The game is fantastic, its unfortunate that the people who dislike it always complain the loudest. SO glad I didnt listen to them when I bought it",
            "Game is good, AI is not.",
            "Most people think this game is fun, we complain because fixes and updates are extremely underwhelming",
            "Game doesn't feel like a swat game, but more like you are raiding terrorists. Missions are too over the top and suspects are all suicidal.",
            "The game is good, it's the AI that is terrible. Not even close to being realistic.",
            "The game is hard, but not unplayable hard. I've completed all levels in 2 player coop and managed to get B-A+ \n\nIt's refreshing to play a game that's actually a challenge",
            "Well, it has problems with optimization, I struggle with em a lot, however I still really love the game, no other game has made my heart drop like this one",
            "I genuinely believe that this is the best tactical shooter on the market. Nothing can compete with the dense atmosphere and solid shooting in this game. Not Ground Branch, Zero Hour, or the other unfinished cash grabs out there.\n\nThe game mostly suffers from issues with the AI. It can trace you accurately through doors, fire at you from the tiniest 3 pixel-sized holes, and tank through your bullets without repercussions. Luckily, all of these issues can be addressed with mods. The modding community is truly wonderful and we had plenty of fixes and bonus content even during the Early Access."

        "content": "For me it was a display of the really brutal gunfight physics. I was casually replaying the first mission and I was trying out shotgun slugs.\n\nOne of the suspects was firing at me, so I blasted his leg. He surrendered immediately and as I'm cuffing him I notice he has a nasty but clean hole in his thigh. Called in the arrest and the radio reply comes in. \n\nStarted watching some of the connected rooms and about 30 seconds later I hear the cuffed suspect say \"Shit...shit shit shit...*shit.\"*\n\nI'm confused and turn around, thinking he wasn't cuffed or something, but he crumples to the floor. His whole trouser leg has turned sickly red with blood and the team reports he has died. I didn't think they modelled arterial bleeding like that and I was both impressed and shocked.\n\nThe game does a great job of making you really feel the consequences of shooting people, I think. When you hear a guy rolling around screaming or get a situation like the above, it really exhibits that horror of that level of violence, even if it's justified in the situation.",

            "Choosing not to detain two suspects to protect my team, if I did, there was a chance of being shot from down stairs.\n\nHate dealing with situations of life or death, that moment was far above any other these terrible AI have given me."
