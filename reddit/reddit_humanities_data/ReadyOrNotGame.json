            "As a modder I get it. It\u2019ll be painful and the delay sucks, but theres a ton of benefits of switching to UE5.3 and I\u2019m excited for the possibilities. I frankly see it as an investment. They could have just as easily stayed on UE4 and released a few maps and guns if they were truly after a cash grab.\n\nVOID has actually been quite communicative with modders behind the scenes. Glad they\u2019re not just pulling a Bethesda and pushing a release with huge breaking changes to mods.",
            "My question is why they didnt just say it sooner?\n\nThey've gone radio silence in the past month, they even stopped posting Briefings for two times, and we're completely left in dark, not knowing what they're doing, can DLC be delivered on time or if they're abandoning the game. If they said \"yeah we're transitioning to UE5 it might take time be patient mate\" back in like March or April, maybe the community can have more understanding. But know it sounds like they just did these things without previous notice. Not to mention we're getting the sneak peak of DLC AFTER we've been told about the delay.\n\nThey're having serious PR problem from EA.",
            "Of course its delayed. And who would have guessed that they outsourced the service?  \nAs some of the community already suspected, it seems that the original team that worked on the game is no longer active, they have moved on to another cheaper studio...\n\nOutsourcing audio design, 3d assets and art production is okay... But outsourcing the source code? Really weird.\n\nExplain a lot about the delays, cut content, terrible performance and how the game looks nothing like the original idea\n\nEverything seems fishy... It seems like they are planning to sell the ip/studio and move on with the cash...",
            "Between all this and the fact that you guys used AI generated subtitles when the game came out for all the different languages. I mean how German is still barely understandable, and Dutch is even worse. I just... Still feel burned, so much feels incomplete, or like they got 75% through every idea and then just stopped.",
            "Hard to look at the state of Void/RON after all the years of work and waiting. They really shat the bed and now they\u2019re wiping their hands clean. Probably wont buy their next game, definitely not gonna follow the development for 8 years.",
            "Cool so devs are basically outsourcing their own work to the community and will probably pay out cheaper on a bounty than if they had a contractor/staff to do it. Very trustworthy and normal.",
            "More talking, and still months and months go by with no significant update. L",
            "Honestly, I don\u2019t know why so many people are angry at them for outsourcing porting to UE5.3. Wasn\u2019t even something I expected to happen for Ready Or Not. There are plenty of bigger studios that don\u2019t even make the switch from 4 to 5, much less smaller studios. \n\n\n\nIt makes the whole delay a bit more justified, imo, as this is a big undertaking to port the game.\n\n  \nStill, doesn\u2019t justify their radio silence on this, and it remains to be seen whether the game will be a better experience because of it. Hopefully it helps with the graphical performance woes and they implement their AI patch at the same time to fix some of the game\u2019s biggest woes.",
            "Still waiting for the game to be finished",
            "So they'll give us hotfixes then no major updates until another \"1.5\" before the end of the year just like what they did back in EA, so expect the cycle repeating again for the \"2.0\" update,"

            "A few things I\u2019ve noticed:\n1. The enemy AI is really broken like you said. Sometimes you get 180 flicked out of no where like that random goon is at the height of his CSGO career and just won majors. \n2. The devs use a lot of AI generation in pictures of suspects, etc. I think its fine personally, but a lot of people vehemently hate AI. As long as it doesn\u2019t impact my enjoyment it\u2019s fine.\n3. Not sure if others feel the same, but I struggled with visual clarity on a lot of the enemies. There are a lot of absolute bullet sponge enemies that are just wearing street clothes. I see the guy wearing a t shirt and shorts, shoot him a few times expecting to one tap him, and then he doesn\u2019t die which results in my death. \n\nOther than that, great game! The gameplay is outstanding and I\u2019ve not played many games that feel as immersive and intense as this one.",
            "People hate on it because the release was 7 steps forward and 4 steps back, it used to be much more fun before the release and had different gamemodes, only major lack was having to do all the handcuffing and evidence collecting by yourself\n      \nWhen you wait years for an update AND BALACLAVAS STILL ARENT ADDED and you get turned into a pincushion from 120 meters away by a homeless junkie with a pistol which stops you from progressing to your favorite level, it irritates people     \n        \nIt wouldnt be such a big deal if it was always like this, but the game used to be much more enjoyable before",
            "For me, its awful in the same way that Ark is awful. It has the bones of a really great game, but it trips over its own shoelaces quite often. Worth playing if the premise suits you, probably not if you\u2019re on the fence.",
            "The game is fantastic, it\u2019s unfortunate that the people who dislike it always complain the loudest. SO glad I didn\u2019t listen to them when I bought it",

            "Game is good, AI is not.",
            "The game is incredibly half-baked. \n\nIt has great gun and loadout customization and good door handling mechanics. Level design is beautiful. Lighting and player characters are nice.\n\nEverything else that makes it actually a *SWAT or shock response game* is underdeveloped severely. AI behavior and animation is atrocious. It\u2019s seriously like 2015 early access place-holder type quality. The civ behavior and animation is essentially non-existent. These are the things that make such a game feel alive and interesting\u2026 but we pretty much just get a high-poly shooting range instead of interesting scenarios that play out differently based on your approach.",
            "Most people think this game is fun, we complain because fixes and updates are extremely underwhelming",
            "The game is good, it's the AI that is terrible. Not even close to being realistic.",
            "The game is hard, but not unplayable hard. I've completed all levels in 2 player coop and managed to get B-A+ \n\nIt's refreshing to play a game that's actually a challenge"

I was casually replaying the first mission and I was trying out shotgun slugs.\n\nOne of the suspects was firing at me, so I blasted his leg. He surrendered immediately and as I'm cuffing him I notice he has a nasty but clean hole in his thigh. Called in the arrest and the radio reply comes in. \n\nStarted watching some of the connected rooms and about 30 seconds later I hear the cuffed suspect say \"Shit...shit shit shit...*shit.\"*\n\nI'm confused and turn around, thinking he wasn't cuffed or something, but he crumples to the floor. His whole trouser leg has turned sickly red with blood and the team reports he has died. I didn't think they modelled arterial bleeding like that and I was both impressed and shocked.\n\nThe game does a great job of making you really feel the consequences of shooting people, I think. When you hear a guy rolling around screaming or get a situation like the above, it really exhibits that horror of that level of violence, even if it's justified in the situation.",

Then I clear the 2nd floor of the connected building and work my way down to the first floor. \n\nI gather the evidence and then move to the back of the map to clear the tunnels. \n\nWell, I get through the tunnels, and I'm expecting a mission competition...except it never comes... \n*Shit*. \n\nSo I go back to the houses, and methodically start clearing rooms again... I let the team clear a room and I see the last suspect bolting through a window, cursing and yelling for our blood. \n\nI expect him to be comings through the front entrance, but...

Suddenly, a panicked voice announces frantically but firmly:\n\n\"Code Omega. The LSPD police headquarters is under heavy attack by the Su\u00e9nos Guerreros cartel. All officers alive are given special permission to use all resources and weapons to defend the station and its personnel, immediately. Fire on sight and respond to urgent radio communications. Military forces are on the way. Rescue personnel.

You catch a glimpse of rocket launchers, snipers, and machine guns as you hear a faint call for help and the voices of cartel members behind you: they have breached the front door. What will you do? Decide quickly or die.\n\n-- Mission info --\n\nThe cartels are retaliating after you disrupted their operations in the Rust Belt, Port Hokan, etc.\n\n-- Mission Special Parameters --\n\nEasy: The cartel has blocked the road around the precinct with burning cars and infantry. They are trying to get in, but surviving officers and police snipers are keeping them out for now. Search & Rescue while killing the lightly armed cartel members you encounter in the precinct. Your priority is to defend the interior. Most armed suspects will surrender easily, especially when outnumbered or hit by grenades or less lethal weapons.\n\nMedium: The cartel is using armored vehicles to lay siege to the precinct with heavy machine guns. Rescue a team of officers to attack the well-armed terrorists and rescue your colleagues inside the precinct. Some armed suspects will surrender, especially when outnumbered or hit by grenades and less lethal weapons.\n\nDifficult: The cartel has a helicopter and armored vehicles surrounding the precinct and many of their heavily armed elite men are already inside the precinct fighting officers. Rockets are being fired at the police station and cartel snipers are sometimes firing on anyone who comes near the windows. A few armed suspects will surrender, when outnumbered and hit by grenades and less lethal weapons.\n\n--\n\nJust a scenario that sounds fun to me, sorry for the completely wrong lore :-S I was in a hurry.
