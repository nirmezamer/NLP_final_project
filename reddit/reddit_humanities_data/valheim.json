            "**Title: Remove the Modern Fishing Rod in Valheim: Bring Back Authentic Viking Fishing!**\n\nFellow Vikings of Valheim,\n\nValheim has captured our interest with its deep Viking lore and engaging gameplay. However, one element of most survival games seems out of place in the context of ancient Nordic culture: the modern fishing rod.\n\nIn historical accuracy and thematic consistency, Valheim has set a high bar. Yet, introducing a modern fishing rod feels like a jarring departure from the authentic Viking experience we've come to love. Let's take a moment to consider how Vikings fished:\n\n# Historical Accuracy Matters\n\nVikings were masters of the seas, relying on their wits and craftsmanship to catch fish for sustenance. They used simple tools and techniques that were integral to their way of life. Spears, nets, and handlines were common fishing tools among Vikings, crafted with the materials they had at hand \u2014 wood, bone, and sinew.\n\n# Why the Modern Fishing Rod Doesn't Fit\n\nThe addition of a modern fishing rod feels out of place in a world where authenticity and immersion are paramount. Vikings did not have access to such advanced tools; instead, they relied on their resourcefulness and skills honed over generations of seafaring.\n\n# Fishing Should Be a Day 1 Skill\n\nIn Valheim, survival skills are learned from the moment you set foot in this mystical realm. Fishing, a crucial aspect of survival in any Viking setting, should be a skill that players can develop from the outset. It's a fundamental part of Viking life and should be treated as such in-game.\n\n# The Merchant Shouldn't Sell Fishing Rods\n\nOne of the core principles of Valheim is self-reliance and exploration. Having to purchase a fishing rod from the merchant undermines this principle. Vikings were self-sufficient, crafting their own tools and relying on their own abilities to thrive in harsh environments.\n\n# Drawing Inspiration from Assassin's Creed Valhalla\n\nLook no further than Assassin's Creed Valhalla for an example of how to integrate authentic Viking experiences into gaming. In that game, fishing is depicted realistically, with Vikings using spears and handlines rather than modern rods. This approach enhances immersion and keeps players connected to the Viking way of life.\n\n# How Vikings Actually Fished\n\nInstead of the modern fishing rod, Valheim should introduce authentic Viking fishing methods. Imagine crafting a fishing spear or fashioning a primitive handline from available resources. These methods not only align with historical accuracy but also add depth to the survival mechanics of the game.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, I urge the developers to reconsider the inclusion of the modern fishing rod in Valheim. Let's stay true to the Viking ethos of resourcefulness, craftsmanship, and historical accuracy. By removing the modern fishing rod and reintroducing authentic Viking fishing techniques, we can enhance the immersion and respect the rich cultural heritage that Valheim embodies.\n\nLet's keep the spirit of the Vikings alive in Valheim!\n\nSk\u00e5l!",

Take roof corners. Why can't we just get  a wedge shape on top of the diamond shapes. Or varied diamond shapes. Me and my friend just built a octagonal portal hub and it was hell trying to make a seamless good looking roof (I think I did a great job. Just need it to rain to make sure no rain gets thru) because the pieces just didn't want to line up right without meshing together in places and looking horrible. Same for the floor. Had to completely redo the floor because we had a lot of triangle shaped spots you couldn't put flooring on without it popping out yhe other side of the building.",
