            "Maybe a random question but... any bands with good vinyl stickers? I'm replacing a couple from my waterbottle and I feel like I haven't been able to find any good band stickers. It's a pain to search through*every* artist I've listened to for a specific merch, wondering if any of you happen to know off the top of your hears.",

This may be niche but thought Id ask if there were any I dont know about or overlooked.",

            "Looking for essential metalcore album recommendations  A long time thrash and heavy metal fan but have recently discovered Darkest Hour and am enjoying the sound, particularly the Deliver Us album. Can you direct me to some essential early to mid 2000s metalcore records, and explain why they are so important to the development of the genre?",
            "I want to find a band I havent heard thats like The Poison era Bullet for my Valentine, and/or Avenged Sevenfold from Waking the Fallen to Nightmare. Ive heard all the common recommendations like Trivium, Atreyu, Killswitch Engage etc. I also was recommended Imminence, Dying Wish, and Kill the Lights. I dont know if a band exists that my mind is longing for but figured Id ask. Thank you",

Especially the black queen or killer be killed.",
