It's an all in one spice rub formulation that uses a bit of Aleppo pepper and Calabrian peppers, which have a sweet heat to them that is very unique. I'd describe it as a mix between a pepper and paprika. It's got a kick! Thank you all for checking us out. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sr6ewkn9zc9d1.png?width=632&format=png&auto=webp&s=13dadc85f0926e42c817577e775ad5ad985e3737"

        "content": "You godless heathens wallow in a fetid swamp of lies.  You\u2019ve wrongly elevated this putrid excuse for instant noodles to undeserving heights, enough to where I decided to try it. What it lacked in flavor complexity it made up for with its unappetizing  industrial chemical mouthfeel. Did it have heat? Sure. That being said it was deeply unpleasant. Little did I know that was simply the first blow of this atrocity\u2019s one-two punch. About thirty minutes after I thought I had rid my life of it, this dickhead of a food-like substance decided to sour my guts to the point of cramping. The act of brutality that followed on the toilet can only be described as an exorcism. \n\nThis is not good. This is not food. You are bad people and you should feel bad about yourselves. Shame. Shame on you all. \n\nEdit: I\u2019d like to,in hindsight, apologize to r/spicy. I had no idea before writing this post how many fragile individuals lurked in these putrid waters. There is a lot of repressed sexuality and small dick energy in this godforsaken place. Nevertheless, It\u2019s alarming how people will lash out and become vile in the face of facts that attack a shitty pack of noodles they\u2019ve allowed to become a core tenet of their personality due to their utter lack of substance. May god have mercy on our souls. ",

            "Yeah this is a typical response when your heat tolerance isn't ready for it. You should try increasing your tolerance and come back to it. The flavors are both natural and complex, but if your heat tolerance matches a 3 year old child's, it's natural for you to just feel eat and taste something that isn't there. It's clear by your wittle tummy ache that you aren't quite ready, which is fine. Maybe come back after you graduate elementary school and give it another go! We all start somewhere",

It is what it is. If you want it spicier, add more stuff to it. They sell ghost pepper and carolina reaper pepper powders now."
