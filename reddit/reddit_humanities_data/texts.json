What I put in the text about the date isn\u2019t even everything that happened. She told me she was looking for something serious and was really into me then discussed trying to decide whether to marry her ex fianc\u00e9 or not several times during the date. Anyway, she ghosted and didn\u2019t contact me again until she realized she lost an instagram follower lol ",
