This picture was also sent to me and she immediately followed up with \u201cim so sorry please delete\u201d to the other guy. We got into a huge fight but ultimately I forgave and moved on due to putting my trust in our 15 year relationship, 7 of those as married.\n\nI was away for a business trip and she mentioned the same person wanted to buy something so she was going to send it with a mutual friend that stay with her while I was gone so she wasn\u2019t alone.\n\nThis sparked my uneasiness so I immediately went to see, searched his name and found these texts that happened AFTER we reconciled over the picture.\n\nPlease someone talk me down and tell me what to do.. I\u2019m so lost, angry and feel like I\u2019m about to blow up. ",

Sorry you are going through this OP.\n\nIf it was me I\u2019d send her these pics without text then block her number then leave/move out. My phone receives texts from blocked numbers but doesnt notify me. So I wouldnt read her texts let alone reply until I felt ready & had already consulted a lawyer to go through with the divorce. There is no excuse for this.",

        "content": "Strap in kids its a DOOZY. This is my mom. She and my brother (J) abused me physically, financially and mentally and emotionally for the entirety of my childhood. From being tasered for fun to full blown temper tantrums where she would stomp her feet and scream at the top of her lungs. \n\nI moved out the day I graduated high school. She signed my name on my paycheck and stole money from me while I was homeless. She would leave my dog tied up outside my job and force me to leave work to take care of it. \n\nWhen my grandparents died she ransacked their house and kept saying \u201ci bet i can sell this\u201d. I took a skirt my grandmother sewed and a sewing machine to remember her by, which I still have 6 years later. She never gave me information to their funerals. She had her Facebook friend message me to tell me my grandfather died. She would have friends stalk me on Facebook to the point where I deleted it. \n\nI gave my brother a car for free and it caused so many arguments because she wanted it. \n\nI got a good paying job and it made her mad. \n\nGuess her dog passed away and that is somehow my issue too. Her being physically assaulted is likely a lie as well. She did the same thing to all her previous boyfriends where she physically assaulted them and then called the cops on them when they tried to leave. I have never seen any of them actually hit her. \n\nAs for her and my brother not fighting, i highly doubt it. Every time I visited it was an argument or the brink of an argument where the household tension was so high you could cut it with a knife. \n\nThe last straw was her telling my nephew she hated him straight to his face. Maybe I was triggered at the time but she said that to me growing up that it really bothered me. I cut all contact. \n\nShe tries this shit every few years as a guilt trip. She\u2019s not sick (at least not physically). She had an opioid addiction and would make up illnesses to the doctor to get drugs. She lies about just about everything. \n\nI sometimes miss my brother and nephew but i cant keep in contact with them and have her out of my life as they live with her. ",
