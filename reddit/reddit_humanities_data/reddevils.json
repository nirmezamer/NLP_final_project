        "content": "Hi all,\n\nSummer Transfer Window 2024 is here!\n\nThe summer transfer window in Premier League will open on Friday, June 14, 2024 12:00 AM BST to Friday, August 30, 2024 11:00 PM BST.\n\nAs always, here is a run-down of the rules we have on r/reddevils for posting during transfer windows:\n\n**Daily Threads**\n\nThere will be a Transfer thread posted every single day, on a 23-hour timer, to get a different post-time every day. These threads are for everything transfer related, no limits on sources, line-up conversations, etc.\n\n**Individual posts**\n\nFrom now on, only posts **TIER 2 OR BETTER** are allowed to be posted in their own right. This helps us only keep credible sources on the subreddit.\n\nThe tier guide can be found here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/wiki/transfer-reliability-guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/wiki/transfer-reliability-guide)\n\nWe will make exceptions during slower days for some Tier 3 posts, and there will usually be some posts from sources not on our tier guide. We will take everything case-by-case. If you believe something to be on the sub and not a good source, please let us know.\n\n\u200b **Transfers IN**\n\n|Name|Position|From|Fee|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|\\-|\\-|\\-|\\-|\n\n**Transfers OUT**\n\n|Name|Position|To|Fee|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Rapha\u00ebl Varane|CB|\\-|Contract Expired|\n|Anthony Martial|ST|\\-|Contract Expired|\n|Brandon Williams|LB|\\-|Contract Expired|\n|Charlie McNeill |ST|\\-|Contract Expired|\n|Alvaro Fernandez|LB|Benfica|\u00a35.1m+\u00a32.6m|\n|Omari Forson|AM|Monza|Contract Expired|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks",

            "Imagine being under 25 and having played for Ajax, Juventus, Bayern Munich and potentially Manchester United",
            "de Ligt to United -> Maguire becomes available -> Dyche spits out his worms in shock and demands Everton sign him -> Branthwaite goes to other way -> Diabolically blonde CB partnership with 200% aerial duel success rate (Licha is playing right wing now because he's just fucking class and it turns out he can do that)",
            "I love the De Ligt transfer rumours. Bayern fans don\u2019t want to lose him, United fans don\u2019t want him at the club.",
            "I keep forgetting that Mason Mount is in our team. What will be the plans for him ? Sub for Bruno /mainoo?",
            "I know everyone wants a Rodri/Kroos/Carrick type line-breaking, tempo controlling DM, but the fact is these are generational players, and even teams like Liverpool and Arsenal don't have any. Arsenal had to buy a finished Jorginho and are having to replace him this summer. I think if we get Ugarte and a proper ball playing CB to partner Licha, we'll have more than a decent team. Let's just hope Collyer can come into his own as a 6 and save us from this conversation again.",
            "De Ligt. Zerkzee. Ugarde. At least another CB, if De Ligt is in addition to someone.\n\nLiking the direction for the window so far, tbh. Think we probably are after at least another one or two players too,",
            "Ugarte, De Ligt, and Zirkzee the heavy links right now. I still think we need a LB and Gutierrez or Ait-Nouri would be ~30m. \n\nAnother midfielder would be nice since we\u2019re probably losing Case, Eriksen, and Amrabat and ideally Amadou Onana or Fofana. Thuram is at Nice so no way. \n\nWe\u2019re also more than likely buying another CB (Branthwaite) but if he doesn\u2019t work out, Todibo appeal gets denied, and we make good sales maybe Guehi? \n\nFor RB targets if AWB gets sold not really sure, only one we\u2019ve been linked with is Frimpong who isn\u2019t really a RB. And then if we have leftover cash for RW I\u2019d love to get Francisco Concei\u00e7\u00e3o and he wouldn\u2019t cost a fortune either.",
            "Getting De Ligt, Ugarte and Zirkzee would be huge to get this summer. These players would fit under our age structure and be upgrades on what we have",
            "I\u2019m hesitant but excited about the prospect of De Ligt.",
            "Players who I think should go permanently for various reasons*. Agree/disagree? \n\n**Vdb**: He\u2019s nowhere near good enough to play at United \n\n**Pellistri**: Not good enough would be better for both parties if he found another team.\n\n**Casemiro**: Legs are gone, had had a season riddled with injuries. His weaknesses has been exposed by a poor midfield setup but we should get an upgrade and his wages are way too high to be a backup. The Saudis are also snooping around.\n\n**Sancho**: Speaks for itself, he\u2019s got no future at United\n\n**Eriksen**: Would be better for both parties if he left for a club where he can be a regular starter. His legs are not there anymore to keeper up for united. \n\n**Maguire/Lindel\u00f6f**: At least one of them should go depending on what replacements we are able to get, they\u2019ve got year left on their contracts and would be good to cash in on them now to not let them leave on a free. Both has arguments for which one who should be sold, Maguire is on really high wages, Lindel\u00f6f is weaker than him but also seem to be more at ease to be a backup. Could also be good for both of them to go somewhere and be a regular starter. \n\n**Greenwood**: No need to explain\n\n**Hannibal**: Don\u2019t think he\u2019s good enough to play at United, a loan would be good for him or a permanent sale to get some money.\n\n**AWB**: Contract is up next year would be good to not let him leave on a free. Must get a good enough replacement though which can be difficult considering the finances of the club. The club should also prioritise getting a new left back making it difficult getting two fullbacks in the same window.\n\n*I have not included players who are at United on loan."

            "how long until de jong articles start coming out",
            "I don\u2019t know about De Ligt man, too injury prone and I feel like his ceiling as a player has already been found. He\u2019s also quite slow as a defender which is something that gets exposed especially in modern football."
