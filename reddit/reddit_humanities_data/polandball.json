            "The new year has come once again, as 2023 has faded into the sunset and 2024 has risen to replace it with the morning's light. As is tradition, /r/Polandball has put together our greetings to the new year in the form of our annual Calendar for 2024.\n\nHowever, if you've kept track with previous calendars, you might be wondering \"wait, where are the other 11 months of the year?\" Well, to spice things up for the new year, we're opting to release the calendar month by month to keep the interest rolling along throughout the year! Be sure to tune in at the start of each month to catch what we've been working on!\n\nOver the course of the several-long-month gestation of this year's calendar, 30 artists have put their pens to paper and made some great art for this project, but of course, you'll have to wait to see some of their art.\n\n---\n\n[**You can learn more about what every panel represents here!**](https://imgur.com/gallery/EX42Oz6)\n\nOf course, the Calendar is made to be enjoyed all year:\n\n* The **sidebars of both /r/polandball and /r/PolandballCommunity** will be updated daily to display the day's panel.\n* **[Moderator /u/AndyRedditor has once again produced a widget for the Calendar that you can download and install!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-tIfW9hqi-UMaT86B3VSIPfZHNqcYkeF/view?usp=sharing)** Download the file from the link, unpack it, and follow the instructions in the README file. Note this is Windows only (sorry Mac or mobile users).\n\n---\n\nA big thanks to all the participants in this project:\n\n* /u/AndyRedditor\n* /u/Aquoteunquoteperson\n* /u/bananasAreViolet\n* /u/BioEditr\n* /u/Bkfootball\n* /u/ChiChiStar\n* /u/Diictodom\n* /u/Fine-Significance832\n* /u/jackson_games_cb\n* /u/Kimiimar0\n* /u/kolbiitr\n* /u/lemondog1132\n* /u/Lord_Asker\n* /u/Marzipanbread\n* /u/mel_bell123\n* /u/Mr___Somebody\n* /u/NagikaKomatsu\n* /u/_Newan_\n* /u/OfficialMoffe\n* /u/Ok-Army-9509\n* /u/Please-let-me\n* /u/PopeInnocentXIV\n* /u/propanolicanni\n* /u/r42623\n* /u/RZ_923\n* /u/RayDeeUx\n* /u/stopinfidel\n* /u/TheAverageSpaniard\n* /u/TheUnknownAaron\n* /u/TokioHot\n* /u/Watmaln\n* /u/woryok\n* /u/xBlueberr_y\n* /u/Yahgoh-sleep-8945\n* /u/Youmg44\n\nAnd last but not least, to our organizers:\n\n* /u/AndyRedditor\n* /u/Paraguay_Stronk\n* /u/AaronC14",

My goal was making this look like an actual comic book, and I think it turned out pretty well. I tried searching for a comic-like font (at first comic sans but ofc i'd get bonked by the mods). I found some that were nice, but in the end I just hand-lettered the entire thing :v ^(\\*by tracing text)\n\nalso [the conquest of constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Constantinople) is the thing in the comic (remind me tmr to do a detailed description)\n\nAnyway.. if the engrish is cringey let me know, and I hope this fits / and allowed for the contest!",
