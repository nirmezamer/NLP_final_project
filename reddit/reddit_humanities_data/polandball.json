Our sleep study has now reached its conclusion, and while our sample size may not have been as large as we may have initially hoped, the sheer variety in the enigmatic images drawn from what lies beneath the waking mind has more than met our fancy. Fifteen participants took part in our research, and from the rolling drumlins of the EEG waves measured from your surprisingly-not-hollow skulls, a myriad of fascinating scenes have been witnessed. Dreams of what we are, of what we yearn to be, and of things wholly foreign to the waking mind crossed our instruments, and yet of all that we measured, the most surprising finding is one solitary dream that dreams of... dreaming.\n\n#[](#nix)\n\n---\n\nWith **8.86 points**, please give a round of applause to...\n\n#[](#nix)\n\n#####[zimonitrome](/user/zimonitrome)\n\n#[](#nix)\n\n#####^with\n\n#####[Palestinception](https://redd.it/1dke3k8)\n\n---\n\nAs this is Zimo's ***twelfth*** pair of wings - an all-time record, iterating on his own commanding lead - we have had to scrounge long and hard through our well-worn Czech archives, historical records, and dictionaries to try and find a new title for this scourge upon our rankings. Eventually, we opted to give him the title of **Velkokn\u00ed\u017ee**, as well as a **pair of golden wings** for the month! Wear it proudly!\n\n* With **8.17 points**, second place goes to /u/jPaolo and their piece [Sultan of Rheum](https://redd.it/1dl40fc). They are therefore awarded with a **pair of silver wings** for the month!\n\n* Finally, with **8.00 points**, the third place goes to /u/alsoandanswer and their piece [Zmora](https://redd.it/1djx12z). They are therefore awarded with a **pair of bronze wings** for the month!\n\n* In addition, with **7.29 points**, our coveted ~~Mod's Choice~~ Participation award goes to /u/Marzipanbread and their piece [Sweden Has a Nightmare](https://redd.it/1dhwpz2).

            "Thank you thank you. Feels big winning again. I have entered contests as of late as a way to get inspiration and get myself to actually draw something for once, and maybe most importantly, to create a bigger buffer against /u/Nassau18b which is climbing dangerously close in the number of hussar wings leaderboard.\n\nAnyway I liked almost all comics this time around. Some of my favs were from /u/jPaolo /u/alsoandanswer /u/DangalfSG /u/Xnopyt16 /u/Nassau18b /u/DoodleRoar /u/yaddar",

            "Congratulations to all participants! Aside from \"A cartographers nightmare\" which could use clearer visual storytelling, all were nice jokes.\n\nEDIT: /u/alsoandanswer really impressed me with the silent comic.",
