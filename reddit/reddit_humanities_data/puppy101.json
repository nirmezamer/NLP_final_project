        "content": "The CDC has updated requirements for border crossing into the US with dogs.  You can see the following statement on their website [here](https://www.cdc.gov/importation/bringing-an-animal-into-the-united-states/dogs-entering-us-after-august-1.html).\n\nThere's been a lot of discussion on their Facebook post you can find [here](https://www.facebook.com/cdc/posts/pfbid07txHWSokgMZia31ou7nqUYw9ZvQBfz3kPwhtG7Hj97VSZaE9pyMJBfoJfmAvTfDGl).\n\nWhat does this mean:    \n- **Dog must be at least 6 months in age**  \n- **Dogs must have microchip**  \n- Dogs must have health records to include vet exam  \n- Import form submitted to CDC to include photo of dog (at least 10 days prior for dogs under age 1 year old)  \n- Current rabies vaccination\n\nWhy this is important to you:  \n\nSo the majority if our community lives in North America.  Many folks, especially if you live in the northern part of the US may opt to consider Canadian ethical breeders.  This will impact those plans given that puppies under the age of 6 months will no longer be allowed to cross the border it seems.  \n\nIf you are traveling and intend to bring your dog and will be border crossing, you will need to know this information for your passage into the US.  \n\nSome folks participate in international dog shows and sports competitions - this will impact you.  \n\nWe wanted to provide you with a megathread to discuss this new information rather than having multiple posts pop up.  Please keep discussions civil - given there are likely pros and cons to these changes.",

            "I understand this is to limit the import of sick dogs,  but sadly it\u2019s going to have a MASSIVE negative impact on rare breeds.",
            "This change is going to heavily affect many rare breeds stateside, no breeder is going to hold a puppy for 6 months. Not to mention there are large breeds that will be much too big to fly by the 6 month mark. \n\nCall your local legislator and tell them how you feel. Idk what else to do, I feel regular people are being punished for things massive adoption organizations have done-bringing large groups of sickly dogs from across the globe without proper testing/vaccinations/paperwork. \n\nThe veterinarian community is already struggling and this is going to burden them even further. I just hope this works out okay, or that some stipulations are added or something\u2026",
            "Does this include just traveling with your pet dog for a short stay in the US? All the talk referring to \u201cimport\u201d are a bit confusing.",
            "As a Canadian that travels to the US almost every week with our dog this is disappointing. I get that the CDC's mandate is not to make travel convenient for Canadians but this will certainly limit our visits and correspondingly the money we spend in the US. It will also force us to reconsider whether we want to continue owning a vacation property in the USA. Hopefully the requirements will be amended to streamline the process for frequent visitors, maybe link the dog to Nexus?",
            "This update to CDC requirements for bringing dogs into the US definitely has some implications for dog owners, especially those who may be considering getting a puppy from a Canadian breeder. It's important to stay informed and make sure you have all the necessary documents and vaccinations in place if you're planning on crossing the border with your furry friend. Let's discuss the pros and cons of these new requirements together in this megathread!",
            "Sounds like a great way to prevent non-Americans from coming, and Americans from leaving, less they leave their precious pet behind. Perhaps even lower the pet population while they're at it.",
            "https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative\nHere\u2019s a link to find and email your congressman. There are some major issues with this regulation that were not properly thought through and need to be addressed.",
            "I'd imagine that local breeders will not be able to replace the amount of imported puppies from oversees which will lead to super high prices for small breeds and to local unethical breeders that will lie to buyers about future size of the dog their buying for big money...   and of course to even more scams.",
            "The age limit is crazy and ukc and akc even agreeing to talk with the government is foolish.  The government\n\nis steamrolling this regulations because it cannot manage itself and does not know how this affects responsible\n\ndog breeders.  Your Congress is also for this, so tell them your vote is against them.  It affects rare breeds and \n\nreally responsible people",
            "From my understanding, one of the reasons on age restrictions was the number of fraudulent documents lying about the dog\u2019s age. Many being vaccinated before the recommended mark (which may be ineffective due to mother\u2019s antibodies). This was causing a lot of stress on the ports (and I don\u2019t mean stressful situations but rather stress on resources - locations to quarantine/ house dogs until decisions were made such as refusal or reexportation.)  By raising age restrictions to 6 months can\u2019t really lie due to dentition. This was majorly noticed over the pandemic due to lack of flights.\n\n*Import will always be about entering, export about leaving a location. Amount of time does matter for purposes and due to disease risk exposure may happen. I understand the notion of saying but it\u2019s a family pet, he\u2019s always by my side, well customs officer cannot confirm that on your word. Or thousands of peoples words passing a port of entry. \n\nI cross into Canada often enough, I\u2019ll need to get my dog\u2019s rabies vaccine certified by USDA for it to be considered legit. It\u2019s an extra step, and prices are clinic depended\u2026 so sure that\u2019s annoying. The idea USDA can confirm vaccinating vet is accredited as necessary, that rabies product is valid. And it stays online and can be pulled up at the border online by overseeing agency to confirm what you have on hand is valid. \n\nIt seems silly, but US had super lax import requirements for dogs compared to other countries. Remember this isn\u2019t about whether your animal is of us origin or not. This is about disease risk. One health guys, it\u2019s important. It\u2019s one of the main points of veterinary medicine."

People are dealing with tough things. People sometimes struggle more than you feel they should, and people do things you don't feel they should do. \n\nIf you can't tolerate it and it upsets you. Don't comment. Being an asshole to people who are having a bad time makes matters worse, not better. It'll put them on the defensive instead of leading them to change their action.\n\n**From here forward, being rude on these posts where support is necessary will result in a 3 day temp ban from the sub on the first offence. If you have priors of this offence, this will be expanded based on mod discretion and the severity**\n\nThose who focus on brutal honesty seem to prefer brutality over honest. We want your supportive honesty. We want your constructive honesty. We want your loving honesty. Leave the brutality at the door.\n\nWe're not going to support people who want to kick people when they're down. If you can't tolerate not doing so, this is just straight up not the sub for you. Yesterday I ended up removing over 50 comments in a single post, and it's not cool.\n\nFor those who feel strongly and want to learn how to help here's some ideas:\n\n* Provide actionable advice to help not just the puppy, but the human too. We strongly believe in building up other puppy owners. Empowering them and supporting them helps. It helps people make the best decisions for them and their puppy. It helps people do better for their puppy. It helps them feel they can get through this because they're no longer alone.\n\n* Share the tough times that you had/are having and some ideas that you've done or are trying to do. \n\n* Ask follow-up (non-judgemental) questions on something. Like, if you notice that somebody may be doing something or not doing something that may be helpful, ask them whether your thoughts are correct.\n\n* Simply acknowledge their emotions and the tough time they're having and offer your support whether you understand or not.\n\nAny questions?",

But, to give some explanation on the unhelpful comments on those posts, I certainly am saddened and frustrated to see people (in a small minority of puppy blues posts) who are considering rehoming after a short period of time, when (looking at their comment history) they\u2019ve already been informed of the level of effort required. In the US at least, it\u2019s very easy to get an adult dog who needs relatively minimal training; deciding to instead get a puppy and then rehoming that puppy when they require the level of effort others told them is deeply unfair to the dog. Even if the feelings are reasonable, posting a comment isn\u2019t helpful and this should be a helpful sub, but I definitely get the feelings",

Many pet insurers will consider this pre existing and not cover foreign body ingestion for your dog going forward. I would definitely call and ask. Others might put you on an extended waiting period. I would be very proactive about figuring out what would be covered. Good luck!",
            "Insurance is a great tool to have but please keep in mind that it works through reimbursement so you would need to have the 7k to pay the vet first and then the insurance pays you back.

They've already forgotten about it. The best thing you can do in those situations is not make a huge fuss, calmly and gently inspect them, book/go to the vet if you need to, and just be there for them. They'll eventually realise that the world is scary and can hurt, but you'll be there to fix it and make sure they're okay. Dogs are resilient but they need to know that to be confident, otherwise they can become anxious. Amplifying their stress by stressing out yourself will only make it worse for the both of you.",

They can understand that accidents can happen. If you give them love for 99,9% of the time, they will know you are a loving person.  \nI understand the feelbad, but it happens and your dog will understand you. Also, it means that you love your dog, that's always a positive thing.",
