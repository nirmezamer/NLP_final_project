            "Which cruise line?  Silversea, Cunard and the like perhaps not.  Some of the more budget type cruise lines slacks and a nice shirt would be acceptable.  I've seen polo shirts to tuxedos, no one seems to mind."

First off the Titanic incident occurred 112 years ago, a time when even SLICED BREAD wasn't invented.  Today's cruise ships on average are around 120,000 GT, while the Titanic was a measly 46,000 tons. That's over 3 times the size. Not only that, today's technology informs the ship staff of any obstacles on the open sea. If you are one of those people, please take a couple seconds of your time to inform yourself.",

I\u2019ve only been on two cruises so far, and the walking definitely helped cancel it out a little bit, and obviously I wasn\u2019t at the buffet all day every day, but I definitely was eating a lot more than normal. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if I ate more than 4000-5000 calories at least each day. Do you think it\u2019s typical to eat in abundance on a cruise or do most people maintain normal habits?",

            "Heh heh, I probably don't want to know. I feel pretty confident at least for myself that I could do 1000-2000 just in liquid form -  milkshakes, special coffees, drinks with umbrellas.. beer.",
            "I generally only eat at the buffet for breakfast or lunch. Then dinner in the main dining room. After a few days I get a little 'fooded out' and I might just order a couple of appetizers for dinner. I also think eating in the MDR keeps portion sizes smaller than a heaping buffet plate.\n\nFor sure I am eating many more desserts than would be normal in a given week.",
            "I like trying out all of the drinks using my drinks package.  Most of them are so incredibly sweet, even drinks that arent supposed to be sweet.  When I sail solo I dont eat breakfast (I dont eat breakfast at home) but when Im with my sister she loves going to the MDR for breakfast and I usually give in.  I dont really go crazy at meals, have never ordered more than one entree, but the drinks package is what gets me.  Im usually around 7-8 pounds up on the scale when I get home but within 2 days 2-3 of those are already gone - drinks package bloat.  Then I try to watch myself more closely until I get rid of the rest of the weight.\n\nI try not to take the elevator at all except when disembarking.  Its too hard to manage a suitcase on the stairs.  I got over 20,000 steps one day on my last cruise.  I love walking around the ship!",
            "Take a look around on the ship. All those people eat MORE on board.",
            "We use to go bananas on sailings, but then realized we can indulge but nothing crazy like we did before. That said hmm maybe 2k and we get very serious months before so we dont have to feel as guilty about 10 +/- of damage to undo coming back",
            "It's not like I'm cruising all time. Cruise in March went from 180 to 193. Haven't weighed myself after the cruise I just got off. I'm assuming a disaster around 200. Next cruise is Summer 2025. So I have 1 year to lose about 30 pounds. I enjoyed it, but now I'll pay the price.",
            "I get picky at the buffet and only choose what I know I want. Can't honestly guess a calorie count, but enough to sustain me lazing by pool or walking around the ship.",
            "Average for people not on a cruise is already around 2500-3000. I'd bet it's at least double that for cruisers. Probably 2500 per meal based on what I've seen for some of the people at the buffet"
