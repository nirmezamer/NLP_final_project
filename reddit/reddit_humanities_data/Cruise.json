First off the Titanic incident occurred 112 years ago, a time when even SLICED BREAD wasn't invented.  Today's cruise ships on average are around 120,000 GT, while the Titanic was a measly 46,000 tons. That's over 3 times the size. Not only that, today's technology informs the ship staff of any obstacles on the open sea. If you are one of those people, please take a couple seconds of your time to inform yourself.",

Then they go on a shore trip ( oh can\u2019t miss that cost me $200) and then the open cough and infect 50 people on a bus and within two days 90% of the ship is coughing.

I\u2019ve only been on two cruises so far, and the walking definitely helped cancel it out a little bit, and obviously I wasn\u2019t at the buffet all day every day, but I definitely was eating a lot more than normal. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if I ate more than 4000-5000 calories at least each day. Do you think it\u2019s typical to eat in abundance on a cruise or do most people maintain normal habits?",

            "I generally only eat at the buffet for breakfast or lunch. Then dinner in the main dining room. After a few days I get a little 'fooded out' and I might just order a couple of appetizers for dinner. I also think eating in the MDR keeps portion sizes smaller than a heaping buffet plate.\n\nFor sure I am eating many more desserts than would be normal in a given week.",
            "It's not like I'm cruising all time. Cruise in March went from 180 to 193. Haven't weighed myself after the cruise I just got off. I'm assuming a disaster around 200. Next cruise is Summer 2025. So I have 1 year to lose about 30 pounds. I enjoyed it, but now I'll pay the price.",

            "I get picky at the buffet and only choose what I know I want. Can't honestly guess a calorie count, but enough to sustain me lazing by pool or walking around the ship.",
            "I like trying out all of the drinks using my drinks package.  Most of them are so incredibly sweet, even drinks that aren\u2019t supposed to be sweet.  When I sail solo I don\u2019t eat breakfast (I don\u2019t eat breakfast at home) but when I\u2019m with my sister she loves going to the MDR for breakfast and I usually give in.  I don\u2019t really go crazy at meals, have never ordered more than one entree, but the drinks package is what gets me.  I\u2019m usually around 7-8 pounds up on the scale when I get home but within 2 days 2-3 of those are already gone - drinks package bloat.  Then I try to watch myself more closely until I get rid of the rest of the weight.\n\nI try not to take the elevator at all except when disembarking.  It\u2019s too hard to manage a suitcase on the stairs.  I got over 20,000 steps one day on my last cruise.  I love walking around the ship!"

They actually alternated this exact offer for months at a time.  I unsubscribed from their emails, but I imagine they are still running these very special, limited time offers.",

But the prices are always the normal price.  He won't sale Disney because they don't have \"sales\"  the cost doesn't matter to him.  He just wants a deal.\n\nLots of people are stupid like that.  It's why JcPenny almost went out of business when they tried to do honest pricing.  No one wanted to spend $10 for socks.  They wanted $100 socks that were 90% off.",

Doesn't matter what the so called deal is. I just wanna know the initial all in price. Obviously excursions, drinks, ect. will be TBD.",

            "Some blame probably goes to NCL, with their \"Free at Sea\" promotions in 2014. Not saying that they didn't have sales running most of the time, but that cranked up the everyday discount to 70%+, and the other lines have to various extents have followed suit. \n\nThe issue isn't that they don't have sales, they mess with the actual price all the time (and in both directions), they just don't really highlight it.",

One week it's 35% off all cruises (after the price was raised 35%), next week it's 70% off the second passenger, which is exactly the same.  There's no telling what the real price is until you do a booking, Just go through the booking process until you get the price.  Remember to do it in private mode or you'll get unending emails telling you to finish your booking.",
