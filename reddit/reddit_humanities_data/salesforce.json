In the same vein, you get [Permset-  and Permset Group- Permission Summaries](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_permissions_perm_set_summary.htm&release=250&type=5), and you can also see [where a Group is used](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_permissions_group_summary.htm&release=250&type=5). A new help page [groups all the User Access docs together](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.users_manage_access.htm&type=5).\n* User Access Policies [are now GA](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_permissions_uap_ga.htm&release=250&type=5) with a limit of 200 active UAP per Org, and you can control their [order of execution](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_permissions_uap_order.htm&release=250&type=5) which you couldn't before. \n* Freezing Users does not [require you to be able to create them and edit them](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_permissions_manage_users.htm&release=250&type=5) anymore which is great for deputy admins\n* [Search Manager](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_search_manager_parent.htm&release=250&type=5) allows you to change [security](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_search_manager_security.htm&release=250&type=5), sorting, [etc](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_objects_to_always_search.htm&release=250&type=5) for search for your users.

[Not a fan of this but eh](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b8ac8518af1ec2f850661712c76042d6-pjlq).\n* Those new [\"intelligence\"](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.account_intelligence_view.htm&language=en_US&type=5) views from last release now support [standard and custom actions](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_sales_intelligence_views_more_actions.htm&release=250&type=5)\n* External Apps, the \"Connected App v2\", now have [a frontend](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_security_eca.htm&release=250&type=5) to create them and support [more oAuth flows](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_security_eca_oauth.htm&release=250&type=5).

You'de think it's the same old \"based on the agent's status\" crap we've had for years, but no, it's _per work item [status](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_omnichannel_status_based_capacity.htm&release=250&type=5)_. The example they give is exactly why it's awesome: \"If a session is inactive and the customer sends a new message, the agent who was handling it receives the message and continues helping the customer\".\n* Messaging for in-app and Web now [allows you to do your full-custom UI](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_messaging_custom_client.htm&release=250&type=5) in your website or app on top of their API. There's also [quite](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_messaging_form_expire.htm&release=250&type=5) a few [releases](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_messaging_component_parent.htm&release=250&type=5) about [messaging components](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.messaging_component_formats.htm&type=5) which use a [builder](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.messaging_components_builder.htm&type=5) to build custom [forms](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_form_format.htm&release=250&type=5), data exposition or input in Messaging. I hadn't noticed that in past releases but it looks sweet. On the Agent side there's [filtered Transfer options](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_agent_transfer.htm&release=250&type=5) and [refresh after disconnect](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_refresh_conversations.htm&release=250&type=5)\n* Unified Knowledge [allows you to import articles from other systems like JIRA or Sharepoint](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_knowledge_unified_knowledge.htm&release=250&type=5), unsure why it's not just listed as a data import tool or something.\n\n**FLOWS**\n\n* Action Button [allows you to call an Autolaunched Flow from a Screen](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_automate_flow_buider_action_button_screen_component.htm&release=250&type=5) and use returns from that Flow.\n* Address fields can now [be required](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_automate_flow_builder_require_address_screen_component.htm&release=250&type=5) and [be autofilled via search](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_automate_flow_builder_search_field_address_screen_component.htm&release=250&type=5), and also store [ISO Codes for State and Country](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_automate_flow_builder_state_country_codes_address_screen_components.htm&release=250&type=5) which is all great but [feels like it should have always been the case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fndeDfaWCg).\n* Reactivity got brought to [Collection Choices](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_automate_flow_builder_reactive_collection_choice_sets.htm&release=250&type=5)\n* [ISBLANK and ISEMPTY](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_automate_flow_builder_isblank_isempty.htm&release=250&type=5) operators lessen the amount of workarounds needed to check the state of a string or collection.\n* Creating Records now [allows you to check for duplicates](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_automate_flow_builder_check_for_duplicate_records_with_the_updated_create_records_element.htm&release=250&type=5) using a Flow-specific engine that is not the Duplicate Rules and allows merging... If it's bad practice when I rebuild standard in a client Org, why can Salesforce rebuild its own standard in its own application ?\n* The [Automation Lightning App](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_automate_flow_builder_automation_lightning_app.htm&release=250&type=5) looks like a non-setup way to allow users to see, [group](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_automate_flow_categories_and_subcategories_that_you_define.htm&release=250&type=5) and maybe edit Flows. Can be nice for delegated Admins I guess.\n* Record (Un)Locks [now can be controlled via Flow](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?language=en_US&id=release-notes.rn_automate_flow_extend_lock_record_action.htm&release=250&type=5) which is VERY powerful because no previous automation tool could do it :)\n* [Unlimited Flow Interviews](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_automate_flow_remove_paused_interview_limit.htm&release=250&type=5) are probably only useful for huge clients as most the time you should optimize to avoid undue waits anyway. Yes, you should optimize to avoid undue load. [Jankforce](https://imgur.com/nyQqB96) isn't best practice even if it works. \n* You can FINALLY [stop building your own case threading formula](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_automate_flow_actions_email_threading.htm&release=250&type=5) and just tell Flow to [add the threading token](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_threading_flows.htm&release=250&type=5) for you. The best part is [the threading token isn't just for Cases anymore but for any Activity-Enabled Object](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_threadingtokens_platform.htm&release=250&type=5). Understated feature of this release IMO.\n* You need to [review your Flow permissions](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_automate_flow_release_update_restrict_user_access.htm&release=250&type=5) so it'll continue working after Winter 25. [Security is becoming something Flow cares very much about](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?language=en_US&id=sf.flow_distribute_context_data_safety_system_context.htm&type=5), [even for URLs](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_automate_flow_release_update_enable_secure_redirection_for_flow.htm&release=250&type=5)\n\n**DATA CONSOLIDATION AND VISUALISATION**\n\n* Data Cloud continues to try to be a useful platform. While [some updates](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_data_cloud_reports_matrixformat.htm&release=250&type=5) [are just](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_data_cloud_reports_increasedexportlimit.htm&release=250&type=5) [\"why wasn't it that way before anyway\"](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_data_cloud_reports_unifiedlinkobject_dmo.htm&release=250&type=5), others are [pretty impressive](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_data_cloud_reports_unstructured_dmo.htm&release=250&type=5) and seem to be [thought out for Service most of all](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_dc_reports_formula_generation.htm&release=250&type=5). Tons of the [major notes](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_c360_truth.htm&release=250&type=5) are mostly around \"[we're building what most other data lakes already have](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/aXAAAOSw9GhYcmp8/s-l1600.jpg)\". I still don't think I'd buy it outright on most clients, it'll be nice in a year as per usual with Salesforce I guess. If you read [this page](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_cdp_2024_summer_ai_navigation_es.htm&release=250&type=5) and you're wondering about classification vs regression [read this](https://machinelearningmastery.com/classification-versus-regression-in-machine-learning/). There's something called [unified messaging](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_mktg_um.htm&release=250&type=5) that looks to be interesting for Marketing Cloud users that [leverage Whatsapp](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_messaging_migrate_unified.htm&release=250&type=5) ([it's critical if you are](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_messaging_goodbye.htm&release=250&type=5)), and [Marketing Cloud Growth](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_marketing.htm&language=en_US&release=250&type=5) looks like it'll already soon be a good replacement for Pardot or whatever name it is now.\n*  Something called [Intelligent Analytics](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_bi_intelligent_apps.htm&language=en_US&release=250&type=5) seems to be preconfigured Data Cloud and Normal Reports for Service, Field Service, and Commerce (?) but licenses seem to vary for each product.\n\n\n**DEVELOPMENT**\n\nWith most of the articles being factual, exhaustive, example-full and linking to proper documentation both in reference and in help pages, the Development subsection gets a special award for being lovely release notes that were actually interesting.\n\n\n* [LWC API v61](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_lwc_versioning.htm&release=250&type=5) brings [FACE](https://web.dev/articles/more-capable-form-controls) compatibility for programmatic form control, and force only connected components to use `connectedCallback()` and `disconnectedCallback()`, which also dispatch errors globally now.\n* You can now [Update using an External Id in REST](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_api_new_updateonly_param.htm&release=250&type=5) using `update`\n* [Dynamic Formulas in APEX](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_apex_formulaLimits.htm&release=250&type=5) were first available [last release](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_apex_formulaeval.htm&release=248&type=5) (but as a pilot only so we didn't cover them). Yes, that does mean you can evaluate formulas without DML, and technically can invent create them on-th-fly without an actual field, and yes it's awesome.\n* Apex now was [Cursors](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_apex_ApexCursors.htm&release=250&type=5) which are an alternative to Batches wherein you control which subset of that data you are referencing. [There are new limits tied to this](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.250.0.salesforce_app_limits_cheatsheet.meta/salesforce_app_limits_cheatsheet/salesforce_app_limits_platform_apicursors.htm)\n* You could already [use Third-Party Web Components in LWC](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_lwc_custom_element_mode.htm&release=250&type=5) but now you can do that while exposing `shadowRoot` which makes 90% of use cases NOT bug out instantly. This feature allows you to provide custom-branded styling Web Components by uploading them as a `staticresource`.
