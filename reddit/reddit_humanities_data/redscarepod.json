        "content": "Hello...... firstly sorry for the delay - I'm a lover, fighter, worker, mensch... things get in the way... things reached for among the stars and things grasped from in the gutter... but it's here now.\n\nRegarding the lists, the letterboxd and Spotify general recs lists are there and ready. The niche recs letterboxd list is there... but I decided to add all recs and then cut it down (stupid) and so some laughably un-niche films have slipped through which I will come back to when I have more time and cull. The niche Spotify list is barebones and effectively a placeholder, but I will eventually add them all on... let's say before Christmas. So, like or bookmark or whatever you want if you're interested, they will in the end be what they should be.\n\nI lifted the bar for the niche films from 10k to 20k, and the niche Spotify list from 10k to 30k. I think 10k was fair with movies but wanted people to get more of their faves in, but on music yeah I was wildly out, I listen to a lot of continental stuff from the 80s that never did anything at the time let alone now, 10k seemed generous but obviously wasn't.\n\n[Letterboxd general recs](https://boxd.it/pWHNs)\n\n[Letterboxd 'niche' recs](https://boxd.it/qbYxQ) (anything over 20k will be removed in the next few weeks)\n\n(shoutout to the users who recced 'Trans-Europ-Express', 'The Night of Counting Years', 'The Chess Players', and 'Belle de Jour or Freddy got Fingered')\n\n[Spotify general recs](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/01RezE1n2fRVGjPFM5p080?si=1a422548447a4719)\n\n[Spotify 'niche' recs](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7ql9jY39SiDTR9DH4S3Cmy?si=c5d147c1891e463d) (literally at this point a placeholder, come back in a month lol)\n\nBook recs and 'last messages to the sub' I was looking to put into a pastebin but as it's gone 'woke' it no longer allows slurs to be posted, which of course, being the sub, people peppered their replies with... so I went with this ControlC\n\n[Au Revoir, r/rsp](https://controlc.com/d19e6f07)\n\n[r/rsp 2023 Lit Recs](https://controlc.com/2caa6710)\n\nThere are a few glaring omissions when it comes to questions, but then there is every year.
