        "content": "Hello...... firstly sorry for the delay - I'm a lover, fighter, worker, mensch... things get in the way... things reached for among the stars and things grasped from in the gutter... but it's here now.\n\nRegarding the lists, the letterboxd and Spotify general recs lists are there and ready. The niche recs letterboxd list is there... but I decided to add all recs and then cut it down (stupid) and so some laughably un-niche films have slipped through which I will come back to when I have more time and cull. The niche Spotify list is barebones and effectively a placeholder, but I will eventually add them all on... let's say before Christmas. So, like or bookmark or whatever you want if you're interested, they will in the end be what they should be.\n\nI lifted the bar for the niche films from 10k to 20k, and the niche Spotify list from 10k to 30k. I think 10k was fair with movies but wanted people to get more of their faves in, but on music yeah I was wildly out, I listen to a lot of continental stuff from the 80s that never did anything at the time let alone now, 10k seemed generous but obviously wasn't.\n\n[Letterboxd general recs](https://boxd.it/pWHNs)\n\n[Letterboxd 'niche' recs](https://boxd.it/qbYxQ) (anything over 20k will be removed in the next few weeks)\n\n(shoutout to the users who recced 'Trans-Europ-Express', 'The Night of Counting Years', 'The Chess Players', and 'Belle de Jour or Freddy got Fingered')\n\n[Spotify general recs](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/01RezE1n2fRVGjPFM5p080?si=1a422548447a4719)\n\n[Spotify 'niche' recs](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7ql9jY39SiDTR9DH4S3Cmy?si=c5d147c1891e463d) (literally at this point a placeholder, come back in a month lol)\n\nBook recs and 'last messages to the sub' I was looking to put into a pastebin but as it's gone 'woke' it no longer allows slurs to be posted, which of course, being the sub, people peppered their replies with... so I went with this ControlC\n\n[Au Revoir, r/rsp](https://controlc.com/d19e6f07)\n\n[r/rsp 2023 Lit Recs](https://controlc.com/2caa6710)\n\nThere are a few glaring omissions when it comes to questions, but then there is every year.

        "content": "I know someone who worked as an SNL writing intern this spring. its more hierarchical than I thought it would be here is what they told me:\n\n1. **Isolated Break Room**: Interns have their own break room, completely separate from the main cast audience hall. They can only watch the live show from there unless they\u2019re called upon for tasks, mid show.\n2. **After Party Segregation**: They can attend the after parties but are walled off by red velvet ropes in a separate space. They can watch the main cast members, producers, and host celebrities hangout but they cant enter. It\u2019s like being in a kids club at a bar.\n3. **Menial Tasks**: Interns are often used for petty tasks like fetching coffee. Interaction with cast members is limited to brief responses unless otherwise instructed. Some of the cast members/crew were interns themselves and even though they were treated the same. They kind of treat the SNL interns like how they were treated for some reason.\n4. **Couch Controversy**: Once, a production exec was unhappy with the interns and removed their couch from the break room, forcing them to sit on the floor for the rest of the week. This was because a mistake they made in their order/task.\n5. **Sydney Sweeney\u2019s Cookies**: Sydney Sweeney requested expensive baked goods for everyone. An intern misordered by four, got yelled at by the executive producer, and almost got fired. Ironically, Sydney didn\u2019t even eat the cookie and later gave it to the intern. The intern could only talk to her if spoken to first.\n6. **Marcello\u2019s FIFA Obsession**: Cast member Marcello frequently makes interns buy him FIFA related stuff for his ultimate team and batteries for his controllers because he usually plays FIFA after every table read in his dressing room.\n\nWhy do interns want to work there?\n\nSimply put it pens doors and connections if you know how to leverage and can help you enter Hollywood. if you aren't a nepo baby.",
