My current employer in the UK have said that they want to keep me as a remote employee. Would it just be as \u2018easy\u2019 as keeping my UK bank account open, change address to my parents address and continue to be paid my salary in there? Therefore I\u2019ll still be getting taxed, paying into pension etc? You don\u2019t pay any tax in Qatar, so can\u2019t see there being an issue with that. ",

            "If your company does not have an entity in Qatar you\u2019ll most likely have to change to work as a contractor.\n\nWhat you\u2019ve said as a possibility can/will put you and the company in trouble with HMRC.",

A police enquiry led them to suspect the spouse was working casually (which he was to pass the time) & was threatened with deportation for life.  Food for thought \u2026",
            "You're opening yourself up for the bank closing your account as soon as they realise you're in Qatar e.g. trying to take money out or shopping there all the time as they will see you're not actually living at the house you are claiming to. At best closure because you're no longer resident here and most won't allow that as a basic current account, at worst, fraud marker. Some people I've seen on MSE have managed to do something like this with HSBC with a foreign address and all declared to the bank but it's a big gamble to just claim to live at that address then move abroad",
            "working there for your UK company will likely create a PE (Permanent Establishment).  that effectivlky means your UK company entity will then have to submit local tax returns etc etc and have ongoing compliance costs.  Creation of PE's is not something you employer will have necessarily thought about and shouldnt take likely.  it's quite specialist and if your business doesn't do that often its going to be new territory.  i work in international engineeirng and construction and for each bid to a new location a lot of effort goes it to work out what it means, some times these costs would make abid non commerically viable.  you dont want to get it wrong for sure.",
            "Generally speaking that's not how it works. Your address is not your parents address. You will most likely be a tax resident of Qatar and you'll have to be paid by your company either as a contractor or from your company's Qatar entity, if it exists.\n\nI'm not going to go into when you're a Qatar tax resident but I just wanted to say you should really look into it, it's not simple.",
            "Just tacking on to this then\u2026 how much work are you allowed to get away with doing without declaring? If I went for a weeks holiday somewhere but answered a few emails on a company laptop while I was away, would that count as \u201cworking illegally?\u201d",
            "Or they/the employer can hire them in Qatar through an employer of record. Means they\u2019d be able to get paid locally and not paying UK salary or tax.",

If found out, the employer is obligated to pay employee taxes in the country the employee decided to go and work for them in after a certain period of time.",

            "No, if they've got a qatari entity then you should be employed there, legally when you are remote you are resident where you work for all legal purposes including taxation.\n\n\nThat means you need appropriate permissions in Qatar to work and your company needs to comply with local law.\u00a0\n\n\nYou can't just be paid in the UK and that makes it OK because you are paying tax.\u00a0\n\n\nIf your permit allows you to work and the company doesn't want to be bound to qatari law they need to bring you on as a contractor.\u00a0"

Very excited but really new to the world of budgeting and personal finance, especially in the context of London.\n\nMy base will be 54k\u00a3 and a 10% bonus end of year. I found a great flatshare 2.7km by the office (40 mins walk) or 20 mins by bus, located in the area between Edgware road and Paddington basin. The monthly rent, inclusive of bills and council tax, is 1.250\u00a3.\n\nComing from sunny Italy this seems quite a lot, but I'm not sure how to put it in relation to the benefit of being close to the office and the relatively high starting salary. Is there anything else I should consider? I've got low starting savings (1.5k) but full parent support in case I need emergency money. \n\nWith a net salary of 3.4k, is spending 1.250\u00a3 a reasonable amount in london? Or maybe I should compromise on something, like location and distance?",

            "When I first moved to London, I lived ten mins walk from my work in central london, and paid half my salary in rent. I regret nothing. It was great for socialising and making friends (that many years later are still my friends), and I love walking through the city to get to work. \n\nYou can always move further out when you find your feet a bit, but if you can afford it and you have no other big out-goings, I think it\u2019s worth it.",

But a great central location so worth getting so you can make the most of the city your first year and then decide longer term where to live. London is great when you can walk and cycle everywhere. Enjoy!",
            "How many people in the flatshare ? I think \u00a31,250 is a reasonable amount for rent and bills in Zone 1.",
            "I think that even if it\u2019s expensive, it\u2019s a good idea to move near the office and live with people while you find your feet here, and if you don\u2019t like sharing a house then finding somewhere further out later down the line (if that\u2019s what you want to do!)\n\nEDIT: Actually just realised this is inclusive of bills and Council Tax, it\u2019s not exactly a steal but definitely reasonable for the location. It\u2019s also worth it to not have the admin of sorting out all the bills yourself. Paddington Basin is a nice area, lovely walks along the canal.",

The forms are long but they're quite easy to complete, took me and my mate about 3 hours to do and print off evidence and then got it submitted. If he can afford a solicitor to check it all the better but you don't need one... especially if they do it now while they're in a good place with each other so it'll be a simple clean break order."

So I bought tickets to a Taylor Swift concert sometime last year for my wife\u2019s birthday. \nWhen we had bought the tickets, the tickets were not sold as Restricted View.\n\nFast forward to the concert day (last Sunday), and alas our view was obstructed by these tents that had been placed in front of us (guessing it\u2019s to protect the sound system/speakers). It blocked half the stage and the whole runway she was going to perform on so the majority of the concert we were watching her perform on the screen.\n\n\nBut a few days leading up to the concert, my wife had been following peoples experiences of their seats at the concert that took place on days before our scheduled day. There were plenty of posts on Twitter and Reddit showcasing views that were obstructed by these tents and essentially how unhappy they were. They also shared their experiences of talking to the stadium\u2019s customer service department and nothing could be done to fix the problem as it was a sold out stadium. There were comments on how they raised a chargeback with their bank and got refunded.\n\n\nWe have been in touch with ticketmaster days prior to the concert to showcase our concern in the hopes they would rectify the issue and also we were in touch with them days after the concert as we really didn\u2019t receive the service advertised. \nOn the day of the concert, we had also approached the customer service department of the stadium but nothing could be done and were told we\u2019d need to bring it up with the ticket seller. (Essentially we\u2019re being tossed to one company to another).\n\nWe then today tried to raise a chargeback as we had bought the tickets via a credit card. But we were told by the bank that we\u2019re not eligible for a chargeback because we had attended the concert and we should\u2019ve walked away from the concert\u2026. Is this even a legitimate reason that refrains us from raising a chargeback? If not, who do I go to next ? The Ombudsman? It feels like these giant companies can do whatever they want and get away with it from what I\u2019m seeing.\n\nUpdate: seen a few comments speculating how much the tickets were. They were \u00a3200ish each. So in total it\u2019s leaning to the \u00a3500 mark ( including admin, booking fee etc).",

            "Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't a chargeback supposed to reflect a fraudulent transaction or a payment for services that were never fulfilled? Using it to refund a concert you actually attended seems a bit of a stretch.
