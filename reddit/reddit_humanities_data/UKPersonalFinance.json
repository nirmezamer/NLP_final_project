I assume the poor exchange rate could be temporary, and the NOK could bounce back, but that could take years, if ever?\n\nI've been thinking of looking for a financial advisor with specialist knowledge in this area, but I've no idea where to find one, and I assume that they'll take a hefty fee for their services.\n\nThe money I have in Norway is around 600-800k NOK, I also have a small amount of shares there.\n\nThanks. :)",

            "Getting tax codes correct is quite difficult in your situation.  It relies on calculating a basic rate restriction to ensure the correct tax is deducted.

Be as precise as possible but you must still be aware that bonuses, overtime etc will knock the estimate and could cause the basic rate restriction to be changed and then cause under and overpayments.\n\nWhen PAYE was designed, it was when everyone had one job and that was usually for life.  Your current situation was very rare back then.",

He left me his clothing to choose what I wanted to keep and do what I want with the rest. He had several boxes and suitcases of old suits and hats.\u00a0\n\nI recently got around to sorting through it and have found a significant amount of cash. It has the queens head on and is a mixture of mostly newer money and some old money. It is just over \u00a3360k. I have absolutely  no idea how he has this money.

I get up at 530am run PT 6-8am head into London and finish work about 7pm head home or back to gym to run more PT. I also do a few jobs on the weekend to try and earn extra. I earn approx \u00a333 -38k annual\n\nWe have three young sons.

Two years ago I renewed mortgage and managed to get this on a low rate fixed for 5 yrs.

But its reliable. \n\nSo this money is beyond life changing for us. But \n1. I\u2019m not sure where I stand on this as it was not stipulated in the will and I cannot even imagine where grandad got this money from as we used to do his shopping and drive him everywhere\n2. Even if I was able to use this money surely there is some massive tax consideration either immediately or as soon as I spend it. I mean I cannot pay off my mortgage with cash. \n\nI would really appreciate any advice.
