Although I did buy the pilaf trove packs for the link skill orbs and keys, the fact that I\u2019ve reached my highest stone count ever in the span of like 2 celebrations is genuinely crazy. Not only that, but all the recent missions for farming the Ginyu Force and Team Bardock are amazing for the health of the game, and can help new/F2P players clear content up to some mid-tier Red Zone stages WITHOUT SUMMONING. I know as the community we shit on some bad decisions Bandai makes, but honestly this is one area where they have been making a lot of improvements.",

I recently got into Nikke since it was highly rated and I\u2019ve caught up on all the Dokkan content a while back and hate the legends grind, it\u2019s the only thing I can remember playing over the past 8 years that reaches the same level of F2P friendliness. The fact that some of the free teams (Ginyu Force mostly, Team Bardock is pretty good these days too) can carry new people through most of the content till they get some DFEs is great, definitely needed as these games get older and older and just add more and more content. The amount of stones and tickets they just give away for basically free is crazy too, I remember when it was a fraction of what they gave away now. Even though most channels and outlets that revolve around gacha games don\u2019t talk about dokkan, it\u2019s stayed around the top of the charts all this time for a reason.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hg7uaxxg8c9d1.jpeg?width=896&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ec90d26650d7466bde95c5c63d3bc740dfe02052",

Like it was so f2p friendly you could pull all the new units easily because they had multiple pity systems and basically gave away summoning stones. Unfortunately they did this because the resources needed to \u201crainbow\u201d units and \u201ceza\u201d them were scarce and therefore not f2p friendly at all so the PVP was unbalanced as fuck.
