I will be sorting and updating the sheet by program, but you can also easily google how to filter it by any other category that you want to look at.\n\nObviously note this is VERY early so anyone who has been accepted already will have higher grades. Don't put too much pressure on yourself :) Please share this to your friends, discord and wherever else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: i'll try updating at *least* once every week, most probably on sundays.\n\n05/12/23: updated until column 165\n\n21/1/24: fully updated until column 232, updated by program code until 389. (they're throwing exam after exam at me, will try to finish updating it asap)\n\n16/2/24: i've finished updating everything! some areas are a little messy, but if you press ctrl+f you can easily search for what you're looking for :)  i have my final exams in march, so i won't be making any additional updates until after they end.
