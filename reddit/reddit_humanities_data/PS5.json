The meticulously crafted stages, deep narrative, rich character development, diverse array of new items, and distinctive soundtrack elevate this add-on to the same stellar quality as the original game.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Boomstick Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/545/boomstick-gaming)** - [Boomstick Alex](https://opencritic.com/critic/4242/boomstick-alex) - [5 / 5 ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOa4zsz2AKA)\n\n>Video Review - Quote not available\n-------------\n\n**[But Why Tho?](https://opencritic.com/outlet/722/but-why-tho-)** - [Eddie De Santiago](https://opencritic.com/critic/9637/eddie-de-santiago) - [10 / 10](https://butwhytho.net/2024/06/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review/)\n\n>Elden Ring was a massive endeavor and success, and instead of coasting on that success, they turned Shadow of the Erdtree into a thrilling final adventure with its own identity.\n\n-------------\n\n**[CGMagazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/82/cgmagazine)** - [Zubi Khan](https://opencritic.com/critic/4059/zubi-khan) - [9.5 / 10](https://www.cgmagonline.com/review/game/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/)\n\n>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree elevates the already stellar base game to new and challenging heights, adding a wellspring of content that cannot be missed, making it an essential must-play for all Elden Lords.\n\n-------------\n\n**[COGconnected](https://opencritic.com/outlet/94/cogconnected)** - COGconnected - [97 / 100](https://cogconnected.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review/)\n\n>It\u2019s a continuation of what made the Elden Ring fantastic in the first place. An epic adventure!\n\n-------------\n\n**[Cerealkillerz](https://opencritic.com/outlet/465/cerealkillerz)** - [Gabriel Bogdan](https://opencritic.com/critic/3388/gabriel-bogdan) - *German* - [9.3 / 10](https://cerealkillerz.org/review-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review/)\n\n>Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree exceeds all expectations and overshadows every other expansion out there. With around 20-30 hours of new challenging content and areas, designed for veteran players, is the label \"expansion\" a bit of an understatement. Considering the sheer amount of new elements, including some of the most spectular boss fights of the series, smaller shortcomings such as reused enemy types that could've used a bigger facelift, or that upgrades only give you a generic boost for two values, carry no weight in the full picture.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Checkpoint Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/563/checkpoint-gaming)** - [Omi Koulas](https://opencritic.com/critic/5958/omi-koulas) - [10 / 10](https://checkpointgaming.net/reviews/2024/06/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-pure-and-radiant/)\n\n>Shadow of the Erdtree not only expands upon Elden Ring's lore and gameplay mechanics but also enriches the experience with its atmospheric storytelling and intricate world design. It beckons players to embrace the daunting journey through the Shadow Realm, promising a gripping adventure that resonates with the hallmark blend of challenge and discovery. What's on offer is one of the best FromSoftware experiences to date, capturing everything that made Elden Ring special and more.\n\n-------------\n\n**[ComicBook.com](https://opencritic.com/outlet/862/comicbook-com)** - [Tanner Dedmon](https://opencritic.com/critic/9246/tanner-dedmon) - [5 / 5 ](https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review/)\n\n>There's no doubt in my mind that there's more to do still in Shadow of the Erdtree if not in this playthrough than definitely the next. If anything, all those missed connections and areas unexplored only make the prospect of returning to the Realm of Shadow on New Game+ with a bunch of new toys to play with that much more enticing.\n\n-------------\n\n**[ComingSoon.net](https://opencritic.com/outlet/845/comingsoon-net)** - [Tyler Treese](https://opencritic.com/critic/65/tyler-treese) - [9.5 / 10](https://www.comingsoon.net/games/reviews/1770021-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review)\n\n>This massive expansion makes an all-time great game even better and is a must-purchase for those who have finished the original.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Destructoid](https://opencritic.com/outlet/90/destructoid)** - [Chris Carter](https://opencritic.com/critic/431/chris-carter), [Steven Mills](https://opencritic.com/critic/10000/steven-mills) - [9.5 / 10](https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/)\n\n>I think that\u2019s the biggest point here, is that even though my expectations were high, Shadow of the Erdtree still managed to exceed them. From Software probably could have just added more Elden Ring and that would have been solid enough, but instead, Shadow of the Erdtree is yet another innovative iteration of the genre.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Dexerto](https://opencritic.com/outlet/863/dexerto)** - [Sam Smith](https://opencritic.com/critic/9291/sam-smith) - [5 / 5 ](https://www.dexerto.com/elden-ring/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-a-sublime-swansong-that-removes-all-tarnish-2778364/)\n\n>Shadow of the Erdtree is a fitting tribute to Elden Ring and a stunning finale that manages to surprise and shock us all over again. Those who enjoyed the base game will find much more to get their teeth into. This signs off the Elden Ring chapter of FromSoftware\u2019s journey so conclusively and impressively, that it invokes questions about how they will ever top it again.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digital Trends](https://opencritic.com/outlet/124/digital-trends)** - [George Yang](https://opencritic.com/critic/7294/george-yang) - [4.5 / 5 ](https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review/)\n\n>Shadow of the Erdtree is so packed with new content that it almost feels like a sequel to Elden Ring.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Entertainment Geekly](https://opencritic.com/outlet/874/entertainment-geekly)** - [Luis Alvaro](https://opencritic.com/critic/9991/luis-alvaro) - [4.5 / 5](https://www.entertainmentgeekly.com/2024/06/18/shadow-of-the-erdtree-elden-rings-darkest-adventure-yet-review/)\n\n>The daunting challenges ahead, the spirit of adventure and discovery that defines Elden Ring is ever-present, urging the Tarnished to rise again. With its intricate design and immersive storytelling, \u201cShadow of the Erdtree\u201d reminds us of the enduring allure of Elden Ring, promising countless hours of enthralling gameplay.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Eurogamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/114/eurogamer)** - [Alexis Ong](https://opencritic.com/critic/7984/alexis-ong) - [3 / 5](https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review)\n\n>Much of Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is more of the same gruelling beauty - but a shift to explict storytelling and signposting means its essence as a living, evolving shared text is lost.\n\n-------------\n\n**[FandomWire](https://opencritic.com/outlet/886/fandomwire)** - [Tanay Sharma](https://opencritic.com/critic/10503/tanay-sharma) - [10 / 10](https://fandomwire.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-a-fromsoftware/)\n\n>The culture around FromSoftware suggests that we should never expect stories to be directly told to us, and that remains true with Shadow of the Erdtree. I've always been an admirer of art that mimics life. In the context of Hidetaka Miyazaki's undying legacy, I do believe that Shadow of the Erdtree is yet another work of art that builds on the studio\u2019s history of delivering polished gameplay.\n>\n>Whether you choose to wield a fresh, exciting weapon like the Death Knight\u2019s Twin Axes or play with something trustworthy like the Rivers of Blood from the base game, Shadow of the Erdtree will still be a fulfilling journey worthy of your time, attention, and courage.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Fextralife](https://opencritic.com/outlet/501/fextralife)** - Fexelea - [9.6 / 10](https://fextralife.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review/)\n\n>Shadow of the Erdtree is an incredible expansion that no gamer should miss out on, adding even more value to an already outstanding game. With only minor performance issues and a few misses on the landscape, the expansion is challenging but rewarding, and full of secrets to discover. This is the kind of DLC every studio should aim to deliver, and very few can claim to do.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GGRecon](https://opencritic.com/outlet/828/ggrecon)** - [Harry Boulton](https://opencritic.com/critic/9323/harry-boulton) - [5 / 5 ](https://www.ggrecon.com/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review/)\n\n>Shadow of the Erdtree is a staggering achievement, and among the best work that FromSoftware has produced. It expands upon Elden Ring with an intricately woven narrative, unrelenting boss challenges, and a world so full of secrets that it's hard to know whether you've truly seen everything the expansion has to offer.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Game Informer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/35/game-informer)** - [Marcus Stewart](https://opencritic.com/critic/6102/marcus-stewart) - [9.8 / 10](https://www.gameinformer.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/an-emphatic-exclamation-point)\n\n>The boring but ultimately correct shorthand to summarize Shadow of the Erdtree is that it\u2019s more Elden Ring. The incredible sense of discovery, fantastic dungeon design, entertainingly deep combat, and intriguing lore and characters that defined From Software\u2019s 2022 masterpiece all apply to this expansion.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameBlast](https://opencritic.com/outlet/797/gameblast)** - [Victor Vit\u00f3rio](https://opencritic.com/critic/9556/victor-vit-rio) - *Portuguese* - [9 / 10](https://www.gameblast.com.br/2024/06/analise-dlc-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review.html)\n\n>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is a magnificent farewell to the saga of the Tainted One and the demigods. Even if FromSoftware made a bit of a mistake in balancing the bosses, there is enough content to last an entire game and anyone who enjoyed the base will have a lot to enjoy here, especially when exploring the paths and secrets to discover the intricate verticality of the world. open.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamefa](https://opencritic.com/outlet/498/gamefa)** - [mohammad hossein karimi](https://opencritic.com/critic/9320/mohammad-hossein-karimi) - *Persian* - [8.7 / 10](https://gamefa.com/1053881/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review/)\n\n>Shadow of the Erdtree is a successful attempt to recapture the emotions and surprises you had already experienced in Elden Ring. This is a game that in terms of both exploration and difficulty, aims at hardcore audiences and wants you to have a more intense experience than the base game. The more complex structure of the map and the way the bosses are designed are proof that FromSoftware expects you to spend time on their gigantic expansion. However, in the way of surpassing the base game and enhancing its strengths, some bad habits inherent in the base game are also repeated with greater intensity, which cannot be ignored. Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree portrays FromSoftware  a bit fiery, hot-tempered, out-of-control in aspects like boss design and scale. Still, this is an essential experience for fans of the base game that gives more meaning to the main game.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamers Heroes](https://opencritic.com/outlet/467/gamers-heroes)** - [Johnny Hurricane](https://opencritic.com/critic/6599/johnny-hurricane) - [90 / 100](https://www.gamersheroes.com/honest-game-reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review/)\n\n>Shadow of the Erdtree is the perfect swan song to Elden Ring. It gives you all the challenge, the loot, and the lore of the base game in a smaller chunk. Prepare to lose yourself to its siren call yet again.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gaming Instincts](https://opencritic.com/outlet/872/gaming-instincts)** - [Leonid Melikhov](https://opencritic.com/critic/1206/leonid-melikhov) - [10 / 10](https://www.gaminginstincts.com/review/shadow-of-the-erdtree-review/)\n\n>Shadow of The Erdtree is an excellent send off to Elden Ring. Whatever it is that you\u2019ve loved about the original game will be included here. Whether its exploring beautiful new areas with awesome interconnected level design or finding that one gorgeous vista where you can just stand around and gawk at the insane sense of scale. You will encounter plenty of challenging of new challenging bosses and optional bosses. You will discover new builds, new items, new weapons, summons and magics to use for your current and future playthroughs. There is plenty of replay-value here as I\u2019ve previously mentioned Shadow of the Ertdtree is about as big as Limgrave with tons of things to discover.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamingBolt](https://opencritic.com/outlet/297/gamingbolt)** - [Rashid Sayed](https://opencritic.com/critic/1200/rashid-sayed) - [10 / 10](https://gamingbolt.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-dlc-review-unparalleled)\n\n>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is an excellent follow up to the base game. Shadow of the Erdtree's focus on great level design and fantastic boss fights makes it a must play for the fans of the genre.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamingTrend](https://opencritic.com/outlet/102/gamingtrend)** - [Henry Viola](https://opencritic.com/critic/9816/henry-viola) - [85 / 100](https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-this-time-for-miquella/)\n\n>I'm both happy and sad that Shadow of the Erdtree is the first and last expansion for Elden Ring. On one hand, it's a masterfully woven experience that expands on the contents of the base game, whereas on the other it leaves much more to be desired with its disappointing final boss. That being said, it's still very much worth your time if you're craving some more Elden Ring.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Generaci\u00f3n Xbox](https://opencritic.com/outlet/431/generaci-n-xbox)** - [David Fernandez](https://opencritic.com/critic/7156/david-fernandez) - *Spanish* - [10 / 10](https://generacionxbox.com/analisis-de-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-una-expansion-de-10/)\n\n>Shadow of the Erdtree is everything the community wanted it to be\n\n-------------\n\n**[Hardcore Gamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/23/hardcore-gamer)** - [Adam Beck](https://opencritic.com/critic/873/adam-beck) - [4.5 / 5](https://hardcoregamer.com/review-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/)\n\n>When compared to Elden Ring, Shadow of the Erdtree doesn\u2019t quite live up to its lofty expectations. As a standalone experience, though, Shadow of the Erdtree is an absolute treasure that only helps to enhance the enjoyment of Elden Ring as a whole.\n\n-------------\n\n**[IGN](https://opencritic.com/outlet/56/ign)** - [Mitchell Saltzman](https://opencritic.com/critic/621/mitchell-saltzman) - [10 / 10](https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review)\n\n>Like the base game did before it, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree raises the bar for single-player DLC expansions. It takes everything that made the base game such a landmark RPG, condenses it into a relatively compact 20-25 hour campaign, and provides fantastic new challenges for heavily invested fans to chew on.\n\n-------------\n\n**[INVEN](https://opencritic.com/outlet/805/inven)** - *Korean* - [9 / 10](https://www.inven.co.kr/webzine/news/?news=296526)\n\n>An already near-perfect game gets a 30-hour expansion with this DLC. Adding a wealth of new stories within its mysterious world, 'Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree' will also challenge you with its formidable difficulty.

Shadow of the Erdtree is meant to test the mettle of the game's hardcore audience and isn't going to let up soon. This isn't going to change your mind about From Software's approach to its dungeon crawlers: it's either \"get good\" or go home and it intends to keep the messaging that way with its Shadow of the Erdtree expansion. \n>\n>The expansion's new offerings and updates, as well as epic boss fights, are still as grand and challenging as ever to the point that you may see optional boss Malenia (both versions) from the base game as a \"walk in the park\".\n\n-------------\n\n**[Kotaku](https://opencritic.com/outlet/276/kotaku)** - [Unscored](https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505)\n\n>FromSoftware\u2019s highly anticipated DLC could be a standalone game, it's just that good\n\n-------------\n\n**[Merlin'in Kazan\u0131](https://opencritic.com/outlet/661/merlinin-kazan-)** - [Samet Basri Ta\u015fl\u0131](https://opencritic.com/critic/6959/samet-basri-ta-l-) - *Turkish* - [96 / 100](https://www.merlininkazani.com/Elden_Ring-oyun_inceleme-126120p1.html)\n\n>The best game of recent years is back with the best expansion pack in recent years\n\n-------------\n\n**[Metro GameCentral](https://opencritic.com/outlet/75/metro-gamecentral)** - GameCentral - [9 / 10](https://metro.co.uk/2024/06/18/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-dlc-review-king-soulslikes-21057799/?ico=mosaic_tag)\n\n>Exactly as engrossing and meticulously designed as you'd expect of FromSoftware but even by their standards this is an enthralling slice of DLC that underlines and enhances the achievements of the original.\n\n-------------\n\n**[One More Game](https://opencritic.com/outlet/811/one-more-game)** - [Chris Garcia](https://opencritic.com/critic/8410/chris-garcia) - [10 / 10](https://onemoregame.ph/2024/06/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review/)\n\n>Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree is quite reminiscent of other similar From Software DLCs like Bloodborne\u2019s The Old Hunters, which adds meaty content and elevates the overall experience even further. Shadow of the Erdtree is a triumph for From Software, and if you thought that the Elden Ring experience could not be elevated, you are deathly wrong.\n>\n>Between all of the additional content here that the DLC provides, there\u2019s so much to see and do that can easily run you tens of hours, even hundreds, simply because of the difficulty level alone.

However, it could have been flawless if it weren't for the over-the-top recycling of enemies.

While I have personal gripes with what I see to be missed chances, that doesn't stop it from being spectacular on the whole. This expansion feels like it fully completes Elden Ring, a game that already felt like a whole project, in a way I didn't even know it needed to be completed.

And that my friends, is how we got scarlet rot.\n\nAll jokes aside, I love that Miyazaki is so passionate about his games that he wants to continuously work on them, even when he can do what most company president's do and just let everyone else handle it.",
            "I got no issue with Miyazaki, seems like a nice guy. The absolute glazing that goes on about him and From Software might be beyond any other developer ever. It's crazy.",
            "Next post: Contrary to widely held opinions, Mr Miyazaki actually uses the shitter to relieve his bowels.",
            "What's the weird camp you need to be in on Reddit where you downvote Fromsoft shit on sight because I see it a lot on here.\n\nThey're hands down one of the best studios there is in gaming currently and this guy is a fuckin' legend.",
            "Director of game directs game? Shock",
            "Oh trust me, I can tell he's very close to development with how many barefoot women there are in each game/dlc"
