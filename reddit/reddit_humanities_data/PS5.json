I have tested my net multiple times and it seems fine but stuff just seems to have trouble loading and I cant even connect to spotify yet i am still on psn and other devices are running fine",
            "My PS5 has been having a black screen on startup, no home screen sound neither. But when I hold the power button to shut off, it comes up with the turning off screen. It can boot into safe mode just fine, just seems to not load the startup screen. I rebuilt database, cleared cache. Yesterday while messing with it, the screen randomly said it had to repair my USB drive, which allowed me to enter the PS5 and play games like regular so I thought it was fixed. Could this be a resolution thing? I don't think it's the HDMI at all since i've plugged it in and out of multiple ports and it will still show the shutting down screen",

I cleaned to dust collection holes and fan, connected it to a different power outlet, connected a controller to it, held the power button for a while and nothing, still no sound or lights, just dead. I ordered a new power cable that I will test today, but besides that I have no idea what else to try. When I plug in a controller directly with a cable, it blinks a blue lights for several seconds and stops blinking. Anyone has encountered this issue? The console is 2 years old, so it is out of warranty. Thanks in advance for the help.",
            "Any one have a recommendation for a somewhat short single player indie type game (20 hours or less)? I just finished Prince of Persia and loved it so I'd be up for another good Metroidvania although I've played Steamworld Dig 2, Hollow Knight, both Ori games, Guacamelee, etc.  \n\nI also recently finished Animal Well, TOEM, Tchia, minit, Death's Door, A Short Hike, Tunic, Headlander, Stray, The Messenger, The Artful Escape, Superliminal, Carto, Inside, Dredge, Unpacking, Sea of Stars, Humanity, Cocoon, Dave the Diver, The Pedestrian, Tinykin and Nobody Saves the World.",

They might as well have spit on him.\n\nI can imagine having a perfectionist like Kojima, who notoriously takes his time with every project, has to be painful for a company trying to hit their quarterly numbers. But that said, if you have a golden goose maybe you should devise your long term strategy around them? Konami at the time of his departure just didn't care. They had short term plan that revolved around pachinko and annual soccer game releases."

        "content": "Only about 150 games in this weekend's sale, and there's a lot of AAA titles! Full list: https://mp1st.com/news/psn-store-weekend-offer-kicks-off-this-june-28-here-are-the-deals\n\nNot a bad sale. I think this is the best weekend offer I've seen in a long time in terms of games included.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n* Red Dead Redemption 2 (-67%, $19.79) - Who hasn't heard of this? It's the Wild West meets GTA, and it's a damn good ride! If you haven't played it yet, it doesn't seem like Rockstar is releasing a native current-gen version, so it might be worth the jump.\n\n* GTA 5 (-50%, $14.99 on PS4, $19.99 on PS5) - Same with Red Dead, almost everyone has this game already, but for those 1-2 people that don't, then this is definitely worth a buy.\n\n* Mortal Kombat 1 (-60%, $27.99) - The latest entry in the MK franchise. Loads of new characters being introduced, and it features the familiar Mortal Kombat fighting mechanics. Not a bad price for this new-ish game and the Kombat Pack is on sale as well (for the new fighters).\n\n* Star Wars Jedi Survivor (-55%, $31.49) - If you played the first one, and haven't jumped at the second installment, this is your chance. I think this has been on sale on PSN for a lower price before (not sure), but it's well worth the price. It's not a short game, and most of the issues with the first game (backtracking too much, jankiness, etc.) have been resolved here.\n\n* It Takes Two (-65%, $13.99) - Notable co-op game. This is purely a co-op game, so if you don't have anyone to play this with, then don't bother.\n\n* Star Wars Battlefront 2 (-70%, $5.99) - Solid shooter featuring Star Wars and made by DICE. Support for it has ceased but servers are still running, and it's definitely cool to play as Vader, Luke, etc, and trashing enemies about.\n\n* Dead Space (-65%, $24.49) - One of the best remakes in years, and if you're new to the franchise, this is a solid horror game. It's got length, suspense, a good story, loads of weapons to upgrade. Can't recommend this enough. Shame it doesn't seem like we are getting DS2 remake anytime soon.\n\n* Hogwarts Legacy (-50%, $34.99 for PS5, $29.99 for PS4) - Solo adventure game where you get to check out Hogwarts Castle. This is before Harry Potter's time, so don't expect to run into the lot. Combat is OK, and there are loads of side quests. No multiplayer of any sort.\n\n* Need for Speed Unbound (-85%, $10.49) - A not-so-serious take on the franchise. I found the controls a bit too slippery but a lot of people I know like this. Support for this is still on-going, though not much.\n\n* Mass Effect Legendary Edition (-85%, $8.99) - I've recommended this trilogy multiple times, and I always will. Easily one of the best video game trilogies in my book. Superb RPG and features BioWare at its finest. What you do in the first game carries over to the third game, and the combat has been refined compared to the original trilogy.\n\n* Hi-Fi Rush - (-40%, $17.99) - Solid game by Tango and their last one. Get it to see what all the hype is all about.\n\n* Marvel's Midnight Suns - (-75%, $14.99, $24.99 on PS5) - Marvel strategy game from the makers of XCOM. Has a good load of DLC, and packs a lot of content. Personally, I'd get the PS4 version since it's cheaper, and it's not like you're getting this for the graphics.\n\n* Evil West (-6-%, $23.99) - Third-person shooter game that has you killing monsters. It's no God of War and it's a linear game but can be something to play while you're waiting for the next big game. Note that this isn't a AAA game, so expect some jank and whatnot.\n\n* Gotham Knights (-80%, $13.99) - Not a bad action game with loads of combos, skill trees etc. The characters differ enough that you might want to play it more than once (it's not a long game).\n\n* A Plague's Tale Bundle (-60, $31.99) - Two solid titles and a good bargain at that price. Just don't get it if you're scared of rats\n\n* Lies of P (-30%, $41.99) - Have not played this but friends cannot stop raving about it. One friend told me this is the most similar game to FromSoftware that he's played that's not made by From.\n\n* Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order (-75%, $9.99) - If you can handle the backtracking, the fact that Cal runs like he has doody in his pants, then yeah, this is a solid action game. Good length, lots of secrets to uncover too.\n\n* Battlefield 2042 (-85%, $8.99 on PS4, $10.49 on PS5) - Game has gotten a bad rap and deservedly so, but it has turned things around. Season 7 is the last one but DICE is still releasing game updates and events. Player base is still good as well.\n\n* Star Wars Squadrons (-80%, $7.99) - Dogfighting Star Wars style! Not bad and maybe the only modern way to fly a TIE Fighter.\n\n* Dying Light 2 (-60%, $23.99) - Solid zombie game that is still getting a ton of support. It just got the Tower Raid Beta update this week as well.\n\n* LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga (-75%, $14.99) - Good and fun game to play with kids (or even with other adults). Brings that familiar LEGO humor.",
