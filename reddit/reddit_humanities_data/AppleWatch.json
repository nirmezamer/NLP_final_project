            "You can manually tell the watch to use airpods (once they\u2019re in your ear) by tapping the Audio Output icon in watch control center, before walking away from your phone. I run with airpods and stream cellular Spotify from my watch so I know what you\u2019re saying. I found manually doing it as I walk out of the house speeds up the process. I also turn off wifi outside so the watch searches for cellular quicker to stop picking up my home wifi.",
            "I wonder if there's a way you can use the focus modes to create a \"Running\" focus and have automations triggered around that. Then all you would have to do is manually turn on the Running focus mode and then have an automation created that says when Running focus is turned on, turn off Bluetooth on the iPhone. Shortcuts, that's what I mean by automation. I would be surprised if this isn't doable. You could even try to automate when the running focus turns on if you wanted.",
