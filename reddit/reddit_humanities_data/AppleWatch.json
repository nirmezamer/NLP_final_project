            "Which models still for sure have pulse-ox functionality post-patent dispute?\n\nI want to get an apple watch for my sick girlfriend  for its ECG and pulse-oximeter features. I see now that there has been a patent dispute with the pulse oximeter technology.\n\nIs there a sure fire way that I can get her a watch that has pulse-ox? Will I have to turn off software auto-update? Is there a particular model I should go for?",
            "Was tempted by a Series 9 but is there really much benefit over the SE 2 I already have. \n\nI can see some heart stuff and 1mm extra size with larger edge to edge display, anything else I\u2019m missing as if it\u2019s these alone I can\u2019t see the worth of an upgrade at this time.",
            "Just bought an AW S8 41mm (GPS) off Marketplace for $150, 100% battery capacity and no scratches. Almost never worn. Feels like a decent deal.\n\nI was wondering if anyone had any experience with stainless steel \u201cstraps\u201d. Any good brands to look out for?

One is with the pulse-oximeter and one is without. Usually the description will tell you. Last I heard, Best Buy still has some in stock. \nIf you are out of the US, you can buy directly from Apple. Still limited to the 9 or Ultra.",
