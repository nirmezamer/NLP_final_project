            "You can manually tell the watch to use airpods (once theyre in your ear) by tapping the Audio Output icon in watch control center, before walking away from your phone. I run with airpods and stream cellular Spotify from my watch so I know what youre saying. I found manually doing it as I walk out of the house speeds up the process. I also turn off wifi outside so the watch searches for cellular quicker to stop picking up my home wifi.",
            "I wonder if there's a way you can use the focus modes to create a \"Running\" focus and have automations triggered around that. Then all you would have to do is manually turn on the Running focus mode and then have an automation created that says when Running focus is turned on, turn off Bluetooth on the iPhone. Shortcuts, that's what I mean by automation. I would be surprised if this isn't doable. You could even try to automate when the running focus turns on if you wanted.",

It usually works pretty well but every now and then Ill have to select it twice for it to stick.\nApple makes hard because they want the watch to appear as if it has a longer battery life by letting your phone handle whatever possible processing it can."
