            "All I want is to manage a ship loadout without having to change to the ship",
            "I really like that you added the fast travel to takeover events. I would really like to see additional storage space added. The introduction of new materials,  weapons and such has made it frustrating to manage storage space. Thank you.",
            "Plundering military forts/ outposts should drop a lot of ammo",
            "Please don't move focus to PvP instead of co-op. By all means add some options but a lot of players play this rather than sea of thieves because they don't want PvP. \n\nAnd please don't tie a load of rewards to it so people feel forced to do stuff they don't enjoy. Give rewards that are available elsewhere in other game modes for solo and co-op players.",
            "Hey Devs, feedback for right now is that keep continuing the amazing work you do and we appreciate you guys! The only thing we\u2019re having issue with rn is like I asked/commented yesterday in the stream that the bounty timers are currently not resetting every 30 minutes and the Mega Lestari is currently not giving out chest after you did the bounty already once. It will only give out 10k silver rn! So if you guys please fix that asap it would be AMAZING! Also I LOVE THE FAST TRAVELLING TO EVENTS \ud83c\udff4\u200d\u2620\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f.",
            "I want one simple thing (don\u2019t know if it\u2019s on a road map or not).\n\nI want ship cargo loadouts.  If I switch ships with different weapon loadouts having to go through and clear out the ammo not being used and add ammo that wasn\u2019t on my current ship is annoying, especially if I am trying to quickly switch out for different missions.",
            "Random and different sea monster encounters while sailing instead of having them as a quest or bounty.",
            "Springloader but with a harpoon that latches on to enemy ships and keeps them in the circle",
            "You can add some more historical decorations to the store, such as decorative carvings from the Sovereign of the Seas. We already have a lot of fantasy decorations.",
            "To make a space like this for the Latin American community that does not speak English and to be able to have a greater participation or contribution of ideas, thank you"
