        "content": "# r/arduino Monthly digest for 2024-05\n\n## Why did my PC stop working when I plugged in my project?\n\nI have noticed this and similar questions being asked quite a few times over the past several months.\n\nWhile we don't have conclusive evidence from an actual investigation, there is plenty of anecdotal evidence that the reason is:\n\n>! you did it wrong. !<\n\nTo address this and provide a reply you can link to when replying to future such questions, I've added a [Protecting your PC](/r/arduino/wiki/guides/protecting_pc_from_overloads/#wiki_protecting_your_pc_from_overloads) guide to our Wiki.\n\nAny feedback on this wiki page such as corrections or additional ideas (subject to approval by the mod team) are encouraged and welcomed.\n\n## Arduino Survey\n\nThe \"Official Arduino\" user posted a survey asking about how you use and would like to use Arduino. If you are interested in sharing your thoughts, have a\nlook at this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/1d2ezkv/we_want_to_hear_from_you_share_your_thoughts_with/\n\n\n\n## Battery Powered Project update\n\nBack in March, I added the\n[Powering your project with a battery](https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/wiki/guides/batterypoweredprojects/#wiki_battery_powered_projects)\nguide to our wiki. Hopefully it has been of interest and useful to you.\n\nOver the past several weeks, I have been collecting some actual data. There isn't much, but what I have (so far?) is summarised here.\nThese observations illustrate some of the main points made in that guide.\n\nTo capture the data, I used 3 seperate project configurations of a \"system under test\" and ran each one of them\n3 times (so 9 data points in total) to see how long a 9V, 1200mAh rechargeable battery could power them. Why that\nbattery? Because:  \n* I had two of them (I alternated batteries),\n* they were relatively new,\n* they were at the top of the pile.\n\nEach project was based upon an ATMega328P MCU. Each project blinked the same LED at a 50% duty cycle (1/2 second on, 1/2 second off).\nEach project periodically pulsed another DIO pin as a \"heartbeat\".\n\nTo measure the \"lifetime\" of the system under test, another Arduino monitored the \"heartbeat\" of the system under test. If the\n\"heartbeat\" stopped for an extended period of time, then the monitor deemed that the battery had been exhausted to a point where it\ncould no longer power the system under test and output a runtime. There were some other functions, but that is the main idea.\n\n\nHere are the \"system under test\" project differences:\n\n1. A standard (genuine) Arduino Uno R3 with the standard Blink program (modified to blink an External LED and a 1/2 second on, 1/2 second off cycle).\n2. An \"Arduino on a breadboard\" running the exact same code and same external circuit as #1.\n3. An \"Arduino on a breadboard\" running a version of blink that puts the system into low power mode (instead of using delays), but otherwise the same external circuit as #1 and #2.\n\nHere are the results (times are in hours):\n\n|Project|Run 1|Run 2|Run 3|Average|Improvement|\n|:-:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|1|11.4|13.8|14.0|13.1|n/a|\n|2|18.3|18.3|18.8|18.5|41%|\n|3|94.4|94.3|84.1|90.9|391%|\n\nAs I stated numerous times in the guide, the results will vary based upon a great many things.\nBut, this data gives a small insight into the effect of just a few of them.\n\nIf battery powered projects are of interest to you, have a look at the guide in our wiki:\n[Powering your project with a battery](https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/wiki/guides/batterypoweredprojects/#wiki_battery_powered_projects).\n\n\n## Subreddit Insights\n\nFollowing is a snapshot of posts and comments for r/Arduino during the month of November:\n\n|Type|Approved|Removed|\n|---|--:|--:|\n|Posts|1,100|933|\n|Comments|8,200|251|\n\nDuring the course of this month we had approximately 1.4 million \"views\" from 18.1 thousand \"unique users\".\n\n^(NB: the above numbers are approximate as reported by reddit when this digest was created and do not seem to account for people who deleted their own posts/comments.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Arduino Wiki and Other Resources\n\nDon't forget to check out our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/wiki/index/)\nfor up to date guides, FAQ, milestones, glossary and more.\n\nYou can find our [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/wiki/index/) at the top of the r/Arduino\nposts feed and in our \"tools/reference\" sidebar panel.\nThe sidebar also has a selection of links to additional useful information and tools.\n\n\nAs you have probably noticed, reddit has \"improved\" the UI.\nOne of those \"improvements\" was to make hyperlinks difficult to find.\nThe Project Titles and User IDs in the tables below are links.\nClick on them to find out more about the project or the person's other posts.\n\n\n\n## Moderator's Choices\n\n|Title|Author|Score|Comments|\n|---|---|--:|--:|\n|[Decently useless but fun](/r/arduino/comments/1cn7qs8/decently_useless_but_fun/)|u/Reutertu3|588|32|\n|[Rotary Phone Turned into a Kitchen Timer](/r/arduino/comments/1d2562h/rotary_phone_turned_into_a_kitchen_timer/)|u/Scott3DPrints|220|33|\n|[My biggest project ever -

If we have to re-type things manually, (a) we might introduce new errors, and (b) a bunch of people won't bother and you'll get less (in quality and quantity) responses.\n\nSo I say to posters looking for assistance: Make it easy for the people trying to help you. If you don't make an effort asking for help, why should anyone else make an effort trying to provide it?",
            "Copy paste text also makes it searchable, so other users that have similar problems can find previous post with maybe a solution.  \nI'm not saying that screenshots can not be help full, but for error messages I vote for text.  \nI also always start with googling the error text I receive if I don't know it already :)",

Whereas usually the culprit(s) is/are at the top of the errors.\n\nSimilarly, the first parts of the messages are often a lengthy file name, with the actual error being chopped off on the right.\n\nBut, you raise a good point about errors.\n\n1. Error text should be included in full as formatted text.\n2. Dialogs, menu weirdness, display weirdness that cannot be easily explained definitely fit into the \"in addition to category.\n\nI will edit the post to expand #1.",

        "content": "I'm making a keylogger for an old Brother WP-2600Q word processor.  I'm pretty new to Arduino and hardware in general so I don't know if I may be wrong, but I have been programming for years so I at least can get the code down.  The problem I'm running into is that I don't know which pins are row or column, so I need to read the pins for which one gets triggered on each keystroke.  I grabbed a sort of demo script for using Keypad.h and it was reading well (the keys weren't correct, but it read a key for each keystroke) until a couple of the keys started giving the same response, which I took as the row and column may be incorrect or overlapping.  I tried making a small script that would iterate through all pins and tell me which are active when a key is pressed, but it read as the keys constantly spamming.  Below is the hardware configuration and the code samples I've used.\n\nThe Word Processor has a 17-pin matrix for its keyboard and I soldered wires onto it.  Between the wires and the Arduino Uno are 220\u03a9 resistors.  I'm connecting everything with lever-nuts instead of a breadboard because the wires connected to the circuit board don't have pins for solderless, and I don't want to solder more than I already had to.  \n\nHow do I go about getting the state of pins without them constantly spamming the serial monitor with activity?  Any help, advice, or suggestions is greatly appreciated!\n\n\n\n**Demo Code:**\n\n    #include <Keypad.h>\n    \n    const byte ROWS = 8;\n    const byte COLS = 9;\n    \n    byte rowPins[ROWS] = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};\n    byte colPins[COLS] = {10, 11, 12, 13, A0, A1, A2, A3, A4};\n    \n    char keys[ROWS][COLS] = {\n    \u00a0 {'1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'},\n    \u00a0 {'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I'},\n    \u00a0 {'J', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N', 'O', 'P', 'Q', 'R'},\n    \u00a0 {'S', 'T', 'U', 'V', 'W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z', '0'},\n    \u00a0 {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i'},\n    \u00a0 {'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r'},\n    \u00a0 {'s', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z', '!'},\n    \u00a0 {'@', '#', '$', '%', '^', '&', '*', '(', ')'}\n    };\n    \n    Keypad keypad = Keypad(makeKeymap(keys), rowPins, colPins, ROWS, COLS);\n    \n    void setup() {\n    \u00a0 Serial.begin(9600);\n    }\n    \n    void loop() {\n    \u00a0 char key = keypad.getKey();\n    \u00a0 if (key) {\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 Serial.print(\"Key pressed: \");\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 Serial.println(key);\n    \u00a0 }\n    }\n\n\n\n**Attempted Pin Tester:**\n\n    byte pins[17] = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, A0, A1, A2, A3, A4};\n    \n    void setup() {\n    \u00a0 Serial.begin(9600);\n    \n    \u00a0 for (int i = 0; i < 17; i++) {\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 pinMode(pins[i], INPUT);\n    \u00a0 }\n    }\n    \n    void loop() {\n    \n    \u00a0 for (int i = 0; i < 17; i++) {\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 bool currentState = digitalRead(pins[i]);\n    \n    \u00a0 \u00a0 if (currentState == HIGH) {\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Serial.print(\"PIN DETECTED: \");\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Serial.println(pins[i]);\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 }\n    \u00a0 }\n    \n    \u00a0 delay(10);\n    }",

            "What you have looks like a really decent framework to start with. \ud83d\ude00\n\nAs far as spamming the serial monitor you would only have those `Serial.print(...)` lines in there as you developed and debugged things and then once you had it working reliably and consistently you would probably want to remove or comment those lines out.\n\nIf it's spamming the monitor because the keys are being held down you could change the code slightly so that after outputting the info to the serial monitor, you then continually query the key or pin that was pressed until it was released before allowing the program to continue on and log the next key(s) pressed.",
            ">but I have been programming for years so I at least can get the code down.     \n    \nI suggest you haven't learned enough for the level of script you are trying to use.    \nI also suggest your sketch is too slow. The serial portion is 'bogging down' the rest of the sketch.    \n\n-----            \n              \nHardware method:            \nWhat I would do is to use an oscilloscope with at least 2 channels to look at the signals.     \nThat way I can understand the timing of the signals.    \nYou haven't mentioned a scope, so maybe you can do something similar in software    \nBut you need to look at the signals with much faster timing.     \n              \n-----            \n              \nDo you know about function [micros()](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/time/micros/) ?  \nYou can read the value and use it as a timestamp.  \n    \nWrite a sketch that takes a look at ALL 17 pins of the matrix and records their levels,     \nand a time stamp after recording all pins. This would be reported as one 'row' of data     \nAfter taking one row of data, it should repeat several times, collecting more batches.    \nThe data collection should have several samples/rows.    \n     \nAfter collecting several batches, the sketch should separately report that data via the serial     \nmonitor, and then STOP (just sit in a endless loop doing nothing)    \n               \n-----            \n              \n    \nRun the sketch, but don't press any keys, see what pins are active.    \n    \nIf you can determine that certain pins are active, (maybe the are changed sequentially)     \nthen you can run the sketch and quickly press a key, and see what NEW pins change."
