            "Heartbreaking. Thank you Katie for speaking up about it. Her platform makes others know they\u2019re not alone. \nI was a junior in college. He was my personal trainer. I never reported it. \nMy heart breaks for Katie and all of the other women who experienced this. I am so sorry.",
            "I was raped a little more than eight years ago. It doesn\u2019t go away, but it DOES get easier. There will forever be triggers. But I\u2019m not thinking about it every hour anymore. Or even everyday. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry to Katie. And I\u2019m so sorry to all my fellow survivors here.",

            "I hate that Michelle even needed to give her advice and a heads up about the racism she\u2019s going to deal with it and the fact that she needed to ask. I hope she\u2019s able to stay strong and block out the hate. It has nothing to do with her it\u2019s just evil people who need to get past the fact that all the bachelor and bachelorettes aren\u2019t gonna all be white.",
            "Two gorgeous ladies! Happy we\u2019re at a point in this franchise where they at least have each other to talk to with subject matters like this. Also makes me realize how much more difficult it must\u2019ve been for Rachel Lindsay as the first lead of color for the entire franchise.",
            "Michelle had the huge advantage that the show gave her a very favorable edit, and as a heartbroken runner up she seemed like the logical choice to be the next lead. Katie was the one who got the backlash for being picked outside of the F4. ABC really screwed over Jenn by not bringing her to F4, and by not giving her a more sympathetic edit.",
            "Michelle experienced racism regardless of her edit. The edit can only do so much when the audience just don\u2019t want to see a person of color as a lead.",

            "As Jenn Tran began her journey, there was one member of Bachelor Nation she wanted to talk to.\n\nSo ahead of filming season 21 of The Bachelorette, taking up the mantle of being the first Asian-American to lead the franchise\u2014she reached out to fellow alum Michelle Young.\n\n\u201cI really wanted a perspective from a person of color and just get to know what her experience was like and where to kind of go with it,\u201d Jenn told E! News\u2019 Francesca Amiker in an exclusive interview. \u201cI know that being in the limelight, you get a lot of backlash for it and racism, specifically. And I wanted to know how she handled all that and whether she thought it was worth it in the end.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cAnd she was really great with a lot of good guidance. She was like, \u2018There are gonna be haters out there, there\u2019s gonna be racism out there, but know that you\u2019re doing it for a reason and be strong-willed.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn fact, Jenn found that she and Michelle\u2014who led season 18 of the franchise\u2014had similar approaches to their journeys, both on and off the screen.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re both in the same mindset in that we both want to keep making change happen,\u201d the 26-year-old explained. \u201cAnd if we\u2019re the people who are spearheading that, then all the better.\u201d\n\nJenn first appeared on Joey Graziadei\u2019s season of The Bachelor, which aired earlier this year. And though she didn\u2019t find love with the tennis pro, she\u2019s eager for another shot at finding her true match\u2014and she\u2019s grateful for the impact she\u2019s making along the way.\n\n\u201cWHAT A DREAM,\u201d she began her March 27 Instagram post following the announcement of her casting. \u201cI can not begin to explain how grateful I am and how surreal this all feels.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso, FIRST ASIAN BACHELORETTE?!\u201d she added. \u201cGrowing up I never got to see anyone who looked like me lead their own love story on TV. To be able to inspire a generation of people to be proud of their culture is something I\u2019m so grateful for.\u201d\n\nAnd while noting the opportunity is \u201cso much bigger than myself,\u201d Jenn expressed, \u201cI am so incredibly excited for this crazy adventure to find my person and I can\u2019t wait for all of us to laugh and cry together.\u201d\n\nJenn\u2019s journey on The Bachelorette premieres July 8 at 8:00 p.m. ET/PT on ABC and streaming next-day on Hulu. Until then, keep reading for a refresher on the love lives of all your favorite Bachelor Nation alums.",
