            "I was raped a little more than eight years ago. It doesn\u2019t go away, but it DOES get easier. There will forever be triggers. But I\u2019m not thinking about it every hour anymore. Or even everyday. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry to Katie. And I\u2019m so sorry to all my fellow survivors here.",

She may have done it in a moment of fed-up/ desperation but it\u2019s really brave and strong and I think it\u2019ll speak to and help a LOT of people.\n\nWhen courts aren\u2019t doing anything but making it worse, I wish we could all take that power back in a way like this: exposing the person for who they are, and without a shitty retaliatory response like a defamation suit that even further re-traumatizes.",

            "I know many women who have been sexually assaulted or raped. Only a few were able to report. None of them got justice. None. Even when it was obvious or witnessed. To come forward and report and pursue charges is so brave, knowing what we all know. Sending her love.",

        "content": "In a June 26 filing, the former Bachelorette claims that she discovered Abasolo had filed for divorce on January 2 \"via text message\" \u2014 and she included a screenshot of the conversation to prove it.\n\nIn documents obtained by PEOPLE, Lindsay, 39, claims that she and Abasolo, 44, \"had a conversation in my kitchen during which he failed to mention that he had filed for divorce\" on the same day that he eventually filed.\n\n\"Approximately 30 minutes after he left the house, he sent me a text message that simply read 'Hey ... I just wanted to let you know that I officially filed,'\" Lindsay claims.\n\nThough she knew that she and the chiropractor \u2014 who she met and got engaged to on season 21 of The Bachelorette \u2014 \"were separating and would be headed toward divorce,\" she said she was \"shocked\" to be informed that he'd officially filed over text.\n\nShe noted that their \"prior conversations\" had been \"amicable\" and the two had discussed how to navigate filing for divorce in a way that \"would not attract media attention.\"\n\nIn the screenshot Lindsay provided, Abasolo texted her at 11:43 a.m. on Jan. 2, \"Hey...I just wanted to let you know that I officially filed.\"\n\n\"Wait what?\" she responded. Later that night, she stopped sharing her location with Abasolo, per the screenshot.\n\nLindsay claims that she \"tried to talk to Bryan about the divorce in order to settle this matter swiftly and amicably, but he was not interested.\"\n\n\"He informed me in no uncertain terms that everything must go through lawyers. He has not made any effort \u2013 reasonable or not \u2013 to resolve this matter with me,\" she says in the filing.\n\nIn the initial divorce filing, Abasolo cited \"irreconcilable differences\" as the reason for the divorce after four years of marriage. In a since-deleted post on Instagram, he called the separation a \"difficult decision,\" as he said, \"Sometimes loving yourself and your partner means you must let go.\"",

            "I actually think this is a perfect example of social media being indicative of where a relationship is at for influencers. They never posted together and didn\u2019t live together for quite a while, and Rachel insisted they just kept their relationship private. But now she\u2019s saying they hardly went on dates and didn\u2019t even fly the same class and it sounds like they weren\u2019t just keeping things private they just didn\u2019t have anything worth showing off on social media",

            "So many people on the sub called out the weirdness of them never spending time together. Rachel was always traveling for work and going to events without Bryan. The excuse was him being busy with work or maybe not being as social as her.

            "As Jenn Tran began her journey, there was one member of Bachelor Nation she wanted to talk to.\n\nSo ahead of filming season 21 of The Bachelorette, taking up the mantle of being the first Asian-American to lead the franchise\u2014she reached out to fellow alum Michelle Young.\n\n\u201cI really wanted a perspective from a person of color and just get to know what her experience was like and where to kind of go with it,\u201d Jenn told E! News\u2019 Francesca Amiker in an exclusive interview. \u201cI know that being in the limelight, you get a lot of backlash for it and racism, specifically. And I wanted to know how she handled all that and whether she thought it was worth it in the end.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cAnd she was really great with a lot of good guidance. She was like, \u2018There are gonna be haters out there, there\u2019s gonna be racism out there, but know that you\u2019re doing it for a reason and be strong-willed.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn fact, Jenn found that she and Michelle\u2014who led season 18 of the franchise\u2014had similar approaches to their journeys, both on and off the screen.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re both in the same mindset in that we both want to keep making change happen,\u201d the 26-year-old explained. \u201cAnd if we\u2019re the people who are spearheading that, then all the better.\u201d\n\nJenn first appeared on Joey Graziadei\u2019s season of The Bachelor, which aired earlier this year. And though she didn\u2019t find love with the tennis pro, she\u2019s eager for another shot at finding her true match\u2014and she\u2019s grateful for the impact she\u2019s making along the way.\n\n\u201cWHAT A DREAM,\u201d she began her March 27 Instagram post following the announcement of her casting. \u201cI can not begin to explain how grateful I am and how surreal this all feels.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso, FIRST ASIAN BACHELORETTE?!\u201d she added. \u201cGrowing up I never got to see anyone who looked like me lead their own love story on TV. To be able to inspire a generation of people to be proud of their culture is something I\u2019m so grateful for.\u201d\n\nAnd while noting the opportunity is \u201cso much bigger than myself,\u201d Jenn expressed, \u201cI am so incredibly excited for this crazy adventure to find my person and I can\u2019t wait for all of us to laugh and cry together.\u201d\n\nJenn\u2019s journey on The Bachelorette premieres July 8 at 8:00 p.m. ET/PT on ABC and streaming next-day on Hulu. Until then, keep reading for a refresher on the love lives of all your favorite Bachelor Nation alums.",
            "I hate that Michelle even needed to give her advice and a heads up about the racism she\u2019s going to deal with it and the fact that she needed to ask. I hope she\u2019s able to stay strong and block out the hate. It has nothing to do with her it\u2019s just evil people who need to get past the fact that all the bachelor and bachelorettes aren\u2019t gonna all be white.",
