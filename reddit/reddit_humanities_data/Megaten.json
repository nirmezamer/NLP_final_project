            "What's the hierarchy of difficulty of the four super bosses?\n\nThose being >!Satan, Masakado, Shiva, and Demi fiend!<",
            "Why do people spell it \"Quadistu\"? It's not an English Q, it's a q used to represent a sound common in a lot of semitic languages (like the one I'm most familiar with, the Arabic \u0642), which is a deep throaty \"k\" sound. It doesn't follow the rules in English where a u must follow q. It's like how q when representing Mandarin (using Pinyin) represents a sort of \"ch\" sound.",
            "What book is the SMT5 protagonist always reading that he reads while walking around with it?",
            "SMT V Vengeance \n\nJust want to know how much left of the game is left (CoV), I just got to the fairy village. I have been doing all the side quests and exploring. CoC took me about 60 hours on my play thru back in 2021 so I just want to compare.",
            "Anyone has any idea of how Marduk became the King of Based?",
            "Hey guys, I\u2019ve been wanting to beat this game for a few years now, and honestly the only thing holding me back is how awful the Labyrinth of Amala is. As soon as I start it, I just feel like I\u2019d rather do literally anything else with my time, despite liking the rest of the game. I was wondering if it\u2019s truly worth it, and when the point of no return is. Like can I just come back towards the end of the game and breeze through it? Or is it awful no matter what?\n\nFor context, I haven\u2019t played in a few months, but the last thing I did was the boss fight against Lachesis, Atropos, and Clotho.",
            "In smt IV apocalypse, which ending has the demons stay with us?",
            "Where to go/who to talk to to trigger the Khonsu quest in CoV? I finished the Amon one",
            "In Smt5V, how does Deathly Aura II works? The one that makes you demand money from cornered demons?",
            "Am I being very underleveled ? My Nahobino have resist elec, light and dark but when I fight Beelzebub and he used Thunder Reign, each hit still got me like over 100 damage each and his mudobarion take 2/3 of my health bar."

            "So is Tao like an Isabeau character? I think in Vengeance she's given more depth to go from law to law-neutral. I still think Isabeau is a lot cooler though",

            "Bocchi the Rock is also a show that exists.",
            "Nice! I ordered a copy too but it\u2019s not supposed to arrive until July 1 (which works out for me because I\u2019ll be busy until then anyway). Don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll start playing it immediately, but I absolutely want to play it soon.\n\nHope you\u2019re still enjoying the original game too, pretty curious to read your thoughts on it when you\u2019re done.",
            "In that room before the final boss, there's like two quests that differ based on alignment. Idk if there's anything else other than that",

            "I got my copy from Best Buy I work really close to one so in store pick up is so convenient hehe. Something I forgot to mention but I think it's worth pointing out is that 4 other people pre-ordered it! Which blew my mind Especially since it's a pretty niche visual novel that costed 80 bucks. I thought it was pretty cool.\n\nA short version is that I  still like it. It's probably my least favorite in comparison to Witch on the Holy Night, Garden of Sinners and Fate/Stay Night. But it still has some great moments that are just as good as any of Nasu's other work imo. There are just some stuff that brings it down for me.",

It is highly recommended you use a guide to get the neutral ending though, as it is hard to get, and neutral is considered better to play through then Law or Chaos.",
            "it's 4, the speech bubble text boxes are only in 4",
            "using a guide to get a specific ending completely defeats one of the most important elements of the series. i would say\u2026 play the game naturally and be curious about what route you might be getting into, and once you\u2019ve finished it just load a different save and do alignment quests or change your alignment values with cheat engine if you\u2019re on an emulator. the alignment is part of the experience and unless you want to sacrifice the experience just for the sake of \u201cbest ending\u201d (debatable), this is the way to go",
