            "What's the hierarchy of difficulty of the four super bosses?\n\nThose being >!Satan, Masakado, Shiva, and Demi fiend!<",
            "Why do people spell it \"Quadistu\"? It's not an English Q, it's a q used to represent a sound common in a lot of semitic languages (like the one I'm most familiar with, the Arabic \u0642), which is a deep throaty \"k\" sound. It doesn't follow the rules in English where a u must follow q. It's like how q when representing Mandarin (using Pinyin) represents a sort of \"ch\" sound.",

            "Hey guys, I\u2019ve been wanting to beat this game for a few years now, and honestly the only thing holding me back is how awful the Labyrinth of Amala is. As soon as I start it, I just feel like I\u2019d rather do literally anything else with my time, despite liking the rest of the game. I was wondering if it\u2019s truly worth it, and when the point of no return is. Like can I just come back towards the end of the game and breeze through it? Or is it awful no matter what?\n\nFor context, I haven\u2019t played in a few months, but the last thing I did was the boss fight against Lachesis, Atropos, and Clotho.",

            "At last I finished Three Houses (Crimson flower) last night. The fact that it's so short sucks for more reasons than one (I'll have to replay the last month to try and get more A supports for one, as there is no post game, but it's mostly just how clearly rushed/unfinished the route is), but the upshot is that I won't spend so much of my time on this game (most of this week's waking hours have just been playing TH), so I can move on to other stuff, including Vengeance.\n\nAnyway, great game. Possibly the best world building I've seen in any game. I loved planning and min-maxing unit growth. It did make it last way longer than a normal fe game, but I might've overdone it. I put over 150h into this. And to be perfectly clear: that's just for **the shortest route in the game**. And I wasn't even playing on maddening.",

D: clearly a rip off smh.\n\nStill going through the original Tsukihime though so I probably wont get to it for a little while thinking of playing a couple smaller games as well to avoid burn out. Currently doing the Hisui route so at least I'm almost done. After that I have Kohaku. I have some thoughts on Ciel's and Akiha routes but I didn't feel like doing a long post about it heh...",

Don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll start playing it immediately, but I absolutely want to play it soon.\n\nHope you\u2019re still enjoying the original game too, pretty curious to read your thoughts on it when you\u2019re done.",

            "I think its because car accidents are an example of society accepting a certain amount of deaths and suffering simply because of the convenience it allows.\n\nThe reality is that 90%+ of car related deaths would be avoided with a 25 mph speed limit.\n\nBut think about how much that would limit transportation. The reality is that even in Japan, car ownership is over 80%. Sure, public transportation is good - but even over there you are going to run into cases where you can't get where you want to go without a car, especially not conveniently.\n\nTo put it another way, car related deaths aren't even intrinsic to cars - they are intrinsic to the convenient speeds at which people like to travel. Its peoples desire for an easier, cheaper way of living that brings death, not the cars themselves. \n\nThe acceptance of suffering and death for the convenience of society is of course the kind of idea that Atlus would like to reference in their games.",
