            "I have an Alaskan Spitz that loves to play fight with me all the time. He growls like this until I roughhouse with him but he never actually hurts me. It's honestly impressive how excited and playful he can get while acting like a ferocious beast and not hurt me in any way. I grab his lower jaw when he goes to 'bite\" me and he's always careful to not hurt me. When he was little he would \"bite\" my hand and then fall asleep but I figured he did that because he's blind and that way he knew I was close by?  Idk, but I bet that dog isn't nearly as aggressive as he's acting.",
