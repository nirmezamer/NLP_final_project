            "Hello, for the farm on this video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ai7VL_5KqJc\n\nAre those measures internal? Meaning is not counting the blocks on the outside? So 101 from top to bottom counting the bricks i use?\n\nDoes it even matter if i do it a bit bigger?",

            "why is this not a snow biome? it has more than 300 snow blocks so im confused.  \n[https://imgur.com/a/hnxQWM7](https://imgur.com/a/hnxQWM7)",
            "Why undead miners are not spawning? They spawned 2-3 times when I was digging first tunnel and now none. Skeletons are spawning but not the miners. I have killed like 850 bats now..\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e6z2gyx7387d1.jpeg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0a6357f3511fe55da9c258d73b62a0adaa4bd79c",
            "So this is minor suggestion, but I thought of it because I'm currently doing an underground build. We currently have the planked wall which is wooden slats over stone, it'd be cool to have a couple of variations of the planked wall with wood over say dirt, or sandstone, etc.",
            "can anyone either help me  cleanse or tell me how to find this last 1% of hallow in my world, i just want it all gone",
            "Ayo, I want to post something and am not sure if here is appropriate, or if I should in r/TerrariaMemes. The post in question is that I found a random Empress of Light sound effect inside an unrelated netflix show, and want to know where to post.",
            "I'm trying to make a texture pack that changes what Moon Lord looks like, but I can't find what the ID is for its body and arms. I tried looking on the wiki, but the closest thing I could find is the ID for core. Does anyone know or know where I could find out?",
            "Is the worm scarf worth it post Mech bosses? I read that it applies after buffs and defense, so now that im starting to stack both and have \"high\" defense numbers im wondering if i should change it.\n\nIm playing melee and while i avoid damage as much as i can in boss fights, i do get hit quite often.",
            "How do I open the equip menu in the mobile(phone) version? I have armor and extras equipped but I bought a vanity item from a traveling merchant that I want to wear over them. I have forgotten how to open it before and It may have changed. I can double tap to equip the vanity item but It takes away a non-vanity item because it's not placed in a vanity slot. How do I open the menu that shows me what I have equipped and my empty slots?"

            "Mage is well balanced as it is, just a little lacking in the very early game (when you aren't necessarily intended to be a single class anyway). Summoner is getting more whips which will be nice too. Consider that the four classes don't need to be equal in terms of skill. Mage is a good stepping off point for intermediate players who have gotten used to playing the easier classes of Melee and Ranger, requiring you to dodge more and play smarter but with the benefit of many healing weapon options, attack variety, and many more homing weapons. Summoner is better suited to multiplayer when other players can take the heat off of you, and gives you the advantage of getting to focus almost entirely on dodging and running at the cost of attacks hurting more."
