            "(Very new, first time in hard mode!) I read on the wiki that destroying altars will spawn ebostone at random around the world, is it worth avoiding doing this to prevent even more spreading, and finding a different armour set to go for. My world is already at 19% corruption. Thanks for any help!",
            "Does anyone have any tips for Master Mode Wall of Flesh? Specifically as a Summoner. I've followed class setups and literally have the best gear I can get, but my imps barely do ANYTHING to the wall. It seems I can't get past half of its health. I have a murderous Spinal Tap, Ruthless Imp Staff, Flameburst Rod, and a full set of Obsidian Armor. Accessory-wise I have Shield of Cthulhu, Brain of Confusion, Feral Claws, Pygmy Necklace, Apprentice's Scarf, and Terraspark Boots. I also have been drinking ironskin, endurence, and summoning potions. I also use the Bewitching Table and the War Table. From my research, this should be the best layout I can get, right? Do I just suck at this fight or am I missing something?",

            "I\u2019m having trouble opening crates in my world on the switch. I have been scouring the forums but all the advice I can find is either for PC or doesn\u2019t work. I can\u2019t figure out what button to press to open them and I feel so dumb? In the description in my inventory the crates say \u201cPress \u00a0 to open\u201d without a named button. Any advice or know how to open the crates?\u00a0",

            "Bro this isn't team cherry, we're getting consistent sneakpeaks for the update and remember this is all FOR FREE.\nThey don't really have any obligation to keep updating the game the final update was 1.4 and before that it was 1.3 etc etc.\nJust be grateful and patient dude.",
            "No I'm sure that it'll be worth the wait. It always is. I just wish they were more open and honest about the timeline.",

            "Terraria will always be my favorite game. And they are in no way obligated to keep giving us free content. I just wish they were a little more transparent about their progress in these updates. I feel like they have said \"coming soon!\" every month for the last year.",
            ">I've been holding off playing because I was under the impression an update was coming soon.\n\nSame dude. I want to do a summoner playthough but it feels pointless seeing the early/mid game summoner items the update is bringing. \n\nA while back they announced it would be out by the end of 2023. But I fear that feature creep and system version parity is pushing the release date further and further back."
