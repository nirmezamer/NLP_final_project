            " So I went ahead and booked i20 2024 facelift model Sportz (o) ivt for 11.35 lc on road. But the delivery is getting delayed so meanwhile the showroom people told me that they have a discount on another varient that is 2023 model. This is 2023 pre facelift modal Asta (o) dct which they are quoting 12.50 lc on road. Feature wise 2023 model, being asta is an upgrade in every regard, be it projector headlamps, full letheratte seats and driving wheel, alloy wheels, rear wiper, the bigger infotainment setup etc. now I am confused should I go for the 2023 dct for that price or just save that extra 1 lakh and take the sportz 2024? \n\nP.S. I\u2019m looking only for automatics.",

            "Hey all! Our current car (Zen Estilo) is going to retire as per road guidelines in NCR (15 years). We need to buy a new one before end of year. I currently am working in a city away from my family and for the next 1-2 years my father is going to drive, post which I might be driving it. Parking space is limited so he is suggesting we buy a wagon-R type car (paid parking is an option if the car is very suitable).\n\nHowever, a car being a fairly long term investment, I think we should go for a sedan or compact SUVs. Uses: city commute (Gurgaon), highway drives. Primary concern is safety, versatility + durability on Indian roads and comfort. Considering AGS fully manual works as well (again if the car is good).",

            "Hi y'all. This is specific to the VW Virtus GT - so there is this known issue where the DSG gear box gets confused between 1st and 2nd gears at low speeds, especially after you've slowly gone over a speed breaker. It will randomly go into 1st gear even though you have enough speed to be in 2nd. Is this issue common across all Virtus owners and if yes, is there a fix, something the service center can do? Also, my AC makes a weird sound, like a low hissing sound which keeps coming and going. My SA mentioned that it can be fixed during servicing but I am not so confident. Does anyone know what the issue may be / possible fix?"

            "In an ideal world, where everyone follows the traffic rules, it would be the mistake of the car driver. I may get a lot of hate for this, but hear me out. When merging from a side road on to a main road, the driver on the main road has the right of way and priority over other traffic. While merging, it's the responsibility of the person who is merging to make sure that it is safe to merge. Ideally one should merge such that the traffic on the main road is not impeded, i.e. that person should not have to brake. But we don't live in an ideal world and this sub is the best example for it.",
