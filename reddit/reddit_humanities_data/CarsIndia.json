            "Hey guys,\n\nI\u2019m planning to buy a 2018 Brezza ZDi as my first car for \u20b96.60 lakhs. This car has clocked about 95,000 km. I took a 5-year loan of \u20b95.60 lakhs after making a downpayment of \u20b91 lakh. I know I could\u2019ve paid more as downpayment, but I kept \u20b91 lakh in reserve just in case there are any repairs needed after the purchase.\n\nI took the car to a Maruti dealership for a check-up, and the mechanic there said I don\u2019t have to worry and should go ahead with the purchase. I visited the dealership twice, drove it, and also took my family around in it. My parents really loved it and felt it was so much better than our family car, a Hyundai Eon. \n\nI\u2019m really excited about this purchase, and so are my parents. Would love to hear your thoughts and any advice you might have!",
            " So I went ahead and booked i20 2024 facelift model Sportz (o) ivt for 11.35 lc on road. But the delivery is getting delayed so meanwhile the showroom people told me that they have a discount on another varient that is 2023 model. This is 2023 pre facelift modal Asta (o) dct which they are quoting 12.50 lc on road. Feature wise 2023 model, being asta is an upgrade in every regard, be it projector headlamps, full letheratte seats and driving wheel, alloy wheels, rear wiper, the bigger infotainment setup etc. now I am confused should I go for the 2023 dct for that price or just save that extra 1 lakh and take the sportz 2024? \n\nP.S. I\u2019m looking only for automatics.",
            "** Baleno vs. i20\n\nHi guys.\nThinking of buying a hatchback in the 9-11 lakhs range.\nMore or less narrowed it down to Baleno or  i20. (Most likely MT, One below the top variant)\nWhat are your opinions?\nIn particular, I would like some info and/or personal experience on the engines.",
            "**Need Advice: Dealer Offering discount on Display Car for Hyundai Verna DCT SX(O)**\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI recently booked a Hyundai Verna DCT SX(O) and the dealer quoted \u20b921.25 lakhs on road (including discounts). A couple of days after booking, the Sales Manager called me for an appointment and came to my home with an offer. They offered an additional \u20b950K discount and a mini ceramic coating if I'm willing to take the display car.\n\nThe car in question was manufactured on April 25, 2024, and according to the dealer, it's never been driven. I've seen this car in the showroom during my previous visits.\n\nWhile I'm tempted by the additional discount, I'm also concerned about why they are so eager to reduce the price. Is there a hidden issue with the display car that I'm missing? I'm planning to bargain further, but I want to be sure I'm making the right decision.\n\nAny suggestions or insights would be greatly appreciated!",

            "# Which one should I go with Topline MT (ES) 2024 or Topline AT 2023 (July) ?\n\nI'm stuck between two options: the Topline MT (ES) 2024 and the Topline AT 2023 (July). Both are priced at around 17.5 lakhs.\n\nShould I just go for the 2023 model? The salesperson says the showroom got it in April 2024 and can show me the receipt.\n\nI could really use your advice on this. Is the 2023 model the way to go, given the similar price?\n\nAny thoughts or suggestions would be a huge help!",
