If you don't own the current expansion you will not get New World: Aeternum automatically. \n* **I see they're calling it an ARGP (Action Role Playing Game) - is this still an MMO?** Yes, the devs still consider it an MMO and are likely trying to target console players who mightn't really know/understand what an MMO is. \n* **Will my existing characters be deleted** - No. \n* **Will there be fresh start servers** - Yes, we don't know when they will launch. \n\n### Content Updates\n* **Free-for-all PvP Area** - New free-for-all PvP area where players can earn Mystic Doubloons for top-tier gear.\n* **Linear Raids** - These raids feature three bosses, each more difficult than the last, requiring elaborate teamwork from a group of ten players. \n* **End-game Solo Trials** - New solo (Soul) trials, no real details provided yet\n* **Storytelling** - Enhanced storytelling elements are introduced, including an improved dialog system, pre-rendered cutscenes, and in-game cinematics.

This should help with lag and user experience when an area gets very populated, and reduce queue times.  \n\n\n\nYou can watch the stream on YouTube or Twitch starting at 5pm EST, Friday June 7th:\n\n* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZzia5NrMuU)\n* [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/thegameawards)\n\n## What we know so far \n\n* Console release trailer https://youtu.be/c5HrkNz1pSU?si=0EHV5q8B8UBPPL4N\n* Dev update video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-Wcdcy7kKY\n* [Console release was leaked on the PlayStation store](https://www.reddit.com/r/newworldgame/s/e8slNFm81m)\n\n\nWe don't know more than that about when exactly Amazon will present, or what they will announce.  \n\nYou can checkout the sub's theories in this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/newworldgame/comments/1d4fvk2/what_would_you_like_from_the_announcement/\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vpsg8dtk305d1.png?width=688&format=png&auto=webp&s=e22951c6c20c433a4ad7046c8c9a9bff6974941d",

            "6 month wait for that\n\nHAHAHHAH\n\n\nGood night New World.",
            "They gonna make us sit through the whole thing just to tell us it's coming to consoles.",
            "Yeah fuck this game",
            "Dude, they've been hyping this big announcement for 6 months, and all they do is make a 30-minute YouTube video talking to new players like it's a brand-new game. And for us who play every day, they tell us we can now swim, have raids with 3 bosses, and a PvP island. That's it? No roadmap, no nothing. I don't know how these guys still have jobs. It's like they don't care about us at all.",
            "I hope it's more than just console announcements. Because at the moment the game doesn't have a lot of endgame.  \nGetting a PS release would maybe increase player population, IF it's all shared. If the servers are separate, RIP.\n\nI hope for a new expansion.",
            "Welp...",
            "New redditor here!  \nJust to be clear, did they just announce the current game as a new game and put out a dev update showcasing what currently is already in the game? A little bit confused here...",
            "WTB \"HUGE announcement\"",
            "Some evidence-free sophmoric speculation: \n* MSQ expanded with final quest added to take you to Reddit so you can post \"I'm a returning / new player, is the game still with playing?\" to complete your gaming experience\n* New weapon to be added: nunchucks. Because why not, they look cool and based on their inherent animations there is no possible way they can be buggy\n* 1,765 new skins for the store since it's the only part of the game that works consistently \n* Three more seasonal events to be added: Revenge of the Rabbit, A Rabbit Gets Revenge, and Rabbits Revenge 2: Return of the Revenging Rabbit. \n* Musket getting buffed 4,000% because screw you, light melee \n* Night cycle being removed from Morningdale to improve naming accuracy\n* Storage sheds now connect but you have to open their door and crawl between locations to find stuff\n* Captain Thorpe to be prompted to General Thorpe\n* Ellie chest runs reduced to consolidated single chest at entrance to zone with note from mobs saying \"stop bothering us, we like the quiet\"\n\nEdit:\n* It's called New World Aetherum because it's now on in the blockchain"

            "This was remarkable.  They ask for community questions, then proceed to pick/make up question and leave the most frequently asked questions (like OPR map) completely unanswered.  They just doubled down on Aeternum without a hint of how they are going to solve the fundamental issues that caused them to lose their player base in the first place.  \n\n  \nAeternum will be like fresh start servers: a temporary injection of players, followed by the same stale game and massive player exodus.",
            "I am genuinely amazed.\n\nI wasn't angry about the announcement but then I was like surely they will atleast do a season 6 with a small update\n\n\nNo? That's insane? They want to break into the console market and yet they plan on having 0 PC players by the time they do\n\nWhy are you not trying to maintain your PC player base, so that at launch you have PC and console players too\n\nI am so confused this is like the worst way I could ever imagine handling this as a game studio",
            "inb4 dx12 rendering is just a checkbox you untick in your settings because it makes the game's performance even worse like majority of other games with the same thing",
            "AGS the week before Summer Game Fest during their media event: THIS IS A BRAND NEW GAME! COME SEE OUR BRAND NEW GAME! IT IS BRAND NEW!\n\nAGS this week after Summer Game Fest: IT IS THE SAME GAME AS BEFORE, BUT BETTER! IT IS NOT A NEW GAME!\n\nDevs aren't really helping, but holy fuck AGS marketing made it impossible for the studio to come out of this positively. Especially given that apparently this \"major update\" is basically causing them to ignore the live game since the DLC dropped rofl.\n\nEdit: Holy shit finished it and...\"We're glad you asked about the roadmap! There is no roadmap, but here's everything coming on October 15th for the 50th time!\" If I didn't know better I'd think AGS collectively were working to kill NWA before it even launches.",
            "Worst management in gaming history. This is insane.",
            "tl;dr/w: No new content until October, new road map won't be released until after NWA is, and NWA will support DX12. \n\n\n* **Console release**\n  * New World will be released on consoles to reach a wider audience and enhance the overall gameplay experience. The team feels ready to bring this long-desired feature to players.\n\n* **Content for existing PC players**\n  * Existing PC players will receive new content such as a revamped Cutlass Keys zone, a new ten-person raid (3 bosses, \"really really hard\"), enhanced storytelling, and performance improvements starting October 15th.\n\n* **New features and improvements**\n  * The expansion will introduce a new free-for-all zone, cross-world arenas, matchmaking, solo trials, an enhanced dialogue system, and various quality of life and performance enhancements.\n\n* **ARPG elements**\n  * Due to changes in storytelling, combat, and navigation, \"Aeternum\" incorporates ARPG elements while maintaining its MMORPG foundation, especially appealing to console players.\n\n* **Continuation of New World**\n  * \"Aeternum\" is a continuation of New World with significant updates, not a separate game. Players will retain their characters and progress, with an option for a fresh start.\n\n* **Crossplay and cross-progression**\n  * New World will support crossplay between PC and consoles, allowing players to join existing servers and participate in cross-world matchmaking. However, cross-progression is not supported.\n\n* **Future updates**\n  * Post-October 15th, New World will return to a seasonal update cadence, with new content and features regularly added. A 2025 roadmap will be released after the Aeternum launch.\n\n* **Roadmap**\n  * The team highlights upcoming features like a ten-person raid, a new PvP zone, matchmaking, an enhanced Cutlass Keys zone, and swimming. The full 2025 roadmap will be revealed post-launch.\n\n* **Preorder bonus**\n  * Players who log in between June 7th and October 14th will receive the Azoth Stalker Direwolf Mount. However, the mount requires the Rise of the Angry Earth DLC to be used.\n\n* **DirectX 12 and performance**\n  * The game will receive DirectX 12 support, bringing enhanced rendering to PC players. Performance improvements are expected to make the game run better even on minimum specs.\n\n* **Why aren't communications more PC focused given it's the PC audience who has been told to wait for June?**\n  * Our first announcement on June 7th was meant to clearly introduce New World to new players, many of whom had never heard of it. For existing players, we've bundled many questions to provide comprehensive answers in this Q&A.\n\n* **As an existing new world player, what is my experience on October 15th?**\n  * Existing players with the Rise of the Angry Earth DLC will receive all new content. Those with the base game will still benefit from quality of life improvements, ensuring an uninterrupted progression.\n\n* **Why console?**\n  * We have wanted to bring New World to console for a long time because the game plays well on a controller and couch. It's an exciting step to expand the player base.\n\n* **What is being added for existing PC players come October 15th?**\n  * PC players will get new content, including a revamped Cutlass Keys zone, a new ten-person raid, an enhanced entry-level experience, cinematic dialogues, cross-world arenas, matchmaking, solo trials, performance improvements, and quality of life enhancements.\n\n* **Will seasons being going away?**\n  * Seasons will not be going away. The game will continue with a seasonal model, bringing players a regular cadence of new content. The next season will launch with New World: Aeternum on October 15th.\n\n* **Why is New World: Aeternum called an ARPG and not an MMORPG?**\n  * Due to the new storytelling approach, camera, and combat navigation, Aeternum fits into the ARPG genre, which is more recognized on consoles. However, traditional MMORPG elements remain.\n\n* **Is New World: Aeternum a separate game?**\n  * No, Aeternum is a continuation of New World with substantial updates.\n\n* **Is New World closing down and launching as single player?**\n  * No, New World will continue, and players can enjoy both solo and group content within the open world.\n\n* **Will we lose our characters and progress?**\n  * No, existing characters and progress will be retained. Players can also start new characters for Fresh Start Worlds.\n\n* **What will current players get between now and October?**\n  * The focus is on a clean release on October 15th, with the Summer Medleyfaire event and minor patches in the interim.\n\n* **Will PC players who only have the base game and not Rise of the Angry Earth expansion still be able to play after October?**\n  * Yes, base game players will continue to play and receive improvements but won't access some content exclusive to the DLC.\n\n* **Will the release of New World: Aeternum change the minimum and recommended specs of the game?**\n  * No, the minimum and recommended specs will remain the same, and the game might perform better due to optimizations.\n\n* **Will New World: Aeternum bring DirectX 12 to the game?**\n  * Yes, DirectX 12 will be introduced, enhancing rendering for PC players.\n\n* **Will the non-Aeternum version of the game continue to receive new content?**\n  * All players will transition to Aeternum. Base game players will receive updates and improvements but will need the DLC for the full experience.\n\n* **If I don't have the Rise of the Angry Earth expansion, will I still get the preorder bonus?**\n  * Yes, the preorder bonus is entitled upon logging in. However, without the DLC, mounts can't be accessed until the DLC is purchased.\n\n* **Will New World: Aeternum continue to receive regular updates after its release on October 15th?**\n  * Yes, regular updates and seasonal content will continue post-launch.\n\n* **Will New World: Aeternum support cross-progression between PC and consoles?**\n  * No, cross-progression is not supported. Only cross-play is available.\n  * Console players will be able to join existing (originally PC) servers",

They have implied that the Mystic Doubloon Shop and the 3x daily loot from Solo Trials give some of the best items in the game, but no mention of 725.

This would be the easiest way to keep gear from all content relevant without having to add new systems, especially for crafting.\n\nAnother option is that only the Raid drops 725 gear, as a way to make it elite content. Maybe a piece drops for each build type and has things like weapon ability perks on it so that it's not practical to make a full 725 set. The idea being that 700 is still good gear and 725 just adds a bonus.",
