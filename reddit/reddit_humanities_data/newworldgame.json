            "They gonna make us sit through the whole thing just to tell us it's coming to consoles.",
            "Dude, they've been hyping this big announcement for 6 months, and all they do is make a 30-minute YouTube video talking to new players like it's a brand-new game. And for us who play every day, they tell us we can now swim, have raids with 3 bosses, and a PvP island. That's it? No roadmap, no nothing. I don't know how these guys still have jobs. It's like they don't care about us at all.",
            "New redditor here!  \nJust to be clear, did they just announce the current game as a new game and put out a dev update showcasing what currently is already in the game? A little bit confused here...",

They stop because they get to end game and there isn't enough to do.\n\nEither it's a simple cash grab to sell copies before it fades into obscurity or they are so incompetent they think the lack of cut scenes is what was wrong with the game so they're putting resources into that instead of significant end game changes.",
