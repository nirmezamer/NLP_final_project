            "Hello /u/I_can_vouch_for_that. Please be familiar with our rules [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/amiugly/about/rules/)\n\nPlease be aware of rule 1 which is that all posts must include a verification photo otherwise your post will be removed. If this isn't included please delete this post within 2 hours and make a new one. If its more than 2 hours then this post will count towards your 1 post per month. Take a selfie showing you holding a **HANDWRITTEN** (no editing) note / paper with **ALL** 3 of the following:\n\n* **username**\n\n* **today's date**\n\n* **this sub name (amiugly or AIU)**\n\nYour face must be visible in all photos and your hand should be visible holding the sign. It is preferred to have your first photo as your verification photo but not required. Posting without following this rule could lead to a permanent ban.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
