I think 4 is potentially reservoir/filling point for SF6 gas, and that the breaking mechanism is that cylindrical tube part between the V that the bushings form.\nI suspect that's a mechanism box for manual operation at 6.\n8 just looks like the secondary cables connecting the CTs to the mechanism box where I imagine there's terminal strips and that",

I'm from a 3rd world country and wish to work for a foreign company that offers high salary.\n\nI want to work in mining or oil industry abroad from my country, and the nearest English speaking developed country is Australia.\n\nMy college gives 4 area of expertise to choose from, which is:  \n-Power Engineering  \n-Control System  \n-Electronics  \n-Telecommunication\n\nIf I may ask, which of these is the best and most versatile to seek jobs in oil&gas and mining industry? Or is oil and mining industry too different for an electrical engineering perspective that I should choose one of it to focus on?\n\nAnd I'm interested in these industries since it's probably easier to get into than other sectors for people from developing country who want to work abroad. The salary is also high, not to mention 6 figure salary from a developed country will give you a luxurious life in a developing country.\n\n",

        "content": "I want to know how the best leaders in engineering fields got to where they are. To be clear, I'm not talking about leaders in a financial or even purely in terms of success. I'm far more interested in people who moved up and really do what's best for the people under them and who gain the trust and respect of their colleagues. \n\nWhat education helps people move up into roles where they manage, lead or train other engineers? Masters in engineering management? Master in business's administration?  PE license? Minors in any field of study? \n\nHow does one hit the ground running in pursuit of that goal? What gives you a leg up over other candidates? How long does it take to move up the later? How do you hone leadership skills along the way.\n\nI want to know personally because I'm an undergrad electrical and computer engineering student who really likes the idea of becoming a worthy leader. Every place I've ever worked, I made a point of becoming someone who could help teach others and support them. It's something I find extremely rewarding. \n\nSide note - I am not a undergrad with no real work experience. I spent years working as a paramedic both on an ambulance and in the ER. A lot of my soft skills were honed during that time. There was a large portion of that time that I was training emergency techs. My leadership, communication and attention to detail is fairly good in that field. But engineering fields seem quite different.",

Doesn't do shit to build the team, just tries to make all the calls and order everyone around.\u00a0 \u00a0 Another one I thought of is...there is more than one solution to a problem.

Don't shoot down feasible solutions just because they weren't exactly what you would do.\u00a0",

You climb by continuing to improve your craft, taking on more responsibility and scope as your skills develop.
