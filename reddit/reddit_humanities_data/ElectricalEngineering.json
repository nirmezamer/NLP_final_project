        "content": "I want to know how the best leaders in engineering fields got to where they are. To be clear, I'm not talking about leaders in a financial or even purely in terms of success. I'm far more interested in people who moved up and really do what's best for the people under them and who gain the trust and respect of their colleagues. \n\nWhat education helps people move up into roles where they manage, lead or train other engineers? Masters in engineering management? Master in business's administration?  PE license? Minors in any field of study? \n\nHow does one hit the ground running in pursuit of that goal? What gives you a leg up over other candidates? How long does it take to move up the later? How do you hone leadership skills along the way.\n\nI want to know personally because I'm an undergrad electrical and computer engineering student who really likes the idea of becoming a worthy leader. Every place I've ever worked, I made a point of becoming someone who could help teach others and support them. It's something I find extremely rewarding. \n\nSide note - I am not a undergrad with no real work experience. I spent years working as a paramedic both on an ambulance and in the ER. A lot of my soft skills were honed during that time. There was a large portion of that time that I was training emergency techs. My leadership, communication and attention to detail is fairly good in that field. But engineering fields seem quite different.",

            "I think it\u2019s important here to here highlight the distinction between leadership and management. \n\nLeadership is really about being able to motivate and influence people to achieve something. That works both up and down the organisational structure.\n\nManagement is about managing the systems and processes of an organisation. This is primarily what an MBA will give you. As I\u2019m sure many people can have experienced; There are many bosses out there that are exceptional at managing systems, but are horrible to work for.\n\nMy general advice is that the fundamental skills of leadership extend across all domains. Some of those would be:\n* Trust but verify. Trust your team to do their job in a smart manner, but not expect them to be perfect.\n* Be competent at your job. Leadership often comes with accountability. If somebody as screwed up somewhere (which we all do) you want to be able to catch it early.\n* Give people tasks, not directions.\n* Remember that for everything that happens, EVERYONE is responsible (especially you). You may be ultimately accountable, but everyone played a part no matter how small.\n* Talk to people and be a solid person.",

            "Extreme ownership - Jocko Willink\n\nLack of ownership plagues many management teams. Owning the problems and owning the solutions to drive change and ensure success. \n\nEveryone avoids ownership to avoid accountability, because it can cause toxic relationships and conflicts within teams unless you are the final say, or have support from the top dog.\n\nMany C-Suite executives avoid engaging with management and only demand results without understanding the obstacles to achieve them.\n\nHow to avoid all of that? Entrepreneurship. Become the CEO from the get go and build your team.",
            "A good lead is more of an orchestrator, recognizes bottlenecks and identifies potential failure points early, identifies weaknesses in the team and works to improve those.\u00a0 \u00a0 Poor lead is the knowledge hoarder that tries to be the point man for everything. The whole project is limited by what this one guy can do. Doesn't do shit to build the team, just tries to make all the calls and order everyone around.\u00a0 \u00a0 Another one I thought of is...there is more than one solution to a problem. People think differently, just because somebody's solution isn't the same as yours doesn't mean they are wrong. Don't shoot down feasible solutions just because they weren't exactly what you would do.\u00a0",
            "Some may say that a lot of this is management speak but it is stuff to keep in the back of your mind.\n\nIt may sound silly but when I was a boy scout leader I told all of the patrol leaders that they should lead by follow me.  Often times that meant that the patrol leader did the dishes the first night out rather than assigning it to someone else.\n\nAnother way to say it is that nothing encourages subordinates to work hard than to see their boss put in a good days work.\n\nOwn up for your mistakes.  Take the blame for mistakes that your team makes without telling your management that it was particular person below you who was at fault.  Give credit for successes to individual team members as well as the team as a whole.\n\nIf you have someone who is under performing, deal with it privately and promptly.  The goal should be to coach them to improve.\n\nHere is one that most folks don't do that I do.  I tell folks on my teams (individually) that I make mistakes with communications from time to time and ask for them to provide feedback (one on one not in big meetings) when I do.  For example if Sam sees that something I said was offended or hurt Ralph's feelings, I want Sam to tell me at the next opportunity.  I don't expect Sam to tell me how to correct my mistake just to let me know that I goofed up.\n\nDevelop a detailed plan for bigger projects that includes links from one task to the next.  Communicate that plan.  Make sure that folks understand why they have deadlines and how them missing their deadlines are going to delay something that is planned for weeks or months down the road.\n\nAs far as self development ask if you can do some short (intense) management training courses.  One course that I took was at the Center for Creative Leadership, I have no connection with them I just spent a week with them 15 years ago.  The people that were in the class were being groomed by their organizations for C-suite positions.\n\nhttps://www.ccl.org",
            "In my opinion, people managers with no technical skills are practically useless. You climb by continuing to improve your craft, taking on more responsibility and scope as your skills develop. You\u2019ll eventually get to a level where you\u2019re able to tackle complex issues independently and \u2018lead\u2019.

Too many people who get into management are happy to throw team members under the bus when something goes wrong. \n\nLeave the sociopathic tendencies to those at board level, once you reach those dizzy heights being as two faced as possible, at least in the big blue chip companies, seems to be the way to become CEO, but that's a very different world.",

Despite graduating from a good school, having decent grades, and having internship experience of over a year, plus projects and good hard skills. I still do not know what I am doing wrong.

            "I will be blunt - I would put this resume in the 'no' pile because the writing is poor and filled with buzzwords.  Communication skills are an important part of many engineering roles, and this resume tells me that you are not a great communicator.  What does \"Conducted comprehensive technical writing\" even mean?",
            "I am having a hard time reading through this resume. I have hired no less than 100 engineers over the years, and this resume would get tossed before reading past the Sempra Energy work experience. As others have indicated, I don't have a clue what you did for this company. No specifics as to what were the challenges, what you accomplished, what problems you solved, what skills and knowledge you used, etc. Although I doubt that any of your content is BS, it  sure reads like BS to me. How can you \"conduct ... approvals\"? Too many buzz words, lots of fluff, and no meat. Also your punctuation needs considerable work. For example, in your second bullet you say \"Completed, data modeling tasks\". Why is there a comma after \"Completed,\" . In your 3rd bullet, you start a sentence with \"Related to\". That is not a sentence or even a well formed bullet.\n\nOK. now that I have beat up your resume, here is some constructive feedback.\n\n1. Write down clearly and succinctly exactly what you did, focusing on what you accomplished, what skills and tools you used. Don't worry if it gets too long. Pare it down later after rereading it, and solicit some feedback from someone you trust and who is versed in technical terms. Also don't use technical terms or TLAs that are not generally understood in the industry you are pursuing.\n2. Prior to wrapping it up, have someone proficient in English and with some decent writing skills to give it a good formatting and editing review.\n3. I like the idea of \"tailoring the resume\" for a specific job opportunity. However, what is much more effective, if you have the opportunity, is to write a cover letter, matching your skills to the job requirements. I understand that this is not always possible, but if you get the chance, take the time and write a well thought out cover letter. Keep the same concepts in mind when tweaking your resume if you know a bit about the job requirements. Give more detail on elements of your background that you perceive as being important for the role you are applying for - and leave out anything that you perceive as irrelevant.\n\nTrying to land the right job is a full time job and can't be rushed. I see that you achieved a GPA of 3.5, which demonstrates  your ability to apply yourself.  You need to apply the same effort and attention to detail with your job search as you did with your classwork. Keep at it and don't get discouraged. You will get there if you persevere. Good Luck.",
