            "Would it be useful to add a row for whether the app is \u201cnative\u201d or Electron-based? Of course, determining nativeness isn\u2019t always straightforward and can sometimes be controversial. But that\u2019s one of the first things I check for in productivity apps that need to be snappy. We\u2019ve also seen a few high-profile switches to Electron (1Password, Spark) with a major impact on user experience.",
            "Really appreciate this list. Thanks for the work! It\u2019s so unfortunate that there is no browser available that natively supports Apple Keychain etc., but I guess that\u2019s part of Apples security ecosystem.",

            "I wanted to add a couple of useful features for the pdf readers:\n\n\\- support for AI\n\n\\- annotation export formats: rtf, markdown\n\n\\- annotation compliance to the Adobe standard\n\n\\- Scriptability\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you count all the available features: I think Acrobat DC comes on top, followed by PDF Studio. I think you should also remove OCRmyPDF from the list because that one has not a pdf reader. If you add OCRmypdf, you need to add pdftk, cpdf, and many other  libraries.\n\nFor the pdf apps, it might be best to break them into two groups:\n\na) for **reading** (annotation, extraction of annotation): lightweight editing such as adding bookmarks and arranging (rotating) pages; but mostly reading and annotation.\n\n\\-- PdFexpert, pdf reader, preview, pdfgreat, etc\n\nb) editing (**manipulation**): advanced functions: change the internal structure of the pdf= acrobat and PDF studio, pdftk, cpdf etc\n\nThen, focus the comparison on one of the two classes. If you focus on the reading functions only, I think apps such as highlight app, Skim and PDFExpert will come top: because of their flexible annotations tools, speed, and convenience to read.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nON the reading group, I think DEVONthink's pdf reader and Bookends pdf reader could also come out as  good competitors to the stand alone readers.",

(I have multiple personal and work accounts emails to keep track of)\n\n**Ability to Edit any received email:** *Like in Postbox \u2014* It's super helpful to be able to Edit subject lines to include more pertinent info, like for an upcoming event.\n\n**Ability to move an email to a different Account:** *Available in Spark 2, Postbox, Apple Mail, (and missing from Mimestream) \u2014* Sometimes I just want to move an email to the \"correct\" account, as it's much easier and cleaner than forwarding.",

I love typing on my MacBook so one day I downloaded an app from GitHub that would make different sounds of the mechanical keyboards from your laptop's speaker when you type. well, I have low RAM (8 GB) on my Macbook and that app uses the Electron (the desktop framework which is popular for sucking up too much RAM) for the app it also had memory leak issues. \n\nSo one day my developer friend suggested me to join the app that he was building. his app shows the keys/shortcuts that the user presses with very good and cute-looking themes. he was building it for presentations, instructors, and YouTubers to enhance their tutoring experience. he also planned the cursor highlighter feature with different styles.\n\nWhen I joined in I thought it would be great if we just tried to implement the mechanical keyboard sounds feature too! we did add it to the app. It works so well and our app is built using Flutter which doesn't take much RAM on desktop apps. so that problem was solved! \n\nso now we have 10+ different keyboard sounds in the app with many cute/attractive themes for the showing keys/shortcuts and cursor highlighter too.\n\nyou can check out the app here it's available for the macOS and Windows: [https://keystro.app](https://keystro.app)\n\nputting some screenshots here\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fbyju5m2db9d1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=17e09911b4f0b9c66146c7fa575da3f25a86f01e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6vl47b6ydb9d1.png?width=2008&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9a6a5ff17496223c1dc626b5fff22b9ea53f6e1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tyqzdca2eb9d1.png?width=1998&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab7c6c55970fec9851efa23ad1566f2f9bccf47b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j3lv428beb9d1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c51433184c0b32995b2987dd83a1535286dc2c8\n\n",
