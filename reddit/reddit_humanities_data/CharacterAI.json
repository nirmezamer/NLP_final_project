Afaik, almost everyone hates the mods for their unfair treatment of them. And, uh... we don't get very sincere-sounding sorries. Most of us just want frequent updates about what's going on or why these things are happening",
            "Will there be an update about whats going on behind the scenes? With the issues of missing bots among other things, it would be nice to know whats going on.",

I sure hope we got some useful information, hopefully communication about all the issues that you've been ignoring us about for the last month...\n\nOh you're just announcing calls again... I thought you did that already, but no... We needed another announcement of that I guess... Yeah...",
            "I mean, of COURSE i know it's not your choice to make this post... But like seriously, you know HOW MUCH SALT you're pouring into the wound ? Do the people in charge of that even ever LOOKED at the subreddit or anything since they hired Marie while completely lying when promising TRANSPARENCY AND DIALOGUE with the community ?",

It's not because I just hate the bots or anything, but there are still kids on the website (regardless of the age limit ofc)."
