        "content": "#Welcome to /r/selfhosted!\n\nWe thank you for taking the time to check out the subreddit here! \n\n##Self-Hosting\n\nThe concept in which you host your own applications, data, and more. Taking away the \"unknown\" factor in how your data is managed and stored, this provides those with the willingness to learn and the mind to do so to take control of their data without losing the functionality of services they otherwise use frequently. \n\n##Some Examples\n\nFor instance, if you use dropbox, but are not fond of having your most sensitive data stored in a data-storage container that you do not have direct control over, you may consider NextCloud\n\nOr let's say you're used to hosting a blog out of a Blogger platform, but would rather have your own customization and flexibility of controlling your updates? Why not give WordPress a go. \n\nThe possibilities are endless and it all starts here with a server. \n\n##Subreddit Wiki\n\nThere have been varying forms of a wiki to take place. While currently, there is no *officially* hosted wiki, we do have a [github repository](https://github.com/r-selfhosted/wiki). There is also at least one unofficial mirror that showcases the live version of that repo, listed on the index of the [reddit-based wiki](/r/selfhosted/wiki)\n\n##Since You're Here...\n\nWhile you're here, take a moment to get acquainted with our few but important **[rules](/r/selfhosted/wiki/rules)**\n\nWhen posting, please apply an appropriate flair to your post. If an appropriate flair is not found, please let us know! If it suits the sub and doesn't fit in another category, we will get it added! **[Message the Mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fselfhosted)** to get that started.\n\nIf you're brand new to the sub, we highly recommend taking a moment to browse a couple of our awesome self-hosted and system admin tools lists.\n\n[Awesome Self-Hosted App List](https://github.com/Kickball/awesome-selfhosted)\n\n[Awesome Sys-Admin App List](https://github.com/n1trux/awesome-sysadmin)\n\n[Awesome Docker App List](https://github.com/veggiemonk/awesome-docker)\n\nIn any case, lot's to take in, lot's to learn. Don't be disappointed if you don't catch on to any given aspect of self-hosting right away. We're available to help! \n\nAs always, happy (self)hosting!",

The AMA is scheduled for May 29th, 2024! So stay tuned for that. We're looking forward to seeing what they have to offer. \n\nQuick and easy one today, as I do not have a lot more to add. \n\nAs always,\n\nHappy (self)hosting!",

        "content": "Hey-ho, Dawarich 0.7.0 is here!\n\nWell, it's [0.7.1](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases/tag/0.7.1) already, but still.\n\n[Dawarich](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich) is a self-hosted alternative to Google Location History (Google Maps Timeline).\n\nAlmost 3 months passed since the [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1bvoe8a/dawarich_google_location_historygoogle_maps/), announcing the very first public release, 0.2.0 at the moment, and whole bunch of new features were introduced to Dawarich since that moment.\n\nLet's look at them briefly:\n\n* Docker image is now available for both ARM64 and AMD64 architectures\n* Dawarich now can accept your location data from the Overland mobile application\n* The export process was improved and made more robust and convenient\n* More types of imports are now supported:\n   * Google Takeout's Records.json (a huge, bulky file)\n   * Google Takeout's Semantic History Location (a bunch of JSON files split by month)\n   * .GPX files\n* Background jobs concurrency is now tweakable\n* Points from your device now can be sent only with API-key\n* Map changes:\n   * Heatmap\n   * Routes are being split based on time and distance and now are not connected to a single huge mess of lines\n   * Hover over a route will highlight it and show basic data (start-stop time, distance, and duration)\n* User can now (mass) delete their points\n\nAnd now dive into a bit more details.\n\n# API Key\n\nIn the very first release, a user could send his geolocation data using OwnTracks without any kind of authentication. It made it impossible to link points to a specific user, hence statistics calculation was imperfect and any other user, signed up to Dawarich, could see other users' points. Since the introduction of the necessary usage of API key to send geolocation data from mobile apps (both OwnTracks and Overland), this is no longer a problem. Points are being linked to a user and the ones that were created before this change are linked to the very first user in your Dawarich system automatically.\n\n# Imports\n\nRecently, Google announced sunsetting the storage of user location history on their web platform, moving it to user's devices instead. Users can now order a Takeout from their own devices. And looks like this Takeout has a different format from the two they already have (Records.json and Semantic History Location). Unfortunately, I don't have an example of such an export file, but as soon as I have one, I'll work on supporting its import to Dawarich as well. For now, Dawarich supports Google Takeout's Records.json and Semantic History Location, GPX files and OwnTracks export files. More to come.\n\n# Map\n\nI love how the heatmap looks like on Dawarich's map, and how routes started to look a lot better after I introduced rules to split them, but this last change requires a bit more explanation.\n\nIn the first versions, Dawarich rendered one single route that connected all the points on the map. It made the map kind of unreadable (see the screenshot). One of my friends suggested splitting routes based on time and distance between consecutive points. The idea looks like this: points are being connected to form a route on the map, unless the time between one of the points and the other is more than 1 hour. If that's the case, these points are not being connected, and the route ends. The same goes for distance: if the distance between two consecutive points is more than 500 meters, the route ends. These conditions are working on an \"OR\" basis, if one of them is true, the route ends.\n\nThese settings can be changed by a user in the Settings section starting release 0.7.1\n\n[Before route splitting](https://preview.redd.it/bw3y675t9x7d1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=0aeaa8ee6d33f0ce17556491265de7213b20fdd6)\n\n[After route splitting](https://preview.redd.it/ewwfc981ax7d1.png?width=3434&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ec0497afd81362c7a625a994e40a99270e5b4bb)\n\n# More to come\n\nThe development of Dawarich doesn't stop. I have plenty ideas, most interesting (in my opinion) are:\n\n* \"Fog of War\" mode (if you know, you know)\n* API to read points, import data, and so on\n* Notification system to make events happening under the hood more transparent for the user\n* Update statistics to render more information\n* Monthly/yearly digests of your data and insights\n\nThe list is not exhaustive, more you can see at the [development board](https://github.com/users/Freika/projects/3) or suggest in the [discussions section](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/discussions) or right here in the comments under this post.\n\nAny questions, ideas, and contributions are most welcome!\n\n  \nP.S.
