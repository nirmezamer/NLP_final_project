        "content": "Welcome to the /r/NewTubers weekly Feedback Friday post!  Here, you can link to your videos to get advice and feedback, and give other YouTubers feedback on their work!  Please be sure to read the thread rules and follow them so your post is not removed.\n\n## Rules\n\n1. You **MUST give meaningful feedback on at least TWO (2) other posts in the thread BEFORE you post**, or if you are the *first or second* commenter you must post your two feedback comments within ONE (1) hour. Any violations will be treated as Hit and Runs and removed without notice.\n2. The thread is kept on Contest Mode to ensure you always have an equal opportunity to be viewed!\n3. If a Moderator sees that you have not given any feedback, your post will be removed.\n4. If you post feedback on somebody's YouTube page directly, leave a comment in this thread telling him/her that you did so.  This way, a Moderator does not mistakenly assume you didn't give feedback.  Do keep in mind that many users may not like getting Feedback on their YouTube page, because it may look bad to their audience.\n5. Saying \"it's good\" doesn't cut it.  WHY is it good?  What can they improve upon?  This thread is so that users can improve the quality of their content, not just a place to fish for views.\n\nWhile it's not an official rule, it's encouraged that you give feedback first to users who haven't received any yet.  Keep in mind that the more feedback you give, the more likely you are to get more feedback yourself!\n\nAnd don't forget to check out our creator-focused website, [Fetch](http://www.veryfetch.net) for tutorials, and [Fetch Quest](http://quest.veryfetch.net) to join the NewTubers team.",

If you do comment keep it civil. Keep it simple like \"thanks for the feedback\" or \"that is an interesting perspective.\". If you think it is someone challenging the concept and wants to challenge you in a more academic discourse, then by all means respond in a way that would be similar to a debate and address the points clearly."
