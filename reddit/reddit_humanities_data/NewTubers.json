        "content": "Welcome to the /r/NewTubers weekly Feedback Friday post!  Here, you can link to your videos to get advice and feedback, and give other YouTubers feedback on their work!  Please be sure to read the thread rules and follow them so your post is not removed.\n\n## Rules\n\n1. You **MUST give meaningful feedback on at least TWO (2) other posts in the thread BEFORE you post**, or if you are the *first or second* commenter you must post your two feedback comments within ONE (1) hour. Any violations will be treated as Hit and Runs and removed without notice.\n2. The thread is kept on Contest Mode to ensure you always have an equal opportunity to be viewed!\n3. If a Moderator sees that you have not given any feedback, your post will be removed.\n4. If you post feedback on somebody's YouTube page directly, leave a comment in this thread telling him/her that you did so.  This way, a Moderator does not mistakenly assume you didn't give feedback.  Do keep in mind that many users may not like getting Feedback on their YouTube page, because it may look bad to their audience.\n5. Saying \"it's good\" doesn't cut it.  WHY is it good?  What can they improve upon?  This thread is so that users can improve the quality of their content, not just a place to fish for views.\n\nWhile it's not an official rule, it's encouraged that you give feedback first to users who haven't received any yet.  Keep in mind that the more feedback you give, the more likely you are to get more feedback yourself!\n\nAnd don't forget to check out our creator-focused website, [Fetch](http://www.veryfetch.net) for tutorials, and [Fetch Quest](http://quest.veryfetch.net) to join the NewTubers team.",

I also enjoyed some of the tips but the voiceover I think could sound a bit more natural and relaxed as I think a more natural tone would work well with the jokes you have.",

Having 16:9 video in vertical phone format with most of the screen either black or text that doesn't change drives me a litle nuts, personally.  But I'm not a TikTok user so maybe I'm out of touch...",
            "Honestly this just isn't the type of video to get views unless it's a big name musician or famous song maybe? There's no hook or anything to really keep me engaged. The music and production is great, sure, but I am not surprised by your views. Disclaimer that I am not really into the music niche so I could be wrong, but I do enjoy music and it was just \"okay\".\n\nI think for your next phase go back to the idea phase. And Youtube might just not be the platform for you in regards to ROI",

If it is real, I think hearing you give it commands and having the chicken listen would be cool. If it\u2019s satire, it\u2019s good as is.",

        "content": "Am I the only one, or does anybody else also hate the fact that we live in a world where everything has to happen instantly? Nobody has the time to check anything out. Companies and employers don't have the time to screen or interview their employees; they're looking for new magic psychology solutions to be able to look for perfect candidates for their jobs without putting in the time and effort it takes and a human deserves to have their potential realized. Everything has to be boiled down into a couple numbers and patterns. Everyone had to be judged in 10 seconds or less. First impressions are everything. Nobody gives one second more of a damn.\n\nTiktok is the worst offender when it comes to training people to get used to the idea of spending less than 5 seconds to judge someone's work or talent, just like the employer thing I mentioned above. Nobody has the time to check something out and be a little patient. Is it because of overpopulation or are we as a human race devolving from social to anti-social and digital and data-addicted? I just don't like the idea that people's hard work gets judged in 5 seconds or less and its swipe away or watch, only to be forgotten in less than a minute.\n\nI feel like this behavior with shorts also seeps into people's behavior while watching long-form content. Many viewers of my videos tune out in less than 8 seconds of the video. I mean, what gives? In less than 8 seconds, one can tell a video is not for them? Did they not read the video title and thumbnail? And this is no vague title or clickbait situation. People just don't seem to have the patience to watch even long-form content anymore because their brains have got the Tiktok rot.\n\nI say, shorts are like farts. They happen so quick, and they're gone. Nobody remembers them. Long-form content on Youtube makes impacts. You remember the content-creator. You remember the video, its scenes and its words, because they are memorable. But when it comes to shorts, they just fade in less than a minute. One minute is absolutely not enough time to make a point or jokes or a review, yet I see people wasting their time trying to make the next hit short that summarizes a whole 2-hour-movie into another 1-minute fart.\n\nThat joke in Rick and Morty with the alternate reality TV crime show, where they rush through the whole crime episode in less than 10 seconds seems more and more close to reality these days. Am I getting too old?\n\nAm I the only one, who, every time I see someone mention shorts, immediately tunes out? As in \"this is completely irrelevant to me\" sort of situation. I'm working on my long-form gaming content, and have only tried out a couple shorts, just to experiment with the system, but never felt like I should ever waste time making shorts a part of my channel and have since deleted them. My logic is: people who like farts (shorts content) never have the patience to watch long-form and people who like long-form don't like farts. What do you guys think?\n\nI just wish more people would abandon the chase of short-form content realizing nobody knows you when you make shorts, as in people will never remember who you are, who the creator of the short was, what they're like, or even what they sound or look like, because it's all just 1 minute content at longest pulled out of a content machine that churns out random content after content that you have to literally gamble for (Look up the gambling aspect of tiktok videos, you'll know what I mean). It's equivalent to a quick fart. Long-form content is what keeps people coming back to the content-creator for more content in the future. It's what gets people to go to their Patreon page and donate money.\n\nI know a lot of people have already skipped past this post, cuz its \"ToO lOnG!\" but it's their loss, because we're having a serious discussion on attention-span and content here. Let me know what you guys think.",

So why should they watch your video in the first place, if they don\u2019t like it? \n\nI really, really don\u2019t like shorts. But I do think it\u2019s wrong to blame the audience for watching what they like. If you can\u2019t offer them what they like, it\u2019s a you problem. Not a they problem.

Despite offering quick growth, you just don\u2019t get that kind of loyalty or retention through shorts. I\u2019m holding out on shorts as long as I can because I don\u2019t want a \u201cfast food\u201d audience lol.",
            "I totally agree with you, but we see it on this Reddit, all the people who have posted one or two shorts usually of content they stole, all complaining they have been shadow-banned. People expect instant success, and if they don\u2019t get it, it\u2019s our fault not theirs.\n\nOh and I liked your fart analogy, but you left out the most import part about them, they stink!"

            "For me was patience . Has been years with my channel. Patience and dedication. I was not lucky to be one of those people who publish a video and get hundres of subs with it incouple of days. As I said I do this as a hobby, I do not study all my analytics, or do more videos of the same type of the ones that gets more views. I do the ones I fancy . My most viewed videos were tutorials and some tech demos, but I dis not want to make youtube an obligation. I have my well paid job (which I know im.happy to have) so I do not force myself with specific content or schedules  because I do not wamt to risk feeling this is a job and loosing the passion for it. \nMy advice will be do what you want and how you want it if you like doing it . If you just want numbers and quick growth there are many better advisors there. But I believe if you do it not how you want it and doing it how it makes you feel fun, people will realise and it wonth be worth it. At the end the fatigue will come (as come with me and everyone eventually) and I can stop some days because is how I do it.. but if you do it as a job creating content just for numbers the fatigue will get worst and can end in the total stop of your channel. But if you like what you do the fatigue last for some days and then as you love the content you do its 0 effort to go back with full energy after 2 / 3 days of rest.\n\nAnd dont ask.people for follow back . Join communities, have friends, but dont start.. hello. My name is xxx and I have a youtube channel.. oh I also like games. Start, Hi Im xxx and I love gaming. Dont mention your channel, when you have some friends in the community you can mention to.your new friends. Imagine if you are in a pub and you see people talking about games and you jump inside. IVE HEARD YOU TALKING ABOUT MINECRAFT.. I HAVE A MINECRAFT CHANNEL.YOU KNOW? They wont be bothered and thats it.. If you start IVE HEARD YOU TALKING ABOUT MINECRAFT..I LOVE MINECRAFT TOO, HAVE YOU TRIED THE LAST UPDATE? People will fund you interesting and then eventually they will know about your channel\n\nFor me is better to grow slow and solid than quick with the wrong base and wrong motivation"
