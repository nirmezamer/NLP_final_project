        "content": "Hey folks. Mort here with what is going to be the nerdiest game design post you\u2019ll see in a while, but I wanted to share it with you. Generally in all aspects of life, even if you\u2019re confident in something, it\u2019s helpful to double check your biases and make sure you\u2019re actually correct or not. So that\u2019s what I did.\n\nWe\u2019ve all seen posts where a player rolls down 50 gold and doesn\u2019t see the uncontested unit they\u2019re looking for, heck you may have even been on that end yourself (sorry, but wait for the punchline). Sometimes, this experience can be so stark that you\u2019re concerned with the reliability of the system. Could this be bugged? I can\u2019t really be that unlucky\u2014is something wrong with the game? Now, my initial reaction is that this is a common thing called \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d where a recent experience is being weighted more heavily. This, in conjunction with negativity bias, where negative experiences are seen to have a higher impact, become the fuel for many \u201cMortdogged\u201d experiences. But even with knowledge of these biases, is everything fine? I mean, TFT has had its share of bugs, so let\u2019s take a deep dive in the design space to make sure everything works as it should.\n\nFor this experiment, I focused on 4 costs. We pulled out 6 copies of nine of the Four Costs (these are our contested units), and left the other three Four costs as our uncontested units, with all 10 copies in the pool. At this point, this means there are 4 copies of the contested units (36 contested units total) and 10 copies of our three uncontested units (30 uncontested units total). If we do a large extensive roll down, we should see uncontested champions (30/66) 45% of the time approximately.\n\nWe ran this experiment for the first time, with Ornn, Ashe, and Kaisa as the three uncontested units (lol, Ornn is uncontested, right?), and here are the results.\n\n* Ornn: 136\n* Ashe: 168\n* Kaisa: 120\n* Lillia: 58\n* Morgana: 52\n* Kayn: 58\n* Lee Sin: 61\n* Syndra: 38\n* Nautilus: 53\n* Galio: 61\n* Annie: 50\n* Sylas: 46\n\nThe total 4 costs seen was 901, and the uncontested ones made up 424. This is (424/901) 47% of the time, which is within expected variance for something of this sample size, and matches our expectations. Good news. But of course, one time isn\u2019t enough, so let\u2019s run the experiment two more times.\u00a0\n\n* Ornn: 154\n* Ashe: 141\n* Kaisa: 178\n* Lillia: 57\n* Morgana: 72\n* Kayn: 48\n* Lee Sin: 53\n* Syndra: 57\n* Nautilus: 52\n* Galio: 62\n* Annie: 52\n* Sylas: 41\n* Total: 473/967 = 48.9%\n\nAnd again\n\n* Ornn: 150\n* Ashe: 140\n* Kaisa: 152\n* Lillia: 63\n* Morgana: 58\n* Kayn: 55\n* Lee Sin: 48\n* Syndra: 54\n* Nautilus: 47\n* Galio: 60\n* Annie: 64\n* Sylas: 55\n* Total: 442/946= 46.7%\n\nSo yeah, generally we\u2019re seeing the results we\u2019d expect with a sample size this big. It\u2019s not EXACTLY 45%, but the law of large numbers shows that this is expected, and if we dramatically increased the sample size, we would likely converge to that expected 45%. From a purely mathematical standpoint, it seems like our shop is working as expected. Huzzah!\n\nSo all is good right, and there\u2019s nothing to be done\u2026right? Well\u2026no actually. Just because it is mathematically correct does NOT mean the design is perfect. If you\u2019ve ever watched my stream, I\u2019ve talked about how good design doesn\u2019t just let RNG take the wheel, and designs around the core player experience. In this case, the player is not rolling down 1000 times and letting the law of large numbers do its job\u2026instead, it\u2019s rolling down 60 gold and expected results that are intuitive, which is that uncontested units show up more.\n\nLet\u2019s repeat the experiment, but instead of 1000 rolls, let\u2019s only do 40 and see what happens. Same thing, with Ornn/Ashe/Kaisa as our uncontested units, and see what happens.\n\n* Ornn: 8\n* Ashe: 6\n* Kaisa: 1\n* Lillia: 6\n* Morgana: 0\n* Kayn: 1\n* Lee Sin: 6\n* Syndra: 2\n* Nautilus: 4\n* Galio: 4\n* Annie: 0\n* Sylas: 2\n* Total: 15/40 = 37.5%\n\nBecause the sample size is so low, the variance expands pretty dramatically. Much like if you flip a coin 10 times and hit heads 7 times, 70% is way higher than 50%, but the reality is when the sample size is lower, the variance is higher. Again, this all lines up from a mathematical sense\u2026but from a game design standpoint it\u2019s pretty rough. Kai\u2019Sa is uncontested here and is seen one time, while Lee Sin has 6 copies out of the pool, and is seen 6 times! These are the experiences people have that feel off, and make them not trust the game.\n\nNintendo games do a lot of fudging behind the scenes I\u2019ve talked about before, to try to make expected outcomes more likely to happen. Famously one of the most basic versions of this is in Fire Emblem, where they double roll odds, so if something says 75%, it\u2019s actually 87.5% so it FEELS more like 75% to people (A 95% chance in Fire Emblem is much closer to 99%!) Based on this, I think there are improvements we can and should make here, so the game behaves closer to what you would EXPECT it to, even if it is within acceptable outcomes.\n\nPersonally, this was awesome for me to confirm and was a good use of time yesterday. I like constantly challenging our game design to see if we can do better, and I think this confirms we can. It won\u2019t be easy, it won\u2019t be overnight, and it may not even be soon\u2026but I think it is worth exploring, and I think we\u2019ll start doing that as soon as possible.\u00a0\n\nThanks for reading all. Hope your roll downs are within expected variance, and take it easy :)\n\n",
