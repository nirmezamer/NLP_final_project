        "content": "Hey folks. Mort here with what is going to be the nerdiest game design post you\u2019ll see in a while, but I wanted to share it with you. Generally in all aspects of life, even if you\u2019re confident in something, it\u2019s helpful to double check your biases and make sure you\u2019re actually correct or not. So that\u2019s what I did.\n\nWe\u2019ve all seen posts where a player rolls down 50 gold and doesn\u2019t see the uncontested unit they\u2019re looking for, heck you may have even been on that end yourself (sorry, but wait for the punchline). Sometimes, this experience can be so stark that you\u2019re concerned with the reliability of the system. Could this be bugged? I can\u2019t really be that unlucky\u2014is something wrong with the game? Now, my initial reaction is that this is a common thing called \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d where a recent experience is being weighted more heavily. This, in conjunction with negativity bias, where negative experiences are seen to have a higher impact, become the fuel for many \u201cMortdogged\u201d experiences. But even with knowledge of these biases, is everything fine? I mean, TFT has had its share of bugs, so let\u2019s take a deep dive in the design space to make sure everything works as it should.\n\nFor this experiment, I focused on 4 costs. We pulled out 6 copies of nine of the Four Costs (these are our contested units), and left the other three Four costs as our uncontested units, with all 10 copies in the pool. At this point, this means there are 4 copies of the contested units (36 contested units total) and 10 copies of our three uncontested units (30 uncontested units total). If we do a large extensive roll down, we should see uncontested champions (30/66) 45% of the time approximately.\n\nWe ran this experiment for the first time, with Ornn, Ashe, and Kaisa as the three uncontested units (lol, Ornn is uncontested, right?), and here are the results.\n\n* Ornn: 136\n* Ashe: 168\n* Kaisa: 120\n* Lillia: 58\n* Morgana: 52\n* Kayn: 58\n* Lee Sin: 61\n* Syndra: 38\n* Nautilus: 53\n* Galio: 61\n* Annie: 50\n* Sylas: 46\n\nThe total 4 costs seen was 901, and the uncontested ones made up 424. This is (424/901) 47% of the time, which is within expected variance for something of this sample size, and matches our expectations. Good news. But of course, one time isn\u2019t enough, so let\u2019s run the experiment two more times.\u00a0\n\n* Ornn: 154\n* Ashe: 141\n* Kaisa: 178\n* Lillia: 57\n* Morgana: 72\n* Kayn: 48\n* Lee Sin: 53\n* Syndra: 57\n* Nautilus: 52\n* Galio: 62\n* Annie: 52\n* Sylas: 41\n* Total: 473/967 = 48.9%\n\nAnd again\n\n* Ornn: 150\n* Ashe: 140\n* Kaisa: 152\n* Lillia: 63\n* Morgana: 58\n* Kayn: 55\n* Lee Sin: 48\n* Syndra: 54\n* Nautilus: 47\n* Galio: 60\n* Annie: 64\n* Sylas: 55\n* Total: 442/946= 46.7%\n\nSo yeah, generally we\u2019re seeing the results we\u2019d expect with a sample size this big. It\u2019s not EXACTLY 45%, but the law of large numbers shows that this is expected, and if we dramatically increased the sample size, we would likely converge to that expected 45%. From a purely mathematical standpoint, it seems like our shop is working as expected. Huzzah!\n\nSo all is good right, and there\u2019s nothing to be done\u2026right? Well\u2026no actually. Just because it is mathematically correct does NOT mean the design is perfect. If you\u2019ve ever watched my stream, I\u2019ve talked about how good design doesn\u2019t just let RNG take the wheel, and designs around the core player experience. In this case, the player is not rolling down 1000 times and letting the law of large numbers do its job\u2026instead, it\u2019s rolling down 60 gold and expected results that are intuitive, which is that uncontested units show up more.\n\nLet\u2019s repeat the experiment, but instead of 1000 rolls, let\u2019s only do 40 and see what happens. Same thing, with Ornn/Ashe/Kaisa as our uncontested units, and see what happens.\n\n* Ornn: 8\n* Ashe: 6\n* Kaisa: 1\n* Lillia: 6\n* Morgana: 0\n* Kayn: 1\n* Lee Sin: 6\n* Syndra: 2\n* Nautilus: 4\n* Galio: 4\n* Annie: 0\n* Sylas: 2\n* Total: 15/40 = 37.5%\n\nBecause the sample size is so low, the variance expands pretty dramatically. Much like if you flip a coin 10 times and hit heads 7 times, 70% is way higher than 50%, but the reality is when the sample size is lower, the variance is higher. Again, this all lines up from a mathematical sense\u2026but from a game design standpoint it\u2019s pretty rough. Kai\u2019Sa is uncontested here and is seen one time, while Lee Sin has 6 copies out of the pool, and is seen 6 times! These are the experiences people have that feel off, and make them not trust the game.\n\nNintendo games do a lot of fudging behind the scenes I\u2019ve talked about before, to try to make expected outcomes more likely to happen. Famously one of the most basic versions of this is in Fire Emblem, where they double roll odds, so if something says 75%, it\u2019s actually 87.5% so it FEELS more like 75% to people (A 95% chance in Fire Emblem is much closer to 99%!) Based on this, I think there are improvements we can and should make here, so the game behaves closer to what you would EXPECT it to, even if it is within acceptable outcomes.\n\nPersonally, this was awesome for me to confirm and was a good use of time yesterday. I like constantly challenging our game design to see if we can do better, and I think this confirms we can. It won\u2019t be easy, it won\u2019t be overnight, and it may not even be soon\u2026but I think it is worth exploring, and I think we\u2019ll start doing that as soon as possible.\u00a0\n\nThanks for reading all. Hope your roll downs are within expected variance, and take it easy :)\n\n",

            "Wait...Fire Emblem has been lying to me since 2003? What can I even trust anymore???\n\n\nThanks for looking into this some more and doing a more in-game representative rolldown to see just how silly it can be sometimes!",
            "There is a simple fix to this. Give me all of the units that I want, and don't give me the ones that I don't want.",

            "Great post! I've had several discussions in this sub with people claiming It was bugged and I explaining them It was probably just confirmation bias. So I'm glad I can take a victory lap now lol.",

            "As a fcking nerd, I really like this nerd post",
            "I don't know if it was Spotify or some other music platform.\n\nIf you play your playlist with hundreds of songs it sometimes happens that the same artist comes 2 times in a row, or even 3 times.\n\nSo they changed the \"true randomizer\" and made it less random because people complaint it was not really random. \n\nIt was but true random doesn't \"feel\" random to people.\n\nBut that's exactly what random is. Sometimes you roll the dice and get 6 three times in a row which feels so good and lucky. Then you hit 2 three times followed by a 1 and you think the fucking dice is rigged.\n\nHumans are biased"

I have the KDA Kai'sa Skin plus a few other mythics including Lee Sin and arenas.   \n  \nI would at the very least spend 200\u20ac if not more of my disposable income a month on TFT because I felt I got something even if it was really not that worth it. The old system disallowed duplicates and rolls felt like they gave you something even if it was lowkey trash, the revolving shop sounds nice but really I feel like I get less bang for my bucks with this system even if it might be around the same in theory.  I do really miss the feeling of opening up a cache to get something whacky or unknown.\n\nPretty much all of my recent rolls of the new system have been duplicate realm crystals and it feels very discouraging to me to keep spending on it. I will not resume spending money on TFT and am happy to just use the free currency to roll occasionally. \n\nHow do other people feel about it?

This comes at the cost of getting less unique rewards from pulls and the realm crystals overall making every little legend require more pulls if you need to buy them instead of pulling. Overall it's more expensive to get them all now but it is easier to get a single specific one.",
            "I would take 100 crystals instead of random useless legend which iam never gonna use. At least crystals will be used for chibi legend",

            "... I'm a TFT whale and I didn't even realize the new system even gave out tacticians anymore, thought it was just a crystal dispenser. And I've already put in a couple hundred to get the poro fluft. Wack. Is that what determines the variance in crystals?\n\nThe reason I've put so much in is from rolling for specific things. In beta, I ended up with all the little legends just trying to get the sugarcone furyhorn at 3*, and same thing for pretty much one in every set since until the pink shards. I'm not a fan of chibis, but keep falling in love with these random legendaries and specific boards. I much prefer being able to buy certain ones from the shop. If I can ever get the Chinese new year board with the poro audience, my whaling can finally stop.",

            "Is it the second time I see this same post?",
            "I enjoy having more agency in the process of choosing rewards. \n\nPersonally I really disliked having only 2 or 3 mythic treasure realm options available at once for long periods of time.\n\nIn regards to wether people get more bang for buck, i got fluft of poros without spending any extra money because of the pengu pass tokens.  And now have 8 mythic tokens again after spending only like $30 nzd and the free tokens. This seems way better than before, but now that I have very limited tokens without buying them (only battle pass left but still deciding whether to buy) the remaining 2 medalions would cost me like $90ish dollars if I only got garenteed medallions. This still seems quite expensive, but more on par with league hextech crafting gems before they made it a dust.\n\nBut also I may have gotten very lucky since i pulled the x4 medallions reward 2 times. And dont know if this is likely since I havent looked at the rewards table yet."
