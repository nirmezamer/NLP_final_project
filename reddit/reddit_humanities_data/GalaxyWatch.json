            "Congratulations! I also use the 44mm GW5 since more than a year. I would suggest you to uninstall all bloatware you don't use such as bixby or samsung pay for example. This should improve the battery a bit like it did on my watch. You can also uninstall the pre-loaded watchfaces to save some memory (GW5 has only 16GB internal storage). Also, turn on force AOD burn-in protection which isn't on at default to protect the display from burn-in/image retention. Turn off all unnecesarry notifications to not get disturbed and save battery.",
