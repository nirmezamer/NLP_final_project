            "My 5 Pro came in the same day as my Rugged Armor. Took it out of the box, took the strap off, and placed it directly in that bad boy. It has never left. Accessories like this are, in my opinion, one of the main reasons to go with a Galaxy watch. \n\nI've been rocking the Oneplus Watch 2 lately and it's great, for the most part. Stainless steel and sapphire build, but nobody makes cases for it. I like to have a protective bezel around keeping my screen safe. This case will serve you well.",

            "From my understanding, if your HR is over 100 it will say inconclusive no matter what. Why it works that way I have zero idea. But read in the app it says inconclusive is literally defined as either atrial or sinus which is what you want. It's just for some reason if its over 100 it won't specify. Maybe someone else knows why they decided to make it work like that.",
            "Not a doctor, but at a glance, it looks fine to me.  Probably due to the HR being over 100 it just won't say for sure if there are any issues.\n\nIf you feel fine, I am sure it is nothing to worry about.",
            "If your HR is always over 100, yes. If it's not, ignore the ECG app and only use it if you feel bad. You'll drive yourself nuts if you keep doing it over and over again.",

            "Last year, I noticed my resting heart rate had gone up from high 40s to low 50s - about a 10% jump in just a month or two. So I went to my doc, she ordered some tests, long story short, I had a triple bypass just over a month ago. \n\nSo I'm glad I went to my doc. Wouldn't you feel silly if you had a heart attack, and the doc said \"If only you'd come in sooner?\". Because my surgery wasn't urgent and thus completely planned, it went very smoothly, and I am recovering quite nicely. It might be different if I'd actually had a heart attack, and they'd had to scramble in the ER. Better safe than sorry, my friend!",
            "Do you really routinely have a resting HR over 100bpm (assuming you are an adult)?",
            "This is like perfect sinus rhythm. Slight tachycardia but I'm assuming u were just doing something or had anxiety. Unless you have a history of coronary artery disease this is completely fine."
