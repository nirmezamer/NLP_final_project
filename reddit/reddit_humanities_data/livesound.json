            "Hey folks,\n\nI have a musical show coming up with a LCR speaker setup (+ front fill and subs), but unfortunately the SQ doesn't support LCR mixing. Is there any usable way to drive the system apart from summing L+R together for the centre feed? Would a separate centre aux and dropping the centre speaker -3dB be a feasible option?\n\nThanks a lot!",

            "Digital mixers vs DAWs. In a DAW if I boost the master fader and clip the 2 bus it\u2019s real clipping. However, on a digital mixer if I push the master fader, what happens? I assume if I\u2019m not clipping the internal digital 2 bus I\u2019m fine. The master fader then changes the output gain - real electricity changing in the analog realm. Said another way, all channel faders are changing things digitally but once a fader is assigned to a physical output such as an aux or 2 bus, that fader is actually changing  voltage. Ruru Am I thinking about this correctly? Or does the master fader effect the digital \u201cgain\u201d of the 2 bus too? so then I wonder about within the board. If I boost a channel fader can I ever really clip inside the mixer considering it\u2019s likely floating point?",

Had a DJ-gig this weekend and even though I soundchecked I had some trouble finding good levels with my speakers. The pubowner said to me to switch up the volume so I did. I got on a good volume level but then noticed that my sub was limiting in some songs. I therefore lowered the volume on the low frequencies and kept going. Also my tops were sometimes blinking \"limit\". Is this a problem? Should I be able to play without limiting them or is just part of a regular night? I did not redlimit songs on my mixer. \n\n  \nMy set up is currently 2 x EV ZLX 12P, 1 x EV EKX-18SP and I'm planning on getting another EKX-18SP. \n\nThanks!",

I am looking at a Shure SLXD24 w/ a SM58 wireless mic (which would only be used as a talkback mic in both bands) for $700 on Sweetwater. Is this a good transmitter for the price? I\u2019m not sure I can convince everyone to drop the cash for the more expensive models at the moment. \n\n2.
