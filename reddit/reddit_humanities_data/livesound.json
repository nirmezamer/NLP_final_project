You space the arrays and angle them according to the prediction software\u2019s calculations as to not overlap frequencies between hangs, causing cancelation and phasing. EAW somewhat-solves this using what\u2019s called an adaptive array. The array boxes are shaped and built at the angle of dispersion. Therefore allowing them to be mounted side by side and not interfere with each other. They\u2019re called Anna and Anya. They\u2019re actually pretty cool little boxes, especially for a center scoreboard hang, etc. creates 360 degree coverage with next to no box interferences.",
            "I also always wonder why people don't bring up the distance between main L and main R when having this conversation.",
            "This is not how it works. The stated horizontal dispersion angle only exists only at high-ish frequencies where the horn is effective. In the mids, the dispersion pattern is dictated by the width of the box and it gets close to omnidirectional at low mids. With multiple spaced line arrays you'll get an interference pattern in the low mids like you get with AB subs.\n\nAnna and Anya are no different in this regard. Their unique (not really) feature is vertical beam steering which somewhat replaces the need to splay the boxes in the array, but this has nothing to do with the horizontal dispersion which is what matters in a multi array setup. The horizontal dispersion is still determined by the horn design. The fact that there is no curvature allows you to place the arrays closer together which means that you can make them couple to a higher frequency. Ideally the two arrays would perfectly couple up to the frequency where the horn takes over and there is a minimal overlap. In practice ... it isn't as perfect.",

Whereas outfill / side hang / what have you is relegated to medium and large scale events so a lot of us are not as familiar or comfortable with them. But if you can wipe your mind of the \"names\" or the \"roles\" that we assign them, physically and acoustically we realize we tolerate a lot more from L/R (highly overlapped, highly displaced) than we do with our fill systems.",

Toole did demonstrate that the angular displacement between the sources does lessen the perceived annoyance of the combing, so that's definitely part of the equation.
