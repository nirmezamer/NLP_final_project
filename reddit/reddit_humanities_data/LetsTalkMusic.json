You do you though.\n\nI listened to the Been Stellar album this morning and I\u2019m not really feeling it to be honest. It feels like the early 00s downtown NYC rock scene run through OpenAI and spat back out. Like, it sounds like what it is, I guess that means something to people wishing for the return of the Strokes or something.",

            "Classic music fanatic budgeting: in 2001, I was unemployed, sleeping on a mattress on the floor, and living on $7 worth of food a day but I still bought a ticket to see Nobukazu Takemura opening for Tortoise. His live show was deep in the *Child And Magic* era, lots of music box-like naive melodies and glitchy sound design. I definitely don\u2019t regret spending three days of food on seeing this show.",

            "[Been Stellar - Start Again](https://open.spotify.com/track/2xFVZhECTTxesryJ2KzbzA) (2024) Indie Rock: I can't point out the exact band I'd namedrop to reference the kind of sound I'm hearing from the full album, but I appreciate it nonetheless. This track in particular, I appreciate the throwback, the classic indie rock sound, it's arresting and tasteful.\n\n[Crywolf - Gold](https://open.spotify.com/track/7hvMubP82IPoG1gPJbUpBl) (2024) Alt. Pop: Vocoder be damned, but Crywolf is always in his best form when he does really melodic ambient pop/r&B track list this. The lyrics are more pronounced and the vibe overall is something I can rely on during many rainy days as of lately. And of course, that falsetto.\n\n[Demersal - Lys I Natten](https://open.spotify.com/track/6i28Tw6km9TGsHyrij2Z5u) (2024) Screamo: We need more trumpets in extreme music, I swear it just elevates everything in the right moment, a fitting bedfellow. Very orgasmic and triumphant.\n\n[Gordan - \u0160ara](https://open.spotify.com/track/0eyCNSDqATwmRJHoUHMQeu) (2024) Drone Folk: Music to score the birth of the new tyrant overlord rising from the ashes to.\n\n[Kelela - All The Way Down](https://open.spotify.com/track/3GZpSLgW7eaPzbJUFD7jfL) (2015) R&B: Exploring the terrain of her sonic through this sultry beauty of a track jumpstarted my love for her music. And she\u2019s never been more consistent after.\n\n[Dear & The Headlights - Run In The Front](https://open.spotify.com/track/2V31IOkSrk2OvrEwcUbATP) (2007) Midwest Emo: There were times when I could just not stop listening to this, it's just the perfect break up song at the time as it was very cathartic especially during the 'I'll be missing you, I'm missing you, I don't want to. But I will' part. Nowadays there's no more residual pain attached to the song, so I can enjoy it more freely.\n\n[Moby - Porcelain](https://open.spotify.com/track/6EXi6ZqTITKGtVBKqbphjL) (1999) Downtempo: Been on a fix for some iconic electronic tracks from my childhood, something along the lines of this and Fatboy Slim's 'You're Not From Brighton'. Something evocative.\n\n[Pixies - La La Love You](https://open.spotify.com/track/6x0cOqPP07gTXusQfK9COQ) (1989) Alt. Rock: Everytime David croons 'yeah' after every whistle, the album score increases by half a point. Easily my favorite and most played track on Doolittles.",
            "**Nobukazu Takemura** - [10th](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lWwyUHsJ6eGWSFoxUwxzQP3fw2ukjm8t0)/[Songbook](https://youtu.be/BjoDYThWg7g?feature=shared): Nobukazu Takemura is a Japanese DJ, composer, instrumentalist and electronic music producer active since the early 90s. I was vaguely aware of Takemura for a long time and I did listen to some of his music but I did not take a proper deep dive into his discography until recently. The fascinating thing about Takemura's output in the 90s and beyond is that his albums feature a dramatically different sound, from nu-jazz to experimental glitch and remind me of music explored perhaps more successfully by other artists but with an important caveat. Nobukazu did it first. His 1994 debut album sounds like a blueprint to what Jazzanova would go on to do later on in the decade, nu-jazz, dance-y grooves, rap features, it's all there. Starting with his sophomore mid 90s *Child And Magic* album he would venture into this whimsical, moe-fied version of ambient/glitch/downtempo/microhouse that artists on ryoondo-tea and plop labels would later perfect. *10th*, the album I listened to this week sounds like an early vocaloid project except of course it does not actually use vocaloid software and was released two weeks before vocaloid was even officially announced, like I had to check it. Intentional or not, the heavily processed vocals featured all over the album sound like a vocal synthesizer, it's absurd. The next album, *Songbook* is a MPB/Bossanova/avant-folk affair that reminds me of [70s MPB with child vocals](https://youtu.be/YxRqZWngKLE?feature=shared) and turn of the millennium Indietronica from Iceland and even Ichiko Aoba's music but with child-like magic pixie factor turned up to eleven. It's awesome.\n\n**Skee Mask** - [Resort](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_k60SynTqkl6Zg-KuY9QK4IHxUAFQCyFas): Skee Mask's latest LP is my favorite release of his in a while. It's a breaks-y, upbeat ambient-techno ode to the soft gloss of the early 00s. It's warm, lush and full of quiet optimism, sounds fantastic as well. The drums are punchy, the pads are ethereal and the echoes are clean and precise. Beautiful stuff.",
            "[Trampled By Turtles - Ain't No Use In Tryin]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sWIjxvmw68\n\nRomp 2019 is my favorite live video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoWSrhdKXEQ&t=1456s\n\nIt's called New Grass. The song above would be a good place to start. I enjoy pretty much everything they do. So tight, such great musicians. The fiddle player is one of the best I've heard. As is the banjo, mandolin. They're all great IMO.\n\nSecond shout out to Turnpike Troubadours\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcoBe6s1c5U",
            "hello,\n\n  \nSo, since February I have had a goal to listen to all of my cds from A through Z. Currently I am at Bi. \n\n  \nThis is what I have listened to so far:\n\n  \nBig Star - #1 Record. It's Jangly Rock. I can't place what it is influenced by. Maybe if I were to guess I would say that I could hear The Byrds influence in there a little bit. \n\n  \n[https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy\\_mZqXFt2lB8RR84-1eQwkTOhP955XEz7uE&playnext=1&index=1](https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mZqXFt2lB8RR84-1eQwkTOhP955XEz7uE&playnext=1&index=1)\n\n  \nThe Birthday Party - Hee Haw. \n\nThis is pretty silly sounding post punk that takes influence from Country, Leonard Coheen, Western Movie Soundtracks, and Chamber music. \n\nBehind all of the goofiness and weirdness though is some very dark subject matter. \n\nFor those that don't know, this is the band that Nick Cave was in before he went solo with the Bad Seeds. \n\nI personally like his output with the Birthday Party better than I do his solo material. \n\n  \nHis solo material doesn't sound enough like the Birthday Party to hold my interest. His solo work is too safe. \n\n  \nThis stuff though, holds a special place in my heart. \n\n  \n[https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj83GpwkJx-1j0JEC6yff5TU2W8fwbrls](https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj83GpwkJx-1j0JEC6yff5TU2W8fwbrls)",
            "Paramore: is an interesting band with a great career (20 years at least) of course you know who they are, and I like them because of the way that Hayley is, I mean, she is an authentic person who shows herself without being scared about people can say, and I think that when you listen to Paramore is like backward in time to when you were a teenager, but in the recent albums you can find something different, it\u2019s like you can continue feeling like a teenager, but you have to see the world as it is and not how you want it to be.\n\nAlbum: After Laughter. I think this album explores the idea of waking up from a deep sleep in which you were and also accepting the things that you are going through.\n\nThe specific song I like from this album is \"Rose-Colored Boy\". This song expresses the idea that optimism is not always the answer to the wrong things or the things that we worry about. Also, this song is about depression, and that it is easy to be ignored by people because of the optimism. The line I like the most is \"I have taken my glasses off\" because you see the real world when you don\u2019t have that rose-colored perspective that sometimes is a lie about life.\n\nThe rose-colored perspective is about seeing the world with too much optimism that turns it into a lie.\n\nso \"Just let me cry a little bit longer, I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to\"\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW5ueE2vUm0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW5ueE2vUm0)"

        "content": "As a 25M, I generally like a lot of female pop vocalists. Olivia Rodrigo, Lorde, Sabrina Carpenter, Charli XCX, Phoebe Bridgers and others are part of the catalogue of music I consume on the daily. I think that Olivia Rodrigo's last record is a lot of fun and I consider it one of my favorite records of last year.\n\nMy taste is pretty broad. Usually I am listening to heavier stuff but when I need a pop fix, those artists mentioned above are the artists that I gravitate towards. I can't seem to get into Taylor Swift though, and I don't really understand why. At first, my go-to answer is that I relate to little-to-none of the topics that she writes about or is involved in, but then I think to myself, \"I don't really relate to anything that Lorde or Olivia Rodrigo focuses on either.\" \n\nAdding to that point, I don't really relate to what the guys from Knocked Loose or Judge are going on about either, but I still like them.\n\nThen I think, maybe it is the fanbase. It is a fanbase that I think goes over the top to support their favorite artist and I think that can be colloquially described as \"basic\" by people inside and out of the Taylor Swift ingroup. But, there are plenty of other fanbases that are cringey, annoying, overly-committed and other aspects that people that are not \"in the know\" about the trends/gimmicks that surround the artist would consider strange too. Given those annoyances, it doesn't turn me off from the artist, so that can't be it either.\n\nIs it her level of talent? No, clearly she is talented. She has all the makings of a good pop star, she can write and sing and dance and play guitar. Clearly she has talent and deserves the massive success that she has made for herself. She also seems to be a pretty good role model to young women and girls, and an all around  decent person.\n\nSo what is it? Why don't I understand? I want to understand, I've tried time and time again.",

            "I feel like she suffocates every song with verbosity and description to the point that the instrumentation never gets to stand out or be interesting at all. Couple that writing style with a monotone voice and it's like listening to the air conditioner hum over a metronome.",
            "for me her songs are way too on the nose and tone deaf. \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t survive in the asylum they raised me in\u201d? okay miss gurl",
            "I have difficulty understanding lyrics, so a song's rhythm, instrumentation, feel, drive, etc., usually grabs me more than its lyrics and storytelling. And the instrumentation/music of Lorde, Charli XCX, Phoebe Bridgers, and Olivia Rodrigo are consistently more interesting to me than Taylor Swift, who undoubtedly is a storyteller first and foremost. If you aren't connecting with Swift's lyrics or narrative (like me), I have a hard time seeing you connect with her music as a whole.",
            "Her entire schtick is well executed, but is to pop music what Hilary Clinton is to politics: well trained, highly instrumented/measured to the point of too focus-grouped/marketed rather than genuine, and often an uncanny valley of what a person is.  She's the rich daughter of a guy who owned a record label and could afford to build all the infrastructure around her to make her successful with even less talent than she has.  She writes things with the express purpose of commercial appeal (like Madonna for example) but with none of the underlying edgy attitude or an image with anything new on offer -- it's incredibly safe, mass-marketed pop culture, and with 10x the calculation, which I think for some folks is just too sterile and milquetoast.\n\nShe's not a Tina Turner, Madonna, or even a Halsey. She's a future Barbra Streisand or Celine Dion.",
            "I don\u2019t get it either. For me there is just nothing interesting about her voice, it is very generic. At least when she was country she had a shtick (although apparently her accent was fake at the time lol) but any song I hear by her just evokes 0 emotional response for me. I don\u2019t find her lyrics that crazy good either, although it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve read them all.",
            "Her music is generally family friendly, not overly sexual, unpretentious, and not  challenging or subversive. These qualities make it massively appealing to a wide range of demographics all the  while maintaining massive staying power. She projects a curated image of relatability to give the illusion that she's a friend of her fans. Her lyrics deal with coming-of-age experiences that are universal to many people, especially women.  \n\nUltimately, it's her marketing and business ingenuity at work.",
            "I feel like she doesn\u2019t translate well to most men, even if they love music made by women. There's something distinctly feminine about her, and her music, that just doesn\u2019t click with most guys, despite how progressive, accepting, and open minded they might be. It wouldn\u2019t seem strange at all to me if a guy said he loved Joni Mitchell, Phoebe Bridgers, Charli XCX, Lana Del Rey, Fiona Apple, and Lucy Dacus, but didn\u2019t care at all for Taylor Swift. I think it might be in part that she isn\u2019t cool. There nothing truly cool about Taylor Swift. She has no edge. She\u2019s milquetoast. All of the other women I mentioned have some kind of cool factor, and Taylor Swift really doesn\u2019t. I think a lot of men sense that in some way, and find it boring, or uninteresting.",

He listens to Ariana grande and I\u2019m fine with it. But Taylor swift is just so meh. Everything about her is meh. What I do like about her is that she is her an woman and goddamn great businesswoman. I love what she\u2019s doing in the music business.",

        "content": "From [The 100 Greatest Nu Metal Albums of All Time](https://numetalagenda.com/feature/the-100-greatest-nu-metal-albums-of-all-time/) by The Nu Metal Agenda. Bolding mine:\n\n>**5. Linkin Park**  \n***Hybrid Theory***  \n**\\[Warner Bros; 2000\\]**\n\n>*Hybrid Theory*\u00a0is a perfect metallic cube. The intricate cogs and mechanisms that keep it in motion are encased by a flawless silver surface that reflects nothing but your own anxieties and problems back at you.\u00a0*Hybrid Theory*\u00a0is a transmission from a long-ago world in which a metal act wasn\u2019t just competing with the top pop acts of the day but defeating them. NSYNC's\u00a0*No Strings Attached*, frequently pointed to as the peak of the CD era, sold half of what\u00a0*Hybrid Theory*\u00a0would sell worldwide. So successful was\u00a0*Hybrid Theory*\u00a0that Linkin Park immediately had to fight off the boy-band accusations from their detractors. Yet the comparision is somewhat understandable. Beyond just a fresh faced and unthreatening looking bunch who declined to swear even once on their debut what strikes most immediately about\u00a0*Hybrid Theory*\u00a0is how deeply pop it is; it\u2019s debatable that no album has ever synthesized pop music and heavy metal to such seamless extents. Not Metallica's\u00a0*Black Album*, not\u00a0*Appetite for Destruction*, not\u00a0*Back in Black*, nothing. What are modern iconoclasts like Poppy or Rina Sawayama if not visions of an alternate world where \u201cOne Step Closer\u201d was recorded by Britney Spears? For the half decade leading up to\u00a0*Hybrid Theory*, nu-metal had been conquering Soundscan and TRL but the singles chart remained mostly immune. Neither Korn nor Limp Bizkit had ever broken the top 50 on the Hot 100. Linkin Park changed all that by packing \u201cIn the End\u201d with zillion dollar hooks and sending it all the way to #2 on the Hot 100.\n\n>To the legions of teens and tweens who were finally allowed to own a nu-metal record ('Look ma, no parental advisory!') this seemed like the last album they\u2019d ever need. This is as \"all killer no filler\" as it gets. More than just the album\u2019s hit singles, this lean efficiency is why it kept moving six figures a week well into 2002. Radio stations played deep cuts like \u201cRunaway\u201d as if they were singles. If Linkin Park hit you at the right age and right time they were a band you could build a life around. Unlike their larger-than-life peers, Linkin Park were their fans- obviously nerdy guys that were into anime and Xbox and cleaned up their (green) rooms after making a mess. They had a fan club, did web chats, signed autographs, and released a full remix album just a year later, cultivating their own cutting-edge visuals that combined hip-hop culture, graffiti, and Adult Swim.\n\n>For a band that made such completely incredibly uncool music, their influences read like an indie publication\u2019s best albums of the 1990s list. [Shinoda cites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Qxm-pOwTiY&%3Bt=335s&ref=numetalagenda.com)\u00a0Refused\u2019s\u00a0*The Shape of Punk to Come*\u00a0as being essential to Linkin Park, going as far as to say \u201cwithout \\[that\\] there is no Linkin Park.\u201d The comparison might seem off at first - stridently political post-hardcore heroes are responsible for your little brother\u2019s favorite nu-metal band? - but upon inspection makes perfect sense. Until this point, nu-metal was loose and groovy, but Linkin Park tightened everything to a fine cinch. **They bottled Refused\u2019s 'can-I-scream' energy while grabbing Depeche Mode\u2019s clean melodic sense and Nine Inch Nails\u2019 dense layers of electronics and synths to buttress their guitar and bass combinations. Jay-Z\u2019s futuristic flow and pop sensibility, Black Thought\u2019s internal rhyme schemes, and Aphex Twin\u2019s digital sound manipulations. The turntable showcase on \u201cCure for the Itch\u201d giving way to dusty loops and an aching melody could make DJ Shadow bob his head. All of this baked into the by then standard nu-metal formula of downtuned riffs, angst and turntable sfx created a sound that was at once a logical next step and something without precedent.** It\u2019s staggering to imagine a fusion that dense coming on a debut album this seamless, yet here it is. As such,\u00a0*Hybrid Theory*\u00a0works as a sort of musical philanthropy; priming millions of kids to get into acts like Cannibal Ox, Boards of Canada, and Far later on in life.\n\n>*Hybrid Theory*\u00a0changed popular rock music forever. **In the wake of its incredible sales figures, rock bands discarded any lingering pretenses of rock \u2018n roll naturalism - let alone the blues - in favor of Linkin Park\u2019s cut-and-paste Pro Tools methodology. Even their forebears like Korn and Slipknot would forsake their earlier jammy songwriting stylings for Linkin Park\u2019s rigid structures and pop songwriting. Meanwhile, indie rock would sprint backwards to revive the post-punk sounds of the 70s and 80s with production techniques that strove for one band in one room recording to tape. Luckily for them, the world conquering success of**\u00a0***Hybrid Theory*** **spawned a backlash big enough to create a platform for those bands and you could argue that the ripples of Linkin Park's success are as responsible for the popularity of the White Stripes as they are Imagine Dragons. For better or for worse, the line between**\u00a0***Hybrid Theory***\u00a0**and modern rock bands like Bring Me the Horizon and twenty one pilots is a straight one.**\u00a0*Hybrid Theory\u2019s*\u00a0influence is still a testament to its quality, even if some of the wrong lessons were learned.\n\n>If you can allow this author his indulgence, this was\u00a0*the*\u00a0album for me growing up. Chester Bennington, arguably the finest rock singer of the 21st century, a songwriter who understood me before I did. From the melancholy lilt of \u201cIn the End\u201d to the shattering screams of \u201cBy Myself\u201d his golden throat was a conduit of pure angst; flowing directly into the headphones of millions looking for a safe space to explore those first tender feelings of depression and anxiety. A voice that could make something as petty as an afternoon grounded sound as devastating as the end of the world. This longing, for an innocence where the mildest inconvenience could be felt as deep as death, makes the reality of \u201cPushing Me Away\u201d ache. Bennington, spent from an album of bloodletting, sings straightforward and pretty. \u201cWe\u2019re all out of time\" raps Shinoda, \"This is how we find how it all unwinds,\" announcing not just the end of the album but the end of an era. As the song digs in for that last chorus, it all slides away like a VHS tape in fast forward. For a brief moment, as processed drum loops flicker and flutter to a close and a lonely synth trigger is switched off, I communicate with that innocent childhood self again - cradling a discman in the backseat of a minivan staring out the window - then it\u2019s over.\u00a0*\u2014*\u00a0[*H.K.*](https://twitter.com/HolidayKirk?ref=numetalagenda.com)\n\nI do think that there's something undeniably *pop* about Linkin Park. They were an act that could bend and break out of genre constraints with ease, even more than n\u00fc-metal already implies that - and they never felt like other n\u00fc-metal bands, probably because they were so clean and mainstream friendly. (Yet artsy and underground by associating with more legitimate hip-hop and electronic acts.) I think their appearance signaled a shift in the industry that they were at the forefront of, but not the catalyst, as the article suggests. What do you think?",

Grunge becoming popular starts with the black album becoming popular.\n\nNu metal died as a joke because only a few shit bands from it got popular alongside a few crumbs of dignity (and even music aficionados still think nu metal sucks except for Deftones, despite the fact that Deftones' sound comprises a whole ocean of bands which compete with them/sound even better). *Hybrid Theory* was popular, but it didn't influence anything as much as Metallica. No comparison.",
            "I think it overstates it. They certainly had effectively zero influence on the corner of the world I existed in at the time other than as \"that awful shit\", and we were heavy-duty metalheads. At the time the bands that really cut through and ultimately stood the test of time were things like Nile, Angelcorpse, Krisiun etc, and if you were into that there was pretty much no overlap with nu-metal",
            "Whoever wrote this isn't just sniffing their own farts, they've bottled them in a tank and are inhaling them through a mask. Hybrid Theory is a decent album. They blended metal, DJing, and rapping probably better than any other band up to that point and brought in an electronic sensibility that hadn't really been present in the genre before them. It's also not a great album. So many of the songs have this sort of dead space chorus where they're just kind of making noise to fill time, and the lyrics are all angsty and sophomoric. It's not on the same level as, say, Break Stuff, Last Resort, or Nookie, but it's still pretty teenage drama-ish. To say that they're iconoclasts who broke down the walls between genres? No, they're decent musicians who hit on the right sound at the right time and sold a bunch of albums.",
            "Slipknot has 2 albums ahead of #10 SOAD Toxicity so this list is already discounted in my head. I do agree with Hybrid Theory being top 10.",
            "I see them as the Nirvana of Nu-Metal.   You can debate all day whether they are the best in their niche or not but they are clearly the ones who made it popular and mainstream and that matters too.  Especially in influence.",
            "I'd argue that most of the alternative metal and metalcore songs that get played on the radio sound influenced by Linkin Park when they aren't trying to sound like Breaking Benjamin or Evanescence"

I then give each playlist a title, sometimes based on the mood, often based on personal events for that week so each of my playlists serves as a bit of a \"diary\" for a week.\n\nI have begun going back and compiling the songs I have found into bigger meta playlists (like obscure [60s](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4r7bt6xrfvPlIcMEtIDGhr) or soul), but 80% of my listening is to an A or B side for each week. Also I like that I dont feel the need to constantly maintain or update playlists, each one is frozen in time, frozen in order, like a composition or album."
