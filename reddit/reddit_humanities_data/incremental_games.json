            "Hey everyone! \n\nI'm currently in playtesting for my factory game with a bunch of incremental aspects to both the production buildings and the transportation system... It's essentially an incremental game but with 2D layout problems, and 3D graphics. You plant crops, combine them using buildings, and transport them with vehicles, each of which have incremental upgrades to increase their throughout. \n\n#### Playtesting Access\n\nJoin the [Discord](https://discord.gg/AXkPDcwXbd) and follow the quick bot command instructions to get a playtest key! \n\n#### Status\n\nThe game is still a little on the earlier side. There may be some rough edges, but the first ~2 hours of core gameplay are ready for play. That being said, I've also had many testers put over 10 hours into it, reoptimizing their layouts, etc.\n\nThere is a feedback button within the game to report any in game issues or thoughts. I'd also love to hear any other feedback in Discord etc as well!\n\n#### Other Links\n- [Steam Page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2954590?utm_source=Reddit&utm_campaign=incremental_games_ff)\n- [Trailer on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3Or1c3m1v8)\n- [Discord](https://discord.gg/AutVxXjPn4)",
            "\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/2868380/Feed_Da_King/\n\nHello all, several months ago I asked people what gave their favorite incremental game the sauce. Armed with this information over the last couple months I have completed my first incremental game. Feed Da King, an idle clicker game that features moments of active and passive play, with a dynamic window system that allows you to toggle the game on top of other applications and adjust it to your preference. Workers throw crops into your picnic basket. You can click or automate to throw the food from the basket into Da King's mouth. When Da King eats, he will throw a coin into your piggy bank, and his belly will increase, granting you rewards along the way. Use different coins for various upgrades and to add more workers. The only limitations are either your time or your rig. I have 25 Steam bypass codes ready for whomever wants to do some in depth beta testing. This Reddit is the reason I decided to create this game, a great community. I\u2019m currently camping but refuse to miss feedback Friday, so if you\u2019re interested in a beta code please send a message and I\u2019ll get you one asap, thank you!",
            "I'm currently working on a game inspired by Idle Slayer and Idle RPGs.\n\n[screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/rJlEnRF)\n\nIt's currently pretty short and you can exhaust the \"content\" in an hour or so -- but hopefully you'll see stuff and balance get added each week in these posts and you can see some of the scale forever systems that exist already.\n\nIt has the auto scrolling feel, inventory, equipment, crafting, talents, skilling, unlocks etc.\n\nNo game name currently (probably the hardest part) but I have a solid direction I want to go in and am excited for it.\n\nAs I've never finished a game or made one public I'm looking for any and all feedback whether it is UI, UX or a vibe check... with the understanding that almost all the numbers are VERY rough and I'm working on implementing features before dealing with pacing.\n\nIt's playable in browser on itch:\n\n[Unnamed Idle RPG Prototype by born weird (itch.io)](https://born-weird.itch.io/idle-prototype) v 0.03\n\nDiscord: [https://discord.gg/Rr23zKK6Sr](https://discord.gg/Rr23zKK6Sr)",

The flow is quite different now and there are more mechanics. I'm still experimenting with mechanics and would love some feedback.\n\nIf you've played before, the save data will act funky by giving you a big boost for some generators (since I reordered many things). I kept it in for those that want to keep their earnings, but if you want to experience the new version as intended, you have to delete the data (on Android long press the app icon --> app info --> clear data). \n\nAny constructive feedback is highly appreciated! Thanks!",
            "Hello Friends, \n\nI posted my incremental game ([Gaiadon by nadukkon (itch.io)](https://nadukkon.itch.io/gaiadon-eternal-quest)) here a few weeks ago, based on the feedback I made quite a few changes and a few updates later I am back here for more feedback with a lot of new updates.\n\nThere is a demo available on steam, but until the game is released on steam, its free on itch.\n\nItch.io: [Gaiadon by nadukkon (itch.io)](https://nadukkon.itch.io/gaiadon-eternal-quest)\n\nSteam: [Gaiadon: Eternal Quest on Steam (steampowered.com)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3000030/Gaiadon_Eternal_Quest/)\n\nLatest update video: [Gaiadon - Transcendence update (0.8a) (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGeNxQPlO1U)",
            "[https://imgur.com/a/nOgFlp0](https://imgur.com/a/nOgFlp0) Here's the fix for the follower interval. I feel like this is a much more intuitive UI",
            "About an hour in and a few things that caught my attention, I'll start with the negative: \n\n\u2022 Generic, boring font for tutorial boxes. Blue highlights are very hard to read.   \n\u2022 No music - I had to put on my own music to set the vibe of the game.  \n\u2022 Choppy camera movement, maybe it's just that I don't have a monster of a machine, but on wider viewing angles the game lags some. \n\nThings I enjoyed:\n\n\u2022 The UI looks very clean, easy to read.   \n\u2022 Loots of content! If I craved farming games right now, I can see myself playing this for hours.\n\nFor a feature recommendation:\n\nI'd love to see an early more trucks building, as I noticed this being a bottlecap even super early in the game even with truck upgrades.",
            "when i click play on itchio it opens a new window and its a 404",
            "Initial impressions:\n\nI spent two minutes trying to figure out how to make abilities activate. I would suggest either making that tutorial message pop up on game start, or adding some kind of glow or shake effect to make the help buttons at the top of the screen clearer. Actually in general, it might be a good idea to make a sound cue for new tutorial messages.\n\nBullet feels almost completely pointless, when Raze simply erases any enemies on the screen. I'd suggest reducing its cooldown, as 'equivalent to one sword strike to every enemy once every ten seconds' doesn't feel like a big deal given Raze's damage output.\n\nSpeaking of enemies, the groupings are very sparse. It can make it feel like I have to wait to get good value out of my spells, since using them might only hit one enemy. Consider reducing the maximum distance between enemy groupings, or possibly even removing the option of one-enemy groups.\n\nHaving music muted by default is a good QOL feature, but I genuinely didn't realise the game had the \\*option\\* of music for some time. Not sure what can be done about that though.\n\nSlice currently does absolutely nothing. Not sure if this isn't fully implemented or the range is too low to hit even the closest enemy. (Which made me feel pretty stupid for putting a talent point into it...)\n\nI was excited to get to equipment crafting, but making it cost time shards was a real disappointment. Spending 400 gold to unlock it (which is a lot given the drop rates for enemies in this game), only to be told I need 500 of a different currency to do anything with it, was what made me stop the game right there. Eight minutes of idling for a single piece of equipment?\n\nArtstyle and animation is definitely the game's strong point right now. Attack animations look punchy and clear, and the effects on the spells are very satisfying. Looking forward to seeing how this grows!"

I prefer Isekai style and specifically ones where the MC still has to work their way through their new life.\n\nCouple of favourites are Bog Standard and Mirror World.\n\nAlso enjoyed Deadworld which put an interesting spin on the Isekai theme and is complete.\n\nDepending on the way the story is written there can be an incremental aspect to some stories, numbers do go up of course in some stories.  Other stories may not feature any levelling at all depending on the author. However I'd argue the dopamine hit comes from the reading of a story you enjoy rather than watching numbers go up :D\n\nAlas I haven't spoken to anyone else who seems to enjoy this genre sadly.",
