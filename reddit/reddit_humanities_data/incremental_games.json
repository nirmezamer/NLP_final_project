            "Thank you! I think I'll hide the atoms stuff a bit in the beginning and then introduce it with a quick pop up.\n\nI'll rework the scrollbar soon. I'm breaking my head over how to  display what the potato is set to in that icon but also keep the roman numbers quite large. But anyhow, first step will be to show as many as possible and give them a quick move animation.",

            "About an hour in and a few things that caught my attention, I'll start with the negative: \n\n\u2022 Generic, boring font for tutorial boxes. Blue highlights are very hard to read.   \n\u2022 No music - I had to put on my own music to set the vibe of the game.  \n\u2022 Choppy camera movement, maybe it's just that I don't have a monster of a machine, but on wider viewing angles the game lags some. \n\nThings I enjoyed:\n\n\u2022 The UI looks very clean, easy to read.   \n\u2022 Loots of content! If I craved farming games right now, I can see myself playing this for hours.\n\nFor a feature recommendation:\n\nI'd love to see an early more trucks building, as I noticed this being a bottlecap even super early in the game even with truck upgrades."

It's more involved than most idle games, and it's more about management and strategy than just seeing number go up, that's what I'm liking about it so far as I've played a fair share of incremental games but this is the most involved I've seen so far.

Others...well, like someone else said it starts to come off as wish fulfillment (or the author purposefully drags it on with filler to squeeze money out of it). I like skill grinding especially non-combat skills like alchemy or farming, it's pretty tough to find good books though.",

Then I listened to a few more litrpg samples and short books and realised that DCC is probably the pinnacle of litrpg and the rest were just weird  nerdy stories with computer gaming tropes which I did not really enjoy.",
