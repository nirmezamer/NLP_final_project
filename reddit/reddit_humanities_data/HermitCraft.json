        "content": "Hey everyone, our recent collaboration with the Minecraft Marketplace allowed us to bring the Season Nine world to a much wider range of players given the bedrock platforms reach across multiple devices. It was a great experience to see so many of you enjoying the world and sharing your excitement. We would like to do that again with our previous seasons but I don't think I can do this without the communities help.\n\nSeason Nine was quite time intensive and the recentness of it made that far easier. I simply don't have the time to hand to manually check the Season Eight world for missed builds and mistakenly pruned areas. I have rather aggressively trimmed the world down to 300MB with the goal of it being as slim as possible, to reach more devices with storage limitations. I've kept track of everything removed and can restore regions if needed.\n\nIf you would like to spend your time helping out, exploring the world for things that have been pruned by mistake would been immensely helpful. Players who download the world from the marketplace will have a better experience with your help!\n\nI will provide a download for both Java and Bedrock, as well as this image of the pruned overworld - so you don't go looking in places that are not pruned. Any help is appreciated but please provide it in these formats\n\n1 - A description of whats missing with the co-ordinates of that location.\n\n2 - For bedrock, a description of any form of conversion discrepancy that could be fixed and where to see it in the world.\n\nOverworld map - [https://download.xisumavoid.com/s8\\_overworld.png](https://download.xisumavoid.com/s8_overworld.png)\n\nBedrock Download - [https://download.xisumavoid.com/Hermitcraft\\_Season\\_Eight\\_Test\\_1.mcworld](https://download.xisumavoid.com/Hermitcraft_Season_Eight_Test_1.mcworld)\n\nJava Download - [https://download.xisumavoid.com/Hermitcraft\\_Season\\_Eight\\_Test\\_1.zip](https://download.xisumavoid.com/Hermitcraft_Season_Eight_Test_1.zip)\n\n  \nThank you for your time :-)",
