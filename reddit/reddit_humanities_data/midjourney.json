        "content": "Hey Midjourney Redditors!\n\nGuess what? We\u2019ve spruced up the rules for our subreddit, and you can check them out on the sidebar. Don't worry, nothing major has changed; we've just clarified a few points and made some new rules to keep things crystal clear. For instance, we used to handle a lot of request posts under the no spam rule, but now \u201cno requests\u201d is its own rule since we got tons of questions about it. Hopefully, this tweak makes everything smoother. Let us know if you have any ideas for improvements!\n\nAlso, exciting news! We've created a private room on the Midjourney site just for you all to hang out in! [Here's the link to join](https://www.midjourney.com/rooms/1629f728-8132-4465-845e-a8f58501b4d6), and the password is: myspace.\n\nTo join, make sure you've created at least 100 images with Midjourney (you can check your count using /info on Discord) and have an active subscription. Just a heads up, mobile isn't supported yet, and let\u2019s keep things SFW! We can't wait to hear what you think about the new room and are super excited to hang out, chat, and create together. Have fun, y'all!",

            "Can you turn on images in comments in this subreddit?  I think it would help a lot for collabing.",
            "Good work on the new rules :) I've seen a lot of posts I would have reported under the old rules but it wasn't clear which rule if any applied. Especially 3, 4, 5 and 9.",
            "can i ask for help for a prompt ?",
            "Didn't even know it was turned off. On now.",
            "Yeah I second this. Maybe pin a poll about it at the very least to see what the community thinks.\n\nDalle subreddit currently allows this and its the best part about the sub. Facilitates a lot of creativity and doesnt make the comments look cluttered or anything.\n\nI think most members would want this",

            "Thanks for this, but in case anybody is confused, that announcement is from almost two weeks ago ;)\n\nHighly recommended to anybody who hasn't tried it though -- for me at least, the model really figured out what tickles my fancy and I use it for everything by default now :) very fun!",
            "yeah, we havent been announcing all new features over here & have been mainly sticking to posting major stuff like v6 release, but we came to realize that in itself is a missed opportunity so I thought to take my time this time to make the pictures & examples nice for this post rather than just a copy/paste of announcement as well! \n\n  \nhopefully this is a nicer way to showcase new midjourney stuff on reddit and will be something we do more often in the future!",
            "Good idea! There are plenty of people who read this sub who NEVER look at the discord channels or docs, heh... so this will definitely help ;)",
            "**Hey Reddit! We've released an early test version of model personalization, here's how it works.**  \n  \n\r\r**What is Model Personalization?**\r\n\nEvery time you write a prompt there's a lot that remains 'unspoken'. Our algorithms usually fill in the blank with their own 'preferences', which are really the combined biases and preferences of our community. \rBut of course everyone is different! Model personalization learns what\u0003you like so that it's more likely to fill in the blanks with your tastes.\r\r\n\n**Model Personalization Requirements**\r\n\nRight now model personalization learns from votes in pair ranking and \u0003images that you like from the explore page. \n\n* You need to have roughly [**200 pair rankings**](https://www.midjourney.com/rank) **/ likes** in order for the\u0003feature to work.\r \n* You can see how many ratings you have on the above page or by typing **/info**.\n\n\r\r**How do I use Model Personalization?**\r\n\nJust type **--p** after your prompt, or turn on personalization for all prompts under /settings or the prompt settings button on the website.\r When you enable personalization you get a 'code' added after your \u0003prompts, you can share this code to share the personalization effect \u0003being applied to that image.\r \n\n* You can control the strength of the personalization effect by \rusing **--s 100** (0 is off and 1000 is maximum and 100 is default)\r\n* You can blend multiple model personalization codes together \rlike **--p ab12ad3 cd34gl**\r\n* You can weigh individual codes as follows **--p ab12ad3::2 cd34gl::1**\r\r\n\n**PLEASE NOTE:** Personalization is not a stable feature right now, it will change as \u0003you do more pair ratings (subtly) and we may be pushing out algorithm updates over \u0003the next few weeks. So just assume that it's a 'fun feature constantly in flux' \r\rThis is a totally new frontier of image synthesis. We hope we discover\u0003a lot in the process of doing this and we would love to hear your thoughts in our ideas-and-features channel on discord or in response\u0003to this post!"
