            "so the story seems short, right? what about the other content? do yall see the potential to grind this game for like at least 50-100hrs, are there things to chase (like very hard fights, lots of stuff to level up/build)?   \n\n\nmight be too early to ask but given that story is short some people might already be in the \"postgame\"",

            "I'm really interested in how the level scaling works. I have repeatedly ran into other players in Quick Quest using awakened terminus weapons who absolutely melt any boss encounter below Proud, and they're *clearly* not being scaled down. Don't have the level down arrow beside their profile icon either. Meanwhile I'm running a 150 Stinger weapon and shitty sigils and getting synced? It's bizarre.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, is it just me or does Percival's Strength/Sup Damage self-buff apply incredibly slowly compared to other characters' self buffs? Doesn't even feel like you can dodge out of the animation in a reasonable time and still get it going.",

They have basically stated that 1.3.1 was all they had planned, but they MIGHT, keyword MIGHT do more.\n\nI wouldn't expect more than paid DLC characters at this point, if anything at all.\n\nRelink at Anime Expo seems more like they bought out the slot to demo the Shadowverse and Umamusume games, but decided to put up some Relink demos with Seofon, Tweyen, and Sandalphon unlocked to try to garner some more sales.",
            "Unlikely. Relink isn't carrying its own presentation or anything, it's a Cygames booth and it it's one of their recent cult hits so relink is gonna be there on the floor which makes sense, and does not suggest there's going to be any kind of unexpected announcements.",

        "content": "The game plays great on performance mode but just looks really blurry and graphics mode looks good and all but locking it at 30fps has really bottlenecked it. I just feel like a balanced mode would really benefit this version of the game. I mean other anime games have managed to pull this off. Genshin Impact for example. That game can run at 4K 60fps on console so I don\u2019t see why the devs for Relink can\u2019t work on putting in a balanced mode in the game that runs at like 1440p 60fps. It just seems like they aren\u2019t really taking advantage of some of the PS5s capabilities",

            "Yup, I agreed with you on this. An RTX 2080 which is equivalent of PS5 gpu can actually do above 60 fps max settings at 1440p. So there is no reason why they put such restrictions on PS5 version.",
            "I agree. I play in 4k 120hz monitors, performance mode look like shit while graphics mode hurts my eye because of 30fps.",
            "The only reason I have mine set to performance is because of the fps and yeah the graphics in performance mode are indeed crap. They should\u2019ve just had balanced mode right from the start"

I mean it's significant. It depends on the attack scaling of the SBA in particular obviously but DEF down is always useful.",

            "I admit i didn't see DEF buffs having any value till the 1.3 boss rushes were added, played with a rossetta who kept DEF on the entire time and had a seigfried who spammed his party DEF buff, all those 1 shot sneak attacks from bosses only hit for 18-25k, makeing it easier to not get sniped off screen.",

But I tried like 5 times and  can\u2019t beat the golem nowhere near the three minutes for the bonus goal.( Any tips would be appreciated.)\n\n So I tried going online and had no luck finding anyone to help. Now I dunno if the game has an sos flare equivalent from monster Hunter world or how matchmaking works ( or maybe demo online is only with other demo people ?) With all that I wondering the likelihood of finding help with some of the harder missions the game might have, or is the player base pretty much gone? \n\n\n\n\n\nThanks :) \n\n",

Even if there were some playing it, I doubt they're gonna bother trying to queue for the S++ on the Golem cuz you don't need it to get all the demo rewards. \n\nThat said, if you want the S++ anyway, I recall a really old post just before launch showing a player achieving that using Charlotta as their character. I don't remember who they used for their AI party members or their sigil setup but looks like it's possible. Good luck.",

It\u2019s a great game. Pick it up. It\u2019ll be worth your time if you\u2019re interested.",

            "It\u2019s pretty fun - but you need to get past the story solo. Matchmaking is an absolutely trash heap candidly - unlike monster hunter which does this well - GB for some reason just takes forever, and has loads of menus to load in for a 5-10 min match. \n\nResults may vary - could have been a very \u201cmeta\u201d style game but kind of fell short - hoping they improve the formula in the future as combat is fun as hell.",
            "You can solo with AI through most of it save for the few later endgame missions. There is a currency locked behind co-op with randoms though, which stings a bit when you need to grind for mats faster."
