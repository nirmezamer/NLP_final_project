            "Pretty good bugfix update imo, a lot of features are exactly what people asked for\n\nAlso since the game is on its first ever 30% off on steam, hopefully that gets more people on board",
            "Thank God those previous timers for the quest were laughably bad it made me wander if they even played the game same with the health of the bosses in the boss rush like how is the time so short but they have above standard health it makes sense for the zero quest but not the others",
            "Good, now I can complete berserker echo+ quest solo",
            "Not so much a bug fix but more of a make it more accessible to the more casual audience at end game . Which is great as I am one of them",
            "I wonder if the bug was fixed where if you start an SBA at the same time quakadile charges at you, misses and keeps running far from you, but got hit by the SBA starter... the monster ends up frozen and doesn't end the match even if killed.",
            "Its just me or did they fix the Network connection error when playing online on PlayStation?",
            "It's funny that every time I stop playing for a while they drop an update that makes the next thing I was going to farm easier to do. I guess I'll be working towards a good Berserker Echo sigil sometime soon.",
            "Is it still mostly.optimal.to.jus spam with Sandy's beam attack?\n\nCuz that's corny",
            "Damn it I wanted to do these quest after I took a break from the game. I didnt want the bosses to get nerfed. Neat timer change tho.",
            "What was the old time limit on those quests?"
