            "Was wondering why I was having a plateau despite logging everything to the gram and exercising. Tried MacroFactor and it told me to reach my goal at my desired pace, I actually have to eat around 900 calories a day. Oh well, that explains it then. Add to that that my smartwatch probably overestimates my exercise calories and the riddle is solved.",
            "I really dont like tracking calories because anything that requires tracking is pretty difficult for me. Has anyone here created a meal plan of 1200 calories and just stuck with it until they got bored and created a new one? If so, could you share your experience and lessons learned?",

It\u2019s one thing to hear it from your mom, it\u2019s quite another to hear it from a group of internet strangers who are all giving you sound advice. \n\nPS We\u2019ll be going to her therapist more frequently and working on fixing the hurt in her heart. If you\u2019ve been through an ED and have any specific advice for me on how to help her, feel free to DM me, I\u2019d appreciate any help we can get. (As long as it doesn\u2019t trigger you, of course.) ",
