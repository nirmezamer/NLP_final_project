            "With 0 crimes ever before, I got a crime stat just and my ship was impounded simply for flying up to Orison in my own ship.  I was trying to request permission to land, but did not land.  What crime did I commit and how do I prevent this in the future?",
            "What is coupled mode vs. decoupled mode (and what's the keybind to swap)?",
            "Noob flying a Titan. If I hold Y, I exit seat into exterior.  I tried to hold F and look left to find a way to directly exit pilot seat and go straight of of the ship via the ladder, but can't seem to find an option to do so.  How do I do this?",
            "How's the state of the game on the current patch? I try to keep far away from this sub/the game and only revisit once every 6 months or so to keep it feeling fresh. Is the current patch worth playing or should I give it a miss until the next major update?",
            "How\u2019s cargo running been this patch? Now that XT is done for me I wanted to take my C2 out. I was also thinking about using my hull c\u2026",
            "hey, can anyone retrieve any vehicles from the ground stations yet? this is/was a game breaking bug that had me give up until next patch, so i am just asking if anyone has successfully been able to retrieve anything from the geound station ASOP's since the patch?  thanks",
            "I played XT but the final mission to destroy the idris completed as abandoned for some reason. Is there a way to guarantee it'll actually complete properly? It took several hours just to get to that point so I don't want to waste more time again.",
            "I have the iron clad and a cuttlass black through the pledge store. I\u2019m thinking about getting the vanguard hoplite with store credit through trade in the other ships in the only problem is that I need a cargo ship so I can still make money is there any ship that I should get in the pledge store right now or should I just wait?",
            "I need help. I feel like I am being Gaslighted. Probably unintentionally but still I can seem to wrap my head around it. \n\nDuring the first day of Invictus week, I had a ship removed from my hangar, A Cutty Black, that I have had for 4 years. It was there at the start of Invicuts and prior, but ther was some kind of patch or something done and my ship disappeared from my hangar. \n\nNot only did this ship disappear in game, but it also disappeared from my account hangar on RSI website. I am certain it was there, because I looked at it before purchasing a Vulture, stand alone, on the website. \n\nIt was not until after I purchased the Vulture that I noticed the Cutty Black gone. Now, this seems cut and dry, but that Cutty was a reward ship, a bonus, that I got for a significant purchase 4 years ago during the first Drake day and release of the Kraken model and ability to purchase. \n\nI spent well over 300 dollars that day on a Caterpillar, which also came with a free Buccaneer. So I got a Cat, a Buc, and a Cutty Black all on the same day. I thought it was a great deal. I decided to sub to Centurian too, which gives me a Ship of the Month AND a consistant Anvil Arrow in my hangar. I thought, damn these are great deals. \n\nFlash forward 4 years, and not the cutty is gone, and all trace of that sale, the event, the invictus pdf on RSI website is down and gone. ANd I put in a help ticket for the missing ship. \n\nHERE IS WHAT I NEED HELP WITH: CIG has told me there are no instances of recieving free ships from any pledge. I should never have had the Anvil, the Cutty Black, nor the Buccaneer. I feel like I am being messed with. Could I -really- have misunderstood this for 4 years and just so happened to have had 3 free ships over wipes and stuff over 4 years?\n\nThis is exactly what CIG said to me. \n\n>Hello,\n \n>I had a look back through our announcements from that time, but I'm still unable to locate any reference for a promotion that would have awarded either a bonus Cutlass or a Bucaneer as part of a pledge, nor any reference to an Arrow that would be awarded for a Centurion subscription of any length. The only thing that does come to mind is that the Caterpillar does currently loan a Buccaneer, as a Loaner Ship. Due to the current restrictions in Arena Commander, certain ships have a secondary loaner to allow them to play in all game modes. For example, Freelancer owners would receive an Anvil Arrow for use in Arena Commander play modes. \n\nAm I crazy? I feel like I must be completely stupid.",

            "Over halfway there, the June r/starcitizen monthly events calendar is here!\n\nSame with last month things are a bit light as both us and our partners recover from both ILW and their events as well as prepare for some cool upcoming stuff.\n\nTo kick us off this month we have not one...but TWO death races taking place on Saturday, June 15th, first we have our Death Race taking place at 5pm UTC followed by ANZIA Racing's \"Mountains of Mayhem\" at 10pm UTC. Following that we have two more races from ANZIA, the \"Anti-Gravity Racing League\" and the \"Warpath Rally\". All of the above events are open for signups and have pledge prizes for the winners. We encourage you to check them out!\n\nTo participate in any of the above events join the Discord server\u00a0[here](https://discord.gg/starcitizen)\u00a0and check our #server-news channel\u00a0[here](https://discord.com/channels/82210263440306176/1113146864804573285).\n\nThanks\n\nIan/hencaric",
            "I joined the community Discord server and nobody there had any idea that 3 of the 4 of these events even existed.  No details at all for any of the ANZIA events and next to no information on the Death Race event.  There isn't even a channel or thread for discussing community events.\n\nTurns out where you actually need to go for information on these events is https://anziaracing.com/.",
            "Hey Kamakazie! \n\nYou need to check out our #server-news channel for information. The death race info is in there currently and the ANZIA events will be added today. Race events usually get added the same week for visibility but we are a bit behind this week on getting them up. \n\nThanks for the feedback.\n\nEdit: regarding discussing them, you would just use our general channel.",
            "As you've just mentioned, there is zero information in #server-news about any of the ANZIA events.  The Death Race event just says to respond with an emote in order for a chance to sign up, zero additional information about the structure of the race aside from the vehicle being used.\n\nI asked in the new player help and was told to ask in the general channel.  I asked in the general channel and got no response at all.  So then I asked in the Racing channel and got a response from a moderator who had no idea what I was talking about.",
            "Hi, you were responded to in the server with the link to the ANZIA race details. They are now in there.\n\nRegarding the death race, you aren't supposed to know things like the track layout, it is meant to be a surprise other than the vehicle used. It's a race in a Cyclone TR with a partner, the rest is obscured to prevent griefing issues. That being said, we could call that out better in the future and will do so.",

            "As a conversation in global chat went last night:\n\n\"Why can't we just have an option between 50 player lobbies, and 100 player lobbies?\"\n\n\"Because everyone would select 50 player lobbies and the servers would run smoothly.\"",
            "I don't get what people are all up in arms about XT...The servers were running like crap before XT went live. Until meshing drops they will probably continue to run like crap after XT ends. Everyone is acting like the servers are somehow magically butter when XT is off lol.",

            "Don't think Arena Commander maps are big enough for Xenothreat; from Pyro Gateway to the wreck site is something like 500+ km.\n\n\nYou'd need a map at the scale of Theaters of War, and the test runs they did of Theaters of War had many/most of the same problems as the PU (which is why they never released it).",
            "The PU already can\u2019t handle what happens when XT isn\u2019t around.\n\nXT is just something else for players to do, but not everyone participates in it.\n\nPU will still have its 30Ks and server errors when XT leaves.",
