            "As you've just mentioned, there is zero information in #server-news about any of the ANZIA events.  The Death Race event just says to respond with an emote in order for a chance to sign up, zero additional information about the structure of the race aside from the vehicle being used.\n\nI asked in the new player help and was told to ask in the general channel.  I asked in the general channel and got no response at all.  So then I asked in the Racing channel and got a response from a moderator who had no idea what I was talking about.",
            "Hi, you were responded to in the server with the link to the ANZIA race details. They are now in there.\n\nRegarding the death race, you aren't supposed to know things like the track layout, it is meant to be a surprise other than the vehicle used. It's a race in a Cyclone TR with a partner, the rest is obscured to prevent griefing issues. That being said, we could call that out better in the future and will do so.",
            "That link must have been sent after I already left the server.  Oh well.",
            "Hey Kamakazie! \n\nYou need to check out our #server-news channel for information. The death race info is in there currently and the ANZIA events will be added today. Race events usually get added the same week for visibility but we are a bit behind this week on getting them up. \n\nThanks for the feedback.\n\nEdit: regarding discussing them, you would just use our general channel.",
            "I joined the community Discord server and nobody there had any idea that 3 of the 4 of these events even existed.  No details at all for any of the ANZIA events and next to no information on the Death Race event.  There isn't even a channel or thread for discussing community events.\n\nTurns out where you actually need to go for information on these events is https://anziaracing.com/.",
            "Over halfway there, the June r/starcitizen monthly events calendar is here!\n\nSame with last month things are a bit light as both us and our partners recover from both ILW and their events as well as prepare for some cool upcoming stuff.\n\nTo kick us off this month we have not one...but TWO death races taking place on Saturday, June 15th, first we have our Death Race taking place at 5pm UTC followed by ANZIA Racing's \"Mountains of Mayhem\" at 10pm UTC. Following that we have two more races from ANZIA, the \"Anti-Gravity Racing League\" and the \"Warpath Rally\". All of the above events are open for signups and have pledge prizes for the winners. We encourage you to check them out!\n\nTo participate in any of the above events join the Discord server\u00a0[here](https://discord.gg/starcitizen)\u00a0and check our #server-news channel\u00a0[here](https://discord.com/channels/82210263440306176/1113146864804573285).\n\nThanks\n\nIan/hencaric"

I watched the broadcast live on Bilibili, but might've missed an answer or two due to multi-tasking.",
