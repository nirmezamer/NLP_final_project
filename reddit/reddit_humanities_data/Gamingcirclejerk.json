        "content": "**Rule 8**\n\nFirst, a reminder to keep following Rule 8: Censor Reddit screenshots (sub names and usernames). This does not apply to any other social media site. Feel free to share Twitter usernames and Facebook usernames and whatever the hell else. \n\nWe are simply keeping in-line with Reddit's Terms of Service. If you see other subreddits where they do not do this/do not enforce this, they are breaking the site-wide rules. \n\nPlease report any reddit screenshots that are not complying with this rule. We will continue warning all users to follow this rule whenever they post (see the stickied comment at the top of the comments thread, that's the warning) but we will not hesitate to ban people. \n\n**Lazy Posts and Spam**\n\nWe've been fighting to try and prevent this sub being taken over by certain karma farming users. These users post the same ragebait screenshots in multiple subreddits. Rarely are these relevant to this sub or funny or even providing any useful discussion. \n\nThis is not a subreddit for showcasing right-wing grifters and irrelevant YouTubers. We really don't need to know every time some Grumz, or whatever the fuck his name is, posts something to Twitter or has a bowel movement. If you really think these people are a threat to humanity or something, make a sub for that sort of content, just keep it off here. \n\nPost tweets from gamers that are actually funny, shit we can laugh at, copypasta material. Don't just post every time some idiot online is mildly transphobic. Stop posting entire comments sections, select the comment that's the most ridiculously stupid or make a meme making fun of the opinion. \n\n**Ban Amnesty**\n\nIf you have been permanently banned from this subreddit you're always welcome to message the mods to apologise for whatever it is you did. Please message using the system [here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FGamingcirclejerk&subject=&message=) and do not message any individual mods directly. You will be reported for harassment. \n\n**Gaming Unjerk**\n\nA lot of people on here seem to need/want somewhere to have serious, non-jerk conversations about gaming. Introducing [r/ Gamingunjerk](https://tinyurl.com/a67dnem3). It's a space where you can talk about whatever you want in the realm of gaming. Much like this place we will keep it free from queerphobia, white-chauvinism and general conservative/reactionary nonsense. \n\nDoesn't have to be super serious. It can be light-hearted but sincere conversations as well. We're keeping this space for jerking. That new space will be a place for you to 'put it away' and have a real conversation. \n\nYou can also share content you feel is interesting or worth a conversation such as youtube videos or articles or similar.\n\n------\n\nThank you for reading this. Hope you all have a great week.",

They're just getting the older games remade, over and over.",

I think the story is wrapped perfectly and trying to squeeze a third game out it would probably make an overall worse story.\n\nThey can make a new RED DEAD game, but it shouldn't be a redemption game. It should be set earlier and with a different cast of characters."
