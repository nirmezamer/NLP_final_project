            "Let\u2019s be honest if trunks actually did kill 18 most DB fans would bitch and moan about it since they\u2019d be upset for being denied the final form of the villain\n\nIt would be fitting for trunks to do though, some \u201cfor the greater good\u201d type shit",
            "Blow yourself up or leave, I don't care which!",
            "As it was, I could never really see him killing her in that moment. He's known for his no bullshit attitude but the guy is also pretty kind hearted, and I know he'd be able to reason out that they weren't the biggest priority despite how he felt. They were really just pawns that were equally as terrified of Cell if not more. \n\nPlus, I don't think they really did anything deserving of being killed at the moment. Everyone wanted to kill Goku once, and it's just a fact that Vegeta deserved that ass whooping he got. If she'd gone through with murdering him though, I do think this interaction would've ended much differently.",
            "He knew his boy krillin was gonna rizz up 18",
            "[The Lonely Archives verse](https://youtu.be/wb33F1llciw?feature=shared) has gotcha covered",
            "18 could've detonated her bomb herself like 16, right? I'm starting to think nobody there but Cell had the guts to do anything to her.",
            "This part is full of filler in the anime. In the original, Trunk didn't even managed to get close enough of 18. He got kicked by Vegeta, dispatched him as quickly as possible, THEN he (and everyone else) got a point-blank Solar Flare to the face mid-chase (Cell didn't flew upward to the sun's direction) as soon as she was spotted. Cell used this small window to quickly absorb 18 as everyone was blinded; no ridiculous chases, no Krillin and 16 beatings, no conversations.",
            "If we have to explain it in character. It could be reasoned that 18 is not the immediately problem. \n\nTrunks knows he's strong enough to beat Cell handily and he *thinks* he can fight off his Dad. So as long as he can quickly deal with Cell and/or Vegeta then 18 is just clean up after the fact assuming one of the others, like Krillin, doesn't kill her in the meantime.\n\nHe was unprepared for Krillin to get a boner.",
            "You could say that about multiple characters really:\n\n- Trunks\n- Vegeta\n- Goku (For the very quick moment he was there to save Tien and Piccolo)\n- Android 16 \n- Krillin (Both the remote or a well-placed Destructo Disc)\n\nThe only reason I point the finger at Vegeta mostly is because he was actively trying to have Cell reach his perfect form. Whereas everyone else there (except maybe Goku) was trying to make sure Cell didn\u2019t absorb A.18, while also making sure the (mostly) innocent A.18 didn\u2019t have to also die.",
