            "Let\u2019s be honest if trunks actually did kill 18 most DB fans would bitch and moan about it since they\u2019d be upset for being denied the final form of the villain\n\nIt would be fitting for trunks to do though, some \u201cfor the greater good\u201d type shit",

            "He knew his boy krillin was gonna rizz up 18",
            "As it was, I could never really see him killing her in that moment. He's known for his no bullshit attitude but the guy is also pretty kind hearted, and I know he'd be able to reason out that they weren't the biggest priority despite how he felt. They were really just pawns that were equally as terrified of Cell if not more. \n\nPlus, I don't think they really did anything deserving of being killed at the moment. Everyone wanted to kill Goku once, and it's just a fact that Vegeta deserved that ass whooping he got. If she'd gone through with murdering him though, I do think this interaction would've ended much differently.",
            "This part is full of filler in the anime. In the original, Trunk didn't even managed to get close enough of 18. He got kicked by Vegeta, dispatched him as quickly as possible, THEN he (and everyone else) got a point-blank Solar Flare to the face mid-chase (Cell didn't flew upward to the sun's direction) as soon as she was spotted. Cell used this small window to quickly absorb 18 as everyone was blinded; no ridiculous chases, no Krillin and 16 beatings, no conversations.",
            "18 could've detonated her bomb herself like 16, right? I'm starting to think nobody there but Cell had the guts to do anything to her.",

            "This subreddit doesn\u2019t allow users to post images in comments, so imagine, if you will, a two-panel comic starring the Heavy from the 2007 first-person shooter game Team Fortress 2. In the first panel, which has a blank white background, he is giving the camera a thumbs-up, smiling amicably. Behind him is a desk with a powered-off laptop resting on its surface. The caption above him reads, \u201c1) Open Reddit\u201d, implying that he is about to log on to social media. In the second panel, captioned \u201c2)\u201d, the background is now black, the sheer intensity of its darkness somehow casting shadows onto Heavy\u2019s back. The Russian man is now staring into a monitor, the contents of his social media jaunt unseen to the viewer, for better or for worse. It is likely that this is for the better, however, as Heavy\u2019s blank eyes and relaxed jaw imply that his consciousness is no longer present even though his body persists. This image may be seen as a commentary on the objectively reprehensible opinions certain social media users may express under the perceived veil of anonymity, shared either to disconcert other users as a joke, or due to a serious character flaw, the likes of which may require the help of a therapist to rectify.",
