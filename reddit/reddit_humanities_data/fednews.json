I had skills and education (I have my CDL and a B.S in Business Administration and Accounting) but it wasn't getting me anywhere. I was depressed and considering taking it all away \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14. \n\nIf it wasn't for Federal Service, I'd never have met my amazing wife (we met when we were at TSA, been dating for 3 years, and just got married in May), and I'd never have the career progression I have now with VA. I went from a WG-6 Caretaker to a GS-7 Program Suppory Assistant, and a few months ago, I was made a GS-7/9 Program Specialist. I have a career that I love, a wife and a life that I never thought would be possible. \n\nIdk, it just means so much to me to see all the good things I have around me, despite my mind telling me the world is out to get me.",

I did not have any vacation plans and next week is a short week so I just canceled my leave... but the days were blocked so I didn't have any meetings yesterday or today!  Two full days with no meetings is unheard of for me.  Might have to do this once a month on purpose."

        "content": "Today the Supreme Court came to a decision that will affect many of our jobs. They overturned the precedent from *Chevron USA vs NRDC*, by which courts deferred to experts in Federal Agencies on the interpretation of laws passed by Congress when promulgating rules and regulations. The basis for this was that Congress could not anticipate every technical nuance when they passed laws dealing with subjects such as environmental protection or public health protection, and Federal Agencies hired technical experts to do that interpretation. This was not popular with small-government activists such as the Koch Brothers.\n\nNow that this precedent has been chucked, I anticipate that my work at the Environmental Protection Agency will be subject to much uncertainty and a large number of lawsuits that stakeholders have kept in abeyance until *Chevron* were to be overturned. We might be forced to revisit many decisions and technical guidance that we have developed over years. The best guess is that environmental regulations will be weakened or totally revoked.\n\nWhat repercussions do you expect for your work at your Agency or Department? Will it factor into previous plans you had for how long you would stay in your job or in the Federal government?  \n",

            "We're going to (re)discover how unclear some legislation really is. We are going to rediscover that the congressional record often records disagreement over what this or that bill *really* intends. Statements from multiple Reps and Senators each stating their own version of what this or that bit of language means, with those statements all at odds with each other. \n\nThe reality is that Senators, Representatives, and their staff members can be *terrible* legal-technical writers, often on purpose because they intend for the civil service to figure it out. 40 years of laws written with the assumption that the civil service will figure it out. \n\nAnd now it's up to the courts to do that instead.",

            "In my role, I'm often asked to comment on or respond to proposed legislation. My typical stance is that Congress should write laws that are *less* specific, rather than more. Legislation should talk about outcomes Congress wants to achieve and leave the implementation up to the experts at agencies to achieve it. \n\nThe reason I give seems pretty basic: there is no way that a Congressperson, even with a well-informed staff, can possibly understand all the nuances of space travel and toxic waste and cyber security and PTSD and bridge construction and artificial intelligence and foreign espionage and and and and... It makes zero sense that a law should be so prescriptive.",
            "*What's the big deal?*, people may ask?\n\nhttps://www.eenews.net/articles/what-chevrons-end-could-mean-for-epa-climate-regulations/\n\n>In one well-known case, the Supreme Court relied on the Chevron doctrine in 2014 when it upheld EPA emissions reduction standards for 28 states whose air pollution crossed state lines and harmed downwind neighbors. Although the Clean Air Act is vague on the issue, the court ruled that EPA had reasonably interpreted its authority under the law.\n\n>It was the Reagan administration that benefited from the court\u2019s 1984 decision in *Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council.* The case arose out of a Reagan administration effort to limit emissions regulations by narrowly interpreting a Clean Air Act phrase. The Reagan EPA defined \u201cstationary sources of air pollution\u201d as an entire industrial site rather than each individual pollution source on a site. The 1977 Clean Air Act amendments had not defined the term \u201cstationary source.\u201d The EPA definition allowed facility owners to undertake projects that increased emissions in one part of the facility without triggering emissions reduction requirements \u2014 provided pollution from the whole facility stayed the same. The Natural Resources Defense Council said EPA\u2019s definition would exempt 90 percent of large industrial projects from pollution. It sued, arguing that each pollution source on a single site is subject to regulation. **The Supreme Court sided with EPA in a ruling aimed at forcing judges to defer to agency interpretations of law as long as they\u2019re \u201creasonable.\u201d** \u201cThe court in Chevron was reminding the judiciary not to try to substitute their policy judgments for those of agencies with more expertise,\u201d said Meiburg, a career EPA official who was serving at EPA in 1984.\n\nThat bolded line just got blown to Hell. \n\nJudges can now look at federal agencies and say \"Sure, you're reading the Congressional law to mean *X*, but **I** think it means *Y*, and I'm a judge, you're not, so I might agree with the people suing you instead if I think they're the ones being reasonable.\" and it's going to lead to the same sort of \"Jurisdiction Shopping\" that we see conservatives doing in Texas to get the right case in front of the right judge who can tell the entire federal government to pound sand because *he* feels that the agency is being 'unreasonable', and if Congress has a problem with how the judge interprets the law, Congress should write better laws, and if segments of the federal government crash and burn because a judge deems them 'unreasonable', that's a small price to pay for the principal of the thing.\n\nI don't see immediate repercussions at my Agency / Department, because it would take someone starting a new lawsuit to get in the way of something we're trying to do, and then it would go through the legal process, and I don't see that happening until after the November elections and everyone sees what the new lay of the land is.\n\nBut if this increases the enshittification of my employment, I'll retire, and go work for private industry.",
            "I anticipate having to waste our already dwindling budget and limited resources on litigation. I also anticipate leadership being afraid of making decisions over fear of litigation. I am concerned over my ability to reconcile my personal morals and passion for my agency\u2019s mission if we have to make all decisions based on congress\u2019 marginal writing abilities and the judiciaries beliefs.",
            "Some agencies are authorized by statutes that provide the agency head with explicit (but very broad) authority to draft rules and regs as the head deems necessary to run the program. Any GC attorneys in here have thoughts on whether there could be implications for those agencies as well?",
            "While Chevron has been overturned, the court did say it will respect the Skidmore Doctrine.  This doctrine is defined as the administrative-law principle that a federal agency's determination is entitled to judicial respect if the determination is authorized by statute and made based on the agency's experience and informed judgment. See Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134 (1944). Under Skidmore, the level of deference given to an agency\u2019s interpretation is based on the degree of the agency\u2019s care; the agency\u2019s consistency, formality, and relative expertise; and the persuasiveness of the agency\u2019s position"
