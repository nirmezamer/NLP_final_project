        "content": "Today the Supreme Court came to a decision that will affect many of our jobs. They overturned the precedent from *Chevron USA vs NRDC*, by which courts deferred to experts in Federal Agencies on the interpretation of laws passed by Congress when promulgating rules and regulations. The basis for this was that Congress could not anticipate every technical nuance when they passed laws dealing with subjects such as environmental protection or public health protection, and Federal Agencies hired technical experts to do that interpretation. This was not popular with small-government activists such as the Koch Brothers.\n\nNow that this precedent has been chucked, I anticipate that my work at the Environmental Protection Agency will be subject to much uncertainty and a large number of lawsuits that stakeholders have kept in abeyance until *Chevron* were to be overturned. We might be forced to revisit many decisions and technical guidance that we have developed over years. The best guess is that environmental regulations will be weakened or totally revoked.\n\nWhat repercussions do you expect for your work at your Agency or Department? Will it factor into previous plans you had for how long you would stay in your job or in the Federal government?  \n",

            "In my role, I'm often asked to comment on or respond to proposed legislation. My typical stance is that Congress should write laws that are *less* specific, rather than more. Legislation should talk about outcomes Congress wants to achieve and leave the implementation up to the experts at agencies to achieve it. \n\nThe reason I give seems pretty basic: there is no way that a Congressperson, even with a well-informed staff, can possibly understand all the nuances of space travel and toxic waste and cyber security and PTSD and bridge construction and artificial intelligence and foreign espionage and and and and... It makes zero sense that a law should be so prescriptive.",

I am concerned over my ability to reconcile my personal morals and passion for my agencys mission if we have to make all decisions based on congress marginal writing abilities and the judiciaries beliefs.",
            "While Chevron has been overturned, the court did say it will respect the Skidmore Doctrine.  This doctrine is defined as the administrative-law principle that a federal agency's determination is entitled to judicial respect if the determination is authorized by statute and made based on the agency's experience and informed judgment. See Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134 (1944). Under Skidmore, the level of deference given to an agencys interpretation is based on the degree of the agencys care; the agencys consistency, formality, and relative expertise; and the persuasiveness of the agencys position",
            "Some agencies are authorized by statutes that provide the agency head with explicit (but very broad) authority to draft rules and regs as the head deems necessary to run the program. Any GC attorneys in here have thoughts on whether there could be implications for those agencies as well?",
            "Circuits will be divided. Offices across the country will do thing ass differently rather than just infuriatingly differently. Chaos.",
            "This will fuck up and slow down literally every piece of legislation that requires an agency to do something. Which is like *all* legislation. They will be at a standstill, not able to implement anything because Congress does not take the time or have the knowledge to write, in the law, the inner- workings of how an agency should do/not do/enforce or create something. Which is why we have agencies."

The first step is usually having our supervisor review, but this process can take a very long time, given the normal time constraints of supervisors. It really grinds ability to move forward with work to a halt for weeks or even sometimes a month+ while things sit with my supervisor.\n\n  \nI don't have an issue at all with my supervisor reviewing things, but the timing component makes project management difficult. This is also coupled with a review process that includes other stakeholders who will also need time to review things.\n\nIs there a way to improve this process? Any help offered is appreciated.",

I was in a program out of college where I jumped up from GS 5 to 7 to 9 to 11 to 12 every year. \n\nNow that agency has switched to ACQDemo I went to the bottom of NH III (GS 12-13 pay) as soon as I hit 12. I interviewed for a job recently that just a few years ago was a GS 13. I got the job which was great. However my raise this year was like 2% before cost of living. So I\u2019m basically a GS 12 step 2 working a job where I would be making 15 grand more if I qualified for the the job a few years ago.\n\nHas anyone experienced this? I\u2019m a 0340 program managemer in a STRESSFUL job  and would be making the same amount of money if I stayed in my easy as hell 0343 program analyst job. \n\nIt\u2019s a shame because I love the job even though it\u2019s stressful but I feel like I have to apply for other agencies to get the 13 pay for the job I\u2019m doing. \n\nNot sure if anyone else has experienced this.\n\nThanks friends. \n\n",
