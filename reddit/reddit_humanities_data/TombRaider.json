            "Might check out Omnibus 1 and 2, are there digital versions available?",
            "I've been doing exactly this! I just got a few issues of the top cow comics a few weeks ago. The comics can redue her to an object at times, but I really enjoy seeing classic Lara get some fleshed-out characterization.",
            "Question is the novels based on angel of darkness cannon?",
