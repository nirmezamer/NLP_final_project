Today I highlighted the tank sim [*Steel Thunder*](https://greatestgames.substack.com/p/the-classic-pc-gaming-era-1977-1989-5b1) from MicroProse, and later this week we'll discuss the arcadey sim with light real time strategy components *Sherman M4* from French publisher Loriciels and *UFO* from subLOGIC, a weirdly serious otherworldly flight sim based on the same core tech that powered *Microsoft Flight Simulator* and the core *Flight Simulator* games from the 1980s.\n\nYou can find all that - and a lot more! - at [https://greatestgames.substack.com](https://greatestgames.substack.com). \n\nWe're going to be moving on soon to racing and driving games, sports games and fighters and brawlers for 1980s computer platforms. And sometime later this year, we'll shift into the arcades and consoles with a look at their greatest 1980s games. It's going to be a blast!",
