I heard that Nilou would get a rerun very soon, and I\u2019m at pity so I\u2019m excited but\u2026 I\u2019m a person who gets a lot of drive by building characters and doing tons of dmg, and i\u2019m wondering if I should get Furina? I really like her design, I don\u2019t like her personality, amazing va btw, but I think that will change when I\u2019m completely done with fountains story? I heard she becomes more likeable. Should I get Furina the god tier char or should I stay strong for Nilou?",
