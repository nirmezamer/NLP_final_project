I\u2019ve seen at least 5 today when looking for co-op worlds to join and I\u2019m just wondering what it is (America server btw) \n\n  \n((update: they are mostly level 25-35 from what I\u2019ve seen))",

            "Hey guys so i just came back to playing after almost a year of break and i want to rebuild my acc, which artifact domain is much more efficient? EoSF, GilDream, Maracheusser (whatever that artifact name is). Mainly my goal is to build furina, yelan, and if the other artifact set can be used by my other units like yae, kuki, fischl or whatever then i can put them on that piece. Thankyou!!",

            "A friend of mine gave me his account cus he has like thousands of them and i wanted to explore new characters, so I open his account and see neuvi and kazuha, I started looking for furina and fishcl and didn't found them but instead I found xingqui raiden and yae, so now i am using neuvi, kazu, xq, raiden. Does this team work? I haven't done much research on neuvi",
            "I wanted to ask if am the only one lagging in Sumeru because before 4.7 I were doing fine in Sumeru without lag now even the sound suthering i don't understand why this happening i don't have any problem with the others region\u00a0",

Well that's exactly what I used to do.  \n\nSo, now the game has much more content than it had back then , so I want to know the fastest route to get my choice of characters\nAlso, I can buy welkins too\nNot crystals tho, those are scams"

            "\\[Alhaitham/Furina\\]\n\nI have a bit of choice paralysis here. Mostly F2P here (if you don't count Welkin Moon which I don't), started really playing heavily right when Sumeru dropped and took a very long break from the game. Please note that I'm still in post-Liyue progression (I'm exploring that one area with all the lotus leaves and stuff now) so I have lot of world to explore.  \n  \nI have C0 Diluc as my main damage dealer (lost pity on Ayako a long time ago), C3 Diona, C2 Sucrose, C0 Xingqiu as my main team (occasionally swapping in C0 Bennett for one of those). Waiting in the wings for when I finally get off my ass and progress through Inazuma: C0 Nahida, C1 Kuki, C1 Xiangling, C2 Faruzan.  \n  \nI have a couple of other C0's/C1's that aren't really remarkable/I don't have any interest in, or from what I gather they all require teams that I don't have. (C1 Mika, C0 Layla (who seems great but only at higher Constellations), C0 Yun Jin, C0 Gorou, C0 Collei, C0 Barbara, C0 Candace, C0 Lynette, C1 Dori).  \n  \nI'm not counting chars like Lisa/Noelle/Amber b/c lol no. All that being said who should I roll for? I'm leaning toward Furina since she seems to be pretty universally used in a lot of teams but I really don't know if I should just go for Alhaitham instead.",
            "\\[Alhaitham\\]\n\ni have Jade Cutter on Alhaitham but i just lost 50/50 to Absolution. is it better than Jade Cutter on him?",
            "\\[Clorinde\\]  \nWould Thoma be a good/decent character on an overload team with her?  If so, what does he bring to the party?",
            "I\u2019m newish to the game, AR 23. I managed to get Clorinde, and am trying to make a team with her for the open world and abyss. The other characters I have are Charlotte, Yaoyao, Collei, Thoma (c2), Diluc, Noelle, Bennet (c2), Xiangling, Barbara, Lisa, Kaeya, and Amber.\u00a0\n\nAnyone have any suggestions? I tried using a team builder, but I\u2019m not too confident in what I was given, as I have no clue why I was suggested the teams it gave me, so I figured I could ask here as well.",
            "Trying to make an alhaithem team but idk who to use. should I go al, Dendro traveler, fichle, and beido? I have Collie but that's all the Dendro I have",
            "Hi! I'm quite lost here after quitting for about 2 years.\n\nQuestions are:\n\n1. I'm very outdated on team building. Given I don't like 2 current banners, who in 4.8 should I target? (I've guarantee in stock) For background, my main DPS was Ganyu and I have Noelle and Razor built (lvl 80). For support, I've FIshcl, Barbara, Diona, Qiqi, Bennette. Xingqiu is half-built.\n\nMy others 5\\* are: Yae Miko, Raiden, Wanderer, Ito and Jean. Most of them are from my short comeback \"pull for fun\" so not built at all).\n\n2. In order to built newer characters, I've to go to so many places that haven't unlocked yet. Can I go straight (walk) to them or they are locked behind story quest?\n\n3. Is there any good guide for \"comeback\" player? So many things to do and I don't know which to focus first.\n\n4. I'm at the beginning of chapter 2 (next destination is Inazuma). How far until I get Dendro MC? \n\n  \n-- \n\nedited - correct words, and add 4.",
            "\\[Clorinde\\]\n\nI've decided to make a team with Clorinde with Fischl, DMC, and Sucrose and I have a lot of questions lol.\n\n1. Should Clorinde use Thundering Fury or Harmonic Whimsey?\n2. Should DMC be built with enough ER to burst every time she is on field?\n3. Is Sucrose's best in slot weapon for a team like this TTDS?\n4. If Harmonic Whimsey is optimal what is the best rotation? DMC EQ, Fischl E or Q (whichever isn't on cooldown), Sucrose E, Clorinde Q then her E combo until it runs out? I'm guessing Sucrose should only ever burst if Clorinde doesn't have enough energy recharge so you need to stall for a second to get her skill back up.",
            "I'm pre farming artifacts for furina but the domain won't stop giving me terrible artifacts, the strongbox has been very useful to me to get good artifacts except that golden troupe is not in the artifact strongbox, how can I get it there? Do i gotta do the archon quest?",
            "Based on my team, which one would be better, Yelan or Furina?\n\n[Team Roster](https://imgur.com/a/FHV6p3x)",
            "Back in the game after a long hiatus (last time I played, there was only Mondstat and Liyue!)\n\nWhat teams would you suggest for overworld (I know you can use whoever, but I'd like a mix of elements, decent synergy, and an archer) and for Spiral Abyss?\n\n5*: Xiao, Jean, Venti, Keqing, Baizhu\n\n4*: Xiangling, C4 Bennet, C1 Amber, Thoma, C1 Xinyan, \nC1 Xingqiu, C4 Barbara, \nDiona, C1 Kaya, \nC6 Noelle, Ningguang, \nC2 Razor,  C1 Lisa,   C1 Sethos, C3 Beidou, Collei, \nC1 Faruzan, Lynette, Surcrose. \n\nNobody is fully built and I don't have any 5* weapons.

They got handled with the most care by the writing staff, giving them all the time they needed to establish themselves in a natural way and carry the story of their nations. \n\nEvents (slightly biased?): His best times may have been a long time ago, but back when Albedo was one of the event Archons his appearance usually meant that we would get a fantastic story or even more fantastic lore, usually involving his backstory and/or Rhinedottir in some way. Sadly, after Windblume's breath in 3.5 his appearances completely vanished and Furina and Itto took the spots of the event Archons\n\nHonorable mentions 5*: Xiao and Navia\n\nHonorable mentions 4*: Fischl and Collei",
