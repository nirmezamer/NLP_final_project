        "content": "Dear valued users,\n\nWe sincerely appreciate your continued attention and support to Pandabuy. Recently, our company has encountered legal issues related to our services, as our senior management is actively cooperating with the police investigation. Currently, we are fully collaborating with the relevant authorities to ensure that all our business activities comply with legal regulations.\n\nWe understand that this situation may have caused inconvenience and concern for you. Please rest assured that we are actively addressing these issues and commit to keeping you informed of any developments. In the meantime, our team and the authorities are taking every necessary measure to protect your rights and ensure data security.\n\nWe kindly ask for your patience and understanding as we strive to restore normal operations as quickly as possible. During this challenging period, we pledge to prioritize serving you to the best of our abilities.\n\nOnce again, we thank you for your understanding and support and we apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.\n\nPandabuy's online customer service, community management, and other departments will begin handling your inquiries today. If your questions have not been answered yet, please be patient with our customer service and mods. Due to the high volume of inquiries, we will do our best to respond to you as soon as possible.\n\nTo help users understand the situation more quickly, we have collected some of the most frequently asked questions below:\n\n**Regarding Orders and Packages**  \nQ: Can I still place orders on the platform?  \nA: Currently, Pandabuy accounts cannot conduct transactions such as recharging, paying orders, or handling packages. The police investigation is still not over, our warehouse is still not back to normal, and due to the freezing of some of our funds, We are currently unable to provide services such as top-ups and withdrawals at this time. We are negotiating with the third-party payment company to restore the function as soon as possible for everyone to use, once restored, we will make an announcement in the community and the platform. Please be patient for a while, Pandabuy will still provide you with the best service.\n\nQ: What should I do if the seller does not ship the goods?  \nA: You can contact purchasing consultation; the shipping time depends on the seller.\n\nQ: What should I do if purchasing does not reply? What is the response time?  \nA: Purchasing has begun replying to customer inquiries in sequence. Due to the large volume of inquiries, please be patient.\n\nQ: Is my stored order/package/account/order/parcel on the way safe? / What if parcels in the warehouse cannot be shipped? Should I cancel the parcel? Do I need to submit the parcel?  \nA: Please understand that we are actively addressing the current issues. Please remain patient, and we will resume normal operations as soon as possible. Please wait for official announcements regarding the restoration time, at which point warehouse colleagues will proceed with signing, inspection, packaging, and shipping tasks in sequence. If you have related order or parcel needs, you can contact online customer service again. If your parcel is in transit, it will not be affected.\n\n**Regarding Refunds**  \nThe platform is still cooperating with the investigation and the warehouse is still organising goods. Regarding your item/parcel, we are still waiting for the results of the investigation and the results of the sorting before we can confirm the final status and resolution. So we are temporarily holding your refund request. We fully understand the anxiety of everyone waiting, please give us time. We will do our best to resume normal operations as soon as possible. Thank you again for your understanding and support.\n\n**Regarding Logistics**  \nQ: Any situation requiring consultation with the logistics department, such as abnormal logistics trajectories, insurance, redelivery, compensation, and after-sales inquiries.  \nA: For inquiries regarding your parcel status, please contact the logistics provider for verification. Please wait for official announcements regarding the restoration time, and we will assist you with your inquiries at that time.\n\nThis April has been particularly challenging for Pandabuy. However, we will persevere and overcome this difficulty. We earnestly ask everyone to have more patience and understanding towards Pandabuy, and we also appreciate everyone's attention to Pandabuy. We are actively cooperating with investigations, and we will correct any problems identified. Even if there are no problems, we will conduct internal reforms and reflections to continue providing everyone with a satisfactory shopping platform.\n\nSinserely,  \nPandabuy Team",
