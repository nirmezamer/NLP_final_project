            "The Passionate Tudor by Alison Weir",
            "Have started **The Collapsing Empire** by John Scalzi, I'm about 70% through it and think I'll be picking up the other books in this trilogy.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0I'll also continue the **Dungeon Crawler Carl** series, have read the first two books and loved them. Don't know if I'll read them as a palate cleanser in between the Scalzi ones or if I'll do each series separately.",
            "Just finished THE ROOK, by Steven James. This is book 2 in the Patrick Bowers files. Patrick Bowers is an FBI Criminologist. Really enjoying the series. Now starting on THE CAINE MUTINY, by Herman Wouk. Two chapters in and I can tell I'm going to love it. I try to do1 contemporary fiction,1 classic,\u00a0 1 nonfiction, in rotation. Enough people have called this a modern classic that I'm counting it as this month's classic.",
            "Previously finished 11.22.63, The Watchers, and The Creeper earlier this month.  Currently reading Winterset Hollow.",
            "Currently reading two:\n\n**The Arc Files** (from Prime Reading, Eden Black Archaeological Thrillers Book 1)\n\n**Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear Vol. 7** (fun quick read series, OP clueless MC)\n\n**ShipCore Vol. 1** (Litrpg style space with a Project Hail Mary feel so far)",

            "Hi, all!\n\nI recently subscribed to KU. I was wondering if anyone had any good psychological thriller, horror, and/or sci-fi recommendations! I am open to audiobooks and ebooks :)\n\nSome books that I have read and enjoyed in the past:\n\nSharp Objects\nInto the Water\nWhere the Crawdads Sing by\nThe Silent Patient\nDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\nThank you in advance!\n\nP.S. I am not a romantic books girly, so I would like books that keep romance to a minimum!",
            "Recently finished the first of a KU trilogy - **Pictures of You** from Leta Blake. Part gay 90s Coming of age / Part Smut. A pretty good if not slightly predictable story that has plenty of hot under the collar moments, if you like that sort of thing (appears I now do). Some very likeable characters.\n\nWas just what I needed after previously finishing a heavier/darker but enthralling title - **Saving Noah** - Lucinda Berry.  \n\nWill be moving on to the 2nd in the series today - **You are not Me**.\n\nAside from that, I'm a few chapters into **The Red House** - Roz Watkins, a thriller which is proving to be an interesting read. Teen murder's almost all his family, creates a video game, crashes his car rendering himself comatose. Many years later, it is rumoured that the game he created has a hidden level within it, which reveals what really happened on that night of the murder. Was he really guilty? Who knows ;)..."
