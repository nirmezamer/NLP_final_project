            "Dream come true for Richard.\n\nThis must\u2019ve been a cakewalk for him to drum compared to his other metal band experience!",

            "I remember I was a freshman in High-school around 07 and I downloaded some stern shows to my iPod Video. I was watching it and this kid who was super into metal saw Richard and was telling me how big Richard was in that scene and I was shocked. Apparently Richard is like one of the highest regarded metal drummers of his time. I'm shocked he was basically homeless in Florida and never got picked up by like Korn or some other big metal band when they lost their drummers.",
            "That is one of the most badass things for Richard. Being able to play drums live with one of your all-time favourite bands must have felt amazing! He did great, I'm so happy for him! \n\nGreat job drumming Bub!",
            "Coheed is like Richard's favorite band.This man has been living his dream for like 20 years. And I'll say again, for how much they shit talk him, Richard is more talented at drums than any of them have ever been at ANYTHING, including Howard."
