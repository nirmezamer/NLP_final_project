            "Does anyone have some good examples of the Sororitas Exorcist vehicle redressed for Chaos? It would look so good for Word Bearers and the old Chaos Rhino is shows quite a lot of age in comparison.",
            "I am building a chaos space marines incursion list. Right now I have a Chaos Lord with a mark of Slaanesh leading a 5 man Chosen with a mark of Khorn.\n\nIf I use the Torpefying Refrain stratagem on this unit. Does only the chaos lord get the \"If youer unit is a slaanesh unit, until the end of turn, your unit is eligible to shoot and declare a charge in a turn in which it Advanced or fell back\" bonus?\n\nI would obviously like if having two different marks on a single unit, thanks to having a leader, got me benefits they otherwise couldn't get, but I also understand how that may not be the rules are written.",
            "When I'm rerolling dice (specifically with Oath of Movement or Command Reroll), do I have to reroll all the dice that failed, all the dice in general or only 1 die?",
            "Does the Core rule Change also applys for Combat Patrol?\n\nFor example the New rule that you can use reinforcement Stratagems only once per Game would be a huge Nerf on the Astra Militarum Combat Patrol that very much rely on this Stratagems.",
            "Question about a 9th edition rule, \n\nDo named characters always have their specified warlord traits, regardless of whether they are a warlord or not?  \n\nI'm confused because most sources say that they need to be nominated for warlord first, except for this one definition here. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0wsoflmfet7d1.png?width=742&format=png&auto=webp&s=e38d8bf6246991adaaf69f17406cd266a5556b7e",
            "I'm done my first pass at narrowing down which two factions to start WH40K with, and would appreciate your input to help me narrow it down. Obviously I don't yet own any codices for specific unit info, and only have 10th Ed indices to look through.\n\n* Experienced tabletop gamer / playtester who's new to wargames\n* Johnny+Spike. Will definitely attend local Strikeforce tournaments. I'd see the game as a challenge vs myself more than anything else.\n\nWhat I enjoy and am looking for in descending order of importance:\n\n1. Adaptability\n2. Certainty and consistency in achieving results of \"at least x\", at the expense of power if need be\n   * Flat bonuses\n   * Re-Rolls\n   * Not relying on crits\n   * Crit fail impact reduction\n   * Faction's fave strategems are those that are used on my turns, as opposed to defensively\n   * My high mobility gives me more options to make the right decision\n3. Increasing opponent uncertainty by non-strategem means\n   * Flat negative modifiers\n   * High mobility / deepstrike encourages the opponent to make contingencies\n4. I don't want to retire my minis anytime soon, and I have no idea which minis are new vs due to be made into 'Legends'.\n\nGiven those criteria, the rest of the focus would be on points and winning. That is to say I'd rather the above criteria be met and lose games due to my decisions and bad meta than regularly win through a 50% coin toss.\n\nI like pretty much all the lore. If I have 'gotcha' abilities, I always remind opponents about them. I can have fun with hordes, or just a few units. I care more about depth than complexity, if that makes any sense.",
            "Last year when they made making army lists free on the gw app I made like 6 lists and I\u2019m still able to view and edit them if I sign into my gw app with my account now will it delete those armies? Also if I pay for premium make a bunch of armies then when I cancel the membership do I keep all the army lists I made?",
            "So outside of asking a TO to overule it, is it still correct that non-codex Chapter unique marine units (e.g crusade squad, proteus killteam) can't have an Apothecary/Lt+(Captain/Chapter master) as although they would normally both be allowed to attach, the unique units aren't in the \"above list\" called out in the ability of the Apoth/Lt?",
            "Question on a combo before I commit to it.\n\nWith the Repulsor update I believe 6 Eradicators and an attached Gravis Captain will fit in a 14 capacity Repulsor.\n\nCan the Vanguard Spearhead stratagem \"calculated feint\" allowing you to \"make a normal move up to d6 inches\" in the charge phase allow you to re-embark into the repulsor if charged and the repulsor isn't in engagement range?\n\nTo my understanding the only restriction would be that you can't disembark and embark in the same phase. Meaning disembarking during movement and re-embarking if charged should work.",

            "In the trailer they get that currency when finishing a mission, it\u2019s essentially unlock tokens so you pick what you unlock instead of having to wait till a certain level to unlock something.\n\nImagine you really like a certain color or armor but you have to play 100 hours to get it. With this system, you can just get it right away",
            "I don't remember the exact wording the use, but they will have micro transactions but for cosmetic items only. It was something along the lines of not having an in-game shop, then the dlc would be free, and then their next statement was something about purchases would be for cosmetic items only.",
