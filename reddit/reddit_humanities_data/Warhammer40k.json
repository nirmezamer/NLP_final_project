            "I've just got my first job since I've graduated college a year ago. I've went to the GW store once a month for the free mini for the past year, and I want to finally get a set to celebrate once I get my first paycheck. I'm looking at the different options, but I'm not sure as to what I want to get because I was/am too poor to think about it until now lol\n\nWhat are you guy's suggestions for a good celebration set?",
            "Question about being combat. If my unit is in melee combat and I remove units after being shot at from the front line so I\u2019m no longer in engagement range. Does that unit then start the turn no longer locked in combat and can move and shoot, freely?",
            "I'm thinking I should start taking notes during my games so I can \"review the tapes\", so to speak. However there is a TON of information being generated each turn. What are the things I should absolutely be tracking?",
            "What do you guys do with your old brushes?\n\nI've got about 50 spent brushes and while some can be repurposed for drybrushing I don't know what to do with the rest and I'm loathed to just throw them out.",
            "Just bought a pack of Vanguard Veteran Squad w/ Jump Packs this past weekend. Given that they are not the \"pop in/pop out\" kind of mini, and the fact that I don't want to glue them together, I'm thinking of magnetizing them. Any suggestions on tutorial videos for that & where to find the right magnets needed?",
            "Did GW ever update Combat Patrol rules?",
            "Can someone tell me where the Indomitus Lieutenant is in battlescribe? I don't see an option for his Volkite pistol or shield.\n\nThank you",
            "I'm getting ready to start my 40k journey but I'm a little confused on what rules are okay to buy. I want to play sisters and a friend of mine gifted me their \"pile of shame\". I'm planning to put together a 500/1000 point list. Is there somewhere that I can find the detachment rules? Or do I need to buy the new codex? Or what rules do I need to get? \n\nI heard there was a lot of stuff changed recently and I don't want to buy something that is already out of date or going to be out of date before my first game with friends. I don't know how these things work.",
            "Hey so I have a previous version custodes combat patrol box, would it still be as balanced? Did they just change things up for fun, or would it no longer be viable if some friends and I were thinking of just getting a combat patrol each? Never played only painted.\n\nAlso I\u2019ve been veering away from custodes as I\u2019ve fallen for the whole imperial agents thing, is there any form of combat patrol with them as the flavour? Love me some inquisition \ud83d\udc4d"

I tried selling some of it a short time ago and I lost so much money. But the loss of money in the Hobby is a nice part. I mean I buy a box and Boom, I lost 25% of the gw value, as soon as the return is expired. Then I rip it open and now I lost 2 or 3 more Euros. Then I build them and Boom they are 20% less worth. After that prime them and lose another 5%. Then Paint and Base them and they're basically worthless now and I love it. I got hours of fun and there is not a chance in the world for me to make any money with it. ",

If it's the main focus of an endeavor, then it's a job.\n\nI accept the loss of money towards plastic crack because Warhammer brings me pleasure. I have made exactly 20$ out of it, and spent many times that. Most people in this hobby won't make a cent off it. But here we all are, because it brings us pleasure!",

            "The need to monetise everything in life, down to what are meant to be the things you do to relax, is an annoying trend in the last few years. It's a stupid counter argument to stagnant wages, just turn your hobbies into money making schemes!\n\nOr just have something you enjoy regardless, we all probably don't want to admit how much we have spent of warhammer, or other game systems, but it makes us happy so who cares.",
