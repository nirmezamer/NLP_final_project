            "sometimes slow-play isnt slow-play. Ive set up flood gates before and have my opponent freeze for a good 2-3 minutes. But then they suddenly break my board after figuring out an extensive combo. I have respect for those kind of players. they were probably writing down the step by step solution.",
            "This event has really opened the doors for me to pure zoodiac. Their strategy is stupid easy and it\u2019s the only deck that has made me feel super confident going second. This is probably because 80% of the deck is hand traps \ud83d\ude02\n\nThe game feels sluggish going back to crazy combo decks now",
