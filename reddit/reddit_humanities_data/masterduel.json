            "I have a bit of a personal rant...\n\nI have been playing with my friends since day 1 and have been the focus of negative comments and bullying on my deck choices. Let's take into account that 2 of us haven't played yu gi oh in years while one other friend has been up to date with the series.\n\nI will divide it by deck choices:\n\n1- Drytrons: I picked this deck since the secret packs had some galactic bears or something and I wanted to try those out. As I looked up for suitable decks with what I had, drytrons seemed like a popular choice so I went with it. I had no idea they were so broken, it was an honest \"mistake\". They wouldn't stop bashing me, saying how I only play meta decks and that its boring to play with me.\n\n2- Toon deck: I asked my friend if toons was a viable deck, since i didn't want to repeat the drytron situation. He said no, that it was gimmicky and non meta, so i went with it as they always looked quite fun. I absolutely destroy them with that deck. 3 turn kills, all BLS spam, they start saying its annoying, how I am a brain dead player with no strategy in mind.\n\n3- Monarchs: I once again ask, is monarchs viable as it seemed underpower with no extra deck and lots of tribute summons. they say its fine. I negate all their decks with my Domain. They are frustated that they can't have fun and use their extra deck\n\nAt this point I am tired, I have wasted all my gems and I am working on a Dragonmaid deck, because fuck them. I want to have fun playing this game but apparently all my choices are the wrong choices.",
            "20 deck slots? It\u2019s the first month and I have 5 complete decks without spending a cent. \n\n30 bookmarks? They were full with staples the first couple days. \n\nReally hope they increase these ASAP.",
            "I don\u2019t understand this shit and it\u2019s making me nuts. How can I go on a 12 game win streak in platinum, then get one win away from plat 1 and go on a 14 game in a row losing streak. \n\nSuddenly my opponents always have perfect hand traps, make no mistakes, never scoop, and I can\u2019t draw any of my staples or kaijus. Six kaijus in a 40 card deck, what are the chances I didn\u2019t draw a single one 14 games in a row. It\u2019s so frustrating. It\u2019s like the game knows you\u2019re almost there, and then screws you over on purpose. \n\nEvery time I get to plat 3, I face almost exclusively plat 1s. Then plat 2 finally. Drytron 5 games in a row.",
            "I put a win more card on my deck but I'm winning less, how could this be",
            "Ugh, maintenance. \n\nIs this what heroin withdrawal feels like?",
            "Would be nice if there is a \"in a nutshell\" compilation of what the meta decks are in the \"New Player Quick Tips\" section. Maybe it could be a new thread on its own? \n\nI suggest a format like this:\n\nDeck: Toons\n\nPlaystyle: Destroys opponents with monsters that can attack directly even when there are monsters on the opponents field.\n\nStrengths: Toon monsters can stay on the field even when destruction effects are activated and Comic Hand is a scary card that can turn the enemy's boss monster against them.\n\nWeakness: Without Toon Kingdom, the deck cries like a b\\*tch.\n\nThis could help players in choosing a deck they want to start playing with or find new decks to play with.\n\n(Note: Yes, I know Toons are not that hot. This is just an example).",
            "can we add a FAQ section? and include the \"guaranteed UR stays even if your secret pack expires\" to this FAQ? because it still gets asked 20 times a day",
            "made it to plat 1 with adamancipator.\n\nnow i can play my yugiboomer dark magician deck in peace.",
