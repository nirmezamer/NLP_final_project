        "content": "For anyone who comes in wondering about this magnetic cable or that. Here is some good commentary on the dangers of magnetic cables. Not to mention the large majority of [kickstarters](https://www.reddit.com/r/shittykickstarters/comments/6qmcn3/crowdfunded_magnetic_usb_chargers_thread_v21/) that have failed to deliver anything other than an aliexexpress rebrand.\n\nEdit: Let me make this clear. **USB-C magnetic tip adaptors or cables are not compliant with the USB specifications.** This means any resulting damage to products, which is a very real possibility even if it is a relatively small chance, would not be covered by product warranties. Therefore, these cables and adaptors are not recommended and future posts asking for such recommendations will be locked. It will stay like this until some big company like microsoft or apple and or the USB group comes up with a cable design that is safe.\n\n**I am not saying that these cables do not exist or that they do not work as claimed however there is an inherent risk when using these cables and that will fall onto the reader to decide for themselves.**\n\nTo quote /u/chx_\n\n> There are two risks\n> \n> As mentioned, static electricity is a huge problem. Look at any connector and it has the exact same generic shape: a gigantic grounding shroud protecting the data pins. DisplayPort, HDMI, USB of all variants. But if you go back, back, back, VGA and all its ancient DB friends, DVI, whatnot -- even those were the same, just there was more plastic. This generic idea stretches back to the dawn of (computer) time. Exposing the pins just like that makes your laptop very suspectible for static electricity. Ever felt the hairs on your arm stand up after changing clothes? Congrats, you just fried your laptop if you touch it like that. https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/511QlHyl8CL._AC_SL1000_.jpg see how they are out in the open? And this issue is inherent to the overall physical requirements of the plug.\n\n> Connection/data loss due to electronic noise. There was a fun problem where Dell laptops used to drop their TB3 connections unless you limited their wifi transmission power. This took Dell significant time and expense to figure out. And that's Dell, not some random tiny company... Want to go there with a who-knows-what built system when NathanK already told you explicitly the pogo pins are too noisy electronically? https://twitter.com/USBCGuy/status/1095614250414796800\n\n> Also he mentions https://twitter.com/USBCGuy/status/1186718432932159488 using optoelectronical couplers you could do something by completely disconnecting the magnetic pins from actual USB C connector and letting current flow only when the other half of the connector is connected and VCONN power is present. Of course, your isolation is now a few mm of air, pray your static electronic charge doesn't arc over it... hope you rather live in Phoenix than here in Raincouver! https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andreas_Neuber2/publication/3165903/figure/fig17/AS:668977227386923@1536508008917/Breakdown-voltage-in-air-versus-relative-humidity-with-an-alumina-surface-Electrode.png\n\n> I am reasonably sure there are gigantic companies which would just love if this worked. Riddle me this: why do you think Apple didn't put this on the market? Do they lack the R&D dollars? :) Somewhere in that sixteen billion dollar yearly R&D spending I am reasonably sure you could find a few (hundred...) millions to resolve this issue if it were possible. And yet, Kickstarters with a few hundred ... thousand raised claim they can? What's wrong with this picture? Look at the Thunderbolt 3 Pro cable they released: it's an active USB C cable, it's an active TB3 cable and costs a fortune. There's nothing even similar on the market but where there's a will, there's a way. They have designed a custom ASIC for that cable which can amplify both USB C and TB3 signals -- both existed separately but having them in a single cable before was thought impossible. This is to demonstrate: if they could, they would. And if it would be really expensive, hundreds of dollars per connector, have you seen that thousand bucks monitor stand :) ?",

            "Tiny nitpick: I doubt optocouplers are filled with air. Probably some sort of transparent dielectric. So the breakdown voltage would be significantly higher.",
            "The whole static argument is stupid. ESD failures are so rare with modern electronics its basically pointless to worry about them nowadays.",
            "is Volta dangerous? I'm using it to charge my Samsung Galaxy S10.",
            "So what are you saying? Is discussion on \"what magnetic ones are recommended\" not allowed now?\n\nIf so that's ridiculous, people have to go to other subs instead of the sub literally designed for USB-C discussion?",
            "The risks holds true for any device that did not ship with a magnetic cable.",
            ">So you are saying that I shouldn't be using things like this because of ESD? And what if instead of using C I used it for micro b and other such ports?\n\nI've used Baseus cables with exactly same connector and it break 7 GaN chargers when I disconnected magnetic parts from my P14s laptop. Used them for 1.5 months everyday until it became a disaster. But most likely it's pretty safe to use it with phone.",
            "If you come here looking for recommendations on products. Most of the time, people will recommend products that appear on the right side of compliance. This goes for docks, cables, c2c charging devices. This falls right in line with that idea. You can definitely get away with things not into spec but the problem here is that there is no recommended magnetic adaptor because they are all inherently flawed. In the future, posts that are made specifically asking for a recommendation will be locked and referenced to this post because no matter the product, the outcome is the same unless something fundamentally changes with USB specifications or some sort of technological breakthrough and something new, not a rebranded aliexpress cable is released onto the market. See microsoft patent pending magnetic type c.\n\nHowever, if you want to discuss it, that's totally okay, even making a new post to talk about it is fine. Nothing wrong with talking about stuff.",
            "Indeed, the charging part has been done before. All 2015 and earlier Apple MacBooks had the MagSafe connector. It gave 19V (17V for the Air) and worked fine for many years. Its a shame we dont have an equivalent at the moment.",
            "Why do you say that they are safe for charging?\n\nI think its reasonable to say that making an unprotected charging connector is much easier than making an unprotected 40Gbps data connector, but USB C interface designers are expecting the charging connector to be recessed. They havent built and tested it with exposed, easy to poke connections in mind, so I would not assume that its static safe.",
            "It sounds like if Microsoft would like to contribute their work on this to the USB working groups, that would be a good start."

            "All Thunderbolt 3 and later passive cables are automatically good for Thunderbolt 5 speeds. In other words, they printed a \"5\" on a cable. Yay.",
            ">All Thunderbolt 3 and later passive cables are automatically good for Thunderbolt 5 speeds.\n\nYes, but not for 240W as they lack the snubber circuits to prevent electric arcs.",
            "The passive TB3 and TB4 cables are designed  to carry a ~20GHz signal for TB3/TB4/USB4 40gbps.   Since TB5/USB4 80Gbps only increased the clock rate about 26%, tests showed these cables would also work for TB5/USB4 80Gbps.  The remainder of the increase in bandwidth is obtained through PAM-3 signal encoding.   \n\nFor non-passive cables (generally over 0.8 meters), it would require brand new electrical design in the cable plugs.",
            "Thank you for taking the time to answer. In summary, if less than 0.8 meters then it is possible to get the same speeds right? Is this the same for display refresh rates?",
            "Although Thunderbolt 3 cables are backwards compatible they are rated for 40 gigabits, while these are rated for 80 gigabits.\n\nHave you seen an example of a Thunderbolt 3 cable delivering 80 gigabit speeds on a Thunderbolt 5 connection somewhere?\n\nI have seen reviews of cables where manufacturers have labeled Thunderbolt 3 cables as Thunderbolt 4, the cables didn't achieve the same levels of refresh rates for multiple displays as actual Thunderbolt 4 cables can. Also some earlier versions of Thunderbolt 3 cables are limited to Display Port 1.2 alternative mode speeds meaning they can only do 4K 60Hz instead of 4K 120Hz.",
            "USB4 officially says, that passive USB-C Gen 3 Cables (20 Gbps per wire pair) are automatically good for Gen 4 speeds, there is no difference in the cable. Only active cables require new tech for USB4 80Gbps / 40 Gbps per wire pair. And going by cable length this new Cable Matters cable is passive. They probably only upgraded the version of the eMarker's definitions and added \"Gen 4\" to it.\n\nTB3 reusing USB-C's Gen 2 identification for slower speeds, but added its own custom way to signal 40Gbps, as nothing from USB existed yet. USB4 added the Gen 3 speed and allows passive TB3 40Gbp cables, even though they are not marked as Gen3 to be used as Gen 3 USB-C cables. Just as passive Gen 3 cables are implicitly Gen 4. So any problems here are probably down to the individual USB4 controllers not accepting old TB3 cables as Gen 3 like they should, or they are not passive cables.\n\nAll passive TB3 40 Gbps cables do not care what alt mode you put on them as long as the needs are covered by the signal quality that the cable guarantees. Only active cables were allowed to leave out everything but TB support, so here you have compatibility limitations.\n\nSo all passive TB3 40Gbps cables are automatically accepted as USB-C Gen3 & Gen4 cables.\n\n  \nEdit: most active TB3 cables support only USB2 and TB ,nothing else. Would be news to me that one supported only specific DP speeds. But maybe Apple does it that way? They are the only ones I know of that produced active TB3 cables that where backwards compatible. Maybe in order to achieve that they borked them? DP itself does not read out any eMarker stuff. It just tries to do a speed and check if it fails and then reduces speed. So a cable would have to physically fail the HBR3 speed to cause a downgrade to HBR2. And even TB3 20Gbps is faster than HBR3. So would be very weird if the cable allowed DP, but only at ancient speeds."
