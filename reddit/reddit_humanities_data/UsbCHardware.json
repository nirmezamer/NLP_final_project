        "content": "For anyone who comes in wondering about this magnetic cable or that. Here is some good commentary on the dangers of magnetic cables. Not to mention the large majority of [kickstarters](https://www.reddit.com/r/shittykickstarters/comments/6qmcn3/crowdfunded_magnetic_usb_chargers_thread_v21/) that have failed to deliver anything other than an aliexexpress rebrand.\n\nEdit: Let me make this clear. **USB-C magnetic tip adaptors or cables are not compliant with the USB specifications.** This means any resulting damage to products, which is a very real possibility even if it is a relatively small chance, would not be covered by product warranties. Therefore, these cables and adaptors are not recommended and future posts asking for such recommendations will be locked. It will stay like this until some big company like microsoft or apple and or the USB group comes up with a cable design that is safe.\n\n**I am not saying that these cables do not exist or that they do not work as claimed however there is an inherent risk when using these cables and that will fall onto the reader to decide for themselves.**\n\nTo quote /u/chx_\n\n> There are two risks\n> \n> As mentioned, static electricity is a huge problem. Look at any connector and it has the exact same generic shape: a gigantic grounding shroud protecting the data pins. DisplayPort, HDMI, USB of all variants. But if you go back, back, back, VGA and all its ancient DB friends, DVI, whatnot -- even those were the same, just there was more plastic. This generic idea stretches back to the dawn of (computer) time. Exposing the pins just like that makes your laptop very suspectible for static electricity. Ever felt the hairs on your arm stand up after changing clothes? Congrats, you just fried your laptop if you touch it like that. https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/511QlHyl8CL._AC_SL1000_.jpg see how they are out in the open? And this issue is inherent to the overall physical requirements of the plug.\n\n> Connection/data loss due to electronic noise. There was a fun problem where Dell laptops used to drop their TB3 connections unless you limited their wifi transmission power. This took Dell significant time and expense to figure out. And that's Dell, not some random tiny company... Want to go there with a who-knows-what built system when NathanK already told you explicitly the pogo pins are too noisy electronically? https://twitter.com/USBCGuy/status/1095614250414796800\n\n> Also he mentions https://twitter.com/USBCGuy/status/1186718432932159488 using optoelectronical couplers you could do something by completely disconnecting the magnetic pins from actual USB C connector and letting current flow only when the other half of the connector is connected and VCONN power is present. Of course, your isolation is now a few mm of air, pray your static electronic charge doesn't arc over it... hope you rather live in Phoenix than here in Raincouver! https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andreas_Neuber2/publication/3165903/figure/fig17/AS:668977227386923@1536508008917/Breakdown-voltage-in-air-versus-relative-humidity-with-an-alumina-surface-Electrode.png\n\n> I am reasonably sure there are gigantic companies which would just love if this worked. Riddle me this: why do you think Apple didn't put this on the market? Do they lack the R&D dollars? :) Somewhere in that sixteen billion dollar yearly R&D spending I am reasonably sure you could find a few (hundred...) millions to resolve this issue if it were possible. And yet, Kickstarters with a few hundred ... thousand raised claim they can? What's wrong with this picture? Look at the Thunderbolt 3 Pro cable they released: it's an active USB C cable, it's an active TB3 cable and costs a fortune. There's nothing even similar on the market but where there's a will, there's a way. They have designed a custom ASIC for that cable which can amplify both USB C and TB3 signals -- both existed separately but having them in a single cable before was thought impossible. This is to demonstrate: if they could, they would. And if it would be really expensive, hundreds of dollars per connector, have you seen that thousand bucks monitor stand :) ?",

            "I agree with you on USB-C magnetic cables. But I will put the surface connector out there as a data+charging magnetic cable from a large company. \n\nI don't think the issue is that it can't be done, but more that the compromises that go along with doing it correctly aren't worth it to every company besides MS. \n\nI will say though that the Surface connector is really convenient. I would love to see something like a standard version come out. Maybe some day...",
            "I have a notebook burned by an accidental magnetic connector detach being connected to a charger. Then I inspected the connector parts with a magnifying glass to find out it was made very good way to prevent such accidents. In fact, I can't understand how did it happen. But, on the other hand, the damaged notebook is the fact that can't be denied. Since then I stopped using them and recommend the same to my friends.\n\nI've used the one looking exactly as mentioned above ([https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/511QlHyl8CL.AC\\_SL1000.jpg](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/511QlHyl8CL.AC_SL1000.jpg)).",
            "Tiny nitpick: I doubt optocouplers are filled with air. Probably some sort of transparent dielectric. So the breakdown voltage would be significantly higher.",
            "So you are saying that I shouldn't be using things like [this](https://voltacharger.com/products/volta-spark-1-tip) because of ESD? And what if instead of using C I used it for micro b and other such ports?",
            "The whole static argument is stupid. ESD failures are so rare with modern electronics it\u2019s basically pointless to worry about them nowadays.",
            "is Volta dangerous? I'm using it to charge my Samsung Galaxy S10.",
            "So what are you saying? Is discussion on \"what magnetic ones are recommended\" not allowed now?\n\nIf so that's ridiculous, people have to go to other subs instead of the sub literally designed for USB-C discussion?",
            "They're fine, but only for charging. I wouldnt expect any mag usbc to do anything other than that, and probably not fast charging. \n\nThe netdot ones on Amazon are decent\n\nLmao you guys know there's probably thousands of people using these without issue right? Stop making things up to worry about lol.",
            "Totally agree. Compared to the Microsoft proprietary connector, USB-C is a huge step backwards, especially for folks with disabilities. Magnetic alignment and zero-insertion force is huge for folks with the use of only one hand, for example.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I like USB-C so much more than the older USB connectors, but I *love* the MS connector.\n\nIMHO, the only advantage USB-C has over the MS connector is size (2x wider connector and 3x wider keepout) and cost (MS connector F/M pair probably costs a dollar more to manufacture)\n\nIf you want to learn more about the MS connector, I posted an article about it a few years back: https://dancharblog.wordpress.com/2015/06/16/surface-pro-3-landscape-docking-station-teardown-part-2/\n\n\nAnother neat thing MS does is have an automatic anti-arc scheme that ramps-up current from the 5mA range -> 8A (2amps per contact) over the course of a few seconds once a solid connection is verified to prevent wear on the tiny contacts. On detach, there is not much you can do except have good ESD protection and design the contacts such that angling this way or that can't cause catastrophic shorts. They really did a good job on it.\n\n-----\n\nedit: FWIW Microsoft has a patent on a magnetically latching USB-C-ish connector: https://patents.google.com/patent/US20180375251/en",
