If I want 2x Cisco ASR 1001-x and to terminate both providers to those boxes and each provider is only willing to give us one fiber, is best option to use a switch, one for each provider (I was thinking two of those small cisco industrial switches, assuming they are well designed to run until the end of time under any conditions and don\u2019t take up too much space and power acting as only a 4-5 port switch)\n\n2: we want to separate our datacenter activities from HQ end-user networking, and our lab environment. Being a small shop I do like the idea of just using the ports on the router vs setting up a core switch below that. Basically I\u2019m just setting up small transit networks on each port, and using OSPF from my downstream firewalls/routers. Or am I missing out a bunch from eliminating that core router/switch from the topology?\n\n3: I have read the arista 7280R3 (and possibly some variant of the R2, or others) support full internet BGP tables. Curious if we stepped down to the R series if that is still the case as that would be the max in our price range. Or, how much benefit we lose if we step down to taking partial BGP tables with a default route, especially since I have had a weeks long peering issue with our local ISP - but not Comcast-  a few years back. \n\nSo - this is all a bit new to me in terms of selecting hardware and deploying it.

            "Remember: Firewall ports more expensive than router ports mode expensive than switch ports. When connecting a bunch of stuff, aggregation switches aren't the worlds worst option for several reasons.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n1) \n\n-  >> One fiber: \n\n Pair, you mean? Not that it's super relevant. \n\n- An aggregation switch is not a bad way to go, but I would recommend 2x; if the switch goes out you lost all your redundancy. Terminate one router and one provider to one switch, and the others to the others. Mesh the routers to each agg switch in case of switch failure. Less ports you can link the two routers together.\n\n- Hardware redundancy and cheap/easy way to add new circuits, routers, firewalls, cores, or replace any of the mentioned components; it becomes a matter of copying configs ahead of time. Plumbing the vlan(s) from the old device to the new device on cutover day. Minimal downtime, and no fatigue from moving a ton of physical ports around and making sure things match up.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n2) If you have a 'core' device, what is the purpose of it and why is it a 'core'. It sounds like you're terminating internal end-points. If that hardware has a specific feature or purpose (tons of cheap ports, redundant RE/power) it isn't bad to utilize. The 'agg-switch' mentioned in 1) technically works like your core, but that's not it's purpose necessarily. Comes down to your design intentions. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n3) What is the purpose of two providers? If it's simply internet connectivity backup, then you don't care about full tables. If they're similarly connected ASNs, default is sufficient. This is inefficient, though, because now you have an expensive connection not doing anything. Reconsider Default First + Full tables. You may also ask the providers for Default + \"Connected\"/\"Customer\" tables. This way you at least efficiently push traffic to their +1 hop connected networks and reduce your table size. Though, I would say if budget is so constrained full tables is an issue, management needs to be educated on the criticality of your edge/WAN routers.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>> I just don't have enough experience running a network like this to know what is a bad idea and what is a good idea practically.\n\nDon't worry about what you don't have - you'll get there. While failures and emergencies are the most common ways people learn about how their networks could be improved, go through failure scenarios/tabletop in your head. Think of ways things could fail by breaking a cable, a provider, or a piece of hardware and game out what the network would do when that happens."
