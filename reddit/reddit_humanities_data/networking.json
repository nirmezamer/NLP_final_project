Many, many different experiences along the way, tons of learning about new things, great people, great projects, etc.\n\nBut in the last 5 years, shit is moving soooo fast that I am struggling to keep up. I feel that any move up the so-called ladder will just end up with an unbearable workload, responsibility for everybody else's problems, and stress levels that continue to escalate. I have easily 10 more years of work ahead of me, but staying at my current level is far preferable to moving up to a higher level where I have to figure out everything on my own. I know \"...build a good team...\", etc. but I can't embrace the feeling that I'll be over my head if I try to move up.\n\nDo others have this same sense? Or if you did move up to a management tier, how did it work out?",

Even when its like 10 minutes between tasks, its not like I can get much accomplished in those 10 minutes before I have to context switch back again.\n\nEdit:\nGot one whole morning off of these change calls and felt like a corporate weapon, clearing all the easy tickets and finally replying to a bunch of emails.

A bottleneck wap that supplies mesh access to the rest of the infrastructure was disconnected outlining our homes need for additional trunk waps to eliminate single point failures in the future. Service was returned to natural state as of 09:00 (AM) after an auxiliary tech (wife) was dispatched to move the 6 foot cable that was connected to the wap from port 7 to port 3 as the initial repair was unsuccessful. POE is only available on half of the intended switch and the onsite tech at time of accident had to leave (for work).\n\nI'm tired."
