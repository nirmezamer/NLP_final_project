            "People say it feels forced for the first half, but I honestly believe that it was just them being serious about what they were doing ( hey they are giving people food and drinks, they need to be safe) and also including some of their normal humour which is their interactions",
            "this video almost gave me an anxiety attack lmao, incredibly chaotic",
            "Hen do girls lowkey the best group that came in",
            "this one was so funny, guests were really good and the whole \"shutup\" drink had me dying laughing",
            "This one gave me second-hand high blood pressure in an entertaining way",
            "Well that was an absolute fever dream from start to finish. As a whole, not the best, but some absolute god tier moments throughout",
            "JJ's reaction when one of Jedward appeared in the kitchen was absolutely hilarious",
            "Jedward are funny af, can't believe it took sidemen so long to find this gem for content",
            "I feel like the only one that thought Weller was hilarious. They would have edited his bits out if they didn't like them.",
            "This video definitely had a few good moments. But also a lot of moments were I questioned what was going on and if that should be happening. JJ and the lot getting pissed was funny to see but maybe some parts pushed the limit if not more because like Tobi said hygiene is important and . But maybe as long as the guests knew before hand it wouldn't be a serious thing and anything can happen then I'm all in for what happened."

            "Tobi such a valid answer. If youre best friends with him you just know hed do anything for you. Simon JJ or Harry are my other options",
            "Harry, Vik, Tobi & Ethan",
            "Ethan!!! Hes always the most proud of his friends, so unfiltered and honest, and loves his friends to bits!",
            "they are my friends, i watch them every sunday. (this is a joke)",
            "imma be real, JJ. His off camera personality is pretty chill and fun",
            "I feel like i would probably vibe the best with harry, josh, tobi or vik. \n\nBut all them seem to have qualities I would enjoy. Different friends for different things",
            "Probably Josh,Vik, Tobi and Ethan. I don't see myself being that comfortable with the rest of them.",
            "Ethan, then Tobi for homie characteristics. Harry and KSI for the humour of course. Simon, Josh and Vik are smart friends I'd hang around with. Nobody's perfect but I think they are good people, I'd befriend them all."
