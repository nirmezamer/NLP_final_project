            "I'm sorry the term \"gender Taliban\" is so funny I cannot believe a person with a functional mind would use it seriously. \n\nBut being serious for a moment, any comparison between trans rights and the Taliban - a group that shoots women for wanting education - is extremely crass. Imagine being someone who has worked in Afghanistan, being trans or knowing trans people, and hearing this woman think you should be compared to the Taliban. It's a horrifyingly extreme position to take and she's lost the plot to the point of genuine derangement. She's tipping hard into Graham Linehan territory over this and it's just pathetic.",
            "JK Rowling talks more about trans issues than trans people do.",
            "She really has made this her entire personality. It\u2019s a mental illness.",

            "The trans population of the UK is only around 0.5%  I cannot believe so much hated and political football is being used to target such a tiny amount of people",
            "Maybe we should double-check the policies of the Taliban when it comes to trans rights. Something tells me they much more align with JK Rowling then David Tennant.",
            "Anyone who loves David Tennant even more now, you should definitely watch Good Omens on Amazon. I only just discovered it and it's really rather good.",
            "The feminist compares trans rights to *the fucking Taliban*.",
            "What a rational and well thought out argument. I'm so glad this is the level of the national discourse, and that the press covers it so rigorously.",

            "I've spent a decade within the academic and industrial sectors of life sciences within the UK and I'm done with it. Wages are unbelievably shit for the level of expertise and knowledge you have to bring to the table. Imagine having a literal PhD and only earning \u00a335k for performing ridiculous complex work with poor work life balance.\n\nThings have gradually gotten worse over the last decade and I don't see it as a reliable career path anymore. Less funding, fewer jobs and a huge international talent pool means you have to fight very hard to get a job in which you're underpaid. Why even do it? Probably better off being an electrician.",

Or the better offers from other countries that won't treat them like criminals just for wanting to work there.\n\n No, it's only the tax - which entirely coincidentally would apply to senior figures at large pharmaceutical firms too.",

My colleagues in the US who do the EXACT same role earn $175-200k. We have the same qualifications and experience, have the same responsibilities, almost identical career pathways but unfortunately very different career progression opportunities which also favour the US team.",
            "Yeah if your employer isn\u2019t willing to pay a few thousand in visa fees I\u2019d question whether you are \u201ctop global talent\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be tough convincing the British public that visas are too hard to obtain.",

How do they do it?",
