            "Labour have three choices, none of which are very palatable:\n\n* Significantly the amount of government money go to universities, which will make it harder for them to meet their other priorities.\n* Increase tuition fees, which will piss off a lot of their younger voters.\n* Continue to allow universities to decline, and possibly oversee some of them actually going bust.\n\nAnd whatever they do, they'll end up getting blamed (despite the last 14 years of Tory choices meaning that we ended up here).",

            "Something needs to be done ASAP. It is actually shocking me how blatant it is we are approaching a crisis, how serious that crisis seems set to be, versus how little interest there seems to be in doing anything about it. I don't think I've even heard it mentioned in any of the debates I've watched yet. I used to be an academic, I left months ago as working conditions are just intolerable in the system now. I've moved to doing sales for stuff where university research is a fairly large customer and every single contact and project I am hearing oh whoops sorry our budgets just been cut, the university is in deficit to the tune of tens of millions etc. And this is coming from science teams working at top-ranked universities, its not the media studies team at Uni of Blackburn who are suffering as everyone just seems to assume.\n\nE - Also to add its been put aside for so long, its difficult to know what the solution is. Raising tuition fees in line with inflation, we'd be looking at somewhere between a 30 to 50% increase in fees. I doubt many people would be happy with that. Just another poison chalice the Tories are handing to Labour I think.",
            "(Article)\n\n---\n\nA Labour government should take immediate steps to stabilise the UK\u2019s university system, raising the annual \u00a39,250 tuition fee in line with inflation, the head of the sector\u2019s main lobby group has said.\n\nVivienne Stern, chief executive of Universities UK, which represents more than 140 universities, said if Labour wins rapid action would be needed to avoid the sector being left in limbo as the new administration beds in.\n\n\u201cThe worry is that there is an 18-month review process that delivers no substantial change for two or three years. We\u2019d argue for a two-step approach: do something to stabilise the ship, then address the question of more fundamental changes,\u201d she told the Financial Times.\n\nLabour said in its election manifesto that higher education was \u201cin crisis\u201d and that the current funding settlement did \u201cnot work for the taxpayer, universities, staff, or students\u201d, but has failed to provide details of how it would address the problems if elected.\n\nThe sector is battling financial headwinds caused by a sharp decline in international student fees and a decade-long freeze of domestic tuition fees.\n\nThe cap on fees means universities are losing an average of \u00a32,500 on every domestic student, according to analysis by the Russell Group of leading research universities. \n\nMore than 50 universities have announced job cuts and closure this year and several are on the verge of bankruptcy, according to Whitehall insiders.\n\nStern said three immediate steps were required to stabilise the system. These were a backstop mechanism to avoid university insolvency; clear signals to international students that they were welcome after recent hostility from the government; and a decision to raise student fees and maintenance loans in line with the retail price index.\nShe added that the short-term measures would create financial and political space for a wider review of university financing, including changes to the loan repayment system that would take years to implement.\n\nBridget Phillipson, shadow education secretary, has signalled that Labour is preparing to address the challenges of the UK\u2019s higher education system. \n\n\u201cLet me be clear that reform is coming,\u201d she said in a speech to the UUK annual conference in September, adding that \u201cstudent finance will be the first to see change, although by no means the last\u201d. \n\nEducational experts said the options for Labour, which has a 20-point lead according to polls, included reversing recent changes to the loan repayments system that landed hardest on women and lower-paid professions, or restoring real interest rates to student loans.\n\nMore radical policies include \u201cstepped repayments\u201d, which would mean higher-earning graduates pay significantly more over their working lifetime than they borrowed in students loans.\n\nOne former university vice-chancellor said the fact that Labour had acknowledged the sector was \u201cin crisis\u201d indicated that Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and Phillipson, who have not ruled out a tuition fee, were likely to act.\n\n\u201cThe short-term pain of putting fees could be blamed on the Tory inheritance . . . and then traded against a transition to a better deal for young people, which Lab can deliver before next general election,\u201d he said.\n\nNick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute think-tank, said he was sceptical of the case for radical reform, noting that the 1997 Dearing review, the 2010 Browne review and the 2017 Augar review had all stuck with a form of student loans.",
            "Presumably if you accept unis have to fund themselves, then tuition fees have to rise with inflation?\n\nOf course in my opinion HE should be heavily subsidised because it's handy to have plenty of doctors, engineers, scientists etc in society.",
            "Was at university during the tuition fee rise (thankfully had the ~\u00a33000 fees locked in) the attitude of the lecturers was that the new fees and removal of student cap would simply allow big universities to crush smaller and younger ones. \n\nMany were supportive of the current system, though only under the assumption that fees would keep rising each year. They wanted a \u201ccompetitive market\u201d\n\nThe government needs to start thinking about what happens when a university fails to meet its financial commitments, otherwise they will simply hold the government to ransom and demand massive bailouts. \n\nThere are already suggestions they have handed loans out to some universities to stay afloat (before COVID even). This just fuels the bubble"
