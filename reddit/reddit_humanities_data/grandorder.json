            "# FAQ\n\n**Q: When is the next SSR Ticket?**\n\n*A: As of its 6th Anniversary, NA now has a free SSR selector in Da Vinci's shop, which features*\u00a0[general pool and storylocked servants up to Europa](https://webview.fate-go.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/0703_6th_anniversary/info_3_nf2l3.png)\u00a0*(this will not be updated with more recent units). There is no time limit on this selector, and going forward, all accounts receive it upon clearing Fuyuki. No further SSR tickets have been announced to date.*\n\n**Q. Which banner do I choose for the GSSR? Which is best option?**\n\n*A: The answer is different for every player, and depends on many factors. We suggest you use the*\u00a0[GSSR Calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dT7wE61H11dOaukY_INLuwtmFf5iyDdb8TXAKymttCY/copy)\u00a0*or*\u00a0[GSSR Advisor](https://fategc.com/gssr/details/anniversary-7)\u00a0*tools to rate servants based on your own criteria and see which banner/pool is statistically better. If you have tried these tools and are still uncertain, you can ask for advice in the thread.*\n\n**Q: What is happening to reruns? Which event will get a rerun in the future?**\n\n*A: As far as we know, most events will not be getting reruns. The only exceptions are Karnamas (NA ETA: Dec 2024), Summer 6 (May 2026) and Lilim Harlot (June 2026).*\n\n**Q: Will welfare servant X be obtainable in the future?**\n\n*A: Yes, JP has introduced a new Evocation system which allows players to get selected welfares which can be view on the* [*Fandom wiki*](https://fategrandorder.fandom.com/wiki/Evocation_Festival)*.*",
            "I currently have a grailed Hans in my support list (default, non-event list). Normally, he pretty much never gets used but lately he's been my most used servant. Is there supposed to be some sort of event or challenge that he's preferred on right now? Or do I just have someone on my list that really likes using him?",
            "Just to confirm - there is no way to miss out on anything by just following some random path in Ooku maze, right? I.e. you can always come back and explore the labyrinth in full.",

I got a new tablet and can't seem to be able to set it up for some reason. Despite still having access in my phone and old tablet.\n\nEDIT: \n\nManaged to solve the issue. For some reason the FGO data folder was visible but NOT modifiable from a PC when connecting the device via usb, despite this being possible before. Maybe it was a change to Android 14 I was not aware of. \n\nThe \"fix\" was to open **two** instancesof the default google \"Files\" app and put them side and side, from which it was possible to **drag** the files into the data folder. Copying was not possible.",
            "How long do I have before events need Lostbelt 6 completion? Cernunnos is rough, and I'm gonna need time to build my Sanzang and Lobo and also get some of those blue cubes.",

(8PM for me) I accidentally clicked on it and only read limited time mission. \n\nAlso, do you guys think that NA\u2019s release of the Ooku interlude will still follow JP\u2019s schedule? I just assumed that we\u2019d get a heads up of the release and if we\u2019re following JP\u2019s release then it should be releasing today, or 15 days into Bakin\u2019s event.",
            "After the last update on JP I'm getting a black screen when I boot up the game. There's sparkles when I touch the screen but I don't think anything is loading there. Anyone else has the same problem? Is there any solutions?",
            "Was there a change in how bond works on JP recently-ish? I've noticed the first 3 servants seem to always be getting more bond than the last 3.",
            "So, I'd like some advice on Tamamo Cat. (I know what you're about to read is stupid and likely unfeasible, but I genuinely would love to have a Tamamo only account, just to flaunt to my friends how much of a simp I am lol)\n\nShe's literally the ONLY damage dealer my account will have until next year when Lancer Tamamo gets a rate up (and maybe Koyanskayas of Light + Dark later). I want to make a fox-only account (I'm already in the 3rd singularity in this alt) and I quickly realized that as adorable as Tamamo Cat may be...\n\nShe's kinda bad. At least, without the proper supports I definitely won't have. Is it feasible to progress in this game, even IF i manage to 120 max append all of the tamamos + koyanskayas? I'd feel terrible putting so much effort in this silly niche alt account only to realize I physically can't beat >!Tiamat!< or >!Goetia!< later on.\n\nIn my main account, I mostly farm with double KoyanDark + Light (with append 2 maxed, the three can farm with their NPs while leaving free slots for CEs in events and such), so I know farming won't be a problem once I obtain them, but my biggest fear are bosses."

But it\u2019s funny because she can sense my presence, even on someone else\u2019s phone.\n\nI just like to make fun of Douman one because my lap is Kama\u2019s territory, so he needs to stop lying down there.
