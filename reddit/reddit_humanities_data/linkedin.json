        "content": "Hi everyone, I just want to confide my struggle to you guys. I am an international senior undergrad in the UK and am supposed to join the corporate world next year. Since the UK job market is terrible at the moment and hasn't shown any signal to be better next year, I have started building my personal brand on LinkedIn recently.\n\nI often post content about marketing, psychology, and branding to give away free knowledge to all members and simultaneously aim to impress any employers seeking new hires. I have even started publishing a newsletter about marketing case studies. I have attached a link to one of my newsletters. if possible, please take a quick look at it and give me some advice. I appreciate it).\n\nBut, I feel like the LinkedIn algorithm enjoys making me hopeless. Sometimes, I get hundreds of impressions, which is a massive number to me, but most of the time my posts do not even bother to reach like 10 impressions.\n\nThe problem seems to be down to the majority of my connections who are from my home country while my content is in English. I have tried to post in groups but no result so far, my newsletter grows quite slowly and gets almost no engagement. Another issue is that since my content gets low impressions, I have no clue whether it is because of the quality of the content itself or it is because the LinkedIn algorithm sucks.\n\nI'm an introvert so not the kind of person who always makes friends no matter what kind of friendship it is. I just hate pretending to be nice and excited with strangers on this platform just for connections. It's just weird and does not align with my desired identity.\n\ncan someone give me some advice on this? How was your journey on the platform from the beginning and what made you get out of the algorithm that enjoys saddening active users like me?\n\nHere's my newsletter: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ikea-effect-how-succeeds-making-customers-craft-products-chu-j2mmc/?trackingId=NkxyuPmkTVeX3eLB3Zctmg%3D%3D",

            "Not really related, but I remember seeing this guy on LinkedIn I followed has an interesting content creation strategy. \n\nHe creates a series (e.g. best exercises for each muscle) and consistently uploads them. When he finishes the series, he complies everything into one big ebook (e.g. complete guide to the best exercises for each muscle).\n\nYou can consider implementing this with your marketing case studies. When you've compiled enough to create a valuable ebook, you can share it in LinkedIn communities. That should get you more impressions while still doing what you're doing."
