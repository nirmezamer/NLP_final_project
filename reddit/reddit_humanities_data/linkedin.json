I leverage cutting-edge artificial intelligence and Starlink to modernize systems and processes, particularly for local governments, small businesses, and nonprofits. Our ultimate goal is to fully bridge the digital divide, using AI to swiftly overcome pervasive resource constraints faced by my clients such as low bandwith, delayed tech adoption, and computer illiteracy. As far as I know I am the only person in the region who does this kind of work. \n\nIn my free time, I enjoy learning new technologies and supporting community initiatives. keep bees  and weld as a hobby. Last summer, my husband Michael and I hosted 400 PCT hikers at our volunteer hostel, and we're working on starting a hiker nonprofit with a focus on inclusion and accessibility. We expect to have at least as many hikers stay with us this summer as last summer!  \n\nLooking to meaningfully expand my professional network. I will follow you back if you send me a connection invitation.",

Often, I would think about converting my learnings into quality articles to share and create value for others. However, it used to take me nearly 2-3 hours to produce just one article.\n\n\n\nRecently, I discovered the potential of AI automation. By integrating Google Sheets, AI, and N8N, I\u2019ve streamlined the process. Now, I can convert my learnings into quality posts in under a minute. This efficiency allows me to consistently post 3-4 times a week.\n\n\n\nThe transformation has been incredible. Not only do I save time, but I\u2019m also able to share valuable insights more frequently, enhancing my online presence and providing continuous value to my audience. Automation has truly revolutionized my content creation process.\n\nHere is demo link.\n\n[https://youtu.be/4ZfGClZ0Ufc](https://youtu.be/4ZfGClZ0Ufc)",
