Then he roared like a dinosaur and ran out giggling. \n\nAnd his 7th birthday party is tomorrow, and he's losing his first tooth, (*but now we'll curtail your curiosity in sweetness)* and my god, Taylor, I'm supposed to be working, not sobbing about how much I love that little innocent, sweet creature!
