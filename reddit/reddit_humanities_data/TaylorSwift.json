Death By A Thousand Cuts had its fourth performance on the Eras Tour and its sixth performance ever. The Black Dog made its live debut tonight! Come Back\u2026Be Here had its fourth performance on the Eras Tour and its fifth performance ever. Maroon had its seventh performance on the Eras Tour and also its seventh performance ever, having made its live debut in East Rutherford last year.\n\nMaroon is now tied with You're On Your Own, Kid for the most-played surprise song on the Eras Tour. (Unweighted. Weighting for mashups, You're On Your Own, Kid still has the lead.)\n\nDeath By A Thousand Cuts was previously combined with Babe during the Singapore leg of the Eras Tour. Come Back\u2026Be Here was combined with Daylight during the Melbourne leg of the Eras Tour and with The Way I Loved You and The Other Side Of The Door during the Lisbon leg of the Eras Tour. Maroon was previously combined with Forever & Always during the Sydney leg of the Eras Tour and with Cornelia Street during the Liverpool leg of the Eras Tour. This is the first time Hits Different or The Black Dog have been played as part of a mashup.\n\nTaylor has now played The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived live more times than The Outside.",
