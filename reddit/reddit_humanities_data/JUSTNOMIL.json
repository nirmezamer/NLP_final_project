        "content": "Update, see thread for back story.. I usually post in /inlaws beacuse all members are very toxic but MIL the one driving me crazy. So I finally lost my cool on my MIL.  The last visit we had was around 3 weeks ago for a birthday, whenever I am around them I keep to myself as much as possible for the sake of DH, I usually read magazines, books, spend time outdoors sunbathing or go on my phone. I am polite and cordial but do not engage much. I have always been on guard with them because of what I heard about their daughter going NC with them and them getting sued and convicted for trespassing and disturbance of the peace. FIL is a total brute and I steer clear from him, he has a very anxious and angry energy that I find unpleasant. MIL is sickeningly sweet, you would never guess there is something wrong with her upon meeting her but she is in perpetual victimhood. I think covert narcissist describes her very well. They have never done or said anything mean or rude to my face or behind my back that I knew about up until recently but she really annoys me.\n\nDuring a visit 3 weeks ago FIL made some comments about my growing body (I am 8 months pregnant). I replied that I didn't tolerate comments about my body, that I was healthy and that was the most important. DH and MIL also backed me up in the moment. I thought he was sloppy and that at least he wouldn't make the same mistake again. Oh boy was I wrong. Speaking up for myself, telling him how and how not to speak to me must has REALLY triggered him. \n\nLast week we visited again and he didn't say hello just started telling me how big I was getting and telling me to lay off the chocolate. I was in complete shock. DH immediately told him to fuck off so did MIL I just sat there in shock. I was relieved that DH cut him off immediately (not that it matters but I am a healthy person and have gained the recommended amount of weight during my pregnancy). I don't feel insecure about how I look but I immediately felt furious and felt tears coming to my eyes. I walked out of the room slammed the door and threw myself on a bed and started crying. DH followed me shortly after and he let me know that he spoke to him again about how wrong he was to do that. He also let me know that MIL was also furious and yelling at him and that he had simply replied that that's the way he was and he wasn't going to change. When I heard that I felt a bold of energy surge inside me and I said let's go home- DH agreed and we grabbed our things and headed to the car. I felt so relieved that DH was on board that he wanted to go home too. But then things went to hell.\n\nMIL and FIL followed us up to the car and FIL apologized to me- it was too soon I was not ready to receive any type of apology from him I didn't even want to look at him. I told him I didn't want to speak with him and that I wanted to go home. Then MIL starts crying and demanding that I accept his apology- telling me I shouldn't leave, asking me \"Haven't you ever made a mistake?\" Telling me that I was beautiful and that I shouldn't be so affected by his comment- I said I know I am beautiful but I don't feel safe here, I want to go home. She started sobbing even harder and telling me that I should stay and accept his apology- that I am overreacting and this just felt so manipulative I snapped and said \"It's not my fault you have a shitty husband\". She was in shock and DH cut me off. I told him to get his mother away from me and to take me home. I don't regret what I said. I felt attacked by both of them, even more so by MIL who clearly did not care about me or how I felt, just wanted to sweep everything under the rug and go on pretending like she has a happy close-knit family. \n\nNow things have been really tense for the past week between DH and I. They have been making him feel guilty about his decision to leave, to the point where he begged me to go back there to smooth things over. DH is really sad about everything and I can tell he feels torn between his family and I. I did not want to go. He spoke to them on the phone to smooth things over and let them know that we can move on from this but if something similar were to happen we would leave again so I went, it was extremely unpleasant for me although nothing happend. \n\nOne big source of annoyance for the past 2 years was that they included me in a group chat I found this really annoying for many reasons. I don't like group chats, they all speak a different language than me so I would have to translate a lot of the messages. I stayed in it because there was a renovation project with a family property and they would frequently ask about tiles, paint color etc. I would give my 2 cents every now and then but since I have no desire to share a property with a dysfunctional bunch I didn't participate much and found that when I did my opinion was rarely considered. Once the project was over I left the chat group. During that same day she repeatedly added me and I left each group 4 times in a row. At the end of the day she made a group with just DH and I. I gave up and just stayed since I figured communication would not be so frequent- it wasn't but messages have increased since we announced our pregnancy. Around 4 months ago things between us and them seemed to had been improving. DH and I had kept more distance and used the grey rock technique so when she added me to another group with the other ILS again I was annoyed but I just stayed in the group and didn't reply to any messages.\n\nSince this moment of conflict when I lost it on her I realized I'd given in too much (getting messages from them frequently and the frequency of visits has increased again). The way this family speaks to each other on this group really triggers me. BIL belittles DH and she pretends like we have this happy united family...I decided I would leave the group after the incident since I need to reduce the amount I am exposed to them to as little as possible and DH clearly told her that I did not want to be in any chat groups. She tried to throw me under the bus and suggest that I was dramatic and that I overreacted- this obviously made me more angry. I removed her from social media and within 12 hours she had requested to follow again. I left the group with the ILS and yesterday I find that she added me again. I finally decided to block her. I am so sick about this situation. ",

            "I would consider that with hormones and pregnancy that the ILs behavior may be triggering you more than what would be usual, and you should tell your DH this. Maybe he would agree to lay off the pressure to participate and explain this to his family. But realistically, it sounds like you need to just go LC or NC for your mental well-being, at least in the short term.",

I\u2019m excited and terrified at the same time!!\n\nBeing that I\u2019m only 5 months pp, the way MIL acted during my pregnancy with #1 is still very fresh on my mind. I feel like she truly believed my pregnancy was equally about her becoming a grandmother as it was about DH and I becoming parents. She made me feel like an incubator for \u201cher baby\u201d and took away from a lot of the joy. I spent quite literally every day of my pregnancy stressed out over her ridiculous and unpredictable behavior. \n\nI think we did well in regards to setting boundaries during the first pregnancy, and when MIL got to be too much I went NC. With #1 I actually didn\u2019t have to see MIL my entire pregnancy because we live across the country, and even when she attempted to guilt me into flying 3,000 miles so she could throw a baby shower with her friends (the same friends she sits and gossips about me with) I declined. This time will be a little bit different because we will be moving about a 6 hour drive from MIL later this year. As with last time, I plan on having MIL/FIL wait 6 weeks before visiting after birth. I\u2019m so glad we made that choice with #1. I have a post up about MIL\u2019s visit and what a nightmare it was. \n\nThe difference with this pregnancy is that I refuse to allow MIL to take away from my joy. There are no chances to overstep and I won\u2019t sugarcoat anything. When it comes to a shower, she\u2019s not invited, and if she finds out and gets upset- oh well. Even if we\u2019ll be a car ride away this time it doesn\u2019t mean I want her around while I\u2019m healing. I\u2019ve already told my husband point blank \u201cI\u2019m not doing anything that makes me unhappy this pregnancy\u201d. \n\n\nETA: For those that have multiple children, was your MIL\u2019s behavior with the second pregnancy any better/worse than the first?\n",

            "Congratulations!  Is it worth not telling her about the pregnancy at all?  Make a birth announcement and give yourselves the gift of peace.",
            "My MIL was HORRIBLE with my first, so she didn't get to meet my second until she was almost 3 months old. Her behavior was better, but only because I had set so many impossible to cross boundaries after my first pregnancy and postpartum period left me absolutely traumatized because of how terrible she was to me. My second pregnancy wasn't as soon after as yours, so my MIL had gotten enough time to kind of lose interest in my first once she finally seemed to understand she wasn't going to get what she wanted in regards to babysitting, alone time, etc. I think she kind of would've lost interest anyways, as she's much more into babies than toddlers, since she really just wants dolls to carry around rather than actual humans with their own feelings.\n\nI think the 6 week plan is a great plan and good for you for setting that expectation with your first too. I think your boundaries will make a huge difference in your pregnancy experience this time around.",

Let DH be the brick wall between you and her and let him handle her. No visits, no texts, no calls, no FaceTime, nada. She wants something involving LO#1, DH takes care of it. And **no visits**, especially after you move. She'll probably try to talk DH into giving her a key for \"emergencies,\" don't let him.

No her 20 dollar gifts at birthdays and Christmas don't count.) \"She should abort that\" yep... so much worse the second time around. Mind you it would have only been her second blood grand child. Then the pity party started when I blocked her access to me and my youngest completely. She wasn't allowed in my home, near me or at the hospital. She met the baby a few weeks after birth and she wasn't allowed to hold him, didn't get to hold him until he was over 4 months old. And the flying monkeys...",
            "My second was lil more hyped because it was a different sex and we lived with them for the majority of my pregnancy. When I tell you the anxiety was maddening for me. She was extremely passive aggressive towards me and rude! The moment we closed on our house and begin to move she lost her marbles! I believe she realized the access she had once to us would be limited or even non existent and she was scrambling to be apart of *something* to secure her spot and I wasn\u2019t giving in. \n\nShe complained about me doing \u201ctoo much\u201d and I need to ask for help, little did she know, I was excited to get up early in the morning and come back late at night because I was being productive at my house. She even made a comment about us not being entirely moved out until my baby was born, not the case. We were completely out in two weeks.",
