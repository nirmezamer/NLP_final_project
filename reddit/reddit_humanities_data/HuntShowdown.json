        "content": "tl;dr We're banning cheating-related posts outside of this thread, with the exception of videos and clips.\n\n---\n\n**Hunters!**\n\nAs you have probably noticed, there is a heated debate about cheaters in Hunt: Showdown that dominates the discussion on the subreddit. It's unfortunately gotten to a point where we get as many complaints about this, as there are threads supporting the sentiment of there being a cheating problem.\n\nIt's clear that there are cheaters in Hunt, in many different flavors. Whether it's blatant ragehacking on a burner account to provoke reactions, or something more subtle, like ESP, or XIM on consoles. It's obvious - cheaters are present in nearly every online game ever made, including other shooters, PvE games, and even MMOs. Crytek is well-aware of this issue, and they are continouously working on it.\n\nThe problem with working on anti-cheat solutions is that the more transparent you are about it, the less effective they are. Which is one obvious reason as to why Crytek isn't communicating as much as some players would like them to.\n\nThere is a lot of discussion to be had about the validity of concerns about cheating, how prevalent it is, and how accurate the reporting is, but we're not here to take sides. An unfortunate side-effect is that this topic is choking out other content on the subreddit, and as it's very emotionally-driven, it also causes a lot of friction. Arguments are boiled down to their absolute extremes, and discussions are derailed into angry fights.\n\nBecause of this, we have decided to contain the discussion to a megathread. **From this point onwards, any threads or memes about cheating will be removed, and directed to this thread. The same will happen to comments on otherwise unrelated posts. Consider this a hub for all cheating-related discussion.**\n\n**However, videos on the topic are still allowed, whether they're clips of suspected (or blatant) cheaters, or videos like huuge's recent YouTube upload.** Reminder to keep the names and profiles censored, as usual. \n\n---\n\nOK, so why are we banning discussion threads, but not videos? We've had a concern that delegating this topic to a megathread would be akin to sweeping it under the rug. Stickied posts don't get nearly the same exposure as normal posts, they're collapsed by default on mobile, and comment threads on reddit aren't as easily navigatable as individual posts.\n\nBut most discussion threads don't really bring any substance to the table. Just saying that cheating exists does not leave a whole lot of room for debate. It's a completely different matter if there's something to actually discuss - like a recording of an actual cheater you've met in-game, clips of streamers blatantly cheating while live, or huuge's recent video, which gives a lot of specific points to address, with numbers to back them up.\n\nWe may also make some exceptions for discussion threads. If you're unsure if what you want to post will be removed, please send us a modmail with the post, and we'll let you know. This is primarily to take into account things like discussions surrounding Crytek's communication on the issue, or other, bigger posts with actual substance.\n\nWe believe this to be a solid compromise. The frontpage is going to have more breathing room with most discussion relegated to this central thread, but we won't be hiding the existence of the issue. We hope that this is a satisfactory solution.\n\n---\n\nFinally, in the short term, text discussions on the necro megathread will continue to be removed, [here is a link to the necro megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/HuntShowdown/comments/174mrpv/megathread_necro_solo_discussion/) if you would like to continue the discussion. We will assess the situation at a later date, but for now we still want to prevent clogging of the subreddit with that style of posts. We appreciate your understanding",

            "Siege has one of my favourite ways of communicating that cheaters (and toxic players) are being dealt with, without revealing how, in any game I've played. They literally have a popup on the right side of the screen that doesn't interfere with the game and fades out on its own after a few seconds where people who get banned are named, what they did to get banned is shown and what ban they got is stated, so for example \"BigStinkyPoofaceCheater was banned permanently for cheating.\" will pop up and fade out.\n\nIt's particularly satisfying when a ban wave hits 30+ people all at once.",
            "[deleted]",
            "Before I begin, i have over 4k hours in this game, and i consistently play on the above average mmr. I have killed and died to ttvs multiple times. The well known ones I mean. So I guess the personal experience may count to something.\n\nWhy do people derank in the first place? To get to lower mmr and stomp lobbies. Because they cannot stomp lobbies at the higher mmr since a lot people there are either extremely campy or they have esp or they are abusing some configs or Nvidia inspecter bs. I used to love this game. And now I don't feel like touching it because of how unplayable the game is. There are sound bugs or exploits along with the absolute atrocious rain and corruption conditions which makes it even more frustrating. I am half blind. Legally. So I rely on sounds. People out there headshotting through walls and fog and rain and terrain from 150+m seems a little too obvious no? Crytek themselves gives the option to hide the profile so cheaters can defend themselves from getting manually reported to hunt website. And we all know how reliable ingame report is. The other day I read a reddit post from around a year ago where this new trainee engineer just decided to make esp for this game. And guess what? He reported back stating he made a properly functioning one within 5 hours. Is this how effective eac is? Eac is used in coop games like back4blood, vermintide and stuff like that. It serves its purpose for those kind of games, but why hardstuck to something that genuinely doesn't work? We have no features to truly identify soft esp users. Instead what does crytek do? Add fmj to dolce and bring out more skins. \n\nHow does the game still allow compact no pen custom ammo to go through terrain to the other side of the map? Like how obvious does one have to be to actually get banned? Even then they get to play for solid 400-500 hours before they actually get the ban. How many lobbies have been ruined? According to huuge video the Asian server is literally unplayable. I am from Asia and I play on eu. Every other day I used to see slurs on my steam profile. Personally don't mind, but what am I supposed to do? 120 ping on asia vs 140 ping on eu. non-English speaking racism vs European racism due to being an asian playing on eu. Getting on to deranking, I personally find it a waste of time but I do understand the feeling of the lower lobbies. Why is someone with a much higher skill set able to derank this hard through quick play or cheese necro? Isn't this part of the reason why the mmr is so volatile? Why not simply remove the effect of mmr from quickplay? Why not remove mmr number reduction after the dude has died the first time? People like to flaunt their kda, so let the kda get effected meanwhile the mmr stays somewhat same. \n\nI few days ago I came across this issue. Every game I kill 3-4 people but I am unable to get successful extractions. So basically, my mmr keeps on increasing and I get a bit more better players with every passing game meanwhile I am shafted because in the end i am making the game harder on myself without any rewards? Why does the mmr still increase even after unsuccessful games?\n\nI got video proof of a well known twitch streamer from a few months back spamming comms and reported him for it. Now he is an employee of crytek. He breaks the tos of your game and you recruit him as an employee. Good job crytek. As of day before yesterday he was still screaming like a little girl ingame and nothing has been done. \n\nThere are dedicated communities using config files to remove shadows. Use programs like hudsight and crosshair x to make crosshairs which enables them to lead perfectly with any gun. The cheaters are using built in game feature to hide and evade manual reports. Crytek allows deranking. And i will not even mention the exploits and sound bugs. Why do you think people are getting upset and old vets like me are on the verge of quitting?",
            "Crytek support just closed 4 separate tickets of mine after 10+ days. The cheaters were blatant and the evidence was clear. No bans were issued. 4200 hours and I'm ready to quit.",
            ">The problem with working on anti-cheat solutions is that the more transparent you are about it, the less effective they are. Which is one obvious reason as to why Crytek isn't communicating as much as some players would like them to.\n\nSo I hope this is the case, but I've read multiple times that this subreddit is community-run and not officially affiliated with Crytek. Have the developers actually come out and said this? Because without actually reading it from them, this seems like a cheap statement in hopes of getting people to shut up and be happy with no communication from the development team about this very real issue.\u00a0",
            "megathreads are so ass. Just let people post normally.",
            "4 rounds against cheaters tonight. I think Im done with this game. Thanks for 2300 hours Crytek.",
            "Don't point out cheaters please! Our devs will be easily offended and they need to be protected <3<3\n\nPlease continue bearing with a free version of easyanticheat that does absolutely nothing. Oh don't forget to buy our 57 DLC!",
            "You hit the nail on the head. Crytek isn\u2019t communicating with us about the cheaters and how many accounts are being banned, and it\u2019s not because discussing these topics bolsters cheaters ability to cheat.\n\nSeeing as how Hunt Showdown is using free EAC, it seems to me a simple solution would be to pay for the upgraded EAC. Especially considering how long the cheating problem has persisted, how much worse it\u2019s gotten, as the fact that Crytek has been pushing out events and DLCs and content left and right.\n\nIf you were to spend money to buy all the skins and hunters without any discounts, it\u2019s well over $200, not to mention the base game. Sure, not everyone is buying everything, but I don\u2019t for a second believe that Crytek can\u2019t afford to make the upgrade.\n\nCrytek, like a significant portion of gaming companies, doesn\u2019t prioritize their game or their community, rather they want to milk as much money out of an idea as possible before it dries up and they move on to the next one.\n\nI\u2019m not referring to the fine folks actually working on the game and doing the coding, but to the corporate money managers who refuse to invest in the game they\u2019re profiting from.\n\nI love the concept of this game so much I\u2019ve put nearly 3000 hours into it. But I haven\u2019t been playing the last two months because I either get stuck playing against Zen users, or I get de-ranked and get stuck in 4 star lobbies where I absolutely do not belong, because I wipe them with ease and am right back to 5 star or higher.",

But then I'm seeing downvotes for bullet drop and necro being a burn trait.\n\nNo matter how you feel about the changes, downvoting a game you claim to enjoy for changes that aren't even in it yet is sad. It's pathetic, really. Absolutely no one - those who are happy and those who are not - know how ANY of these things are going to play out. No, you don't even have a *good* idea for what it'll be like - so many changes are coming, you have absolutely no clue how they're all going to relate to each other.

But there\u2019s where this is a little more intricate: the game has been out for 6 years and this completely upends all the muscle memory and learning that everyone has built up for all that time.\n\nAnd let\u2019s also be honest, crytek has a horrible track record for implementing thing effectively. This wouldn\u2019t be a big deal if they dealt with feedback within a more reasonable time frame, but this is a studio that won\u2019t patch broken mechanics for a 2-3 month event duration.\n\nIf Crytek had the full trust of the players then it would be fine, but they have not earned that trust back enough to make people willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.\n\nSidenote: It\u2019s always bothered me a bit that Crytek likes to try and implement solutions to things that aren\u2019t necessarily broken, while actively avoiding listening to the player base. I understand that the player base isn\u2019t always on the same page but even when they are, it often just gets ignored.
