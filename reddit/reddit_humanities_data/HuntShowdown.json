        "content": "tl;dr We're banning cheating-related posts outside of this thread, with the exception of videos and clips.\n\n---\n\n**Hunters!**\n\nAs you have probably noticed, there is a heated debate about cheaters in Hunt: Showdown that dominates the discussion on the subreddit. It's unfortunately gotten to a point where we get as many complaints about this, as there are threads supporting the sentiment of there being a cheating problem.\n\nIt's clear that there are cheaters in Hunt, in many different flavors. Whether it's blatant ragehacking on a burner account to provoke reactions, or something more subtle, like ESP, or XIM on consoles. It's obvious - cheaters are present in nearly every online game ever made, including other shooters, PvE games, and even MMOs. Crytek is well-aware of this issue, and they are continouously working on it.\n\nThe problem with working on anti-cheat solutions is that the more transparent you are about it, the less effective they are. Which is one obvious reason as to why Crytek isn't communicating as much as some players would like them to.\n\nThere is a lot of discussion to be had about the validity of concerns about cheating, how prevalent it is, and how accurate the reporting is, but we're not here to take sides. An unfortunate side-effect is that this topic is choking out other content on the subreddit, and as it's very emotionally-driven, it also causes a lot of friction. Arguments are boiled down to their absolute extremes, and discussions are derailed into angry fights.\n\nBecause of this, we have decided to contain the discussion to a megathread. **From this point onwards, any threads or memes about cheating will be removed, and directed to this thread. The same will happen to comments on otherwise unrelated posts. Consider this a hub for all cheating-related discussion.**\n\n**However, videos on the topic are still allowed, whether they're clips of suspected (or blatant) cheaters, or videos like huuge's recent YouTube upload.** Reminder to keep the names and profiles censored, as usual. \n\n---\n\nOK, so why are we banning discussion threads, but not videos? We've had a concern that delegating this topic to a megathread would be akin to sweeping it under the rug. Stickied posts don't get nearly the same exposure as normal posts, they're collapsed by default on mobile, and comment threads on reddit aren't as easily navigatable as individual posts.\n\nBut most discussion threads don't really bring any substance to the table. Just saying that cheating exists does not leave a whole lot of room for debate. It's a completely different matter if there's something to actually discuss - like a recording of an actual cheater you've met in-game, clips of streamers blatantly cheating while live, or huuge's recent video, which gives a lot of specific points to address, with numbers to back them up.\n\nWe may also make some exceptions for discussion threads. If you're unsure if what you want to post will be removed, please send us a modmail with the post, and we'll let you know. This is primarily to take into account things like discussions surrounding Crytek's communication on the issue, or other, bigger posts with actual substance.\n\nWe believe this to be a solid compromise. The frontpage is going to have more breathing room with most discussion relegated to this central thread, but we won't be hiding the existence of the issue. We hope that this is a satisfactory solution.\n\n---\n\nFinally, in the short term, text discussions on the necro megathread will continue to be removed, [here is a link to the necro megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/HuntShowdown/comments/174mrpv/megathread_necro_solo_discussion/) if you would like to continue the discussion. We will assess the situation at a later date, but for now we still want to prevent clogging of the subreddit with that style of posts. We appreciate your understanding",

            "Siege has one of my favourite ways of communicating that cheaters (and toxic players) are being dealt with, without revealing how, in any game I've played. They literally have a popup on the right side of the screen that doesn't interfere with the game and fades out on its own after a few seconds where people who get banned are named, what they did to get banned is shown and what ban they got is stated, so for example \"BigStinkyPoofaceCheater was banned permanently for cheating.\" will pop up and fade out.\n\nIt's particularly satisfying when a ban wave hits 30+ people all at once.",

Which is one obvious reason as to why Crytek isn't communicating as much as some players would like them to.\n\nSo I hope this is the case, but I've read multiple times that this subreddit is community-run and not officially affiliated with Crytek. Have the developers actually come out and said this? Because without actually reading it from them, this seems like a cheap statement in hopes of getting people to shut up and be happy with no communication from the development team about this very real issue.",

            "tldr: We know its a big issue, but the big issue is taking up too much of the conversation so we are limiting the conversation. Crytek knows its an issue but can't tell us what they are doing.\n\nMy take.... Crytek, your privacy concerns are BS and protect the very thing you say that you are concerned about. You literally let people hide from being reported and make it extremely difficult to report people.",
            ">  We've had a concern that delegating this topic to a megathread would be akin to sweeping it under the rug.\n\nAs if that's not the goal of forcing it to a megathread.  Solo necromancer obviously shouldn't still be relegated to a single megathread after 7 months, but here we are."

I could think of half a dozen people that I could instantly bring into this game if I were able to invite them into lobbys and I don't believe I would be the only one. It think it would be a feature that would definitely strengthen the console player base. Now I know that you are not planning to implement such a feature but maybe you could do us console people a favour and bring it up in the future when you have a chance to represent us. \nAgain many thanks and I can't wait for the engine upgrade.",

When equipping items with legendary skins from a loadout, the game won't pull from items already owned.

I know it's niche, but I'm poor from prestiging constantly, and this has been an issue since the legendary rework wayy back when."

        "content": "Necro is frustrating to play with and to play against it. Downed, you spend forever waiting for someone to move off your body, or the fight to give some space, or youre frustrated at the assholes who keep burning your body and wont stop taking all your hp chunks. And from the other side, its frustrating to play against that one dude who keeps getting up, or worrying about being shot from behind while fighting 2 other teams by the dude you killed 4 minutes ago, or trying to sound for the barbed or alert trip wires during a firefight. And its boring to sit and watch a body burn all the way out, and those kills as they rez feel undeserved. Ive often thought that necro should be an event specific trait, or a one-time use (burn trait!). Reasons: when its less used, its not as frustrating to play against (obv), and people are less likely to burn you when youre playing with it, esp since now necro users are more likely to use necro to j extract before time.\n\nHunt is about having fun action fights, theres not a ton of progression (whether you like that or not) but it really doesnt matter if you save this specific hunter, no matter how high level he is. I love this change because it will encourage hopping into a new match and having some action, rather than waiting for 15 minutes sounding from your dead body or staring woodenly as your hp chunks burn away. If you lose a max hunter, you go get another! All hunters die, it doesnt effect progression, and especially with how theyre giving good hunters and traits for essentially free (if youre low cash), loosing hunters is just really not a big deal. Also one time use will encourage people to use it wisely, rather than jumping back up and stabbing hunters in the back.   \nI died, i had my chance, the other hunter got the better of me! Fair.\n\nPS no, i dont usually run necro, its still frustrating and un-fun to play against.",
