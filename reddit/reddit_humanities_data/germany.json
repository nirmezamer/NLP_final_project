            "hello guys\n\nI just graduated medical school and im currently in the pathway of pursuing medical residency in Germany , i should land a medical residency in Germany by next year .\n\nI recently saw that AFB has won significant portion in the EU and while i know it is the opposition party i didn't know much about it . Upon googling further i was shocked to learn that they are\u00a0**extremely right and even considered Neo Nazis by some Germans . I also came to find that they are extremely Xenophobic and misogynistic in nature the most shocking thing of all is they do have a huge following in Germany with such radicalized and ardent supporters .**\u00a0i have seen such polarization , right wing radicalization happen in my own country and it was ugly where the party supporters feel they are superior to other humans around them and impose their radical views on the rest , claim anyone who opposed their views as antinational .\n\nI'm a south east Asian and brown skin color person , which makes me kind of scared now what will happen if they come to power which seems like a very likely outcome , i will be at the middle of residency by the time ... will i be subjected to racial slurs , discriminated and been looked down upon as the stigma around being a racist/supremist would have be broken ? coz if a party in power assures its the normal thing to do then the citizens will follow suit usually ...\n\nFrom what i heard of doctors who work in Germany who came from my country , they have experienced subtle racism but they people always keep to themselves coz of the fear of embarrassing themselves , but thats about it on the contrary most of the Germans they met were super sweet and extremely helpful . The German colleagues in the hospital have been so well accommodating and very amicable as opposed even doctors from own country\n\nBut reading about the articles online about the activities of AFB has left me least to say horrified , to the extent im reconsidering my decision to pursue my residency in Germany.... from what ik i wouldn't be having a problem with immigration status as im a skilled worker that's not really the issue , what bothers me the most is their attitude towards immigrants, people of different ethnicities and im really scared the German people will follow suit , thus resulting in me having a very uncomfortable experience in your country where i would end up feeling not welcome at all !\n\nwhat do you guys think ? am i a being overly concerned ? i would love to hear the status quo there from the eyes of a German people\n\nPlease provide your valuable thoughts and insights on the situation , Thanks in advance :)",
            "Because I saw in another german sub that people say the right-wing parties would ruin the german economy and mostly uneducated young people voted for them, basically because they are stupid and just listen to \"easy solutions\", here a few links with regards to the german economic trends over the last decades of rule of other parties:\n\n[https://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2023-10/iwf-prognose-deutschland-schrumpft-rezession](https://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2023-10/iwf-prognose-deutschland-schrumpft-rezession)\n\n[https://www.destatis.de/DE/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/2023/06/PD23\\_N032\\_81.html](https://www.destatis.de/DE/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/2023/06/PD23_N032_81.html)\n\nThe years from 2021 onwards are particularly interesting here, although things are not looking good from 1990 at the latest. Now you can say GDP is not a good economic marker, and I would agree, but what about this:\n\n2015\n\n[https://www.faz.net/aktuell/karriere-hochschule/buero-co/oecd-studie-jeder-dritte-auswanderer-hat-studienabschluss-13623987.html](https://www.faz.net/aktuell/karriere-hochschule/buero-co/oecd-studie-jeder-dritte-auswanderer-hat-studienabschluss-13623987.html)\n\n2019\n\n[https://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/2019-12/bevoelkerungsforschung-auswanderer-akademiker-deutsche-studie](https://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/2019-12/bevoelkerungsforschung-auswanderer-akademiker-deutsche-studie)\n\n2023\n\n[https://www.agrarheute.com/management/recht/fachkraefte-hunderttausende-deutsche-wandern-gruende-608481](https://www.agrarheute.com/management/recht/fachkraefte-hunderttausende-deutsche-wandern-gruende-608481)\n\ndestatis has also shown a consistently negative balance of German migration since 2005, i.e. more people are leaving the country than coming back.\n\n[https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Umwelt/Bevoelkerung/Wanderungen/Tabellen/wanderungen-zwischen-deutschland-und-dem-ausland.html](https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Umwelt/Bevoelkerung/Wanderungen/Tabellen/wanderungen-zwischen-deutschland-und-dem-ausland.html)\n\nOf these, between 1/3 and 3/4 have university degrees, and the trend has been increasing over the period. So if you want to make the point here that it's only the stupid people who \"vote for populists with simple solutions\" you have to keep in mind that a not inconsiderable proportion of the well-educated and educated are constantly leaving the country and have already left. They basically voted with their feet, as the saying goes. What is left is people who do not want to leave, for one reason or another, and those who cannot.\n\nOn the other hand, it is not the right-wingers (don't say that the CDU under Merkel was right-wing) who have had the political and economic power in their hands in recent years. Ruin will come even without this, but who or what do you blame? It couldn't have been the previous governments (CDU, SPD, Greens)...",

They can have a word with the guy; if they continue to get complaints, they can ask him to leave the premises and not return. There is probably a clause in the house rules about respecting other patrons' privacy that they could cite, for example.
