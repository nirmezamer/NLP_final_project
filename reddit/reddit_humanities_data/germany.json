Please use these resources. If you post questions that are easily answered, our regulars will point you to those resources anyway. Additionally, please use the **Reddit search**.

We know what's in the Wiki, and we will continue to point you there.]\n\nThis goes particularly if you are asking about **studying in Germany**. There are multiple Wiki articles covering a lot of information. And yes, that means reading and doing your own research.

Please either leave a comment here or make a new post, not both.\n\n**If you ask questions in the subreddit, please provide enough information for people to be able to actually help you.** \"Can I find a job in Germany?\" will not give you useful answers. \"I have [qualification], [years of experience], [language skills], want to work as [job description], and am a citizen of [country]\" will. If people ask for more information, they're not being mean, but rather trying to find out what you actually need to know.\n\n----------------\n\n**German-language content** can go to **/r/de** or **/r/FragReddit**.\n\nQuestions **about the German language** are better suited to **/r/German**.\n\n**Covid-related content** should go into **[this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/r7ui9b/megathread_corona_rules_vaccination_questions_etc/)** until further notice.\n\n**/r/LegaladviceGerman/** has limited **legal advice** - but make sure to read their disclaimers.",
