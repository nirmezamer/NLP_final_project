            "I love how everyone in this series gets the coolest power-ups just by challenging themselves to be better than everyone else.  Their egos are insanely contagious even for me",
            "The Magnus Impact was insane but man that page of Child Kaiser going back to kicking the ball... beautiful paneling. Blue Lock is lucky to have an artist who's THIS good",
            "\"Interview\" my ass bro needed 2 weeks to cook Up this amazing artwork",

            "\u201cA super golazo that leaves the entire world stunned in awe and amazement! A goal displaying his prodigious talent! A charismatic goal that ONLY HE can score! A goal befitting a Kaiser!! With a single strike, Micheal Kaiser shifts the momentum back in his favor!!\u201d \n\nWhoever wrote this at the end of the chapter is so real \ud83d\ude2d  this is 100% facts fr!!",
            "Bro, Kaiser has quickly become one of the best written characters \n\nHis speech about love was amazing character development",
            "I really like Isagi's reaction these later chapters. He still wants to beat Kaiser, but he doesn't hate Kaiser's developments. Heck, maybe this rivalry will finally take a mutually appreciative egotistical turn like Isagi and Barou have. While I agree with many that it will be Rin next that scores, then Isagi to close off the game, I have no idea what story turns this match will take. Blue Lock be peaking as per usual.",
            "Anyone else notice Isagi's eyes changed in the last panel? Talk about nostalgic",

            "Kaisers relationship with isagi is twisted in a sense that kaiser still doesn't believe he's human and undeserving of a relationship. He threw away his relationship with everyone. It's only him and the ball, the only person who has genuine administration for kaiser is isagi. And it's purely based off of what kaiser can do not kaiser himself. Yeah isagi gets angry but kaiser only takes it as love because that's the way he sees life, through pain. Kaiser desperately wants a friend and isagi can become that by the end of this match. I predict next chapter isagi congratulates kaiser and that breaks kaiser down. Isagi is really good at meeting people where they are.\u00a0",
