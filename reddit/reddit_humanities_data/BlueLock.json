            "I love how everyone in this series gets the coolest power-ups just by challenging themselves to be better than everyone else.  Their egos are insanely contagious even for me",
            "The Magnus Impact was insane but man that page of Child Kaiser going back to kicking the ball... beautiful paneling. Blue Lock is lucky to have an artist who's THIS good",
            "\"Interview\" my ass bro needed 2 weeks to cook Up this amazing artwork",
            "Man just wants to be loved and eat good food, relatable",
            "Very nice goal, with a lot of narrative build up. I'm quite satisfied with the way Kaiser's character has shaped up. As much as I would have liked the malicious angle to be leaned into, this isn't necessarily bad. Kaiser's desire to be \"loved\" is pretty much a direct mapping onto what it means to have a 'world-type' ego. In that he wishes to score goals that only he can score, that stretch the bounds of possibility and that others recognise as somewhat divine. I use the word 'divine' because of the heavy allusions to some level of divinity surrounding Kaiser's character (his name, the whole 'God's Chosen' thing, the luck, making the 'air an ally' etc.). Ultimately, this is a nice way to kick start a new development trajectory for Kaiser, since there's plenty of potential for him going forward as a rival to Isagi. So yeah, this is probably the best 5-6 chapter stretch we've had in a while.\n\nAs for what comes next, could the title 'Golden Ticket' reference how Kaiser is back on the path to becoming the world's best striker (Noa referred Isagi's discovering of Metavision to a 'ticket' that will lead him to the top)? There will likely be a chapter centering on character reactions to the recent developments, starting with BM. Isagi (and Hiori) will yap for a bit to digest it and we'll likely get a response from Noa, acknowledging Kaiser's effort.\n\nThe really interesting question is how PXG respond. Does Loki sub himself in? At this point, the Isagi - Kaiser factions aren't really separate and they have figured out how to get both elements functioning together effectively. And given the foreshadowing before the match, the key to PXG matching this threat would be getting the Rin - Shidou dynamic working as well. Which means getting Charles playing optimally again. How that will be accomplished will become more clear, but I'm hoping we see (in the next few chapters perhaps) a bit more focus on PXG as a team, what Loki wants from them, how they first met, a stated philosophy and much more.",
            "Final page is so raw, kaiser pulling down his shirt to expose his blue rose tattoo, showing the world that he made the impossible possible",
            "The motion rotation force lines and thorns artwork is  insane this chapter. They really had to dedicate 5 doublespread pages (+1 for Isagi reaction) just to fully showcase the whole Magnus shot. Oh god thats crazy because the Kaiser Impact Manshine shot also got 5 doublespread pages dedicated to it. Is it safe to say Kaiser is the only character this far to have the most pages dedicated to pure goal shot movement?\n\nTo the people who said that they could have squeezed a goal at the end of 265 now know why the creators waited for 266 to show it off in its full glory while inserting those emotional beats with one last flashback to show Kaiser's true innocent wishes. THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE ABOUT TO COOK\n\nTHE ENDING SHOT GODDDD ALL THOSE PETALS\n\nKANESHIRO NOMURA ARE INSANE!!! THE WAIT WAS WORTH",
            "\u201cA super golazo that leaves the entire world stunned in awe and amazement! A goal displaying his prodigious talent! A charismatic goal that ONLY HE can score! A goal befitting a Kaiser!! With a single strike, Micheal Kaiser shifts the momentum back in his favor!!\u201d \n\nWhoever wrote this at the end of the chapter is so real \ud83d\ude2d  this is 100% facts fr!!",
            "Bro, Kaiser has quickly become one of the best written characters \n\nHis speech about love was amazing character development"

            "Isagi said he was gonna kill him at one point",
            "Ironic isn\u2019t? Kaiser even said to himself that Isagi reminded him of his father, yet Isagi is somewhat the only person to give genuine love to Kaiser.",
            "I want an AU where Snuffy adopted Kaiser and Ubers just 0 diff the entire league",
            "this post is vicious assault. \n\nHis father had a duty to give him love and support, it\u2019s  mentioned that even if Kaiser did everything right (stole everything his father wanted) he was still beaten. He created Kaiser\u2019s fragility + modelled the whole \u201cinflict despair to feel human\u201d. \n\nKaiser is a bastard to Isagi, they are rivals so there\u2019s the expectation (or even justification) of hatred/hostility between them. Yet Isagi\u2019s alarmingly practical and rational. He hates Kaiser\u2019s actions specifically and not his fundamental existence like his father- but smiles at his plays + success, whilst simultaneously being his rival that gives as good as he gets. Isagi managed to get Kaiser to break his own fragility and fosters Kaiser\u2019s growth as a person and player (regular Tuesday for him tbh)- he modelled resilience and adaptation.",
            "Kaisers relationship with isagi is twisted in a sense that kaiser still doesn't believe he's human and undeserving of a relationship. He threw away his relationship with everyone. It's only him and the ball, the only person who has genuine administration for kaiser is isagi. And it's purely based off of what kaiser can do not kaiser himself. Yeah isagi gets angry but kaiser only takes it as love because that's the way he sees life, through pain. Kaiser desperately wants a friend and isagi can become that by the end of this match. I predict next chapter isagi congratulates kaiser and that breaks kaiser down. Isagi is really good at meeting people where they are.\u00a0",
