            "People gonna hate but the story is actually insane. 4 steals per game and 2 blocks per game at home. 2 steals per game and 1 block per game away.\n\nAt home they have evidence of a game where the Hawks had 10 TOs total and 10 steals credited to the Bulls, which meant the Hawks never committed an offensive foul, traveled, or threw the ball out of bounds. Instantly they saw many times the ball did go out, they counted 2 steals and MJ ended with 5 on the stat sheet. Many times they believe balls tipped by Jordan that went back to the Hawks, were credited to MJ with no change of possession.\n\nThe NBA never confirmed his stats (nor did they care). These stat inflations go further than MJ, Wilt and Bill Russell were credited with 26 40+ rebound games, all 26 were credited at Home.\n\nFull story link: https://sports.yahoo.com/a-closer-look-at-michael-jordans-1988-dpoy-award-raises-questions-about-its-validity-has-lebron-james-been-chasing-a-ghost-140452567.html",

            "https://deadspin.com/the-confessions-of-an-nba-scorekeeper-5345287/ . . . . the time a stat keeper deliberately inflated assist numbers just to prove a point.\n\nIt's always weird to me how rarely big-time sports have revewed and double-checked stats, even in playoffs/finals. E.g. Tim Duncan got robbed of at least one block in the 2003 Finals in a game he was 2 blocks short of a quadruple-double, and in the famous 2005 Texas/USC game, Vince Young's winning TD is in the box as an 8-yard run, even though the ball was exactly on the 9-yard hash to start the play. Also, on the previous drive on 3rd down, LenDale White lost the ball and had a teammate recover it, but this fumble and recovery aren't in the official stats at all.\n\nThey may review things better now, but it's still not consistent. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vzw3n27K1o This was considered an assist by Marcus Smart, for example.",

Back then stocks were a lot more valued, and there's no way he got that DPOY with his away numbers, and even assuming the home numbers are better, they definitely are way overblown.",
