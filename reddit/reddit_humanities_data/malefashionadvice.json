            "Is it a faux pas to wear one\u2019s wedding suit after the fact? I\u2019ve thought that it would be a great opportunity to justify buying a nicer suit than I\u2019d ordinarily be able to and use for a while, but I had a conversation with a friend who was a bit confused by that thinking. Basically, because it\u2019s such a special garment, wearing it often would be a bit weird. My thinking is garments can be worn at all kinds of special occasions, so why would a wedding suit be any different?\n\nWhich mindset is correct?",
            " recently came to the realization that my feet are too wide for most shoes, after buying a pair of wide shoes. Now all of my shoes are supremely uncomfortable. Any recommendations for wide toed shoes that aren't dad sneakers? I like to wear boots, and enjoy a slight heel. \n\nAlso, I dance salsa and like to wear dressy pants with camp collar shirts. Any recommendations and flexible dress pants for those of us with bigger legs/behinds? I only fit into 541 Levi's and other athletic fit pants normally. Thank you.",

I know Gianni Campagna was a famous Italian suit designer, I just bought these shoes on a thrift store and am not sure if he ever designed any shoes at all.

Full rim. The frames are also not too thick and not too thin.

Unfortunately the Real McCoys is sold out in my size -34 to my knowledge. The Buzz Ricksons I don\u2019t know how I feel about the Ties on the bottom of the pants in case I may need to roll them up due to length being an issue.\n\nWhat belt would you recommend for both denim jeans and the cargo pants?\n\nWhat about socks?\n\nWhat about some vintage looking shorts?\n\nShoes? I\u2019ve heard PRAS and Pottery are awesome! Any others? Hopefully they don\u2019t look and feel like a basic Chuck Taylor\u2019s.\n\nMaybe a backup denim pair to be different than my Fullcount 0105xx?\n\nAny other T-shirts you recommend other than the ones I mentioned above?\n\nAny other piece of garnet im missing?",
