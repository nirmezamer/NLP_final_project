            "So as someone who grew up in a conservative small town, fashion and personal style has never been something that I've been surrounded by for a lot of my life. But since I started going to university in a big city, I have been pretty in awe of how so many people use fashion as a way of expressing themselves. I've always wanted to express myself through fashion but don't have any clue of where to begin with that. Like I want to dress more out there, accessorise more, etc but I don't know how to start.\n\nAnyone have any advice, even if it's just small ways of finding personal expression?",
            "So generally, when people say they want to elevate their style (as is the case with me, for example) I assume they mean something more than, like a graphic t-shirt and jeans. Is there anything specifically unfashionable about that? If, say you got a nice souvenir t-shirt from vacation, would you not be able to throw that on with a pair of jeans and call it a style? On a semi-related note, are there any graphic tees that would not pair well with a button down/overshirt?",
            "Need some advice on birthday dinner outfit. Based in Dallas so something cool and breathable is a must right now, with that in mind I picked up a off-white Tommy Bahama linen shirt, but can\u2019t make a decision as to what kind of slacks to wear with it. Was planning on some low top brown leather sneakers as well. Also I am a fairly large guy in stature so nothing with a skinny fit \ud83e\udd23 any advice is appreciated \ud83d\ude04",
            "First time poster here. I\u2019m in my late 20s and about to start my first high school teaching job. Problem now is idk what would be good to wear (what\u2019s too formal/casual) and need advice on what to buy to expand my small wardrobe. I do like polos more than button downs if that helps for the advice.",
            "I'm looking for some help for a gift for my partner - I recently saw him wrapped up in a big fuzzy blanket and he looked stunning - so I decided I would love to get him a coat with a big fluffy collar as a gift. He's a low effort guy and has had the same coat for at least a decade, so it doesnt have to be ridiculously fancy - but we *do* live in Montana so it has to be decently insulated, or else hell never wear it and then theres no point. However, I'm having trouble finding anything that looks like what I'm thinking - regardless of budget- outside of a few websites with sketchy reputations.\n\nI'm gonna put a link with a screenshot of three of the best looking ones I've found - though only the green one has a reputation I'd consider taking a risk on - and budget wise, I cant trust any winter coat that isnt at least a hundred or two. Otherwise I'm just kind of trying to get a feel for what I'm looking at - if it turns out anything in this style is going to be four or more digits I can temper my schemes accordingly, but I'm just not having much luck finding anything legitimate to really get a sense of it.",

I've bought a few suits during that time, because I need them for work, but I've been waiting to get to a more-or-less permanent weight before trying to put a wardrobe back together.  \n\nA local upscale store has a couple of Canali suits on sale. The jackets fit me well. The pants fit well enough to be tailored to fit; they were snug in the hips and thighs, but my hips and thighs are a little bigger than spec for my frame.  \n\nI might, optimistically, lose another 20 lbs. What's the chance that going from 205 to 185 ruins the fit of a suit? Taking the pants in, or the waist of the jacket, is no big deal, but if I go down to a size 40 and the jackets don't fit in the shoulders, I'll be sorry. On the other hand, if I stay as a size 42, I may be sorry I didn't jump at the on-sale suits when I had the chance.  \n\nHas anyone been through this before? How much weight equates to moving a size up or down? For men with big hips and thighs, what suit brands work well?\n\n",

            "Sometimes, you might go down another size.  If you are worried about it, just buy one suit. Your shoulders can loosen more as you lose more weight and jackets aren't cheap to tailor.",
            "I recently lost 15 pounds, went from 197 to 182, and wear a 42 short suit size.  Although, I can tell that the 42 size is starting to fit a little loose, it\u2019s still not too obvious where the jacket needs to be re tailored.  It has in fact motived me to continue working out to lose a couple more pounds.  The suit is the last thing on my mind.  I only wear Brooks Brothers suits for context.  Brother, keep doing you and good luck!",
            "The cost of food for maintaining a weight 20 lbs extra weight as well as long term medical expenses will be more expensive than any suit.  Keep up the good work.",
            "I weigh 30lbs less than you and wear a 42 jacket. I think there should be wiggle room.",
            "Depends how you\u2019re losing the weight\u2026i fluctuate by about 20 lbs between summer and winter but do it on purpose basically bulking and cutting. \n\nIf you\u2019re lifting weights and keeping protein up generally your shoulders won\u2019t fluctuate much but your waist will. I get my jackets tailored at my heavier weight and get two pairs of pants, one size down and my current size at the time\n\nI would say don\u2019t plan for weight you\u2019re going to lose until you\u2019ve lost it, just get a suit that fits and a second pair of pants you can bring in if needed\u2026fluctuation is pretty normal for most people",
            "It\u2019s roughly 20-25 pounds per suit jacket size, but it\u2019s really difficult to predict ahead of time where the weight will come off. I started wearing smaller shoes and had to resize my wedding ring after weight loss, because apparently I was storing fat in my feet and fingers. So for a suit, where ideally you have accurate shoulder, chest and waist measurements, you can\u2019t really know what your new measurements will be after losing X amount of weight.\n\nDon\u2019t buy any suits until your weight is stable. I bought a new suit for a wedding after losing 25 pounds, thinking I was approaching a stable weight, and went on to lose another 25 pounds. I wound up only wearing that suit once.\n\nI recommend just wearing the suits a little big until you\u2019ve plateaued and maintained your weight for 2-3 months."

I have been wanting to add some clothing for dates with woman, but have some questions on things.\n\nFirstly, I have heard that button up / button down shirts are a very popular and safe choice for dinner dates. However, what kind of button up / button down shirts are acceptable? Dress shirts? Oxfords? Button down Collars? Linen Shirts? I'd most likely wear dark jeans or chinos for my bottoms.\n\nSecondly, do guys ever wear dress shirts on dates? Can they be worn without ties? Can they be worn with dark jeans? Can they be used casually or only in a very formal environment? Also would the type of shirt collar matter if the top button or two were left unbuttoned?\n\nThank you to anyone who has any input on any of these questions!

            "Biggest advice is you don\u2019t want to outdress your date in terms of formality. Your clothing should match what you\u2019re doing and the culture or style where you live. If you\u2019re going to a cafe, a casual button down, or nice shirt, jeans, khakis, clean sneakers make a good outfit. Look neat and put together but don\u2019t overdress. If you\u2019re going out for drinks or dinner or activities like a show, dressing up your shoes and wearing a nicer shirt would be appropriate, you generally can\u2019t go wrong with a nice pair of black or khaki pants that fit you well, and a long or short sleeve button down shirt depending on the season. The shirts without the tie buttons on the collar will look more relaxed when worn without a tie. For basics, non-white socks, and pick up some v-neck undershirts to wear beneath your button downs."

I'm looking for an affordable (but not the cheapest) black suit. I understand the controversy surrounding black suits, but I'm obliged to buy my first one as part of an upcoming wedding party. I'm not looking to break the bank for this suit given that I won't be wearing it frequently, but I figure I shouldn't buy the cheapest possible black suit either as I will have use for it in the future for funerals, etc. Ideally I wouldn't need to spend more than a few hundred dollars but I'm open to increasing the budget if it'd be worth it. I have time to get an off-the-rack suit tailored if that would be the recommended course of action, though would appreciate guidance on that as my prior suits have all been tailored at the stores where I bought them (I've never had to search out a tailor myself). I'm located in Boston if there are any local suit shops, tailors, etc. that are recommended. Thanks in advance!",

It\u2019s a used clothing store so prices are significantly higher than say goodwill but you will get something decent.  I don\u2019t love the prices of their shoes though. \n\nIf that won\u2019t work for whatever reason, try Macys Bar III. Make sure there\u2019s a sale or available coupon (there almost always is).  Prices have crept up over the years so  it\u2019s not a great value it once was but it will look the part.",
