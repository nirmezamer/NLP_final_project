            "I just realized I was scared of Homelander showing up in all the A-Train scenes... even though there was no chance of that happening because of Homelander's plot this episode... maybe the most terrifying character I've ever seen."

            "That\u2019s the point. No one on the show is purely anything. It\u2019s all gray like any person in real life is. It\u2019s just amplified because she\u2019s a supe",
            "Well, yes, but you just don't do what they are doing without having your hands dirty",
            "The Gecko situation is I agree pretty much wholly fucked. \n\nThe carjacking tho contains more. Annie while not intending to did kill a guy, she definently commited manslaughter. However the only reason the situation developed as it did was cause of Butcher. He brandished a weapon, escalated and deliberately agitated both Annie and the driver. Annie is responsible for his death but the only reason that occurred is cause Butcher is a callous ass.",
            "That's the whole point of The Boys: to bring accountability to the supes. Most of them have no training, there seems to be almost no protocol to rescue civilians / hostages (if there is, they don't follow since there will be a clean up crew and PR team to sweep it under the rug), ...",
            "According to this episode, Annie is close to maxing out her credit card too.\n\nWhat a horrible person!",
            "y\u2019all think you\u2019d be butcher but you\u2019d be one of the general public idiots whose opinions get swayed by vought\u2019s propaganda",
            "People who are watching and keeping score of who is a \u201cgood person\u201d or \u201cbad person\u201d are doing it wrong.  There\u2019s no such thing as an objectively \u201cgood person\u201d in the show or real life.  These posts with some kinda \u201cgotcha!\u201d as a way to tear down a character aren\u2019t particularly insightful. \n\nAnnie is presented as someone trying to navigate the situations she finds herself as best she can.  She\u2019s made mistakes, and her hands aren\u2019t clean.  No one\u2019s hands on this show are clean - it\u2019s a f***ed up, sick world they inhabit.  Characters are messy and complex (like real people) - depth and insight is found by embracing the grey, and the contradictions that they represent.",
            "Okay, first, having an abortion isn't anything you get to judge the right or wrongness of.  \n\nI am glad the show didn't make it into something she did behind Huey's back and have him find out that way as it would have been the worst manufactured conflict with them yet.\n\nBut the entire point was that wasn't even something wrong that she did, yet she's more vilified for it than if Firecracker gave her real reason for hating Annie.  Because the argument is not whether or not Annie has done bad things, Firecracker is a literal manifestation of a bad thing she did in the past and is paying for now.  In case you haven't noticed it's kind of the overarching theme of season 4.  Frenchie falling for a man whose family he slaughtered, Huey's mom coming back to the family she abandoned, Huey after not having been there for his dad in recent seasons now not being trusted to make decisisons about his health, Kimiko running into a girl she helped abduct, just to name a few.",
