Like I'm just glad that this is the vibe that I'm giving off, non-threatening, come ask me a question no problemo, definitely not an old lech.

In many parts of the world, it's normal to do things in your 40s, but in Vancouver, there's always been some ageism, both weirdly voluntary   by that I mean, people shutting themselves away because they turned 31 or so, and also the discrimination inflicted on older people, but that obviously changing.

        "content": "Heyo!\n\nI\u2019ve heard a lot about how the driving in Richmond is so bad so I decided to see if that\u2019s actually true, statistically.\n\n**So, does Richmond have more accidents than other cities in the Lower Mainland?**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vaqwlsz2se9d1.png?width=1943&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffe7a190d206e0b945fbeee36fe564bb13e15bf8\n\n**Not really!** Richmond makes up about 8.2% of Lower Mainland crashes and has about 3% higher crash rates per person than Vancouver Proper (in 2022, for all following stats).\n\nFor reference, Vancouver Proper makes up 25% of crashes in the Lower Mainland of the \\*communities I chose to include with 64.1 crashes per 10 000 people. Richmond makes up 8% of crashes with 66.4 crashes per 10 000 people. However North Vancouver, with only 4% of total crashes, has about 86.3 crashes per 10 000 people, 3*4% higher* than Vancouver Proper!\n\nI think a lot of the disproportionate blaming of Richmond and Surrey is from intentional and unintentional racism, so I also looked at some of the numbers of ethnicities.\n\nRichmond is mostly Asian (74.8%), Vancouver proper is 48.2% European settlers and 49.6% Asian and North Vancouver is a majority of Europeans (65.2%)!\n\nLangley, on the other hand, is 12.6% Asian, 79.1% European descent but has 15% higher crash rates than Richmond. Surrey is 54.3% Asian and actually has *16% fewer* accidents per 10 000 people than Vancouver Proper.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u2hqvrz2se9d1.png?width=2617&format=png&auto=webp&s=dffe0f864a8a23bdd9b2a4cae189b91907ac6dc3\n\nFinally, on a more subjective note, I see comments talking about \u201cit being okay to come to Canada, but don\u2019t try to make it the country you chose to leave\u201d. I suspect that upon interviewing Immigrants to Canada, \u2018quality of driving\u2019 would probably not be in the top 10, even 50 reasons someone might leave their home country. It\u2019s certainly not why my ancestors immigrated, European nor Asian. Also, if you\u2019re like me and not Indigenous and from this area, remember that *you're guests on this land*. Check yourself.\n\nI\u2019m a mix of Asian and European blood and I drive in the Lower Mainland so I figured I was a reasonable person to make these graphs. I also say this to explain why I talked about Europeans and Asians in particular and to cover myself from identity politics finger-pointing!\n\nA few places where this data fails (to keep the haters at bay):\n\n1. No unreported accidents.\n2. No near misses.\n3. No types of vehicle nor traffic (industrial, tourists, etc.).\n4. Mismatched data - Crash and total population data from 2022, ethnic makeup is from 2016 - although I doubt it\u2019s changed considerably.\n5. \\*Some communities aren\u2019t technically Lower Mainland, but I don\u2019t know what other region would claim them that has a similar sized audience. I chose the cutoff as approximately Lower Mainland and at least 10 000 people.\n6. Ethnicity data doesn\u2019t well represent mixed kids like myself; there\u2019s actually a negative percentage of people who aren\u2019t Asian or European in Richmond. Definitions of Ethnicities are given by Stats Canada, linked below.\n7. I grouped everyone who isn\u2019t Asian or European as just \u201cOther\u201d.\n8. **\\*Edit from comments\\*** Does not consider commuters - assumes that every crash is of people from that area. I don't know of a better way than to assume that most people driving in an area are from that area, and bordering cities to Richmond are still lower than Richmond itself.\n\n[Crash Data](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/icbc/viz/ICBCReportedCrashes/ICBCReportedCrashes-LowerMainland#1)\n\n[Population Estimates](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/statistics/people-population-community/population/population-estimates)\n\n[Ethnicity Breakdown](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/index.cfm?Lang=E)\n\nLet me know what you think I missed!

            "Of course it doesn't. This is the oldest and most tired racist trope in the Lower Mainland, and it's a bunch of bull.\n\nNow there IS one demographic on the local roads that is responsible for a lot of accidents: the olds. We should be pulling boomers licences, or at the very least making them take a test every 2-5 years.",
            "The stereotype of \"Richmond drivers\" are not driving *dangerously*. They are perceived to be driving *stupidly* with less confidence. So, assuming that were true, they would naturally tend to get into less major accidents because they tend to be less reckless.\n- My mom is one",
            "It is definitely just racism, just like the people who start yelling about deportation in crime posts before the name or ethnicity or residency status of the offender is released.",
            "The two factors I can think of are: There was a scandal a few years back where some folks at the Richmond ICBC office were taking money under the table for years, to give people a pass on their driving test. And there are some pretty convoluted and confusing traffic configurations in Richmond, especially near the airport, which probably feel especially crazy and stressful for the folks who only ever go through there when theyre catching a flight.",
            "The top four on your list are all areas where most of the traffic is highway traffic.  Even though there are less accidents per driver on highways, the sheer volume of traffic on them means there are more accidents per resident due to commuters from other cities.\n\nRichmond is mostly local street traffic, and if you are driving in a city on regular roads with intersections, bikers, pedestrians then yeah Richmond has the worst drivers."
