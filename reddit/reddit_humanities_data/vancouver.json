Direct sow your ornamental flowers. No guarentees they won't come back with a shovel, but it makes things harder to get at when seedlings grow root systems rather than transplanting. Plus it takes a while before the plant ends up flowering. Also grow them in clusters, therefore it's harder to get at one plant.
