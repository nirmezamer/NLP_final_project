            "I don't know who's even going to read this but I just wanted to say that I'm thrilled I decided to pick this game up again after quitting years ago. I couldn't get past Blood Starved Beast. Even before that, I quit after 15 minutes on that first road. I'm not good at games like this and I'm still not great but I'm doing well enough to get by.\n\nI only have 6 bosses left between the dlc and main game, 2 of which are optional. Lady Maria is kicking my ass right now but it's a fun battle and I'll get her eventually.\n\nI can't believe I'm finally so close to finishing when I never thought I had it in me. Thank you to this awesome community for encouraging me to try again and stick with it.\n\nEdit: 5 bosses left. I finally took Maria down.",

            "SPOILERS AND A THEORY , I have a theory  about the lore , so everyone doesnt know how yharnam exactly work like why the night is longer than normal why when gherman kills you u wake up on a sunrise where the hunt is just finishes well i got a theory im not sure if anyone had it before but what if the moon presence need human mediator to visit other planes , like when the moon presence first came to yharnam wasnt it because gherman contacted him so the moon presence created the hunters dream world for gherman to train hunters and send them to the hunt then the moon presence have you the hunter as a mediator in the real world maybe thats why everytime you leave the dream its the hunt because everytime the moon presence have a presence in yharnam everyone turns into a monster so actually u are the problem not the savior plus thats why when gherman severs your connection to the dream he severs your connection to the moon presence so you are not longer his mediator to the waking world thats why when you wake up after gherman scythe your head its sunrise the moon presence have no presence in the waking world anymore , idk if any of this tbh makes since i just thought about it and my english sucks so im not sure if i explained it right",
            "You guys, i honestly can\u2019t get over BB. I\u2019ve never played any Souls games before. I first played this game back when it first came ps+ on PS4 and i couldn\u2019t get past the Cleric beast and i gave up. Last December i bought it on PS5 and i just can\u2019t believe what ive been missing on. Im trapped in its world ever since. I finished it couple of times and got the DLC and almost at the end. I watched every lore video, understood its story like no other game, i just roam the place and i don\u2019t know what to say i just am in love. Part of me just hates how late i am to this masterpiece. And no i haven\u2019t played elden ring or any souls because I know for a fact i won\u2019t love it as much. I genuinely don\u2019t know how to explain my feelings towards it but i truly love it and appreciate it in every way imaginable.",

Thank you for making it, OP. \n\nWe can speculate forever about the meaning of the line \"even the doll, should you please\" but, it's clear that of all the tools of the workshop Gehrman sees her as having a special and elevated status.
