            "SPOILERS AND A THEORY , I have a theory  about the lore , so everyone doesnt know how yharnam exactly work like why the night is longer than normal why when gherman kills you u wake up on a sunrise where the hunt is just finishes well i got a theory im not sure if anyone had it before but what if the moon presence need human mediator to visit other planes , like when the moon presence first came to yharnam wasnt it because gherman contacted him so the moon presence created the hunters dream world for gherman to train hunters and send them to the hunt then the moon presence have you the hunter as a mediator in the real world maybe thats why everytime you leave the dream its the hunt because everytime the moon presence have a presence in yharnam everyone turns into a monster so actually u are the problem not the savior plus thats why when gherman severs your connection to the dream he severs your connection to the moon presence so you are not longer his mediator to the waking world thats why when you wake up after gherman scythe your head its sunrise the moon presence have no presence in the waking world anymore , idk if any of this tbh makes since i just thought about it and my english sucks so im not sure if i explained it right",
            "You guys, i honestly can\u2019t get over BB. I\u2019ve never played any Souls games before. I first played this game back when it first came ps+ on PS4 and i couldn\u2019t get past the Cleric beast and i gave up. Last December i bought it on PS5 and i just can\u2019t believe what ive been missing on. Im trapped in its world ever since. I finished it couple of times and got the DLC and almost at the end. I watched every lore video, understood its story like no other game, i just roam the place and i don\u2019t know what to say i just am in love. Part of me just hates how late i am to this masterpiece. And no i haven\u2019t played elden ring or any souls because I know for a fact i won\u2019t love it as much. I genuinely don\u2019t know how to explain my feelings towards it but i truly love it and appreciate it in every way imaginable.",

Thank you for making it, OP. \n\nWe can speculate forever about the meaning of the line \"even the doll, should you please\" but, it's clear that of all the tools of the workshop Gehrman sees her as having a special and elevated status. And when she wakes, so do we.",
            "I saw a theory a while back, it basically said that it wasn't made because Gerhman was an obsessive seggsual creep. He made it to be a copy of the woman he most admitted and considered an adopted daughter. And he never is near the Doll in the dream, because no matter how \"perfect\" he made it, it would never be how he remembered her. It made me sad.",

            "So it's a translation era?  How is the relationship perceived in Japanese? Is it that he didn't have a crush on her? Or is it that he didn't think of her like a daughter? Because it's only through both of those being true simultaneously that Gherman's relationship with Maria feels weird.\n\nI don't hate Gherman btw. He chooses to kill us amd wake us up rather than let us suffer in his place, I don't think he is a bad character. I just don't like the way his relationship with Maria is depicted, at least in English.",
            "In the japanese the \"should it please you\" dialogue is delivered more as a \"shes also a tool, you can use her aswell if you want hehe :)\" instead of what they gave us in eng, which sounds less of a chummy little comment (which pretty much rooted every other translation afaik, thus spreading that out), his bond with the doll is clearly a little distant considering how shes the live image of Maria yet just a vague imitation on personality as far as i am concerned.\n\nAlso worry not! I totally get the last part, just wanted to add that because it plays a big part on how some headcanons are constructed if reffering to him just based on hearsay, ur good!! :)",

        "content": "I want to start this with Bloodborne was my first Platinumed game on PS4. From what I remember I loved it more than anything and sunk insane amount of hours into it. Then as time went on other games came out including other souls games and I got into them. Eventually I ended up having to sell my PlayStation for financial reasons. So I went back to my Xbox. \n\nAfter years of not owning a PlayStation and playing other Souls games and with Shadow of the Erdtree now released I figured I\u2019d take a little break from Elden Ring and fire up my recently acquired PS5 and play my original copy of Bloodborne. \n\nStarting it up felt amazing. A lot of the world started coming back to me and I fell in love almost instantly again (even though the 30fps took a little bit to get used to) after playing all these other games. \n\nAs I beat the Cleric Beast with little trouble I began to explore every nook and cranny. This was great. I was really feeling like this was my first playthrough again. \n\nEventually I got near Father Gascoigne and remembered I had the Beckoning Bell and thought \u201clet\u2019s play with a random Hunter.\u201d So I rang the bell and waited for a few.\n\nHonestly after about 60 seconds of waiting I forgot I rang the bell and ended up exploring a bit more before reaching the boss. Then it happened\u2026 a hunter was summoned. A real person just like the old days. Excited waved and proceeded to the boss. They followed and the fight started.\n\nFighting with this random player was a blast, but like all good things\u2026 they must come an end and the Hunter had perished. This left me to finish the fight alone to which it was a success.\n\nAfter the fight I started exploring again for a while. Making my way through the maze of a world and collecting items trying to find everything I could. Then I remembered again\u2026 I have the bell. Let\u2019s ring it again.\n\nThe bell echoed across the land and I waited.\n\nAnd waited\u2026\n\nNothing happened. No one answered the call. I figured maybe I\u2019d take a break, and try another day.   \n\nBut that day hasn\u2019t come. I\u2019ve rang the bell and no one has answered. I\u2019ve waited patiently throughout different times of the day and nothing... I\u2019m alone.\n\nNow I want to make it known that I don\u2019t need to summon anyone. I know there are subreddits that you can reach out to for help, but I wanted that organic feeling of ringing that bell like I did 8ish years ago. To explore this world with one or two other Hunters. But unfortunately it didn\u2019t happen. \n\nI will continue to play through the game, but there is something really somber about actually being alone in this game. There is \u201cno help\u201d if you try to go about it the way I am. No posts. No messages. Just a ringing of a bell echoing to nothingness. I understand NPC summons are an option but it\u2019s not the same. \n\nI will continue my journey and ring my bell. Maybe\u2026 just maybe someone will hear it and we can explore this beautiful world together like we did once before. \n\n\u2026and if you happen to be playing the game and ring yours. I\u2019ll be there to stop the echo. I may be only one lonely Hunter, but i\u2019ll do my best to answer your Bell.\n\n- A Lonely Hunter\n",

            "Everyone is still playing Shadow of the Erdtree. Hell, I started replaying Elden Ring at the beginning of June. Beat Erdtree a couple days ago. I'm still playing Elden Ring cause I want to get all the achievements and do a couple NG+ runs. I'm sure Bloodborne will be less lonely in a month or two. \n\nIt's fun playing Elden Ring right now cause everyone is playing it. It's fun to read all the messages and see everyone's ghosts, even in base game areas. Right now is Elden Ring hype, so if you want to feel less lonely just play Elden Ring.",
            "So that's what a first playthrough was like back then! I played it first only a few years ago and since I never have PS+ I missed out on all the messages and coop fun that's supposed to be part of the game... It still was a magical experience, but now I do remember, how awesome it was when I played Dark Souls 3 last year (on PC) and summoned some random dude who then walked me through the entire level and showed me every door and shortcut, since I hadn't explored it yet. He then carried me until the boss fight, which we ended up winning together on the first try. It didn't feel as difficult as it normally would, but there was also this sense of adventure and following a master or something like that. It was a really special experience. But yeah, I can't wait for the day a Bloodborne remaster (or remake hopefully) comes to PS5 and PC and I can experience this game again but with frame rates that don't give me a headache and better resolution with proper anti-aliasing so the details in the distance don't flicker like they do now on a bigger screen. And most importantly, I'll then play it online and will enjoy it with all the funny messages that made Elden Ring so much more fun the first time."
