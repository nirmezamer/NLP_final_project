            "We get all worked up about this, and I think it's a justified complaint, but I know that there are 3rd parties who make an app or a portal that accesses Reddit content and then that 3rd party applies ads and other thresholds to monetize access to the Reddit content that you made, and that the portal does not create and does not add value to.  It's a lot like when you create some image or video content for free, but then someone else comes along and charges access to see what you made and they get $$ while you get nothing. \n\nI think exorbitant fees are ridiculous, but 3rd party folks charging for access to something that reddit helped to create and makes available for free, seems a lot like a scam.",
