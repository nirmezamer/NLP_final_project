There are many things that make this show awful but those are just a few. I would like to thank everyone who supported this season and helped to ruin one of the best shows of all time.

They became too self-aware. Nature created an aspect of nature separate from itself. They are creatures that should not exist by natural law. They are things that labor under the illusion of having a self. This accretion of sensory experience and feeling programmed with total assurance that they're each somebody. When, in fact, everybody\u2019s nobody. Maybe the honorable thing for their species to do is deny their programming, stop reproducing, walk hand in hand into extinction, one last checkout, brothers and sisters opting out of a raw deal.*"
