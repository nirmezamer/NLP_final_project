            "do both ps4 and ps4 pro have hdd as default?",
            "my ps4 isn't turning on its been like 3 days i thought it was cuz of the cable but I just bought a new one and yet it dosent turn on what do I do",
            "Does Anybody know how to downgrade Versions of Minecraft PS4 Edition? (Not Bedrock)",
            "So the thing is I bought used dualshock 4 to play on PC and no matter what I've done the lightbar stayed off. I thought its broken, but controller works just fine, so whatever. BUT! It actually works, but only while vibrating.\n\nHas anyone any idea what's wrong?",
            "Hi guys I have been kinda bored of the current games I have been playing and was wondering if you have any good suggestions for new ones I have ps plus extra and have 2 platinums. Just for context some of my favourite games were Minecraft, Spider-Man 2018, Fortnite, miles morales, heavenly bodies, shovel knight and all time favourite rocket league which I just platinumed :( looking for something new thanks",
            "Does anyone have any recommendations for single PS4 controller docks? I can only seem to find duos, and I have no plans to get a second controller",
            "Obviously. Like any computer they can't function without them. It's where the system software (think Windows for a Pc) is installed to and runs from.",
            "If nothing happens, no lights or anything then send it for repair if you can afford it",
            "If you own the original game on disc you may be able to play it without any patches.\n\nWith Playstation it's all or nothing in terms of patches",
            "Safe mode 2. Lower the resolution. Safe mode is 480p, the PS4s resolution varies from 1080p to 4K depending on your model/TV.\n\nSo your monitor needs a lower resolution to display your consoles image"

            "NHL 24 is so dead they had to add it as a free game. Maybe I will actually be able to get an opponent now.\n\nEdit: it's actually a pretty fun game as far as sports games go. If you have quick reflexes, that is.",
            "I'm usually the guy defending ps+, but this is pretty boring.",
            "why did they hike the prices up again?!?!",
            "Good for anyone wanting the Borderlands games because the Handsome Collection is always on sale at \u20ac10/$10",
            "I do enjoy NHL games but it's been hard to justify buying a new one the past couple years, so I'm cool with getting it for free to jump in a couple exhibition games from time to time.",
            "Got to be the worst month in recent memory",
            "I've been wanting to play NHL for years but I wasn't willing to pay for it, it's a great month just for that for me",
            "Borderlands 3 is pretty fun for those who never tried\n\nBut damn the villain twins were so cringey",
            "I am absolutely positive Borderlands 3 was on here before.",

            "It\u2019s time to move on from these post.",
            "Which is fine, honestly. Not every game needs to turn into a multi game media franchise. It\u2019s cool that we got a biker zombie game from Bend and it\u2019s cool that they\u2019re now working on something different.",
            "Damn shame. I really loved the first one and as long as the 2nd one didn't have any thing to do with multiplayer I'm sure I would've loved the 2nd one as well. SMH.",

            "For the love of God give us more co op focused games.",
