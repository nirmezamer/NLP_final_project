Tsumuri, the former navigator of the Desire Grand Prix seeks out Kuroto Dan to bestow him the power of Creation, in order to prevent more innocent people from being needlessly sacrificed to further Zein's forced utopia.*\n\n*Unfortunately for the Game Master himself, Zein proved to be invincible to deal with. However, all hope is not lost when a mysterious Kamen Rider appeared and stood before Kamen Rider Zein \u2014 Kamen Rider Zero-Three. This mysterious Rider's identity remains a mystery, but one surrounding question regarding this new Rider: is he a friend or a foe?*\n___\n\n||TITLE|RELEASE DATE|SCREENPLAY BY|DIRECTED BY|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n||ep.5 Goddess of Genesis and the Third Singularity|May 12, 2024|Yuya Takahashi|Takayuki Shibasaki|\n\n___\n\nPrevious Discussion Threads:\n\n**Geats Extra: Kamen Rider Gazer:** https://redd.it/1c00h95\n\n**Kamen Rider Geats: Jyamato Awaking:** https://redd.it/1c00grb\n\n**Kamen Rider the Winter Movie: Gotchard & Geats Strongest Chemy \u2605 Gotcha Great Operation:** https://redd.it/1cnf3iq",

            "The word \"death\" doesn't exist in the dictionary of Kuroto Dan. He just keeps coming back. Also, this was the first time he renounced his godhood. I'm guessing he gets it back after he revives as human, lol.\n\n  \nAdmitedally I'm an idiot but I think Zero-Three really represents a true Kamen Rider. They are not entirely good or entirely evil. Zein which was meant to be the culmination of main Riders is just as evil as the foes they fight, to which Zero-Three (combination of There and Ark) serve as an answer.\n\n  \nI wonder what they'll do with Evolto (or I guess Evol-X).",
