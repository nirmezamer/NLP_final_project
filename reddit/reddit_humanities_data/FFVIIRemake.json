            "Is it just me or does time just disappear when playing this game? A few times Ive blinked and its 1am and Ive been playing for 5 hours. Never experienced it quite to this degree before!",
            "PSA: kupo charm (which sometimes gives you double crafting mats when you collect some) works even if it's on a party member that isn't in your current party.",
            "This is probably one of the funniest games Ive played in recent memory. Like legit laugh out loud moments all the time. I had to pause it when I got to upper Junon cuz I gave myself cramps",
            "Anyone have any recommendations for audio settings? I feel like it's no secret that the mixing can be pretty poor at times; in my case, it feels like the voices are way too low (or the music is way too high), but when it's just the music standalone with no voices, I wish it could be a tad higher. Feels like there's no good middleground.\n\nIf anyone's found a good balance that works I'd love to give it a try.",
            "PSA: You can use the triggers to switch between the different stores at the Gold Saucer. Did it by accident and almost cried at how much time I'd wasted traveling to each zone.\n\nLess important PSA: \"Maycomb Blume\" or however it's spelled is a pun, \"make 'em bloom.\" Maybe I'm just an idiot for not understanding why Aerith got up but when I realized it was a funny pseudonym the dad in me audibly chuckled.",
            "Do the protorelic missions ever stop being silly? Only up to the second region, but the first one was with the stupid criminals and the second one is fort condor. Are they all kinda comic relief?",
            "I was meh on and on the fence about Cait Sith in the original game\n\nIn this game I fackin lave the wee robo bastard",
            "Devs played a lot of Ghost of Tsushima in between Remake and Rebirth.",
            "This may sound hyperbolic but this may be the best FF game I have played in a long time. Every time I get to a new town or see a big chapter piece, just smiling ear to ear. Im in love with this game and its so hard to put down. I want to be in the world for so long. I often find myself trying to walk around at a slow pace and just taking in every piece of scenery like Im there. So much detail, so many Easter eggs. Its perfect.",
            "Anyone know how level 2 limit breaks work? Most of them say they increase stagger but do they also do less damage? Like if the enemy is already staggered is it better to do a level 1 limit break?"

[No Spoilers]\n\nPlease remember that spoilers are permitted for each chapter *up to that chapter only*. Spoilers that come later in the game *should not* be referred to in earlier chapter threads. \n\nWe have created a list with an arbitrary number of chapters as some consider the number of chapters to be a spoiler. Do not post that we have created more chapters than there are actually, do not post the number of chapters in any of these discussion threads except the End Game Discussion thread.\n\nA breach of any spoiler warnings or rules in place will result in a ban until after the launch window of the game. Any posting of leaked content which could breach copyright laws will result in a ban.\n\nWe hope that you all have fun playing Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and let's all make the effort to make this a safe space for the community to participate while they play the game, however far they've made it through.",

FFVII is my favourite game and I enjoy the remakes but holy shit the fans are terrible to the devs and how they react to the games. I haven\u2019t seen this type of behaviour from other fandoms they celebrate their games unless they turn out absolutely terrible. Maybe I will give them benefit of doubt and assume this a small vocal minority.",

            "That type of behavior is present in any kind of fandom. If you havent seen it anywhere else, all I can really say is Im jealous lol.",

            "I'm OOTL, can I get the spark notes?",

            "I think there's definitely some real bad apples who like to levy criticism, but I think there's more than enough people who are guilty of toxic positivity. Both come up in a lot of fandoms, one side thinks that everything is shit and need to hate on it, the other thinks 'we got content I'm happy' and refuses to ask questions. And it's unfortunate.",
            "It's definitely a small vocal minority. I wouldn't stress about it. There's way more people who enjoyed the game then not. That's just a symptom of reddit unfortunately, and it's not limited to just this gaming subreddit.\n\nOne of my favorite games of all time by the way. Not sure anything will come close to that shot of nostalgia I got from my first play through. It was like playing Elden Ring for the first time and then some.",
            "Yeah definitely a small minority who are more vocal, some are very toxic as well. I wish we can stand together as a fandom instead of tearing each other down. Why are we fighting over the game for, what do you gain from it other than increasing more hate?? We  need to learn to respect each other opinion and be kinder to each other especially to the devs. \n\nI love this series so much and I want it to succeed. Toxicity can draw new players away too. Let's learn to be more kinder to each other, isn't that what the game is trying to teach us too?",
            "Cause they live in their own ff7 fantasy and reject anything that doesn't line with that. Just look at the shippers for example.",
            "Fanbases in general tend to be like this, but I do agree. People butthurtly downvoting any opinions they don't agree, to the point asking harmless questions yields one for bo reason.\n\nAnd with VII Remake, certain fans are alreasy uppity about anything about the remake project.",
            "Hm I have yet to play rebirth but regardless of how the devs created this game let's just be thankful we got a game to play. I mean FFXV was a great game that went bad a game that has lots of would beens and lots of flaws but I still enjoyed it.\n\nI'm sure the ff7 remakes are far better since they(Square Enix) planned created and launch a complete game."
