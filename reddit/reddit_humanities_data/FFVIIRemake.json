I feel like it's no secret that the mixing can be pretty poor at times; in my case, it feels like the voices are way too low (or the music is way too high), but when it's just the music standalone with no voices, I wish it could be a tad higher. Feels like there's no good middleground.\n\nIf anyone's found a good balance that works I'd love to give it a try.",

Did it by accident and almost cried at how much time I'd wasted traveling to each zone.\n\nLess important PSA: \"Maycomb Blume\" or however it's spelled is a pun, \"make 'em bloom.\" Maybe I'm just an idiot for not understanding why Aerith got up but when I realized it was a funny pseudonym the dad in me audibly chuckled.",

[Discussion Thread Suggestions](https://old.reddit.com/r/FFVIIRemake/comments/1ax28m0/discussion_thread_suggestions/?) [No Spoilers]\n\nPlease remember that spoilers are permitted for each chapter *up to that chapter only*. Spoilers that come later in the game *should not* be referred to in earlier chapter threads. \n\nWe have created a list with an arbitrary number of chapters as some consider the number of chapters to be a spoiler. Do not post that we have created more chapters than there are actually, do not post the number of chapters in any of these discussion threads except the End Game Discussion thread.\n\nA breach of any spoiler warnings or rules in place will result in a ban until after the launch window of the game. Any posting of leaked content which could breach copyright laws will result in a ban.\n\nWe hope that you all have fun playing Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and let's all make the effort to make this a safe space for the community to participate while they play the game, however far they've made it through.",
