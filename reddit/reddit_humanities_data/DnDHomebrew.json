            "Cool concept but my issue with it is if it's in the game, anyone can use it. Meaning if the players can learn it and use it on enemies, the enemies can use it on players. I feel like it could be very cool and have amazing, significant moments for PCs. But would feel very disheartening for players without magical weapons.",
            "I actually love this spell. My only question is if you cast it again on a weapon that has been suppressed, it can then be disintegrated, correct?",
            "Normally Id agree, but the earliest youd expect to run into this is at 5th level, and it would be an expensive, one-off cast at that level. Like any spell, it could be abused, but it could also set up a wizard as a very crafty asshole/villain. It feels just the right level of mean to be a challenge yet not a particularly gamebreaking setback. \n\nTo OP: Id recommend adding scaling. Allow an additional target for each spell level above 3rd. Thatll give it some kick as it scales and has to compete with direct damage, as well as larger magic-suppression spells like Antimagic Field.",
            " Yep, but thats true of any spell. Im not trying to protect players from challenges. The fun is in overcoming them.",
            "Its kinda funny how much it scares people. Im also really attached to my characters weapons so I get it, but for comparison the 3rd level fireball spell does 4d6 to 8d6 fire damage. Causing someone to drop their weapon seems pretty tame for a 3rd level spell slot.",
            "Well I didn't write it that way, but it sounds like a potential progression you could add.",
            "Bro is asking to remove a PCs arms",
            "That was my exact thought.  Tame for a third level spell.  This to me would be a second level spell.",
            "Depending on what direction you wanted to go, you could add a line that says a magical weapon targeted with this spell cannot be targeted again for the duration. Or something like that. Being able to completely destroy a +3 weapon with two 3rd level spells feels bad to me. \n\nYou could also potentially add a scaled difficulty depending on the rarity of the weapon. I.e if cast again on a magical weapon thats suppressed, you must beat a DC 15 Arcana check for an Uncommon weapon, DC 17 for a Rare, DC 19 for a Very Rare in order to destroy it.",
            "Thatll teach the martials for being martials.\n\nAlso it seems kinda a bit of a free they will drop their weapon no matter what kinda spell?\n\nNeat idea, but god I would put this at a waaaaaaaay higher level or say nah"

            "Hello there! More content from[**the Deck of Many Fates!**](http://www.patreon.com/codexofstrings)\n\nThis is our Justice inspired ranger, cuz we really thought a justice ranger was lacking from D&D as a whole. Yeah, you got your typical revenge quests, but are you truly being fair? The Justiciar will decide! They got a bunch of pretty cool abilities, and their capstone feature is kinda crazy, but we feel like it's very playable. What do you think?\n\nThis is a subclass from our Deck of Many Fates entry. It's basically a tarot deck, with each Major Arcana card as a subclass.[**Come check it out!**](http://www.codexofstrings.com/)\n\nThat's all for me now. Cheers, and Happy Threadseeking!"

            "Interesting idea, but you still have to think about what its like at level 1 and 3.\n\nAt level 1, an extra 1st level spell a day is very good, and while arms of hadar isnt necessarily the greatest spell, its actually a great one for a squishy level 1 caster to be able to use in a pinch.\n\nAt level 3, similarly, crown of madness is a pretty good spell.\n\nPoint is, you have to think about both the overall balance of cross-level features, and the balance at individual levels."
