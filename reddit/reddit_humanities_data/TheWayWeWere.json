Head is way too in focus, hands are way too in focus. What the fuck kind of lens was used when they took this? Was it lopsided on one end? I don't understand. There's some tilt-shift going on that I've *never* seen before. Was it partially a drawing?",

John Wesley Keys, to the far left at the front, is reported as serving in ww1, but I could not find any records of the specific unit. He is also the relative who I am descended from",

            "Not by this point no. A few decades earlier, in the 1840s and 50s, where photography was a relatively new technology, it was reserved for the wealthy. But, starting in the 60s, they started becoming more widely available and by the 90s, while nowhere near as ubiquitous as today, it wouldn't break the bank either. It was actually around this time you first started seeing smiles in photographs",
