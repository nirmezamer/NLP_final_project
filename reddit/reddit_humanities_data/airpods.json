        "content": "TL;DR Got some new headphones\n\n2 years ago, the Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds were ruling the game in the wireless arena. Top in all polls and reviews. That\u2019s why I purchased them at the time. After only 2 years they started dropping connection, the fit is a bit whack and the comfort leaves a little to be desired so I started to see what the best on the market was again.\nThe transparency mode and speak to mute options are.. not as smooth as I\u2019d hoped so was happy to look to another brand.\n\nOnce more the new sony WF-1000xm5 earbuds have come out on top again in terms of sound quality and performance. However, based on my previous experience with Sony, they aren\u2019t a product that I will entertain for a few years now.\n\nI will admit I\u2019m an Apple fanboy with all my products, except headphones being Apple so wanted to look on the AirPod Pro 2\u2019s as they had always come second to Sony. You know what? Apple products just \u2018always work\u2019. They literally never, don\u2019t work! Im really excited for these to arrive Monday to get testing all the cool functions that they have to see how they compare but I suspect, they will just be damn good!",

            "Went WF3 to AirPods Pro to AirPods Pro 2. AirPods are smoother integrated experience for sure. They\u2019re good for everyday. However, I cannot travel without my WHXM2s. I\u2019m an ANC snob. Sony\u2019s is just superior. Finally got to try AirPods Max in store, and what a letdown. Not even close to Sony\u2019s ANC or Bose.",
            "Tested both i think apple pro 2 are slightly better!",
            "Interesting! Good to hear it from someone who has made the switch. Maybe I\u2019ll keep both then and just use the Sony for when ANC is essential.",
            "Yeah; WH XM5 is what I reach for whenever I need silence. AirPods Pro 2 are in my pocket wherever I go though.",
            "That\u2019s great to hear! I\u2019m most excited about the transparency feature for when I walk the dogs and the talk to mute/volume lowering when I\u2019m out and about."

        "content": "Since 2020, I\u2019ve been using the AirPods Pro Generation 1. At the time, they were the most insane, feature-rich wireless headphones I had ever had. The quality was insane, and the sound was good. Of course, I had the faulty model that later developed issues with Transparency and Noise Cancellation, but I was still able to use them normally mostly without issue. And now, I\u2019ve upgraded to the Air Pod Pro Gen 2s. They take everything i loved about the originals and ramp it up to 11. Even now, I am writing this at work while using the noise cancellation. I work in a mill, and it\u2019s always loud, but I can barely hear anything with these on. Good job, Apple, seriously. These headphones are impressive and the gain in base was very noticeable. ",
