        "content": "TL;DR Got some new headphones\n\n2 years ago, the Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds were ruling the game in the wireless arena. Top in all polls and reviews. That\u2019s why I purchased them at the time. After only 2 years they started dropping connection, the fit is a bit whack and the comfort leaves a little to be desired so I started to see what the best on the market was again.\nThe transparency mode and speak to mute options are.. not as smooth as I\u2019d hoped so was happy to look to another brand.\n\nOnce more the new sony WF-1000xm5 earbuds have come out on top again in terms of sound quality and performance. However, based on my previous experience with Sony, they aren\u2019t a product that I will entertain for a few years now.\n\nI will admit I\u2019m an Apple fanboy with all my products, except headphones being Apple so wanted to look on the AirPod Pro 2\u2019s as they had always come second to Sony. You know what? Apple products just \u2018always work\u2019. They literally never, don\u2019t work! Im really excited for these to arrive Monday to get testing all the cool functions that they have to see how they compare but I suspect, they will just be damn good!",

            "Went WF3 to AirPods Pro to AirPods Pro 2. AirPods are smoother integrated experience for sure. They\u2019re good for everyday. However, I cannot travel without my WHXM2s. I\u2019m an ANC snob. Sony\u2019s is just superior. Finally got to try AirPods Max in store, and what a letdown. Not even close to Sony\u2019s ANC or Bose.",
            "Tested both i think apple pro 2 are slightly better!",
            "Sony were never on top of airpods lol.\nDifference between airpods pro 1 and 2 is not THAT big.",
            "Unfortunately, I could never get a solid fit with the XM4s. I hear that they\u2019re amazing but I can\u2019t even give them a fair shot. Luckily the APP2 fit well enough so they sound better and have better ANC for my ears.",
            "Interesting! Good to hear it from someone who has made the switch. Maybe I\u2019ll keep both then and just use the Sony for when ANC is essential.",
            "Yeah; WH XM5 is what I reach for whenever I need silence. AirPods Pro 2 are in my pocket wherever I go though.",
            "That\u2019s great to hear! I\u2019m most excited about the transparency feature for when I walk the dogs and the talk to mute/volume lowering when I\u2019m out and about.",
            "I\u2019m only basing the comments on all the reviews on tech and audiophile sites that I researched before making my purchase:)",
            "I couldn\u2019t get a solid fit with either of them. \n\nI have the XM4\u2019s and APP2 and I literally cannot keep my right earbud in my ear. Small, medium, large; they all fall out after a little while of usage, and even then, I have some extra small spin fits I managed to fit onto my AirPods and that also either falls out or messes around with the ANC.",
            "Adaptive is also a cool functioning transitioning between anc and transparency based off of your environment"

        "content": "Since 2020, I\u2019ve been using the AirPods Pro Generation 1. At the time, they were the most insane, feature-rich wireless headphones I had ever had. The quality was insane, and the sound was good. Of course, I had the faulty model that later developed issues with Transparency and Noise Cancellation, but I was still able to use them normally mostly without issue. And now, I\u2019ve upgraded to the Air Pod Pro Gen 2s. They take everything i loved about the originals and ramp it up to 11. Even now, I am writing this at work while using the noise cancellation. I work in a mill, and it\u2019s always loud, but I can barely hear anything with these on. Good job, Apple, seriously. These headphones are impressive and the gain in base was very noticeable. ",

            "I have owned an airpods before it was a 2nd gen airpods, when I upgraded to airpods pro 2, I noticed a difference in the sound quality. It is better.",
            "ayy welcome APP2 gang \ud83e\udd18",
            "I have AirPod pro gen1 and the noise cancellation and transparency no longer works like it used to. Also one of the mics doesn\u2019t work properly. I\u2019m disappointed at the quality of them, I\u2019ve used them as intended and over time they\u2019ve slowly degraded so I\u2019m reluctant to spend money on new ones.",
            "I would say that most likely, depending on what you listen to, the overall sound improvement isn\u2019t gonna be super crazy,  they do sound quite a bit clearer than EarPods, but I bet the difference would be diminished compared to 3s. Tho the bass on them is superb, I had no idea such low frequencies could be hit on earbuds, some songs transform dramatically D: \nAnd I had no idea how much needed anc was in my life \ud83d\ude05 now I can comfortably listen to songs playing 10db quieter while having a walk (65 vs 75), a good thing for ears :D",
            "This is really helpful.  I have difficulty hearing low sounds, which is one reason I love the gen 3 pods so much\u2014the bass isn\u2019t very prominent. So, this tells me that the pros may not be the best product for me.  I know what you mean, though about bass hitting just right.  I think the HomePods capture low frequencies well, and the sound is phenomenal.  \n\nBut the ANC sounds like something I would love\u2026.maybe it\u2019s best to try them out.  I\u2019m so torn!",
            "I see, I tried reduced bass eq preset on Apple Music, it does make lower frequencies noticeably less prominent, but still Pro\u2019s sound harsher than earpods (I heard tho that 3s pack much better bass capabilities, tho not close to Pro 2), just cause the latter can\u2019t physically go in the range that pros do :( if you listen to music on Spotify tho, you\u2019re likely to have better luck having a real equalizer there. I want to say tho, that here not that many songs that I listen to make use of such low frequencies much enough to make dramatic difference, and overall pros are tuned in fairly neutral way, they don\u2019t boost bass, it\u2019s just that they allow it to be \ud83d\ude05 But yee, would be great if you get a chance to try them for yourself C:"
