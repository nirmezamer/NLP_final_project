        "content": "Up until now we have been pretty lenient in regards to Rule 2, which states that post must describe *why*  the YSK is useful. We have approved posts that didn\u2019t state why the  knowledge is useful under the guise that its usefulness was implied.  However, due to an increasing number of these types of posts, we feel it  needs to be addressed. Therefore, starting now we will be enforcing  Rule 2 more heavily. All posts must include (in the text body) an  explicit statement of why the post is useful. Even if you think the  reasoning is obvious, you still must explicitly state it. This should be  done by having a simple \u201c**Why YSK:**\u201d in the text body. (Just for those who might not know, the text body is the area where you can put additional text after the title text when creating a post.) *Please note that it should go in the text body -- not the title or the comments.*\n\nRemember that this sub is focused on self-improvement on how to do things, improve on activities, skills, and other tasks.\n\n*BASICALLY:*\n\n* All posts must include a \"**Why YSK:**\" (typed just like that) section in the text body.\n\n\\[\\[Additionally, we want to take this time to remind everyone that [r/YouShouldKnow](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/)  is not a place to share personal stories or anecdotes. If you feel your  post needs to include one, a brief anecdote is fine. The entire (nor the majority of the) post should not be about your own personal experience, however. We will be removing posts that are just personal anecdotes.\\]\\]\n\n**Why YSK:** We (the YouShouldKnow moderators) hope it will improve readers' abilities to better understand the purpose of the sub, mentioned above and in the expanded Rule 1. For thread creators, it will help in their ability to explain how the reader can improve upon a certain skill, task, or ability. It will also help the creator improve upon the skill of not having their post deleted due to not including \"**Why YSK**\" in the text body of their post.\n\n*NOTES:*\n\n* Bolding the words **Why YSK:** will make it a lot easier for people to find it.\n* Again, please put **Why YSK** in bold letters. It's easier to find in a sea of text.\n* **Why YSK** must be followed by an actual explanation as to how it helps someone improve upon a skill, task, or activity. Following it with a massive personal anecdote is not the point -- neither is following it with \"I think this is important\" or something similar.",

When adopting the Latin alphabet, the letter \"Y\" most closely resembled \"\u00fe,\" and so was used in its place. \n\nSo now, when you go to the Renaissance Faire, you can stop mispronouncing the word \"Ye\" and sounding like a clodpoll.\n\nEdit: I realize this sounds like I'm just being overly pedantic, and some have said it's not really \"wrong\" pronunciation, since language evolves, and since mostly everyone says it that way now, it should be considered correct. However, as u/MisterToothpaster pointed out, \"there's a difference when the word is used in an intentional attempt to sound old-fashioned.\" I agree with this statement. We're not using it as a modern word. We're trying to emulate Old English (as much as we can) when we say it.",

        "content": "Why YSK: aquatic sports equipment and gear like wetsuits, surfboards and others, kayaks, paddles, life vests, and anything else that may come into contact with bodies of water (especially saltwater) should be thoroughly cleaned and dried after each use to avoid mold, rot, infestations, unpleasant odors, and saline corrosion overtime. \n\nProper cleaning of water sports equipment will ensure your gear stays in operable condition for much longer. Here are some upkeep tips for water equipment post-use:\n\nWaterwear: go back and forth agitating gear in fresh and soapy water until fresh water appears too cloudy to continue. Continue cycle with fresh soapy & clean water until it remains colorless after significant agitation. Hang wetsuits up to dry out of the sun. This will mean it dries slower, but proponged UV exposure over time may cause damage to the material. If you want it to dry quicker and don\u2019t mind this side effect, hang it in the sun. This goes for most waterwear.\n\nBoards: all surf, skim, wake, and windsurfing boards should be first rinsed off with fresh water. Lightly scrub the surface with a washcloth if there is excess gunk or seaweed. Make sure all sand and grime is off your equipment before storage. Hard top surfboards require wax on the top to provide grip, not soft tops. The board should be scraped off and rewaxed at the worst every year (in my experience) or once the wax gets damaged, naturally is scraped off, or loses its grip.\n\nKayaks & paddles: same thing as board cleaning, minus the scrubbing. After the rinse, open the kayak\u2019s drain plug and tip it to drain the water. Remove any debris from inside the kayak, as leaves will often collect around the plug and make it harder to drain. Leave them to dry naturally in a cool space out of the sun. Avoid that UV! It can lead to the material getting sun bleached.",

They'll never get sweeter after they're picked, thus why ones left growing have more chances of becoming sweet.

Color is unimportant, size is.  A larger ground spot indicates ripeness.\n7.\tMalformed watermelons are often poorly pollinated and may have areas that are unripe.  Normal shapes include round and oblong.  Size of a ripe watermelon is determined by genetics and can range from 1 pound up to a bit over 200 pounds.\n8.\tSome varieties of watermelon have been selected for very thick rind.
