        "content": "Up until now we have been pretty lenient in regards to Rule 2, which states that post must describe *why*  the YSK is useful. We have approved posts that didn\u2019t state why the  knowledge is useful under the guise that its usefulness was implied.  However, due to an increasing number of these types of posts, we feel it  needs to be addressed. Therefore, starting now we will be enforcing  Rule 2 more heavily. All posts must include (in the text body) an  explicit statement of why the post is useful. Even if you think the  reasoning is obvious, you still must explicitly state it. This should be  done by having a simple \u201c**Why YSK:**\u201d in the text body. (Just for those who might not know, the text body is the area where you can put additional text after the title text when creating a post.) *Please note that it should go in the text body -- not the title or the comments.*\n\nRemember that this sub is focused on self-improvement on how to do things, improve on activities, skills, and other tasks.\n\n*BASICALLY:*\n\n* All posts must include a \"**Why YSK:**\" (typed just like that) section in the text body.\n\n\\[\\[Additionally, we want to take this time to remind everyone that [r/YouShouldKnow](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/)  is not a place to share personal stories or anecdotes. If you feel your  post needs to include one, a brief anecdote is fine. The entire (nor the majority of the) post should not be about your own personal experience, however. We will be removing posts that are just personal anecdotes.\\]\\]\n\n**Why YSK:** We (the YouShouldKnow moderators) hope it will improve readers' abilities to better understand the purpose of the sub, mentioned above and in the expanded Rule 1. For thread creators, it will help in their ability to explain how the reader can improve upon a certain skill, task, or ability. It will also help the creator improve upon the skill of not having their post deleted due to not including \"**Why YSK**\" in the text body of their post.\n\n*NOTES:*\n\n* Bolding the words **Why YSK:** will make it a lot easier for people to find it.\n* Again, please put **Why YSK** in bold letters. It's easier to find in a sea of text.\n* **Why YSK** must be followed by an actual explanation as to how it helps someone improve upon a skill, task, or activity. Following it with a massive personal anecdote is not the point -- neither is following it with \"I think this is important\" or something similar.",

        "score": 510,
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/1dql8us/ysk_transmission_fluid_needs_replaced/",
        "content": "Why YSK: All cars have a transmission (or gearbox). These are machines that cannot operate without some sort of lubricating fluid. That fluid has to have certain properties to do its job. Over time, it will degrade because it's exposed to heat, oxygen and wear particles from the moving parts.\n\nIt is very common for people to drive a car for years, and never have it serviced. Eventually, they are surprised by a transmission that won't shift or fails completely. This is because the oil has degraded and can no longer lubricate properly, also because it's full of metal particles that abrade other surfaces. It causes permanent damage that cannot be fixed by replacing the oil once it's happened.\n\nThis is much worse in automatic transmissions, because they're more complicated and rely on valve spools to shift. The poor lubrication and debris causes the valves to wear, meaning they can get stuck and not function properly.\n\nIf you want to avoid these problems, your transmission fluid needs to be replaced at least as often as the manufacturer recommends. If you don't, you will need to replace or rebuild it, which is extremely expensive. This applies to any mechanical device that's lubricated with a fluid (including your engine).\n\nSome manufacturers have 'lifetime' transmission fluid, meaning it doesn't need replaced. All that means is that the manufacturer has managed to design a system that will work long enough for the owner to not complain about an early failure when problems occur. They're betting on most people switching cars every few years. They don't want a car lasting twenty years, it means they sell fewer cars. They want a car that lasts long enough to avoid being called a lemon.\n\nThere is no such thing as a lubricant that won't degrade over time, it's not possible, regardless of what the manufacturer claims. Even 'lifetime' fluid should be replaced every few years if you're smart.",

            "I asked the Audi dealership to change the transmission fluid in my Audi last time it was in (170000km),and they wouldn't. They said the gearbox is sealed for life.",
            "So if my car is at 200,000 km and has probably never had this done, what would be the best way to correct this mistake?",
            "It should be noted fully electric cars usually don't have a transmission",
            "You know this is a topic of debate in the car world and needs to be specified. I have seen some mechanics recommend every 40k miles, some recommend to follow the vehicle maintenance schedule, some recommend flushing, some dont recommend flushing. I have literally talked to a transmission shop that says to never get your transmission flushed and just to drain and replace the oil, yet some manufacturers will only to flushing. \n\nLots of mixed info on this from reputable sources.",
            "Heard the exact opposite from some old school car dude who basically said if its old and hasnt been changed dont touch it. Also watched a chevy astro breeze past 200K without ever touching transmission fluid",

When I told them the owners manual says to change the fluid every 60,000 when driven in severe conditions (I live in Maine, so yeah our conditions are severe 7 months a year) they said the owners manual is \"generic\" and that doesn't apply to my specific car.  Does that make any sense?",
            "This is extremely overlooked by many people I think. Its also very important to research how it needs to be done. For example with my 13 accord V6 I did 3X drain/fill every 60k miles and at 209k and 9 years later it showed no signs of wear whatsoever",
            "For people that have a manual transmission, its always recommended to change the fluid every 20-30k miles. Its actually not hard at all in some cases, literally like an oil change. Drain and fill (Usually there is 2 ports, an upper and lower)",
