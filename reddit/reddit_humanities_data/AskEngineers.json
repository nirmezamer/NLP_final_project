            "A lot of large device companies have had layoffs recently but Ive also heard rumors that startups are looking to poach the job seeking talent out of the market. The greater economy has been robust dispute uncertain times but no one knows how it will change next. Engineers whove been through turbulent job markets before  whatre your insights and what do you suspect will happen next for the medical device  and biotech engineering job market?",
            "Hey folks. I applied for a job a few weeks back and last week was contacted asking if I was still interested. Rather than an HR person, I was contacted by the technical engineering lead for the position I applied for. I replied expressing that I was still interested and would like to meet to further discuss. It's been a week and I haven't heard back. Is it kosher to circle back and follow-up? If it were an HR person, I'd have no issue; I'm just a little uncomfortable with it being someone on the technical side. (Federal job if it matters). Thanks!",

            "Government agencies are VERY slow moving. You can send a follow up email, but may not a response and will just have to be patient.\n\nWhen I was looking for a career change years ago, I applied to a Federal agency in late July and a tech company in early August. I accepted the offer from the tech company at the end of August with a start date of October 1. The Federal agency brought me in for an interview in November, after I've been working for a month at the tech company.",

            "Thanks for the reply. I posted this over at AskHR as well and got a much better picture of why it can be much more challenging than I anticipated. I had to really go through all the details before I could be convinced that the only real benefit to an employer is that it's a perk for employees to keep them around. It's beginning to look like a pipe dream to implement it for the whole department, but for myself individually I'm considering suggesting it at my next performance review in exchange for a reduced or maybe even no raise."

            "Im very curious to see how the repeal affects the ongoing fight over PFAS, PFOS, and similar forever chemicals. \n  \nI originally came from a federal agency and went into private three years into my career. I had a personal experience with a regulation that was passed over the heads of my working group, who had significant concerns over its contents due to lack of data and missing key technical information. At the time, it was very frustrating watching the agency push ahead without paying any mind to the technical advice of my team, which is what I believed the whole purpose of the Chevron Deference to be. I have no clue if my experience was a one-off."

Not every 1\"x1\" stick of pine will break at this point, but some will.\n\nThis number varies WILDLY with the actual design values of the wood. I plugged in the numbers for #1/#2 SPF, which is the most generic cheap crap you'll find at a big box store. For Select grade southern yellow pine, that number *more than triples*."
