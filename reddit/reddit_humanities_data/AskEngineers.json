            "Design/mechanical engineering hiring managers-- what can applicants coming from manufacturing environments bring to the table for your positions?",
            "Hello, \n\nI have a question about office politics and lunch. So I work two jobs, one is my 9-5 at a engineering consulting firm. The second is after work, 5 - 10ish and I do studio musician work and song writing along with making my own music. I always skip lunch so I can leave after 4 instead of 5. This week onward I have physical therapy on Fridays so I have been working 9 hour shifts one Wed and Thru so I can leave 2 hours earlier on Friday instead of using sick time or vacation. \n\nThe problem is that today, Thursday, I was asked if you want to go to lunch with us because everyone is going? I have made it semi clear to some that I have 2x jobs but don't want to announce it for some reason. Maybe that would be helpful? I digress. I had to decline and there was this moment of silence as 6 of the people who were going just kinda was like \"huh\"? Thankfully the guy who knows I am grinding like crazy said \"Silent Egg\" is a busy dude, don't give him flack. I wanted to explain right then, but I figured I'd just let it be. I don't need to explain this to everyone:  \n  \n \"Hey I cant make it to lunch because today I have to work an extra hour, and I worked an extra hour yesterday, so I can get my two extra hours worked so I can go to physical therapy Friday at 2 without taking PTO and also have the time to get off work at 5 today so I can quickly (yet 30 mins late) get to the studio for my session today at 5 as I work two jobs/a side hustle after work....\"  \n  \nYea... I have my reasons, but I feel bad none the less and feel like I am somehow not being a team player and doing something wrong against engineering office politics?! Ugh.... Any input would be GREATLY appreciated! I am new to this and just a handful of months out of school and I am needing to figure these things out but I also need the time to work my other job as I desperately need more money as I have massive student debts to pay. Sucks....",
            "How does a department-wide hybrid schedule benefit employers? How does it work at your company? Asking because my coworkers and I are building a proposal to do just that. I'm trying to see the issue from my employers' perspective and have solutions ready to any of the issues they might point out.\n\nI work at a smaller company with about a dozen engineers working in my office (1 of 2 across the country). It's a project based custom fabrication company where each engineer tends to take ownership of a given project and see it through from start to finish. Projects are built in house so we're expected to be on site and available during normal hours to deal with any fabrication issues that might come up. Every engineer has the same title other than the two managers, who answer to the general manager of the office.\n\nWhat my coworkers and I want to propose as an alternative is to have about half the engineers on site at any given time to deal with fabrication issues while the other half work remote, with a weekly or bi-weekly rotating schedule so everyone gets even remote time. Remote engineers would still be expected to be on call during normal hours in case of any real emergencies that only they could deal with, but the goal would be to make sure all engineers are capable of handling most issues regardless of who the lead is on the project, or screenshare/facetime with the lead if they can't. I think for our workflow this would be easier to keep track of than trying to set everyone up on different days of the week, and would smooth out any problems with people being out sick or on vacation. I have a friend whose team seams to like working this way at his company. What do you think?\n\nI'm also considering rolling it into a larger proposal to split roles into junior and senior level engineers. Juniors would have more on-site time and be responsible for easier projects and grunt work such as making files for our CNC machines or laying out 2D drawings for a 3D design that a senior came up with. Seniors would be focused more on 3D design, structural calculations, electrical schematics, etc than drafting, as well as reviewing juniors' work and taking some of the brunt of similar management duties. Managers of course would manage time and personnel and focus a little less on design work.\n\nThe timing is ideal because the company is shopping around for a new building, and this schedule would mean they could pay for less office space. The new location also makes for a great excuse for the employees who may not want to commute to a newer location further from home.",

All within the same company (automotive), same product, same features. I am basically doing the same thing I did as an onsite engineer but via simulation. Now I am looking for a career change because I do not like the direction of the company and my current group. I feel stuck though. I have no experience outside of testing, and while I actually enjoy my current role, I am a bit burnt out because long hours that inevitably come with it (I believe due to the nature of testing, no matter which company, because Testing is 'last in line' to do their work, the long hours would be inevitable). However I feel like i am not qualified to do other aspects of Engineering such as design,. controls etc, or anything software related. I just feel like im stuck with testing unless I want to apply for entry level positions which I dont want to do. FWIW i have a BS in Electrical Engineering, in the US.\n\nHas anyone been in the same position as me? What did you do? Should i apply for positions I am not qualified for?

        "content": "I'm wanting to build a \"U-frame\" lift out of tubular steel (think a squared off A-frame). The load is about 600 lbs and it will attach to the center of the horizontal member. I'll be pulling from above the frame at that same point so the over all load would be compression in the vertical members and bending in the horizontal member. The frame isn't doing the lifting, it's guiding the load along a circular path from the ground to the inside of a trailer. I can find formulas to calculate when a tube will fail in compression and I've been able to find ways to calculate bending loads of a tube when supported on the ends and point loaded in the middle. My question is, how would bends in the corners affect those calculations?\n\nSay I have the supports 6' apart and the arm is 6' tall. I can square the structure off and figure out loads on the vertical and horizontal members. However, if I put a large radius bend (guessing here but let's call it a 5 diameter radius so a 10\" radius for a 2\" tube) in the corners, how does that affect those calculations? Does it affectively shorten the horizontal cross member to just 52\" wide? Would an approximation of 50% of the bend being vertical and horizontal work making the cross member 62\" long for the purposes of the bending load? Does the bend make the structure stronger or weaker? My gut tells me a large bend in the corners would make the structure stronger but I want some math to back up my gut.\n\nI've been digging around for a couple of weeks and I can't find an answer. I'm not finding anything in my old statics and dynamics text book and I'm coming up short on my google-fu. This seems like something an actual engineer would be able to figure out during a lunch break but I have no idea how to find a mech eng consultant willing to work such a small project.\n\nAm I over thinking this?",

From 9 minutes on he discusses how the electric motor generator lets the engine operate at the stoichiometrically optimal fuel-to-air ratio (Lambda=1) and how this makes the three-way catalytic converters work more optimally in gasoline-powered cars. This made me think of the Volkswagen scandal and if this would've helped them avoid ever needing a test defeat mode in the first place for their emissions systems. Then I started reading about diesel engine emissions treatment and got lost in the sauce.  Would a combined turbo-compressor and electric motor-generator also allow a diesel engine to operate at lambda equals one for all operating conditions? Would operating only at lambda equals have solved Volkswagan's emissions problems?",

            "Diesels dont operate near lambda = 1 (stoichiometric). They run lean all the time (except racing apps). Typical full power lambda is 1.6 to 1.9 for heavy duty engines. Maybe as low as 1.24 for light duty vehicle like pickup trucks. Typical idle lambda is 7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nSince diesels (and gas turbines) run lean, the 3 way catalyst is not effective to reduce NOx in the exhaust stream. In addition, the diesel fuel & combustion process creates more PM than volatile gasoline. Therefore the diesel emission control uses a Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (HC & CO), Diesel Particulate Filter (PM), and Selective Catalytic Reduction (NOx) [alternatively Lean NOx trap for light duty engines].\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWould making the VW engine a diesel over eletric drivetrain make it easier to meet emissions? Yes, it would have. But the tech to meet emissions was already existing, they just didnt want spend the money and/or take the fuel economy penalty to pass. This wasnt a tech existance problem, it was an active choice not to follow rules.",

Without getting too far into the weeds, yes, they solved VWs emission issues and the one I worked on was specifically for a diesel passenger engine.  \n\nThe benefit of the e-turbo on diesels specifically was to drive very high intake manifold pressures (higher intake air temperatures, more air mass flow for emissions dilution) at low RPM or part load operating points where there was insufficient exhaust energy to drive the turbo normally to those operating compressor points.  It was\u2026.. very impressive for its time.   \n\nThe engine could be driven to very high EGR rates with a variable vane turbine inlet AND high intake air mass flow rates.  It was just the best of both worlds.  \n\nBut it was expensive.  And the 48V it required at the time was a non-starter.   No OEM wanted to switch to a 48V vehicle architecture.",

They then illegally chose to have higher fuel efficiency and to only operate in a manner to meet NOx standards when the vehicle was being tested.

            "As a previous owner of one of these VWs, that's not really the issue.\n\nMeeting the emissions is the law, if you crank the efficency up then you crank the NOx up. If you crank the efficency down then you crank the PM2.5 up (soot). The PM2.5 rules are strict enough that you always need a DPF.\n\nI think early in development they basically figured they could use the EGR to control efficency, and ride it right near the limit. This would avoid the cost of an SCR system. Probably late in development they realized that's not going to work, if you crank efficency down enough to meet the laws the DPF is not going to last the warranty, and performance is going to be kinda crappy. So they lied and cheated. But they knew the legal solution was just add an SCR system.\n\nFor the most part, the recalls resulted in just that, add an SCR, and pay for a couple DPF replacements because they were basically guaranteed to fail now.\n\nAs for your idea to use an electric motor to improve it, that would probably work, but a CVT is probably cheaper and does basically the same thing, if you going to go the electric motor you really need to build a hybrid diesel and that had its own problems (they were so efficient they failed to heat the engine block and catalytic converter up). But at the end of the day, they were not struggling with how to make it meet the emissions, they knew, an SCR would solve all their problems. They were trying to cut costs and skip it, and they couldn't make it work without the SCR and just resorted to fraud and lies instead."
