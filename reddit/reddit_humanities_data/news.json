We saw policemen running around the pharmacy, which is right next door to the Mad Butcher.\"\n\nHe added, \"It was pretty hectic around here between 11:30 and noon\" and that he saw a medevac land at the local hospital's helipad.\u00a0\n\nArkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee-Sanders said on social media that she had been \"briefed on the tragic shooting in Fordyce, and I\u2019m in constant contact with State Police at the scene. I am thankful to law enforcement and first responders for their quick and heroic action to save lives.
