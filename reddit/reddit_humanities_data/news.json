            "The title should definitely include that she left the car running. She probably had to do this because childcare is wildly expensive.",
            "We could have inexpensive high quality child care in this country but instead we spend that money on police, the military, and prisons.",

            "Driving home from southern France back to England two days ago we stopped at services for a pee. Left the dog in the car for literally five minutes WITH the windows open and the poor thing was panting like crazy. Next time we took turns and kept the car engine running. And took the dog for a quick walk to stretch his legs.",
            "If daycare were more affordable maybe this wouldnt have happened. I do wonder why the little girl didnt get out of the car when she got too hot. Maybe she was scared of her mom punishing her. Maybe she just didnt realize the danger she was in.",
            "Sounds like she turned the a/c off then had a medical emergency rendering her unconscious then died due to hyperthermia. An 8 year old isn't going to stay in a hot car till they die unless she was developmentally delayed.",
            "We need free, accessible childcare for reasons like this. No one should have to risk their childs life in order to pay the bills.",
            "Obviously the mother is at fault, but I also blame Amazon.  If youre gonna pay your employees sub living wages at least provide them with on site child care so shit like this doesnt happen.  Amazon is one of the richest companies in the world.  Do better.",

            "TLDR: The Gun got damaged by FBI forensics. The defense claims it was crucial to exoneration. The judge disagrees but insists that the prosecution describe the damage that was done to the gun.",
            "The Court Junkie podcast did a great job covering the trial of Hannah Guitierrez-Reed, the armorer on the set of Rust. She was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and got... 18 months.",
            "They should make a movie about this.  Dishonesty and incompetence everywhere.  Even the FBI and the Judge are getting into the game.  Everyone is pointing fingers at everyone.  No one is saying anything about how live rounds got on the set.",
            "I dont know anything about this, but holy shit how is it anyones fault except for the nepo lady whos sole job is to make sure real bullets never come near the set, but broke that rule immediately and held live target practice on set",
            "This will be a fascinating case that will probably end up with new case law. As the actor, he isn't necessarily responsible because the armorer on set is responsible for ensuring that there are no live rounds on set. Baldwin is responsible as a producer for assisting with the hiring of the armorer. The question is, can they show negligence on Baldwin's part that led to the death?",
            "I still dont understand how that was his fault at all. Wouldnt it be the weapons handler or something?",
            "Please help me with this. Gun handler was shit and a person died. Alec Baldwin had no idea the gun was live? Actors use guns all the time in movies? How is he at any fault? Was the person who killed Brandon Lee charged? \n\nNo intent. An accident. The handler has been properly prosecuted and sentenced for malpractice. Alec was simply doing what hed done many times before on set. What did he do wrong?",
            "From all I have seen and read about this shit, if he truly was involved in less safety for cuts in the production of the movie he is 100% responsible for that shit",
            "Fucking hell... they're STILL going on about this?",
            "For those NEW to this mess, Baldwin claims the gun \"went off on it's own\".  It's a Single Action Cowboy Revolver.  You HAVE to cock the hammer and pull the trigger to fire it.  That is the ONLY way it fires.  People carry these with six chambers loaded because even if it falls from the holster IT WILL NOT GO OFF unless COCKED and FIRED.  It broke under testing because the FBI hit it SO HARD to see if they could get it to go off without pulling the trigger that they BROKE the hammer off of the gun completely.....and it still did not go off.  Modern Revolver styles are built differently.....you are supposed to carry with the hammer over an empty chamber because if it is dropped it MIGHT go off......these Cowboy style single actions are INCREDIBLY safe even if dropped.  TLDR : Baldwin is probably lying out his butt about it going off without him pulling the trigger."

            "I think, even with the immunity case, this is the most far-reaching consequential SCOTUS decision in decades. They've effectively gutted the ability of the federal government to allow experts in their fields who know what they're talking about set regulation and put that authority in the hands of a congress that has paralyzed itself due to an influx of members that put their individual agendas ahead of the well-being of the public at large.\n\nEdit: I just want to add that Kate Shaw was on Preet Bharara's podcast last week where she pointed out that by saying the Executive branch doesn't have the authority to regulate because that power belongs to Legislative branch, knowing full-well that congress is too divided to actually serve that function, SCOTUS has effectively made itself the most powerful body of the US government sitting above the other two branches it's supposed to be coequal with.",

I dont think the general public realizes how much MORE this will grind things to crawl.",

            ">But the current high court, with a 6-3 conservative majority, has been increasingly skeptical of the powers of federal agencies.\n\nAt this point maybe the executive should likewise be more skeptical of the powers of the judiciary. For example, where in the constitution was the supreme court given the power of judicial review?"
