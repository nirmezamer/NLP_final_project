            "With the upcoming changes in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers, is Firefox the only option to use extensions like uBlock Origin without any problems?",
            "Looking for a good Chromium-based browser with Chrome sync (other than Chrome). I use Chrome on mobile but want something else for my laptop.",
            "I would like to use a browser that is as efficient as, or nearly as efficient as, Safari in terms of power consumption. I alternated between Firefox and Brave, but still couldn't figure out which one is more efficient to use on an Apple Silicon chip. Can you guys recommend a browser to go forward with?",
            "can web browsers steal my data or sell my data? what do google know about me?",
            "Looking for a browser that can separate my personal account from my school account. What I like about chrome is that feature but chrome is taking up too much of my CPU which is annoying when you\u2019re taking a timed exam (it only started doing this recently). Now I know opera can have separate workspaces but can you separate profiles like you can in Google (like separate windows for both gmail accounts)? Sorry if someone asked this already or it isn\u2019t making sense.",
            "What's the best browser out there and why is it Baidu Spark Browser?",
            "I've been using Waterfox lately and have been enjoying the experience. I don't need many features and it feels quite minimalistic, and having installed uBlock Origin it is running great. Also, not being based on Chromium is a huge plus.",
            "I switched from Chrome to Opera/Opera GX earlier this year. I've found Opera better. But recently I've learnt about all their privacy scandals and ownership. Should any of the concern me specifically? Is my data/info under risk? I know almost all browsers sell data, but the general distaste of Opera is making me uncomfortable. Purely performance-wise and feature-wise, I do prefer Opera.",
            "Never understood why Chrome is so popular. Its absolutly horrible if you open tons of tabs at the same time and generally doesnt really offer any benefits above other browsers. Hell, other browsers actually use its technology end still somehow end up with less restrictions and handling things better then Chrome. Its not the age of internet explorer anymore, in comparision to which every other browser could shine, even Edge is actually pretty decent browser now so there is no NEED to install other browser unless you wish some extra features from there - and since its actually is based on Chromium as majority of other browsers, there arent many features that Chrome has and other dont. In last years its actually the around, similar to situation with stock android vs custom UIs that often have features years beyond what google offers.",
            "A browser that can have chrome based extensions (idk if this is the right term btw) and can handle opening up a lot of tabs.. Something kinda like Vivaldi (current browser) that has workspaces and doesnt use up all the resources?"

Edge on the other hand imo is just as good as Brave, uses a little more memory than Brave but not that big a difference tbh. If you want absolute optimisation, go Thorium.",

            "Apple: 8GB RAM iS liKe 16GB iN wInDowS",
            "What would've been a more fair comparison is to test with no extensions at all, so just \"out of the box\" experience for each browser, with default settings.",

Like replacing ads on websites with their own ads, promoting FTX exchange on the main page, their partnership with another scam crypto exchange called Gemini, or the privacy scandal when they were injecting their own affiliate codes into some crypto exchange urls users visited. \n\nDo people not know about it or not care about it?",
            "I know the default setting for certain browsers is to have an ad blocker. The reason I added the ad blocker to the others is because I figured I would give more of a fair ground to the other browsers that don't have a ad blocker by default because without the ad blocker, the numbers would be significantly higher trying to load all the ads. I felt it would skew browsers with ad blockers to have an even bigger advantage if a advantage is found compared to others without it.",
            "Sure, But it shows a feature that some browsers don't have or enabled by default. Not everyone will install an adblocker either, so their experience won't be anything like this from this report.\n\nAdding extensions or change defaults will skew the results.",
            "I will try to test without a ad blocker and will update when possible to see the results",
            "Then don't test browsers that have built-in adblock unless you want something that loads 10% of website vs the rest loading 100% of website.",
