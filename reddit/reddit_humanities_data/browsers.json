            "Looking for a good Chromium-based browser with Chrome sync (other than Chrome). I use Chrome on mobile but want something else for my laptop.",
            "I would like to use a browser that is as efficient as, or nearly as efficient as, Safari in terms of power consumption. I alternated between Firefox and Brave, but still couldn't figure out which one is more efficient to use on an Apple Silicon chip. Can you guys recommend a browser to go forward with?",
            "can web browsers steal my data or sell my data? what do google know about me?",
            "Been using FF almost forever... last 8 years. \n\nI have a decent amount of addons I use all the time. Some for security and privacy, some for convienence. I usually have 3 tabs i use constantly plus 1-2 youtube tabs. Rarely go over 8-10 tab unless researching something.\n\nFirst off, is there an addon to clear ram after xx amount of time?\n\nNext are the other FF alternatives better on ram management and resources? Looking for a faster browser with built in better security so i can off load some addons and make it a bit faster feeling over all.",
            "Looking for a browser that can separate my personal account from my school account. What I like about chrome is that feature but chrome is taking up too much of my CPU which is annoying when you\u2019re taking a timed exam (it only started doing this recently). Now I know opera can have separate workspaces but can you separate profiles like you can in Google (like separate windows for both gmail accounts)? Sorry if someone asked this already or it isn\u2019t making sense.",
            "What's the best browser out there and why is it Baidu Spark Browser?",
            "I've been using Waterfox lately and have been enjoying the experience. I don't need many features and it feels quite minimalistic, and having installed uBlock Origin it is running great. Also, not being based on Chromium is a huge plus.",
            "I switched from Chrome to Opera/Opera GX earlier this year. I've found Opera better. But recently I've learnt about all their privacy scandals and ownership. Should any of the concern me specifically? Is my data/info under risk? I know almost all browsers sell data, but the general distaste of Opera is making me uncomfortable. Purely performance-wise and feature-wise, I do prefer Opera.",
            "Never understood why Chrome is so popular. Its absolutly horrible if you open tons of tabs at the same time and generally doesnt really offer any benefits above other browsers. Hell, other browsers actually use its technology end still somehow end up with less restrictions and handling things better then Chrome. Its not the age of internet explorer anymore, in comparision to which every other browser could shine, even Edge is actually pretty decent browser now so there is no NEED to install other browser unless you wish some extra features from there - and since its actually is based on Chromium as majority of other browsers, there arent many features that Chrome has and other dont. In last years its actually the around, similar to situation with stock android vs custom UIs that often have features years beyond what google offers."

High is the max amount of ram found to be used during the testing and average is well the average amount found during testing. Testing time was 4 minutes per site.\n\nNow the numbers:\n\n|Browser|Windows High (MB)|Windows Avg (MB)|Mac High (MB)|Mac Avg (MB)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Chrome|1603|1444|2219|1966|\n|Edge|1703|1437|2328|2048|\n|Brave|1471|1288|1874|1798|\n|Firefox|2308|2143|3239|3077|\n|Vivaldi|1698|1463|2213|1906|\n|Floorp|2439|2125|3681|3414|\n|DuckDuckGo|2497|2327|3827|3513|\n|Arc|1427|1273|1876|1670|\n|Opera|1723|1545|4075|3810|\n|Safari|-|-|2480|2213|\n\n*Note: Safari is exclusive to Mac.

Google Earth. \n\nMy windows PC has a Ryzen 7 5700X, a Radeon RX 6600XT, and 16 GB of 3200 MHz RAM, and Google Earth still feels like it stutters a lot on there. \n\nOn my Macbook, an M2 Air with the base 8 GB RAM config, no stutters at all. \n\nBoth have Vivaldi, latest update. \n\nAs a bonus round an old HP Elitebook I have, i5 6300U, 16 GB 2400 MHz RAM, running OpenSuse Tumbleweed also has no issues using Google Earth in Vivalid. \n\nNot the most scientific test, but scrolling, going into streetview, etc just feel snappier on anything that isn't Windows",

The reason I added the ad blocker to the others is because I figured I would give more of a fair ground to the other browsers that don't have a ad blocker by default because without the ad blocker, the numbers would be significantly higher trying to load all the ads. I felt it would skew browsers with ad blockers to have an even bigger advantage if a advantage is found compared to others without it.",
