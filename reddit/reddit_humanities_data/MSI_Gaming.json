            "according the firmware release date, version FW.012 only released a few days ago, so is there any chance that a current copy of the monitor has this version installed already? i\u2019m looking to purchase the monitor but feel like it\u2019d be pointless to receive it just to ship it to a service center for update",
            "No, they either need a special chip or that the specific firmware update allows for further updates. So to summarize, you gotta pack it up and send it off because you can't do it at home.\n\nIt's a bit ridiculous but idk why MSI even made something this expensive not be able to be updated, still a really good monitor tho."

        "content": "Hello, I have a problem with FPS in games after starting the computer. The problem occurs regardless of the graphic settings or the game. The FPS stays within the range of 90-120 FPS, and to fix the problem, I have to turn off and on the computer several times until the FPS returns to normal. For instance, in the case of Ghost of Tsushima, the FPS goes back to 190-200 on full details. The problem started occurring after I replaced the processor with an AMD Ryzen 7800X3D, RAM with Lexar ARES RGB DDR5 32 GB 6000MHz CL30, and the motherboard with an MSI MAG B650 Tomahawk. The remaining components are:\n\n* Power Supply: Phanteks Revolt Pro 850W 80 Plus Gold\n* Graphics Card: RTX 4070ti Super Palit\n* Cooling: Arctic Liquid Freezer III 280\n\nI have tried everything, from returning items and buying a better motherboard to reinstalling and formatting the computer. The BIOS is up-to-date, Nvidia drivers are installed, Windows is updated, and the AMD chipset driver for the motherboard is installed. In the BIOS, EXPO is enabled/disabled but makes no difference. The temperatures are fine, with the processor reaching a maximum of 74 degrees during a stress test. I'm wondering if it's the power supply's fault because during the stress test the processor only gets 1.02V.",

(Side note- Setting the CPU Lite Load Control as Intel Default sets the AC and DC loadline as 1.10, If not, you can click Advanced and set them manually.) Intel recommends that the AC load line be the same as DC loadline. For the i9 13th and 14th gen as shown in the chart above we will opt for the Extreme config PL1=PL2 at 253W and CPU Current Limit/ICCMax as 400A.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gsu2qpaund9d1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d48839eaf0cebfc4387b0939c68ec73dbf91906e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1kd9dtaund9d1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eda1f47829fd81bc60fe4c22d785d2796c9f81a2\n\nStep 5- After changing the settings inside Advanced CPU Configuration hit F10 to Save and Exit and if everything works fine Turn on XMP.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hljpt3dund9d1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=13fa9e9f2b998c9bde61c884d0f2cc926088f4e3\n\n",

This is not fucking Intel's Default, it has nothing to do with being \"default\", it's a WORST CASE SCENARIO, literally upper limit of Intel's spec, what you're asking the motherboard is to set a dynamic offset of 110mV per each 100A being drawn, effectively easy well over 300mV voltage bump on any i9 for no reason, while also applying a big, flat positive offset in just idle. This is both fucking stupid and irresponsible. There is no \"default\" value for AC/DC LL, MSI's naming it \"default\" is missleading AND stupid, as well as potentially harmful for CPUs due to the voltage dump. Notice how the guideline doesn't even mention AC nor DC Loadline, you literally should not be having to mess with it, especially if you've no idea what impedance your current LLC mode has. Ironically, you mention \"high temperatures\" and then suggest setting an option that literally skyrockets temperatures across the board.\n\nAC and DC are literally said in the spreadsheet to be matching VRM design and AT WORST it's supposed to be 110 mOhm of impedance for i7/i9. Truth be told, there's absolutely zero reason for AC LL to be even above 0.1mOhm, the vdroop should be countered with LLC, literally the option designed to fight vdroop. There's also no reason to ever match AC LL to DC LL, it's just an offset applied to VID, whereas DC only serves as a power draw calculation impedance correction. Funny though, how you didn't disable XMP - don't you know that XMP is overclocking and it's far from being Intel's \"default\"?\n\n\"Some settings like TjMax Offset and ICC Unlimited Bit are not present in the BIOS)\"\n\nThe first is called CPU Over Temp Protection.\n\nBut I've long lost any hope for PC community in terms of having a basic understanding of events, gatekeeping kept everything better.",
