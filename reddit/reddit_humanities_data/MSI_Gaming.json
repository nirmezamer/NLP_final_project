            "i dont get it contact the nearest provider to get the latest firmware?? so these cant be done while at home??",
            "according the firmware release date, version FW.012 only released a few days ago, so is there any chance that a current copy of the monitor has this version installed already? im looking to purchase the monitor but feel like itd be pointless to receive it just to ship it to a service center for update",
            "No, they either need a special chip or that the specific firmware update allows for further updates. So to summarize, you gotta pack it up and send it off because you can't do it at home.\n\nIt's a bit ridiculous but idk why MSI even made something this expensive not be able to be updated, still a really good monitor tho."
