Never have I felt so sure that our bodies are just instruments for the divine to channel into and create magic with. I set out in making this album with the intention to create a body of work that sounded like sunlight and pure love, and by being surrounded by those sounds every day for years, I was taught the true nature of my body and its purpose. You can listen to the album [here!](https://music.empi.re/wherethebutterfliesgo)\n\n[Proof Pic](https://i.imgur.com/1iiqNfW.png)",

            "Smile For Me seems like an older cousin of Mystery, it makes me feel the same way at least. What inspired you to make this song and how did the production come about? I love the melody of the chorus so much  (also hope youre feeling better after you lost your oak tree )",
            "Hi Raveena! What are things that inspire you? And how do you encapsulate that into your music? ",
            "Hi Raveena! I absolutely loved the new album. I wanted to ask if there are any UK artists you would like to collaborate with ? I think you would work so well with Little Simz if you have heard of her."

            "Good for Sabrina - I felt like EICS was very underrated. And her nonsense outros were super cute and creative. I think she's managed to establish her own brand - dirty with a touch of humor and vulnerability.\n\nSome people have discovered the word payola and are just slinging it around at this point",
            "Funny how some people cant just accept that millions are into Sabrinas music because its catchy, fun, and it hits that sweet spot of vitality that a lot of us are always craving.\n\nI, for one, have known Sabrina since her Girl Meets World days and Im so happy that after 10 years of releasing music the industry is finally paying attention to her. I might just have to go back and stream her discography!",
            "Her music is good, shes cute and has her own style that is different from anyone else right now. Also, theres no denying that Espresso was hard to avoid but it helps that its a good song. Please please please is good but Id argue the music video helps too, I really enjoyed it. Im happy for her being so successful. We need some energetic pop with her style right now.",
            "America was probably looking for its next blonde.",
            "I feel like I've seen this article 20 times in the last month",
            "i think one of her biggest underrated qualities is that she still has a level of legit relatability to her despite being an obvious disney produced barbie doll pop star. just her demeanor and whatnot, she seems like a normal chill and carefree person who isnt taking life too seriously\n\non top of some crazy earworms",
            "Good for Sabrina. Espresso was a home run. People were desperate for a new popstar. Im very tired that people try to discredit Sabrinas success to spotify autoplay as if other artist dont do the same but cant get espresso levels of sucess. Also Espresso feels like the first worldwide hit in quite some time.",
            "Because of extreme Spotify auto play! And also espresso is a good song",
            "She is honestly Americas answer to Kylie Minogue.",
            "The payola accusations are ridiculous; Sabrina has been grinding in the music industry for a decade. Her career took off after signing to a new record label, even then it took a while for EICS to become popular. Payola is a silly Twitter buzzword."

I do hope this is a confidence booster for her and Warner Music when it comes to the marketing of the album in the States.",

            "I think the issue was pacing and the wrong order for singles. Her Oscar's campaign and the success of Dance The Night definitely influenced its perception but I think if the singles were Illusion > Houdini > Training Season > These Walls > End Of An Era it could been better recepted.",
            "She's absolutely huge in Europe. We knew she'd be here to stay after *that* One Kiss performance at the Champions League final in Kyiv, I wasn't much of a fan before and neither were my footy friends but it changed everything.",
