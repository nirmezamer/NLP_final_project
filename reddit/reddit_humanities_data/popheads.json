            "This AMA will start on June 21st, feel free to ask your questions in this thread and we will re-pin in a couple days once it begins :)",
            "I've always wondered, how do yall make sure there aren't repeat answers on a \"staff picks\" list? Like what is the process for making lists like this? Do you have a list of potential artists and then the staff picks who they want to write about?",
            "Thank you for joining us Billboard, as a longtime chartwatcher this is the most I've ever looked forward to an AMA!\n\nMy question is: do you think that TikTok (or a similar platform) where licensed music is utilized in user-generated content could ever be added to the Hot 100 formula? I've seen arguments both ways, where on one hand it's a source of revenue for artists/labels and therefore makes sense from an \"industry chart\" perspective, but on the other hand it isn't really direct music consumption.",
            "Do Billboard staff have their own predictions and/or wishes on which new artists will blow up in popularity?",
            "To a lot of people in this part of the internet, ever since the turn of the decade, the song of the summer according to Billboard has felt less accurate and more manufactured by fan streaming/buying. I see many people online arguing that 2020\u2019s SOTS should have been \u201cWAP,\u201d 2021\u2019s should have been \u201cgood 4 u,\u201d and 2022\u2019s should have been \u201cRunning Up That Hill.\u201d Or more recently, much of the Song of the Summer chatter online has been surrounding \u201cEspresso.\u201d The Song of the Summer chart attempts to quantify the race but it has its shortcomings when measuring cultural ubiquity. Do you agree with Billboard\u2019s Songs of the past few Summers? If not, what can be done to help the SOTS chart mediate streaming and sales data with a song\u2019s summery je ne sais quoi?",
            "How do you make the song of the summer feel like an organic concept and not just like we need a song guess it's this one short of an obvious one like Call Me Maybe?",
            "Thanks for joining Billboard! \n\nThis is a very open-ended question that can go a lot of ways, but what do you all consider a \"successfull\" album  these days now that we are in a streaming era (compared to 15-20 years ago when more artists went gold/platinum in a single week)?",
            "What specific metric are you attempting to quantify in the Billboard charts? \n\nPopularity is the obvious answer, but there are multiple interpretations of that. There's breadth of appeal, how many unique listeners are tuning into a particular song, which is probably the most common interpretation. But there's also how popular that song is with an individual - some will stream a song 50 times, buy it, etc. Many in this thread have pointed out that some use the latter interpretation to their advantage, ending up with a no. 1 hit even if that song hasn't resonated with a wide audience. \n\nThen there's also recurrent rules, which don't necessarily reflect which songs were most popular in a week, but allow for charts to feel less stale. \n\nChart discussions on popheads often conclude in users claiming xyz artist doesn't \"deserve\" to be top of the charts - their song/album was not actually the most popular that week. But it's hard to say what song \"deserves\" to top the charts unless you know what criteria the charts are trying to evaluate. So I think some clarification on that would be cool.",
            "I have a question regarding the current policy on album variants counting towards sales. Recently, some artists have released numerous variants of the same album, which seems to drive up sales in a way that might not reflect genuine demand. For example, Taylor Swift's release of 38 variants for one album seems to leverage fanbase size more than actual organic sales.\n\nWould Billboard consider a policy where only one album variant counts towards the charts unless another variant offers at least 30% more material than the first? I believe such a policy could maintain the integrity of the charts and promote a more sustainable practice within the music industry.",
            "It seems that different forms of \"payola\" are still happening now - what are your thoughts on this and whether billboard cares or is doing anything about it?\n\n\nWhat are your thoughts on \"continue playing\" features on streaming platforms that will only play certain popular songs no matter what playlist or album you started with?"

        "content": "#Intro\n\nNo one knows when the piano was invented. We have pianos surviving as early as 1726 and records of them existing by 1700, leaving their creation sometime in the late 17th century. However, it\u2019s hard to imagine modern music without it. It\u2019s a very versatile instrument, showing up in music from early ragtime and jazz to modern electronic and hip-hop. In the 20th century, it was a mainstay instrument in what we consider \u201cpop music.\u201d During that time, three men became ubiquitous with the instrument: Billy Joel, Elton John, and Stevie Wonder. I am /u/ImADudeDuh and over the course of the next month, we will be determining which hit of these legends' is the best!\n\n---\n\n##Billy Joel\n\nBilly Joel is so entwined with the piano that he is known as \u201cThe Piano Man.\u201d With his father as a pianist and starting piano lessons at 4 years old, the piano and Billy have been together for most of his life. After not graduating high school, he made the choice to pursue a music career, eventually signing to Columbia records. His first hit single for the label was \u201cPiano Man,\u201d a song that perfectly defines his legacy for the next 50 years. Billy became known for his lyrical storytelling, his piano playing, and for being the quintessential New Yorker. Joel has sold out Madison Square Garden 100 times, with the 100th being the subject of a recent TV special. \n\nRecords Sold: over 150 million  \n\\#1 Hits: 3  \nHot 100 Hits: 43  \nPlatinum Albums: 20  \nGrammy Nominations: 23  \nGrammy Wins: 5  \nSpecialties: heartfelt ballads, Motown-esque throwbacks, and love songs cheesier than a dish at an Italian restaurant.  \n\n###Songs: \n\n1. Piano Man  \n2. New York State of Mind  \n3. Just the Way You Are  \n4. Vienna  \n5. Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)  \n6. Only the Good Die Young  \n7. She's Always a Woman  \n8. Scenes from an Italian Restaurant  \n9. My Life  \n10. You May Be Right  \n11. It's Still Rock and Roll to Me  \n12. Tell Her About It  \n13. Uptown Girl  \n14. The Longest Time  \n15. We Didn't Start the Fire  \n16. The River of Dreams  \n\n\n---\n\n##Elton John\n\nElton John is probably the most \u201crelevant\u201d artist of the three today, with him currently sitting at over 50 million monthly listeners on Spotify. From albums of duets in 1993 and 2021, and soundtracking classic films like The Lion King and Gnomeo & Juliet, Elton has lent his talents to others, which may have helped keep up his musical prestige throughout the years. He\u2019s a very versatile performer, dabbling in genres from glam rock to blues to country. In 2023, he received all the awards necessary to earn an EGOT. Elton is most known for his extravagant style of showmanship, but don\u2019t let the feathers fool you, he can sing some heartbreaking songs. \n\nRecords Sold: over 300 million  \n\\#1 Hits: 9  \nHot 100 Hits: 73  \nPlatinum Albums: 31  \nGrammy Nominations: 35  \nGrammy Wins: 5  \nSpecialties: doing the most on piano, doing the least on piano, and totally 100% heterosexual love songs  \n\n###Songs:  \n\n1. Your Song  \n2. Tiny Dancer  \n3. Rocket Man  \n4. Crocodile Rock  \n5. Daniel  \n6. Saturday Night's Alright  \n7. Goodbye Yellow Brick Road  \n8. Candle in the Wind  \n9. Bennie And the Jets  \n10. The Bitch is Back  \n11. Don't Go Breaking My Heart (with Kiki Dee)  \n12. Sorry Seems to Be The Hardest Word  \n13. I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues  \n14. Nikita  \n15. I'm Still Standing  \n16. Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me (with George Michael)  \n\n---\n\n##Stevie Wonder\n\nStevie Wonder started his career by breaking a world record. His first charting single, \u2018Fingertips Pt. 2,\u2019 got him the record for the Youngest Solo Artist to Hit #1 at 13 years old, a record that still holds today. Throughout the latter half of the 60s. Stevie cemented himself as a Motown legend. However, in the mid-1970s, Stevie started his golden era. His album run from Talking Book to Songs in the Key of Life is one of the most legendary 4 album runs in music history, a time where Stevie became the only person to win Album of the Year for 3 consecutive releases. He was known as one of the best Soul and Funk artists ever. Even after that historic period, Stevie still managed several hits and even #1s throughout the 80s, and is still one of the most beloved artists of all time. \n\nRecords Sold: over 125 million  \n\\#1 Hits: 10  \nHot 100 Hits: 63  \nPlatinum Albums: 5  \nGrammy Nominations: 74  \nGrammy Wins: 25  \nSpecialties: Funk, Soul, whatever you call his stuff in the 80s  \n\n###Songs: \n\n1. Fingertips Pt.2  \n2. Uptight (Everything\u2019s Alright)  \n3. For Once in My Life  \n4. My Cherie Amour  \n5. Signed, Sealed, Delivered (I\u2019m Yours)  \n6. You Are the Sunshine of My Life  \n7. Superstition  \n8. I Wish  \n9. Sir Duke  \n10. As  \n11. Isn't She Lovely  \n12. Higher Ground  \n13. Do I Do  \n14. I Just Called to Say I Love You  \n15. Part-Time Lover  \n16. Master-Blaster (Jammin')  \n\n---\n\n###Rate Rules\n\n^credit ^to ^whoever ^made ^this ^originally, ^these ^have ^been ^used ^for ^so ^many ^rates\n\n- Listen to every song listed and give it a score between one (1) and ten (10). Decimal points are allowed, but only to one place (ex. 7.1 is acceptable, but not 7.15). Hosts do not care what score you give the songs as long as it is between those two numbers.\n- You **have to rate every single song in the rate.** If you skip any and do not give me a score when I ask you for one, your ballot will not be counted. This is because the program used to determine the results will break if scores are not successfully put in and I will have a mental breakdown if the program doesn't work because it will be a pain in the ass to do this manually.\n- You may give **one song a zero (0)** and **one song an eleven (11)**. These should be reserved for your favorite track and least favorite track. **If you do use either your zero (0) or your eleven (11), it is strongly encouraged to leave a comment on the track.** It can be as short or as long as you want, but please leave one; it will help the sub understand if you should be canceled or not when the rate is being revealed.\n- Please use the prepared link to submit your scores! That is the only form of ballot we will accept. We spent a lot of time and effort on it, so please use it.\n  - Note: if you're trying to access on a mobile device or on the new reddit layout, it may not work; I have made it so the link will take you to old.reddit.com, so you should use a computer to send in your scores (if possible)!\n- If you desire to change any of the scores after you have already submitted them, simply message me and I will be glad to help!\n- If we believe your scores include any form of sabotage (which would be weird for a Billy Joel/Elton John/Stevie Wonder rate), we reserve the right to reject your ballot. Sabotage is defined as extremely low overall average(s) that shows a clear bias towards or against one artist within the rate. If you truly hate the songs given low scores, we strongly encourage you to write comments on them. This indicates to us that you are not trying to rig the results, meaning everything will go smoothly. :)\n- Your scores should not be considered confidential! Don't be scared to share them. Go nuts. Campaign for whatever song you gave an eleven to. Or not. This whole thing really is not that deep.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n###Commenting Guideline\n\nIt is also highly encouraged that you add song comments to your ballot! Do this by adding a space after the score and then typing to your heart's desire, like this:\n\n> Your Song: 10 I can tell everybody this is a bop!\n\nYou can also leave comments for artists! In order to do so, just add a colon after the artist you\u2019d like to comment on and leave a comment like this:\n\n> Artist: Billy Joel: Wow, he\u2019s so good, I wish New York was real.\n\nAny format other than this is NOT good and you will deeply hurt me if you do not follow the example given here. This includes:\n\n> Superstition: 1: this is scarily bad!\n\n> We Didn\u2019t Start The Fire: This song is FIRE \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25PUT IT OUT \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd251\n\n> Don\u2019t Go Breaking My Heart: I\u2019m giving this a 9 cause I\u2019m a Kiki Dee stan for life.\n\n> Mi Cherie Amour: 10, Even the French jumpscare can\u2019t bring this song down!\n\n---\n\n#[YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL85bVGDu5pYeUzPl-OxXrKvERJhABYb9d)\n\n#[Spotify Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0pNnUAcyCAkAyIK6w1FB5m?si=d28f10841dac411d)\n\n#[Apple Music Playlist](https://music.apple.com/gb/playlist/20th-century-piano-men/pl.u-GgA55lgCoMXxy2v) made by /u/impla77!\n\n#[Submit Scores](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=ImADudeDuh&subject=20th%20Century%20Piano%20Men%3A%20Greatest%20Hits&message=Username%3A%20%0A%0AArtist%3A%20Billy%20Joel%0A%0APiano%20Man%3A%0A%0ANew%20York%20State%20of%20Mind%3A%20%0A%0AJust%20the%20Way%20You%20Are%3A%0A%0AVienna%3A%0A%0AMovin'%20Out%20%28Anthony's%20Song%29%3A%0A%0AOnly%20the%20Good%20Die%20Young%3A%0A%0AShe's%20Always%20a%20Woman%3A%0A%0AScenes%20from%20an%20Italian%20Restaurant%3A%0A%0AMy%20Life%3A%0A%0AYou%20May%20Be%20Right%3A%0A%0AIt's%20Still%20Rock%20and%20Roll%20to%20Me%3A%20%0A%0ATell%20Her%20About%20It%3A%20%0A%0AUptown%20Girl%3A%20%0A%0AThe%20Longest%20Time%3A%20%0A%0AWe%20Didn't%20Start%20the%20Fire%3A%20%0A%0AThe%20River%20of%20Dreams%3A%20%0A%0AArtist%3A%20Elton%20John%0A%0AYour%20Song%3A%0A%0ATiny%20Dancer%3A%0A%0ARocket%20Man%3A%0A%0ACrocodile%20Rock%3A%0A%0ADaniel%3A%0A%0ASaturday%20Night's%20Alright%3A%0A%0AGoodbye%20Yellow%20Brick%20Road%3A%0A%0ACandle%20in%20the%20Wind%3A%0A%0ABennie%20And%20the%20Jets%3A%0A%0AThe%20Bitch%20is%20Back%3A%0A%0ADon't%20Go%20Breaking%20My%20Heart%20%28with%20Kiki%20Dee%29%3A%0A%0ASorry%20Seems%20to%20Be%20The%20Hardest%20Word%3A%0A%0AI%20Guess%20That's%20Why%20They%20Call%20It%20The%20Blues%3A%0A%0ANikita%3A%0A%0AI'm%20Still%20Standing%3A%0A%0ADon't%20Let%20The%20Sun%20Go%20Down%20On%20Me%20%28Live%20with%20George%20Michael%29%3A%0A%0AArtist%3A%20Stevie%20Wonder%0A%0AFingertips%20Pt.2%3A%0A%0AUptight%20%28Everything's%20Alright%29%3A%0A%0AFor%20Once%20in%20My%20Life%3A%0A%0AMy%20Cherie%20Amour%3A%0A%0ASigned%2C%20Sealed%2C%20Delivered%20%28I'm%20Yours%29%3A%0A%0AYou%20Are%20the%20Sunshine%20of%20My%20Life%3A%0A%0ASuperstition%3A%0A%0AI%20Wish%3A%0A%0ASir%20Duke%3A%0A%0AAs%3A%0A%0AIsn't%20She%20Lovely%3A%0A%0AHigher%20Ground%3A%0A%0ADo%20I%20Do%3A%0A%0AI%20Just%20Called%20to%20Say%20I%20Love%20You%3A%0A%0APart-Time%20Lover%3A%0A%0AMaster-Blaster%20%28Jammin'%29%3A%0A%0AEND)\n\n#[Backup Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/yUfZ9tfN)",

            "Forbes writes:\n\n>\"A clear example that has currently been seen with the Spotify algorithm and the 'new' payola, is the latest 'hit' of the pop singer Sabrina Carpenter, \u201cPlease Please Please\u201d, which in less than two weeks managed to surpass artists consolidated figures in the industry such as Bad Bunny, Ariana Grande, Kanye West, among others, by climbing to the top of the platform's playslits, regardless of the genre they focus on. Suddenly, we hear one from Peso Pluma and then the one from Sabrina Carpenter comes out\u2026  \n  \nAccording to an article published by [PopFiltr](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=es&tl=en&hl=en&prev=search&u=https://www.popfiltr.com/articles/all-top-50-artists-on-spotify-have-sabrina-carpenters-please-please-please-at-number-2-on-their-artist-or-song-radios), the promotion given established stars within the industry managed to divert at least 2.5 million dollars from other independent artists, which is equivalent to almost 4 million minutes played on Spotify, figures that could continually grow due to payola.\"\n\nMany users took it to X to write about their experiences and share how Sabrina Carpenter's 'Please Please Please' shows up on completely unrelated playlists.\n\n>After seeing a user on X/Twitter post about \"PPP\" playing after a fart track, [we searched \"Fart\" on Spotify and created a Fart Radio, and \"PPP\" still took the 2nd position](https://www.popfiltr.com/articles/all-top-50-artists-on-spotify-have-sabrina-carpenters-please-please-please-at-number-2-on-their-artist-or-song-radios) among the fart \u201csongs.\u201d",
            "Everything Spotify does has been like this - shuffle isn\u2019t random it recommends songs Spotify wants you to hear , same with radio same with AI DJ",
            "It was about time Spotify started getting called out. Sabrina's impact!",
            "I mean, they\u2019ve been doing it for ages. Drake, Taylor and the Weeknd specifically.\n\nI have the three of them muted and spotify will notify me of their concerts, new music, etc. Like everytime I open the damn app. \n\nBut with Sabrina I guess it\u2019s a whole other level when you put her on every single playlist lmao",
            "Not surprised at all, same thing happened with espresso \ud83d\ude2d that song would play every 2 seconds for me it was insane, haven\u2019t had it happen with please please please yet though"

            "I\u2019m so glad Lorde\u2019s verse on the remix was a reminder of just how great and dialed in of a songwriter she is when she\u2019s at the peak of her powers\n\nCan\u2019t wait for L4",
            "Pure Heroine will always be seen by most as the natural turning point from recession era maximalism to moody, minimalist pop that took over in the middle of the last decade.",
            "I'm so happy about this article. Low-key, I've encountered some iffy comments questioning Lorde's impact on the music industry. But I figured many of these new users were too young to appreciate an album like Melodrama at the time of its release.\n\nAnd I guess that's my problem with the rising popularity of indie/bedroom-pop. It's like the industry is working overdrive to frame these young artists as revolutionary or refreshing when most of them have torn a page or two from Lorde's artistic playbook. I'm happy for artists like Billie and Olivia, and only wish them well, but Lana and Lorde deserve their flowers as well.",
            "It\u2019s really clear that Lorde\u2019s fingerprints are literally all over popular music. She changed the game with Pure Heroine, did it again with Melodrama, and (argue with the wall), there was a slew of stripped back, introspective albums in the years since Solar Power. If you give me a minute I can list a lot of them.\n\nNow with this new remix and her album coming almost definitely this year, the pop girl\u2019s have no choice but to follow in her footsteps again, I\u2019ll bet my life on it. She really is the future of music",
            "i'll border on being a solar power defender but since its release, i immediately loved it. i still love it. i've been with lorde since the love club ep and i literally grew up listening to her so i think it's one of the reasons why each era had connected with me. and whenever i feel down, or just want to hear something calmer in the background or want to be with nature or sea/river, i listen to solar power. \n\n\nsometimes, it hurts when people call SP derogatory words (i know im so dramatic) and call Lorde names for releasing SP but i dont understand their POV because Solar Power is honestly an amazing album in its own right.\n\n\nand now, we're in 2024. and over the years after SP's release, i've witnessed a looooot of female artists going to the ocean as well or going to nature to do their new eras (i can give you a list if you want). this to me, isn't a coincidence. it is lorde & solar power's impact",
            "This was such a good read! My pals and I were lamenting over the Gracie album yesterday at work and I went off on a tangent about how influential Lorde is as a vocalist and how she\u2019s shaped the landscape so irreparably that nobody has even come close to nailing her dictation or phonetic phrasing.   \n\nAlso not forgetting that Pure Heroin is one of few modern albums that tangibly changed the sound of music forever. In fact circa. 2013 was an INSANE time for music. 1975, Haim, xx debuts have been massively influential too!",
            "One of the greatest ever",
            "I've missed hearing lorde so much\u00a0",
            "not to beat a dead horse but i feel like solar power made people forget just how forward-thinking pure heroine and melodrama were until girl, so confusing reminded them. sp felt very surface level but where she truly shines is in her biting songwriting and i hope we get more of that on l4. not that her work needs to be sad, i just want some grit.",
            "People forget these days how much she changed pop music with pure heroine"
