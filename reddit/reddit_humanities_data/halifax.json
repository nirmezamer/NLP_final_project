        "content": "# Concerns Over Immigration:\n\nHello,\n\nI am writing to express my immense dissatisfaction with the Liberal Party's handling of immigration in 2023. Like many Canadians, one of my parents immigrated to this country, and I believe strongly in the benefits of immigration when it happens in a sustainable manner. However, it cannot continue at present rates. The absurd influx of people that is presently taking place, while our healthcare and housing systems are already overburdened, is killing people. There is no reason to beat around the bush. Liberal policy has forced people out of homes and hospital appointments, in the sole interest of appeasing big business. This is a disgusting betrayal of working- and middle-class Canadians, and one that as I voter I will not soon forget. It is essential that we severely limit immigration in the coming years (preferably only allowing in people who will help with the aforementioned healthcare and housing shortages), until we have returned to a more stable and sustainable footing.\n\nWithout a complete one-eighty on current policy, I cannot conscionably vote for the Liberal Party again.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[My name]\n\n[Postal code]\n\n---\n\n\n# Fillmore\u2019s Response:\n\nHi [my name], thank you for your message. Canada has certainly seen tremendous growth in the last couple years, and we are struggling with the challenges of that growth in areas like housing and health care. Immigration is an important part of Canada's story and our success, but of course we need to have immigration policies that ensure everyone can share in and contribute our prosperity. I was pleased to see this addressed by Minister of Immigration Marc Miller last month when he put a cap on non-permanent residents - ie, international students - for the next two years. I agree we must ensure that the pace of our growth is aligned with our ability to provide the necessary services to Canadians and permanent residents. I have raised this issue with my colleagues in Ottawa. \n\nThank you for making your views known and please stay in touch. \n\n-Andy.",

            "Current issues with healthcare and housing are the cause of multiple failures by all 3 levels of government, yes, unchecked immigration levels has put painful pressure on our healthcare and housing but it's not the whole picture. Should we tie immigration levels to available or created housing? Yes. Will it solve all the issues? No. \n\nSide note: a liberal (lower case for a reason) being smug and not caring about common opinions because their farts are the only ones that smell like roses? Color me shocked.",

            "So basically, \"We stopped increasing the number of international of students for two years. Good enough?\"",
            "I don't think the issue is caused by immigration per se. The type of immigration we are seeing is a symptom of other issues.    \nOur economy is based entirely on growth, and without making fundamental changes to our economy, immigration will remain a key driver of that growth. In my view, the issue is a fundamental lack of intervention by the government in the housing market, a TFW program that imports a class of under-waged and subsidized workers (that only serves to undercut opportunities for the most economically precarious Canadians), and the chronic underfunding of our universities (while allowing a loop hole to charge foreign students inflated tuitions).    \nIf we actually addressed those issues, immigration would cease to compound our problems, and would help to drive the economy rather than simply helping corporations make more money.",
