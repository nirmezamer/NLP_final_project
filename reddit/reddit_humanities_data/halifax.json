Soak the beans (if required) overnight and then boil them in stock with whatever veg you have on hand (carrots & potatoes work great).

Throw in carrots, celery, potatoes, rice, whatever is cheap and you enjoy.\n\nLots of good Asian soups out there. You could make a version of chankonabe. Or Watercress, nappa, pick an Asian vegetable at the market and you can probably google how to make an easy soup with it. Asian soups go great with rice too which is inexpensive calories. \n\nSoups are nutritious, delicious, filling and generally inexpensive.",

Do a stir fry and add the noodles in the pan once they\u2019re cooked (add a little bit of the noodle water), simmer on low for a minute or two, bonus if you can add some soy sauce.\n\nAnother tip - always look at the price per 100g. Very often I\u2019ll see things on sale, but the larger version of the same thing is actually cheaper than the sale price. So whenever possible get the lowest $/100g."
