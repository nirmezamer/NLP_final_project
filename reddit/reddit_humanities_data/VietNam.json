Don't post your general questions & inquiries outside of this thread as they will be removed.\n\n#Lots of your questions have been answered already so make sure you do a search before asking (how-to below). \n\n---\n\nTo keep this subreddit tidy, we have this monthly thread that is open for random discussions and questions. **If you post your basic/general questions outside of this thread they will be removed.** Sorry, we want to make this sub friendly but also want it to be clean and organized.\n\nSome examples of the questions that should be posted here:\n\n- Questions that can be answered with just Yes/No\n- Basic questions like \"Where can I buy this?\"\n- Questions that were asked many times before. Please do your research\n- Questions that are not specific\n\n---\n\n##**Tips to quickly find answers for your questions:**\n\nMany of your questions may have been answered since people keep asking the same ones again and again. Here is a quick tip to find the answers for yours.\n\nFirst, [have a look at our old sticky threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ASticky). A lot of useful information there. A lot of questions have been answered.\n\nYou can also use the search feature of Reddit, just like you do with Google.\n\nAnother option is to use Google, as Google understands your queries better than Reddit and can return better results.\n\nGo to Google. Add 'site:https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/' next to your queries (without quotes). For example, if I want to find info on eVisa in this subreddit, my query to put in Google is 'eVisa site:https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/'.\n\n---\n\n##**F.A.Q**\n\nHere are the common questions about travel/visa/living in Vietnam which have been answered by the community members, plus other useful information.

Is there anywhere I can play like an open field, dropping in with strangers, or a football academy or tryouts/trials? Im going to stay in hanoi and Thanh H\u00f3a. I also have a citizenship with this country so that could probably help me get into a football academy for a week?",

            "Travel/Visa Question!!! \n\nMy passport expired during my contract, I got a new one so I was never given a new TRC, simply a visa in my passport that expires in late October. I asked HR several times if they wanted my passport (to cancel my visa) and they said no. The last time I met with them they told me they would simply tell immigration to cancel my visa at the end of June. It's a large company and HR has always seemed to be very competent in the past. I want to stay until I can get my pension without doing visa runs. Anyone know what the rule is here, and when I do leave do I need an exit visa (provided I leave before the end date which of course I will). Thanks for the assistance.",

            "Hello folks! I was planning a visit to Vietnam end of this month. Due to my budget and time, Ho Chi Minh City is the most suitable, negating most other travel options. I have been speaking to a few folks who recently went there, and the common theme was heat and monsoon as things to look out for.\n\nHow has the summer been there this year? Is an early/delayed/on-time monsoon expected? What could I be seeing weather-wise at the end of June? I don't mind the heat, (till 30-35 degrees), and don't mind the rain either. I just don't want to be holed up inside. I should be booking the tickets in the next few hours so any tips will be super helpful!",

Below are some quick guidelines to help you better participate in the community activities.\n\n- r/Vietnam is now a dual language subreddit. You can use both English and Vietnamese here.\n- Please read the rules before participating, making a submission or comment. You can find them on the Sidebar (Desktop), About tab (Mobile), or this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/txkoxs/rules_quy_t%E1%BA%AFc/)\n- Trivial questions that can be answered quickly, or google-able, or without the intention of creating a discussion, should be posted in the sticky thread. Travel/visa questions should be posted there too.\n- r/Vietnam has a Discord server [here](https://discord.gg/2cRvfymfTf) which aims to be more open and flexible to handle more casual conversations. You can also find both English and Vietnamese channels there.\n\n---\n\nAbout the changelog.\n\nI've made some changes to the sub:\n\n- Re-writing the rules to make them more concise. Adding Vietnamese.\n- Remove some unnecessary flairs.\n- Big change: Switching r/Vietnam to a dual-language subreddit. This is based on the fact that the number of Vietnamese people in this sub has increased significantly. I know this is controversial and some of you don't like this but I think we should just give it a try.\n- Making a Discord server. This is after r/place event that I realized we need a place to handle future events like this better and for the ease of casual, chit-chat type of conversations.",

            ">Vietnam's economy expanded 6.93% in the second quarter from a year earlier, surpassing the 5.66% in the January-March quarter, as it strives to bounce back from the pandemic, official data showed Saturday.\n\n>In what's been called an uneven recovery, the Southeast Asian supply chain hub kept steady export growth of 12.5% in the second quarter, boosted by electronics and seafood, according to the General Statistics Office.\n\n>Domestic consumption lagged somewhat, increasing 5.78% in the first six months versus a year earlier, data showed, while economists are split on whether Vietnam will raise interest rates to tackle inflation or hold to encourage business lending this year. One of the world's fastest-growing economies, Vietnam targets gross domestic product to increase by 6-6.5% in 2024.\n\n>\"Downside risks are high,\" said Paulo Medas, International Monetary Fund fiscal affairs department division chief, after meetings with the prime minister and other top leaders. \"Exports, a key driver for Vietnam's economy, could weaken if global growth disappoints, global geopolitical tensions persist, or trade disputes intensify.\"\n\n>Low foreign demand has weighed on exporters, though more long term, they have benefited from investors' migration from China, which is locked in a trade war with the U.S. It is unclear how the war will play out after the U.S. presidential election in November, but leading candidates Joe Biden and Donald Trump have both clamped down on what they call Beijing's unfair trade.\n\n>Analysts do not agree on whether Vietnam's economy is strong enough to bear interest rate rises. The statistics office said inflation was 4.39% in the first quarter, putting pressure on the central bank to tame elevated prices.\n\n>Tim Leelahaphan, economist for Vietnam and Thailand at Standard Chartered Bank, predicts the State Bank of Vietnam will increase the refinancing rate by half a percentage point in the fourth quarter of 2024, if not sooner, citing rising inflation and foreign exchange weakness.\n\n>\"Despite the likely \\[second-quarter\\] slowdown, we think Vietnam's recovery remains intact,\" Leelahaphan said. \"However, economic challenges could persist in \\[the third quarter\\] amid rising price pressures, FX weakness, and soft global demand.\"\n\n>A manufacturing base for global companies like Samsung Electronics and Foxconn, Vietnam has seen chronic underinvestment in infrastructure and shaky power supplies, which were interrupted in factory zones last year. Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Le Minh Khai at Nikkei's Future of Asia forum in May acknowledged the shortages and said grid improvements will help avoid a repeat.\n\n>The IMF said renewable energy and productivity gains are the two factors the country needs in \"a new wave of reforms\" to sustain growth in the face of climate change and an aging population.\n\n>\"Given the uneven economic recovery, policies remain highly supportive in 2024,\" Medas said.\n\n>He added: \"Vietnam's anti-corruption efforts are important for high-quality development and would benefit from stronger preventative anti-corruption institutions, economic governance and transparency. Efforts to reduce legal uncertainty and allow for swifter decision making by public officials would also foster a more business-friendly environment.\"\n\n>The graft crackdown has left top state officials out of a job, business tycoons in prison, and bureaucrats reluctant to make decisions.\n\n[Chart](https://archive.ph/HKeDI/83a6a47e3d927f69bcb7300ec17419e8de408d91.avif)"
