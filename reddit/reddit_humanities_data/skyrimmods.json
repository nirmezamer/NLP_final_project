            "I was looking for quest mods and a lot of people suggested Death Consumes All, so I grabbed it. It took me a long time to find the NPC to start the quest, so I did other quests with tough enemies in the mean time. Those tough enemies all dropped this thing called Blood of Energy and I had no idea what it was for, so I held onto all of them in case they were important. \n\nThey were. >!I finally started Death Consumes All and discovered that they're used to unlock the story. So I used them. All 40 of them. And fast tracked all the way to the end of the quest while I dicked around in the wilderness, listening to the tale. I was so confused when other players were talking about a Riverwood portion or needing to do the College of Winterhold questline. Apparently, I skipped it all and went straight to the brutally difficult endgame. I still occasionally find places where the mod's assets were used, presumably to tell the actual story lol!<\n\nAt least I saved a lot of people, I guess?",

        "content": "Recently, Bethesda released a large update with a new marketplace, a few new features, and some bug fixes. It also launched the new Verified Creator program that introduces paid mods via Bethesda.net. Here is what we know as of Feb 10, 2024:\n\nThe Patch notes and change log\n===\nThis update is versioned 1.6.1130. Here is the the [official patch notes from Bethesda](https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/article/4ORD7tshfmHUN8H4ULSgE4/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-special-edition-creations-update-patch-notes).\n\nJanuary 17, 2024 Update\n===\nBethesda announced that another update (after 1.6.1130) will be released on January 17, 2024 at 11 AM (US Eastern time). This update will roll out on GOG, Epic Store, Bethesda Net, Xbox, and PlayStation first, with the Steam release coming later on:\n\n> Happy Tuesday everyone!\n\n> We're planning on patching Skyrim on January 17th at 11:00am EST. Please note, that this patch will only apply to GOG, Epic Store, Bethesda Net, Xbox, and PlayStation. The Steam version of the patch will have a slight delay and be applied after. Our patch notes will be shared here as soon as they are finalized. Thanks for your patience!\n\nHere is the [announced patch notes](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/198sr58/skyrim_special_editionanniversary_edition_january/?) for the update.\n\nThe \"ESL\" form ID increase\n===\nThis is actually only tangentially related to ESLs, as all plugin types now get 2048 addition form IDs to use.\n\nPreviously, Skyrim's ESL-flagged plugins only had 2048 form IDs to work with: 0x800-0xFFF. This is due to a Skyrim engine bug that reserved form IDs 0x0-0x7FF from all plugins when it should only be reserved from Skyrim.esm. Now the range of 0x0-0x7FF can be used by plugins other than Skyrim.esm, which means increasing the number of form IDs available to all plugins by 2048, and doubling the amount of new forms that can be stored in ESL-flagged plugins.\n\nThis was previously fixed on Fallout 4, and has been ported back to Skyrim for the v1.6.1130 update.\n\nThe issue with this fix is any new plugins, not just ESL-flagged plugins, can now be made with form IDs in the 0x0-0x7FF range. If an old SkyrimSE.exe, such as downgraded, VR, or GOG versions of the game, loads these new plugins, the game will immediately crash. There are no mods that use these new form IDs yet. The concern is that future mod makers might make plugins using form IDs in this range, which will not be backwards compatible with downgraded, VR, or GOG versions of the game.\n\nHowever, a more immediate concern is Bethesda shipped a \"_ResourcePack.esl\" with the v1.6.1130 update. This plugin uses form IDs in the 0x0-0x7FF range. So if you try to load this \"_ResourcePack.esl\" file from a downgraded (or GOG, VR) exe, your game will immediately crash. If you crash with address `SkyrimSE.exe+0198090`, `SkyrimSE.exe+0197E90` or `SkyrimSE.exe+05E1F22`, this might be the cause. **[Nukem](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/4995023) has released a SKSE plugin DLL that will allow 0x0-0x7FF and v1.71 plugins to be loaded on older exes: [Backported Extended ESL Support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441).**\n\nSKSE and Address Library\n===\nSKSE and [Address Library](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444) has already been updated for the v1.6.1130 update. However, there appears to be lingering problems with these updates.\n\nAddress Library is in a testing phase, and [powerofthree](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/2148728) has reported that many existing SKSE DLL mods do not work with it. This is because this update, although smaller than the \"AE\" update from 2021, is still bigger than what Address Library can fully handle: there have been some ID changes and game structure changes that break stuff.\n\nOf course, any other DLL mod that doesn't rely on Address Library will need to be updated for the new v1.6.1130 version to work with that version. This includes [RaceMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19080) and [Faster HDT-SMP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57339)\n\nSkyUI\n===\nPeople were reporting that [SkyUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12604)'s and **difficulty selection** and **search bar** functionalities were not working with the new v1.6.1130 update.\n\n**Update:** What appears to have happened is that when Bethesda added the **marketplace** menu entry, they inserted it into the middle of an [enumerated type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerated_type) definition used for communication between the game exe and flash. This caused all subsequent items in the enum to be offset. Skyrim uses flash for UI, so these changed offsets are no longer compatible with SkyUI.\n\nAs of SKSE v2.2.5, SkyUI's **search bar** functionality has been fixed.\n\nv1.6.1130's **difficulty selection** bug with SkyUI has been fixed with [SkyUI SE - Difficulty Persistence Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106418)\n\nControl Map\n===\n**Update:** If you had a custom controlmap.txt from a mod, the game is reported to crash when you try to run the new v1.6.1130 update.\n\nThe cause of this, like with SkyUI, is the addition of the marketplace entry to the control map. If this entry is missing, as the case with old control maps, the game will crash.\n\n**Update 2:** As of SKSE v2.2.5, the controlmap.txt crash has been fixed.\n\nSSE Engine Fixes and plugins.txt loading\n===\n**Update**: People have been reporting that [SSE Engine Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17230) breaks plugins.txt loading with Engine Fixes versions 6.1.0 and older, which means your plugin load order is not loaded correctly by the game. This appears to be due to SSE Engine Fixes's achievement enabler. To fix this, update Engine Fixes to v6.1.1 or above\n\nPlugin version 1.71\n===\nBethesda also incremented the plugin version from 1.7 to 1.71. Any plugin made with this version specified in the header will also crash any older version exes such as VR, GOG, and downgraded Steam SkyrimSE.exe. No mods are using this version number yet. However this is the version number of the the updated free Fishing Creation's plugin (ccBGSSSE001-Fish.esm), and as such, running older exes with the up-to-date Fishing Creation will immediately crash the game. If you crash with address `SkyrimSE.exe+0198090`, `SkyrimSE.exe+0197E90` or `SkyrimSE.exe+05E1F22`, this might be the cause.\n **[Nukem](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/4995023) has released a SKSE plugin DLL that will allow 0x0-0x7FF and v1.71 plugins to be loaded on older exes: [Backported Extended ESL Support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441).**\n\nThe latest Unofficial skyrim special edition patch has also been updated to this plugin version. If you're using an older exe, you can fix by either reverting to an [earlier version](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266?tab=files&file_id=392477&nmm=1), editing the plugin version to 1.7 in the header with SSEedit, or by using [Backported Extended ESL Support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441).\n\nSteam integration is missing\n===\n\nIt appears that Skyrim Special Edition v1.6.1130 shipped without Steam integration. So this version of the game effectively has no DRM. Achievements also don't work with v1.6.1130.\n\nIt is expected that Bethesda will ship an update in the near future to address this.\n\n---\n\nVerified Creator (paid mods) program\n===\nBethesda also rolled out a Verified Creator Program to Bethesda.net. Mod makers can now apply to become a \"verified creator\" with Bethesda. If approved, they will be allowed to upload mods on Bethesda.net and charge users creation club credits. You can find the official description of the program here: [Bethesda Game Studio Creations](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/creators/bethesdagamestudios)\n\n**Current paid mods**\n\n* [Shadetree Lodge](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/details/5492/Shadetree_Lodge) by [Elianora](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/all?author_displayname=TheRealElianora) for 500 credits (approximately $5)\n* [Aldmeri Anti-mage](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/details/5486/Aldmeri_Anti_mage) by [Niero](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/all?author_displayname=Niero) for 400 credits (approximately $4)\n* [Arquebus](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/details/5463/Arquebus) by [Shoeburglar](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/all?author_displayname=Shoeburglar) for 600 credits (approximately $6)\n* [Legendary Dungeons: Dwarven Delves](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/details/5401/Legendary_Dungeons__Dwarven_Delves) by [Trainwiz](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/all?author_displayname=Trainwiz) for 400 credits (approximately $4)\n* [Katja The Thief](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/details/5291/Katja_The_Thief) by [unoctium](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/all?author_displayname=unoctium) for 400 credits (approximately $4)\n* [Winterfrost Plus Edition](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/details/5584/Winterfrost_Plus_Edition) by [TheDogOfWar](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/all?author_displayname=TheDogOfWar) for 600 credits (approximately $6)\n* [Winterfrost (PS4)](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/details/5585/Winterfrost) by [TheDogOfWar](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/all?author_displayname=TheDogOfWar) for 500 credits (approximately $5)\n* [East Empire Expansion](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/details/5294/East_Empire_Expansion) by [kinggath_creations](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/all?author_displayname=kinggath_creations) for 700 credits (approximately $7)\n* [Morthal](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/details/5516/Morthal) by [Arthmoor](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/all?author_displayname=Arthmoor) for 200 credits (approximate $2)\n\n**Bethesda/Creator monetization split**\n\nWe have inquired both the paid mod authors and Bethesda about the details of the split. However, neither parties have been willing to divulge the details. We have not seen any claims about the split that is credibly sourced elsewhere on the internet.\n\n**Support for paid mods**\n\nIt appears that there is currently no official support channels for paid mods on Bethesda.net. Users cannot rate or comment on paid mods. All support for paid mods are currently being handled unofficially, such as via the authors' discord servers.\n\nIt should also be noted that paid mods are not considered official Bethesda content like previous Creation Club add-ons and will disable achievements like free mods by default.\n\n**What is allowed on paid mods**\n\nComments from official Bethesda sources indicates that paid mods are limited in the following ways:\n\n* They cannot rely on any other mods or resources and must be standalone. This means they cannot use [SKSE](https://skse.silverlock.org/), must use vanilla body, and cannot use frameworks such as [Open Animation Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92109) or [Spell Perk Item Distributor (SPID)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869), for example. This also means any compatibility patching must be done elsewhere as separate free mod.\n* They must be new. Mod authors cannot make an existing mod a paid mod. Any collaborative work must be handled outside of Bethesda.net among the contributors themselves.\n* They cannot use generative AI.\n* They must adhere to Bethesda.net community standards. This means, for example, paid mods cannot contain nudity.\n* Since paid mods are delivered via the in-game menu, they are not fully supported by mod managers such as Mod Organizer 2 or Vortex. This also means they cannot contain installers for automatic patches or options.",
