            "The Joke (1969): Saw this last night on 24/7. I read a lot of Russian literature and history and was really impressed by this reading of post-WWII Russia; even the (Gulag) camp scenes were spot on (though brief and not that graphic). The huge strength of this film is how it dissects (and rearranges) filmic form(s). For instance, the viewer is shown flashback after flashback with the protagonist stuck in the foreground of the frame as an older man; he is *discussing* (with the other characters) certain aspects of his past; that template is also repeated in present day time when he returns to these locations from his youth, but now the other characters *can* see (and interact with) him. There's another interesting filmic conceit where the director takes a scene that appears later in the movie that has a full cast and set, removes everything but a few characters, and inserts the resultant scene near the beginning of the movie as a metaphoric foreshadowing device. Example: (1) the big crowd scene at the end features dozens of people on horseback with fancy equipage, costumes, and saddles; (2) there is a scene very early on showing just one boy (practicing for the later scene) on a horse, but the backdrop is a flat, modern, building external, so the kid looks like an angel of light (almost as a nod to Tarkovsky).\n\nThe Hit (1984): This came on (on 24/7) right after The Joke, which was SO cool. An early Stephen Frears sparse kidnapping film with a VERY young Tim Roth (he looks almost prepubescent). Fine acting all around, not too much violence, and stunning visuals (remote parts of Spain, I think).",
            "Finally got around to 'Perfect Days,' and I enjoyed it tremendously. Koji Yakusho is teriffic, and the story does a great job of slowly revealing more about himself and the people in his life. The ending is another wonderful note; it's a great point for reflecting on the events of the movie and how this character lives his life.\n\nGosh, 2023 was an amazing year for movies.",
            "Highlight of the week was by far The Eight Mountains on the channel. First time watch. Really enjoyed the theme of camaraderie and the landscapes in it. Reminded me a lot of into the wild to a degree. \n\nAlso watched the innocent. Wasn\u2019t as into that one but was enjoyable enough. \n\nRewatched Oppenheimer for the second time and it reaffirmed for me it\u2019s Nolan\u2019s best since the dark knight and an apt best picture winner. Also rewatched the zone of interest and it\u2019s another banger.\n\nEdit - I forgot I watched Past Lives for the first time and I really liked it. I really appreciated the dignity and honesty to how each character approached the situation. Simple story but told in a very dignified way.",
            "*Week #181:* \n\n*\n\n*It's a pity we haven't got a bit of rope..*\n\nPrompted by [this HootsMaguire's essay](https://letterboxd.com/hootsmaguire/film/waiting-for-godot), I was reminded that I\u2019ve never seen **Waiting for Godot** (2001). Beckett's absurd play is so fantastically original. Two shabby fellows, confused, belligerent and forgetful, argue with each other for 2 solid hours, without making any sense or connection. Two other odd characters appear, a master and his slave, and then a laconic messenger boy. But everybody's memories are definitely defective, and they must repeat everything again and again - not that it helps. And the allusive Godot of course never appears. \n\nSo what the heck does it all mean? I haven't got a clue, but it's so mesmerizing. **9/10.**\n\n*\n\n**The last two parts of Abbas Kiarostami\u2018s \u2018Koker Trilogy\u2019:**\n\nI don't know why I waited so long to watch these two movies, since I loved his first entry 'Where Is the Friend's House?'. \n \n**And life goes on** (Also called 'Life and nothing more') is a simple but clever semi-documentary meta-film. In 1990, a devastating earthquake killed 50,000 people in a remote Persian area. A filmmaker brings his son with him on a trip to the destroyed village which was the location of his previous film. They want to check if any of the kids from the first movie survived. Like most Iranian movies I've seen, the cars are old, barely moving jalopies, and the deafening noise from street traffic stands out as another character of the story. **8/10.** \n\n**Through the Olive Trees** Goes Meta one level up. It's a lovely continuation of the 2nd chapter, peeling a 'Day for night' onion of 'how it was filmed' in a primitive village settings. Recreating the memorable terrace scene and adding a maybe-true, maybe-fiction story of the boy and girl who played the newly-wed. Beautiful rendering with a sad, sad final shot that last for a long time, and doesn't offer clear explanation. And everything is permeated by death and destruction. **9/10.** \n\n*\n\n**2 documentaries by Todd Douglas Miller:**\n\n*\u201c\u2026 Houston. Tranquility Base here\u2026 The Eagle has landed\u2026\u201d*\n\n**Apollo 11** is an exhilarating 2019 re-telling of the moon landing. Perfectly crisp and emotionally laid out, without any bullshit narration, talking heads interviews or irritating recreations. Just jaw-dropping photography which puts you in the middle of the action. And the display of massive technology is overwhelming: Thousands of engineers and scientists who had built such an inhuman infrastructure (and where each bolt and wire must work 100% of the time!) **- 10/10.** \n\n*On July 20, 1969, I was a 15-year old, arrogant prick, who refused to respond to anything that was shown on TV, so instead of watching the actual event 'live', I ignored it, taking a stroll in the night streets and pondering my miserable life. What an insufferable idiot I was! (And probably still is).*\n\nMiller's earlier docu-drama **Dinosaur 13** (2014) however, was a huge let-down. A fascinating start about the South Dakotan paleontologists who unearthed the \"Sue\" skeleton, turned into a standard 'True Crime' melodrama. Full of dull reenactments, wall-to-wall musical score that tells you how to feel, boring interviews where the characters sit and emote while recalling every step of what happened, fill-in visuals, obvious narrative... Disappointing!\n\n* \n\n**3 by Romanian Adrian & Claudia Sili\u0219teanu:**\n\n**The Ditch** (2012), a terrific rustic comedy about a peasant who has to dig a ditch in front of his house, and like Tom Sawyer, would rather hide in the barn and drink while letting somebody else do the labor. **8/10.**\n\n**[Written / Unwritten](https://vimeo.com/328065700)** (2016) is another unexpected drama about unpredictable, ungovernable and very loud gypsies. A baby is born, and the nurse needs to fill out the correct paperwork in order to release her. **Best film of the week!**\n\n**The Afghanistans** (2019) is very different. It starts with a soldier trying not to be shot, and develops into an intricate power play of government, bureaucracy, refugees and hard negotiations. \n\n*I would watch anything else these 2 will produce!*\n\n*\n\nRaffaello Matarazzo was a successful Italian director, in the days before Neorealism. His **Tourist Train** (1933) is the first comedy from the Fascist era that I\u2019ve seen. But it has no political elements. Just a lovely trip into the Umbrian countryside by a group of middle class people, and their light adventures by the river in Orvieto. Nino Rota\u2019s first film score. 6/10. \n\n*\n\n**Hollywood's depictions of the deep South X 3:**\n\n**Rich Hall's The Dirty South** (2010), my first by comedian Rich Hall, a tongue-in-cheek documentary for the BBC, about how Southerners were portrayed through the years by the movies, from Li'l Abner and Rhett Butler to 'Your cheatin' heart' and Burt Reynolds. *'If you needed Hollywood to tell you about these musicians, then you're a grazer. Fuck you.'*\n\nNext on my list: His entries about American 'Road movies' and 'Westerns' genres. (Thanks to [u/jupiterkansas](https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1cq9s4h/what_have_you_been_watching_week_of_may_12_2024/l8sdqzx/).)\n\n*\"What we've got here is failure to communicate.\"*\n\nPeak Paul Newman as **Cool hand Luke** (1967), a rebel without a cause, another Randle McMurphy sentenced to an institute that will do everything it can to break his freewheeling spirit. Self-destructive, anti-social nihilist, sticking it to the Man, until he can no more. Good old Chain-gang romanticism, lays it thick: When he finished eating 50 hard-boiled eggs in one hour, he's left laying like a crucified Jesus on the table, a beautiful, bare-chested specimen. \ud83d\udcaf score on Rotten Tomatoes. \n\n**Baby Doll** (1956) was another scandalous Tennessee Williams / Elia Kazan tale of unconsummated desire. Sweaty failures tearing each other down. A sexually-frustrated, boozy husband losing his gin-cotton business. A 19-year old virgin Lolita, who doesn't realize the effects she has on all men around her. Eli Wallace in his first role as a hot Sicilian lover-type, bent on revenge. Two black share-croppers acting as a Greek chorus. No wonder The Catholic Legion of Decency boycotted this 'filth'. \n\n*\n\n**Unrelated** (2007), my first film by Joanna Hogg, which was also her debut feature. A British woman escapes some marital issues by staying with friends at a villa in Tuscany (which was nice). The film is highly-acclaimed, but I found the whole story dull and un-engaging. [*Female Director*]\n\n*\n\n*\"Never sweep the place where you live. Because after four years, the dirt doesn't get worse!\"*\n\n**An Evening with Quentin Crisp** (1980) is my introduction to the controversial gay iconoclast, English raconteur and witty performer. The YouTube copy is of low-quality, but the content is 'Marvelous'. \n\nNext: The two movies based on Crisp\u2019s work, with John Hurt playing him, 'The naked civil servant' and 'An Englishman in New York'. (Also, a deep dive into John Hurt\u2019s meatiest roles!).\n\n*\n\n**Brat Pack X 2:**\n\nI haven't seen nearly any movies from the 'Brat Pack' universe, and wasn't vested in any of the actors' careers. So Andrew McCarthy's new autobiographical documentary, **Brats,** didn't carry any nostalgic resonance with me. It's also about the pervasiveness of pop culture television from the 80's, which was even less interesting. But his pained journey of discovery felt unexpectedly honest. He used this film as a form of personal therapy, which is Okay, I guess. I also didn't realize that this was the first time when Hollywood zoomed in its focus on teenagers and the young, and that these actors were elevated to carry the money torch. **7/10.**\n\nSo I thought I'll try some of these '80s classics I had missed out on. Unfortunately, I started with **Class** (1983), which was Rob Lowe's 2nd film, as well as the debut of McCarthy, John Cusack, Virginia Madsen, and Lolita Davidovich. Badly-remake of 'The Graduate' with cringy prep school tropes was a second rate sex comedy. Couldn't finish it.\n\n*\n\nRoger Corman's horror-comedy **Bucket of blood** taking place in a late-'50s counterculture scene, where phony \"Bohemians\" and \"Beatniks\" and \"Artists\" are fawning over the busboy's macabre clay sculptures. *\"I love everything about Roger Corman except his films...\"*\n\n*(Continue below)*"

It's \"girl math\" for physical media fans.\n\nI'm saying that as someone who overspent on the last sale and ended up with a few discs I'm unlikely to watch.",

            "That looks exactly like the Murfreesboro, TN location",
            "I like how they have it organized there! My local B&N is the more typical cover-first alphabetical organization, so you have to flip through them all to see what's there. A little more inconvenient, but I could browse for days.",
            "The library has these, you don't need to spend hundreds on them anymore, pro tip",
            "Also note: it ends on 07/28 this year."
