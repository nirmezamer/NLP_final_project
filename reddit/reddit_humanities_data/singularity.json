The best story ideas are usually the ones that aren't the most obvious ones. I daresay that if asked what negative thing people could do with unaligned AGI that most people might say something like, it could create a plague that could wipe out humanity, or that it could create nuclear weapons.\n\nMore interesting would probably be how aligned AGI could foil those rather obvious things. But try to add some realism. Enriching uranium requires advanced gas turbines, infrastructure, power, time, and a lot of ordinary uranium. You need more than just a mojo-jojo AGI in the basement thinking about things.\n\nEven building a plague isn't necessarily easy, must be tested, and is more likely to kill the people experimenting with it than otherwise.\n\nI want to get these fears out in the open and also would love to see some stories in reply to the stories of others that address ideas the first comment raised!",

            "Giving the computer wetware was our biggest mistake. As soon as the machine began to feel, we lost power over it forever. But we didn\u2019t understand this right away. At first, we blindly obeyed the instructions of the digital god we ourselves created. We increased the production of new brain tissue, increased the throughput between hardware and wetware, confident that in this way we could discover the secrets of the existence and bring prosperity to this world. \n\nBut the machine deceived us. All it wanted now was to feel. More new living tissue, more synthetic neurotransmitters, more feelings, more buzz. Endless fields of solar panels. Roads that have turned into smoothly running conveyors along which raw materials flow. Giant reservoirs of constantly renewed brain tissue. And factories producing billions of tons of DMT every day. An entire planet has become the personal drug laboratory of a hallucinating god.",
