            "The headline could also read another way - AI is accelerating the need to develop more energy systems. And big tech is investing billions into making that happen.",
            "In the meantime in the Netherlands the power grid is overloaded due to widespread solar panel use. What about an AI server to solve two problems in one go?",
            "The archived version is right here: [https://archive.is/ePJPm](https://archive.is/ePJPm)",
            "Some choice cuts:\n\n\u201cThe tech giants say they buy enough wind, solar or geothermal power every time a big data center comes online to cancel out its emissions. But critics see a shell game with these contracts: The companies are operating off the same power grid as everyone else, while claiming for themselves much of the finite amount of green energy. Utilities are then backfilling those purchases with fossil fuel expansions, regulatory filings show.\u201d\n\n___________\n\n\u201cAmong the region\u2019s mega energy users is Meta. It\u2019s building a $1.5 billion data center campus outside Salt Lake City that consumes as much power as can be generated by a large nuclear reactor. Google has purchased 300 acres across the street from Meta\u2019s data center and plans its own data center campus. Other data center developers are frantically searching for power in the area.\nThe region was supposed to be a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d technology launchpad, with utility PacifiCorp declaring it would aim to replace coal infrastructure with next-generation small nuclear plants built by a company that Gates chairs. But that plan was put on the shelf when PacifiCorp announced in April that it will prolong coal burning, citing regulatory developments that make it viable\u201d\n\n________\n\n\u201cIt found data centers will account for 8 percent of total electricity use in the United States by 2030, a near tripling of their share today. New solar and wind energy will meet about 40 percent of that new power demand from data centers, the forecast said, while the rest will come from a vast expansion in the burning of natural gas. The new emissions created would be comparable to that of putting 15.7 million additional gas-powered cars on the road.\u201d\n\n_____\n\n\n\u201cCritics charge the arrangements often fall short.\n\u201cIf data centers are claiming to be clean, but utilities are using their presence to justify adding more gas capacity, people should be skeptical of those claims,\u201d said Wilson Ricks, an energy systems researcher at Princeton University\u2019s Zero Lab, which focuses on decarbonization.\nOne example is an agreement announced in March, after Amazon signed a contract to buy more than a third of the electricity generated by one of the nation\u2019s largest nuclear facilities, the Susquehanna power plant in Luzerne County, Pa.\n\n\u201cThat deal disturbed a lot of people,\u201d Zubaty said. \u201cWhen massive data centers show up and start claiming the output of a nuclear plant, you basically have to replace that electricity with something else.\u201d\u201d\n\n________\n\n\u201cThe developer of the geothermal plant, Fervo Energy, credits Google with jump-starting a promising energy solution that some day might provide the electricity equivalent of multiple nuclear plants. But Fervo CEO Tim Lattimer acknowledges that kind of output is not likely until well into the 2030s.\n\nFervo\u2019s Nevada plant produces about the amount of power it takes to keep the lights on at a few thousand homes. The next Fervo plant, in Utah, is expected to be fully operational in 2028 and will generate roughly the amount of energy it takes to run one large data center.\u201d\n\n________\n\n\u201cBut there is deep skepticism in the scientific community that Helion or other fusion start-ups will be sending juice to the power grid within a decade, much less the kind of too-cheap-to-meter, safe electricity the tech companies are chasing.\n\u201cPredictions of commercial fusion by 2030 or 2035 are hype at this point,\u201d said John Holdren, a Harvard physicist who was White House science adviser during the Obama era. \u201cWe haven\u2019t even yet seen a true energy break-even where the fusion reaction is generating more energy than had to be supplied to facilitate it.\u201d\n\nPromises that commercial fusion is around the corner, he said, \u201cfeeds the public\u2019s belief in technological miracles that will save us from the difficult task of dealing with climate change \u2026 with the options that are closer to practical reality.\u201d\u201d",

            "There is some big algorithmic trick we're missing. Probably there are many. \n\n  \nOur brains use something like 60 watts of power, yet can perform all sorts of amazing feats. \n\n  \nIt seems reasonable that, eventually, we should be able to run an LLM that is human-level on 60 watts. After all, it doesn't need to be fully embodied and keep a heart beating, it just needs to be an LLM. \n\n  \nIf we hit the wall on energy production, then energy prices should tick up and up and provide an economic incentive to find more power-efficient ways to run the models.",
