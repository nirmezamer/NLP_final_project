If there's a useful resource you feel  would be helpful to have added there, or if you have other suggestions  or issues to discuss with the subreddit moderators, please feel free to [contact us via modmail.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Flimbuscompany)\n\nThere are also a number of helpful guides linked there, which may be of assistance.

Also, **the mods of this subreddit are not paid by ProjectMoon**  \\- we are fans doing this on our own time, so we unfortunately don't  have any more direct means of reporting bugs, issues, or relaying  feedback, than any other player.\n\nThank you.",

        "content": "Hello all. Lately, there has been an upswing of people uploading gameplay and showcases of cosmetically modded Limbus Company content.\n\n***We are disallowing this. Please do not post content discussing/showcasing any type of mods for Limbus Company.*** Our reason for this is because Project Moon has not explicitly said they approve of this, and we don't want to have issues with users modding the game and then getting banned as a result. This issue is especially difficult to navigate because Project Moon has said in a [recent newspost](https://twitter.com/LimbusCompany_B/status/1801104033811448246) that they are using automated checks to determine if people are hacking the game. It is **completely unknown** if these checks will trigger on skin/cosmetic mods, so the mod team has decided it is better to be safe than sorry about this issue.\n\nAs always, if you have any questions, complaints, etc please leave them here or in modmail.",

            "Quick question, in the event that project moon allows for mods, the rule would be reverted right?",
            "I hope PM will allow skin mods. It doesn't affect gameplay at all and isn't a cheat, so I don't think it should be entirely disallowed.",
            "LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOO N- nvm they are only banning actual ingame modded content, tch\n\nhey mods any update to fanmade ID posts? Its literally clogging and drag down the quality of this sub to the point of me NOT wanting to follow nor sub to to the subreddit, and im tired of blocking all of these people that keep spawning just because you \"allowing\" it through the tags. Please, make megathread, make another sub, ANYTHING to contain these people. No hate to them, but im here for LimbusCompany not FanmodCompany.",
            "You are now the r/limbuscompany mod. If anything goes wrong on the subreddit now, the fault lies entirely with you.",
            "Oh yeah definitely lol, my reasoning for banning it completely crumbles if PM says they're fine with it. I just implemented this rule as a safety measure, ideally just for the time being, because the modding is getting more popular and PM is dragging their feet on making a statement about it.",
            "Though you must also keep in mind that gachas typically profit off the sale of cosmetic/aesthetic items. While we don't have unit skins, we do have items like banners that are sold through packs.   \nIt's not unreasonable to assume they will crack down on this at some stage.",
            "I think they are going to ban mods sooner rather than later PM. The problem is that Limbus is a game as a service and gacha. Maybe it's not so bad now that they are just cosmetic mods to existing IDs, but things like creating Fan-IDs or EGOs would be a threat to their business model, which is gacha. Even if it were like other games that sell skins, the mods that are out there now would pose a risk to them in the same way. So they will surely ban any modification to the game.",
            "Thanks for the help, hoping PM sorts this out soon.",
            "What exactly do you mean by fanmade posts? Do you mean like the fanmade ID posts that pop up from time to time? Do you mean non-OC fanart? I want to give you an answer but I am unsure what you're talking about."
