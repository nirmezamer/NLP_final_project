If there's a useful resource you feel  would be helpful to have added there, or if you have other suggestions  or issues to discuss with the subreddit moderators, please feel free to [contact us via modmail.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Flimbuscompany)\n\nThere are also a number of helpful guides linked there, which may be of assistance.

Or are there some important event stories or side stories that are time-limited and unavailable so have to go to YT for those?\n\nAlso, how long do you think it might take to complete the entire story if I'm grinding daily?

Please do not post content discussing/showcasing any type of mods for Limbus Company.*** Our reason for this is because Project Moon has not explicitly said they approve of this, and we don't want to have issues with users modding the game and then getting banned as a result. This issue is especially difficult to navigate because Project Moon has said in a [recent newspost](https://twitter.com/LimbusCompany_B/status/1801104033811448246) that they are using automated checks to determine if people are hacking the game. It is **completely unknown** if these checks will trigger on skin/cosmetic mods, so the mod team has decided it is better to be safe than sorry about this issue.\n\nAs always, if you have any questions, complaints, etc please leave them here or in modmail.",

We assumed that meant that he did so while the sinners were wearing them, but it might just be via his Notebook ... thing. It hadn't occurred to me that the menu page was canon, but Canto VI >!has made it clear that it certainly *could* be.!<\n\nSo all this time I've been gazing at Meursault in various costumes, I guess they've been aware of it. I'm not mad about it.\n\ne: Yi Sang's technology is based on a literal small mirror (or an opaque window) -- so it's totally possible that Dante's notebook has that tech baked into it so he can speak to the other IDs in real time even without the main world sinners being present.",

            "the ability to talk to these alternate selves has been established back in canto IV with yi sang talking to sang yi\n\nand it's already established the IDs are fully aware of what they're doing when possessing people (best example being the erlking himself)\n\nthe dialogue probably is just dante talking to them at a certain day of their life, one where they aren't exactly busy,(otherwise how the hell would maid ryoshu be talking since her post uptie art is effectively her last day alive)",

            "I will quote Dante's notes to answer your question \"Synchronizing the extracted identity with my LCB-PDA and the bus window allowed me to communicate with or feel it, in a way. Calling forth the image of the identity in my mind, I get a sense of understanding as if I'm talking to the Sinner like usual\". So more then likely when Dante calls forth an ID it isn't a one way conversation and the Identity can catch a glimpse into his mirror world as well.",
            "It used to be that every ID would fully replace the sinner, including just on the bus. This can be seen with the launch IDs. For example, in Dantes notes he mentions he learned of the W. Corp singularity from W Don, Faust, and Meur. However, at some point, they changed how IDs work to only be temporary around canto 4. This is the first time in quite a while an ID has spoken directly to Dante by name, and explicitly referred to being brought over to the main world.",
