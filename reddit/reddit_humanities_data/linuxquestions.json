Ones that peaked my interest were immutability and atomic updates. So much so I had decided that my next distro will be something like openSUSE Kalpa or Arkane Linux, unless I figure out a way to setup Arch itself to be immutable and have atomic updates.\n\nAt least for me personally, I see no downside to the safety and robustness these concepts introduce. A minimal, practically unkillable base OS which is built with containers in mind to improve the overall robustness? Hell yeah!\n\nHowever, when I ask about these, I often get comments like \"rolling release and atomic updates are incompatible\", \"back to the wiki, stop imposing on others\", \"this is gonna be a painful experience\".\n\nSo, I genuinely wonder, is there an aspect to these concepts that I don\u2019t know yet that ruins them to the core? Do I not understand something? Thanks.",

One friend backed up a good chunk of their DIY Nas' (I think it might have been a Pi hooked up to a bunch of harddrives, I forget) system settings and files to a second partition and wrote a script so that his linux would overwrite any changes so that it wouldn't care about hard shutdowns, and at the time, in Windows 7, that was not a serious concern unless you were installing a windows update when it happened.\n\nI just put Zorin OS on my desktop, yesterday.\n\nHow big of a concern is that in 2024? Is that still a real concern today, or have the various Linux distros become more resilient in that area since 2014? Do I need to take special steps to prevent major data loss or system corruption in case of power outage?\n\n----------\n\n## **Edit**\nI'm glad to hear it's essentially a nonissue, and back in 2013-2014 the instability my friends were running into may have had something to do with a Pi and SD Cards rather than the file system.
