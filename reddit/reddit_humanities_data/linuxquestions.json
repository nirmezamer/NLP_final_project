            "Recommendations for a distro for my Alienware laptop?\n\nIn 2019 I bought a Alienware 17 R5 i9-8950HK, QHD, GTX 1080OC, 32GB RAM, 256GB SSD+1TB HDD. For $3000 USD. I hate it. I wanted it to be an everything laptop. Games, SteamVR, and the WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). Bad idea. Laptops aren't that expensive. I now wish I'd bought a few cheaper systems for their own purpose. But here I have this expensive ol' thing with pretty OK specs. It's full of Alienware everything. Almost like half Windows 10 Pro, half Alienware. I wanted it to power my Steam VR games with my old Vive Pro. But now I use the Meta Quest 3 and have a desktop that can power Steam VR both on my old timey Vive and on my Quest.  I'm a 20 year developer who existed mostly in the B2B space as CTO of a small company of 10 people. We sold to private equity a couple years ago and I'm now doing a startup. I had an Ubuntu laptop as my main daily computer for about 3 years, and tragically it was stolen about 5 years ago. I seriously think about that laptop a lot. The simplicity. The no BS performance. Living on the command line. Not Windows. Especially not Windows 11.  \nMy usage/wishlist would be:\n\n1. Lots of cloud infrastructure design and building. AWS, Azure, etc. Automation scripts. Nothing performance heavy.\n2. Code reviews. Administrative oversight. Approving merge requests. No Microsoft software except VSCode. For Azure I have a secondary Windows box to do PowerShell and MSSQL if we ever choose to use those. Emails, documents, correspondence.\n3. Steam VR that I occasionally pipe to my Meta Quest via Steam Link. It's fairly supported on Ubuntu.

I would love to utilize my video card and specs because I love to toy with 3D modeling and audio/video production.
