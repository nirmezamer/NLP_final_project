            "the story and music are 10/10",
            "Its an epic cinematic masterpiece. Loved every second of it.",
            "It's honestly fantastic. Take it for what it is and don't compare it to something that it is not and you will thoroughly enjoy it. I wish I could play it again for the first time.",
            "If you love FF, not for it's being JRPG, but loves because it's FF. You'll love this game. I'm not much of an action guy either, but I have a time of my life with this. Hope you have fun too!",
            "This is the first Final Fantasy I ever loved after X, it is one of my top 3 of all time.",
            "FF games have always been known for innovating and advancing with technology and this game definitely continued that legacy with the spectacular boss fights. Youll love it.",
            "Still havent played it yet, bought it when I bought rebirth and dropped 130 hrs into that but its my busy season now",
            "This story is really really good and the soundtrack is amazing. Get ready!!!",
            "Also a long time fan, and I really enjoyed it. The devil may cry combat is a new twist, but the big fights make it worth it. Definitely gonna be difficult to platinum though lol",
            "Pro:first half. Con:second half. Good game all said and done"

        "content": "I have played more than a few of the games but this one truly amazed me. The graphics were out of this world, the story reveals were interesting. I kept wanting to learn more about this world and dont let me get started on the eikon battles, absolute cinema. I was so surprised reading other opinions calling the game bad, it may have had a few down moments but the hype parts that came all made up for it. Easy to say I was very very satisfied playing this game for 60 hours.",

            "I think it's a good action game but received a bad reputation amongst FF fans for some very valid reasons. It is an action adventure game with some very light RPG elements, marketed as an RPG and a mainline entry in one of the most RPG-ish franchises of all time. Fans can't be blamed for expecting more of a, well, final fantasy experience in a final fantasy game. 7 Rebirth I think nailed the sweet spot between the flashy epicness of 16 and an actual RPG with a lot of customisation/party management/strategy, and if FF17 is more like that I think everyone will be pleased.\n\nAgain though, definitely a good game, just marketed to the wrong demographic.",
            "Ive been playing since FFIV on the SNES, and this one has become one of my favorites in the series. I had a blast with the gameplay, loved the story, the voice acting is probably series best, and that OST!!",
            "I keep forgetting this game actually exists because no one speaks about it, still you made me curious about it",
            "Going back to the hub after every freaking mission is okay for an MMO but just such a downer for a single player game. \n\nThe game teases you with a huge amazing world at the start and you basically get to experience none of that. What a disappointment.",
            "Congrats, love this game as well",
            "Every Final Fantasy I've played has highs and lows. It's whether those highs outweigh the low moments and for me, XVI has F*CKING PEAKS, the size of mount Olympus.",
            "For reference, I've played and beaten every final fantasy and most popular games in general.\n\nI think the story here was a great one but I couldn't believe the lack of enemy diversity, fighting the same mobs but with a different coat of paint got so boring and repetitive. The world also felt very empty and dull for over half the game as well.\n\nI ended up Platinuming the game but I definitely think they could have done a better job. I will say the intro/demo is probably the best 2-3 hour intro into a FF game I've ever played though.",
            "Depends on how you view it. I personally did not think the movie part of it was enough to outweigh the atrocious gameplay loop, empty world, and lackluster side quests.\n\n\nAs a game it has many unforgivable problems. At best from a gameplay standpoint it is a half baked DMC, which is where most the hate comes from.\n\n\nIs the movie pretty? Yes, but it is first and foremost a video game.\n\n\nIf XVI was a 3D anime I'd probably rate it an 8-9/10. As a video game it is a 4/10.\n\n\nBut hey if you liked it you liked it, I'm not trying to convince you otherwise. To me after the 2nd time skip and I realized this was everything it was a slog from that point forward until I eventually dropped it during the first Ultima fight.",
            "I thought it was a terrible game. My least favorite FF. \n\nMusic was great though. Looked pretty. Story was ok. I couldnt stand the stretched out pre battle hype talk that Clive did every 5 minutes. \n\nCombat was fun for an hour, but it never felt satisfying. \n\nSide quests were a bore. \n\nGoing anywhere off path was not rewarded, unless you like 3 gil. \n\nCrafting was pointless, the entire game can be beat by buying the next weapon. \n\nBtw, FF6, 7, and 4 are my favorites. Not like theres crafting, or an open world exploration feel. But they still felt so much better, your time was more respected there. \n\n16s filler was trash and brought the entire game down. Felt like a chore to finish.",
            "The highs of this game truly out weight the lows by a lot. This game is worth it for the music and moments alone\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8vkfyqdwkh9d1.jpeg?width=1411&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8c947ab93a6fe2de6b13bb6f5dc98aaa123df325"
