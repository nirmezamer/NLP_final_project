I mean, the NFT thing was announced *well* after they already crashed and were shown to be a scam. Glad to hear them pulling back on the AI craze, but them blindly jumping on that bandwagon without any research or familiarity with it still points to them being clueless.\n\n\nGranted, I think most executives at most companies are idiots mostly risen through nepotism and luck, but I might just be jaded.",
            "Tbf they used AI for the lip movements for different languages in FF7 rebirth and the result was amazing. That\u2019s one good way to utilise AI to save tons of development time",
            "They used AI for the new KH upscaling, and it messed up a lot of textures. And this isn\u2019t their first time\u2026 they tried to use it on chrono cross, and it absolutely ruined some backgrounds",
            "Square Enix's top brass just suck. They're SO unbelievably bad its a wonder how the company is still functioning. They just don't get it. Square Enix's games are successful in spite of its executives not because of it. Have you ever wondered why there's always reports that \\[insert Square Enix game\\] under delivered and was a disappointment to them? Its because their sales target numbers are STUPID. Like unrealistic and stupid. Like they think their games will do as good as Call of Duty and hit THAT level of mainstream, thats how many units they think they're gonna sell. Its impossible for the developers to hit those targets with the types of games they're making.\n\nBut yeah, the ultimate \"Square Enix execs are dumb\" story is definitely just selling off the ENTIRE Tomb Raider franchise to someone else and using that money to get into NFTs, after the NFT fad died down and people realized its worthlessness.",
            "Use of AI in shit like upscaling, mouth animations in sequels, etc that ASSISTS the process and doesn\u2019t full on replace people is a fantastic thing. But\u2026 idk\u2026 I don\u2019t trust square too much\u2026",
            "So... everyone gets this is a song and dance for the investors, right?  Supporting AI, being careful with AI... it's just to appease the stockholders who probably don't even know what the damn acronym stands for.  \n\nOr we could just keep dooming, that's fun too.",
            "Just a reminder that big gaming companies only care about money and they're never on the gamer's side. The whole NFT/blockhain and AI debacle tells how out of touch SE is.",
            "AI is one of those new topics that EVERYONE is looking at implementing different things for. Initially everyone is gun-ho about it. There are Definitely uses for it across the board. However, if not careful, it can screw with a LOT of stuff in the wrong ways. It's not a \"magic hammer\" that can fix a lot of problems. Can it do a lot if implemented correctly? Sure. but again the correct part has to be looked at with research.",
            "SE's top dogs have been saying this stuff about every tech bro fad for years.",
            "Well yeah, most of the big people there consider themselves ARTIST ASS ARTISTS so I'm sure as soon as execs tried making them use ai for the art or writing, theyd probably freak. Plus just seeing the last six months of the majority of their fans begging them not to us ai and already dumping on them for it."
