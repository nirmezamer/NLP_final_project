            "Have fun in the sun!  I always feel a sense of jubilance when I see Mt. Rainier peeking out from a distance while entering I-90 West from I-5 after days of rain/cloud. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin) Also makes me feel less irritated when Im stuck in that forsaken traffic. ",

            "Pic taken on my lunch break. Wild how everything in the city gets 300% better when it's sunny & 70+",
            "Shhhh...no, it's cold and rainy and grey all summer long except when the wildfire smoke engulfs the region for weeks on end and we get a 100+ degree heat dome on us. It's awful. Don't let people come here.",
            "Extremely true. Summers here are gorgeous. At least when the smoke isn't rolling in.",
            "True. There's usually 4 months of great weather, 4 months of good weather and 4 months of not so good weather.\n\nThat's actually as much as most places not in California get. Florida is too hot and rainy for much of the spring and summer. Other places are too cold and snowy.",
            "Yep. Tough to beat Seattle on a summer day.",
            "Portland maybe? Butt I'm biased. West of Cascades, best of cascades regardless. Summer is *perfect* here"

I won\u2019t delve into the details too much but it\u2019s not about the businesses appearance, there are legitimate safety and risk management issues that arise from their presence and it\u2019s simply not a place that tweakers and the mentally ill can exist in so it\u2019s pretty important that they gtfo.\n\nAnyways, every single time I have the exact same experience and I was just hoping if anyone has any advice.\n\nHere\u2019s how it goes:\nIn a respectful, not condescending or rude tone: \u201cHey man sorry we\u2019ve gotta have you keep moving, we can\u2019t have you around here while we\u2019re in operation\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is public property(it\u2019s not)/You\u2019re harassing me(I\u2019ve politely asked you to leave once)/fuck you\u201d\n\nAt this point, the profanity-laden ramblings start every. single. time. They get angry, they throw rocks, they intentionally destroy shit, make death threats, etc. I\u2019ve lived in seattle my whole life so I get the drill and just give myself space and call the cops and eventually the homeless dude gets it out of their system and leaves and then the cops show up three hours later and do fuck all and just ask what they looked like and then I go home and wake up the next day and do it again.\n\nHow the hell do you get these people to just leave? Any thoughts?\n\n\n",

Sometimes you just need to out crazy somebody for them to decide your juice aint worth the squeeze.",
            "I had a guy hanging around and I told him, truthfully, that I had a social worker coming to help him.  I didn't see him again for 3 years.  Checked with the social worker, they never found him.",
            "I did security details around 3rd and pine for about 5 years. I always start with hey are you okay? Once I get a response I turn on the kindness and suggest safer places to be. Pointing in a direction grabs attention while being firm with my last sentence Let me point you in the right direction I am a physically imposing man but Ive always tried to make myself as small as the other person.",
            "Have you tried not being nice? They are expecting you to be timid. They are counting on you to back down. Don't give them that. \n\nPractice your best \"GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE BEFORE WHOOP YOUR ASS\". Even non-vocal animals, like dogs and bears, will back off if you can make yourself threatening enough.",

            "As someone who used to work security downtown, it's often going to immediately turn into yelling as soon as they're confronted(despite being polite, it's how they'll see it). It often helped me to have suggestions of places they can go; shelters, parks, libraries, etc. The recommendation of picking up the phone and going through the routine of a 911 call also usually works pretty well.",
            "Get your cellphone out and faux dial the cops (they're not coming anyway though). Or start recording. Be prepared to run if this escalates their behavior. \n\nThese people are the nastiest, meanest. They always go for the jugular, calling me a gay slur or the n word (I'm white)",
            "\"Hey, you hanging out here so you can get an ambulance ride and spend a few nights in the hospital?\"  \n\nWhen they say no \"well, this is a dangerous spot to hang out because of the work we are doing. You could get fucked up, I don't want to see you get hurt unless you are trying to get hurt, you know?\"",
            "can they just put up a fence or something?",
            "If your workplace is dangerous to have people wander into then there should be fences and security barriers up, as well as clear warning signs about the safety hazards. Idd talk to whoever is in charge of such things at your company."
