I won\u2019t delve into the details too much but it\u2019s not about the businesses appearance, there are legitimate safety and risk management issues that arise from their presence and it\u2019s simply not a place that tweakers and the mentally ill can exist in so it\u2019s pretty important that they gtfo.\n\nAnyways, every single time I have the exact same experience and I was just hoping if anyone has any advice.\n\nHere\u2019s how it goes:\nIn a respectful, not condescending or rude tone: \u201cHey man sorry we\u2019ve gotta have you keep moving, we can\u2019t have you around here while we\u2019re in operation\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is public property(it\u2019s not)/You\u2019re harassing me(I\u2019ve politely asked you to leave once)/fuck you\u201d\n\nAt this point, the profanity-laden ramblings start every. single. time. They get angry, they throw rocks, they intentionally destroy shit, make death threats, etc. I\u2019ve lived in seattle my whole life so I get the drill and just give myself space and call the cops and eventually the homeless dude gets it out of their system and leaves and then the cops show up three hours later and do fuck all and just ask what they looked like and then I go home and wake up the next day and do it again.\n\nHow the hell do you get these people to just leave? Any thoughts?\n\n\n",

Dow wants several more billions of dollars, for the purpose of doing the same exact things he's been doing for the last decade on a grander scale.\n\nThe only way you can argue that he's focused on results is if the result he's concerned with is keeping homelessness in everybody's face so that they'll keep approving new taxes and levies and the goverment has a bottomless and ever-escalating revenue stream in perpetuity.

It is posturing their ideals for their followers.

No one knows! Or it is completely ass backwards evangelical bullshit locking down women\u2019s bodies, forcing gays back into the closet and encouraging bigotry- but at least they are actually acknowledging the homeless DO cause harm to the neighborhoods they inhabit?
