I just graduated from college, so I'm not making a ton of money right so I don't want to pay to be apart of it. I'm looking for a community of writers who are kinda crazy (the kind that love magical realism) and are open-minded/non-judgemental. A group that shares work, reads books and reflects together, etc. I live in Park Slope right now but am open to commuting too. Does anyone know of such communities?\n\nThank you!",

It seems like there are constantly a few people outside the hotel smoking cigarettes that seem like addicts and yesterday one of them became aggressive for no reason as I walked by with my girlfriend and accused me of touching my dick and looking at him (which would be gay and apparently worth beating the shit out of someone for, according to this man).\n\nWas just curious what this place actually is.",

            "It is what used to be referred to as a \u201cwelfare\u201d hotel and it\u2019s been that way for at least 30 years since noticed it was there . Many formerly fancy hotels ended up this way the St. George In Brooklyn heights was one until the late 90s , there used to be a few on Atlantic by Barclays",
            "It's pretty much always been contracted by the City as a shelter of one sort or another.",
            "I had to stay there last fall when I had to move out of my longtime apartment after my landlord died and I did not have a new apartment and was getting over Covid (I was in a more expensive hotel in downtown Brooklyn but then had to downgrade). I was a little concerned at first and yeah it had its quirks but it was okay. The rooms are nicer than the service, but, once you accept that, it\u2019s basically okay. I didn\u2019t interact with other guests. I didn\u2019t see anyone smoking cigarettes or who seemed like addicts outside. They sort of skate by viewing themselves as a \u201cbudget hotel\u201d like you shouldn\u2019t expect too many towels. That was annoying. I was nervous at first but then I got used to it. It seems to me like a place people go when they need a budget hotel. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s far worse. And apparently some of the other hotels nearby cost like $350+ a night and are totally loud party hotels according to one of the staff there.",
            "I used to live right there and often wondered this. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a shelter, I think it\u2019s just a shitty hotel masquerading as a trendy one. It seems like it\u2019s designed to be a tourist trap.\n\nIt\u2019s also around the corner from the soup kitchen so you\u2019re gonna get some homeless people hanging about. Most of them are harmless though. Sorry about your experience",
            "It\u2019s most likely being used as a shelter. Almost all smaller hotels are now contracted by the city to house homeless or migrants. There was an article recently about someone in queens who was getting many lucrative contracts from the city to turn their hotels into shelters.",
            "And before you ask, of course I wasn't touching my dick.  I was licking my lips and rubbing my nips.",
