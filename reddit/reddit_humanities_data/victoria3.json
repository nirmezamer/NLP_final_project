            "How hard it was to implement remote ownership? (Like manor houses)\nAlso, how are you doing? :)",
            "Which feature you really wanted to implement but you had to cut from the final product?\n\nEDIT: \"final product\" = 1.7 patch and SoI DLC, to be clear",
            "the biggest feature I want to see is a Treaty system that allows for more complicated agreements even if conflict doesn't occur. So my question is are there any plans to make such a system for treaties allowing for more realistic treaties and who knows what else if it's done well?",
            "What do you feel were the most important improvements in 1.7?  Has there been anything that has worked better than expected or the team is particularly proud of?  Generalist Gaming says the late game performance is vastly improved, so I'm certainly looking forward to that...",
            "Economic Dependency seems to be based solely on consumer goods, which imo is a missed opportunity to simulate economic dependence on raw resources/produced goods which are needed for their buildings, which are still important. Are there any plans to maybe include the goods buildings require as part of Economic Dependency, maybe on a lower modifier?",
            "How does the ai handle the creation of new power blocs? Specifically what I am curious about is how they decide their central identity pillar and name. Does a France with Napoleon III form the French Empire power bloc, and does a Japan form a Co-Prosperity Sphere, or do they have default names?\n\nAlso, is the ai inclined to destroy a power bloc in case of a regime change in order to create a new bloc? (Say that Britain transitions to a council republic, will they still be the British Empire?)",
            "In what ways is the AI changed? \nI expect that now AI nations will use the new features added to the game, but does it have some interesting consequences a player would see in a playthrough that you would like to point out?",
            "Do you guys ever plan on making \"International Treaties\" for power blocs. Like: \"No Chemical Warfare\"",
            "On behalf of someone else:\n\u201cCan manor houses or financial centers buy levels of urban centers and trade centers?\u201d",
            "Is there going to be new journal entries in the update or in the future updates? Mostly i am interested in journal entries regarding Hungary (there is great potential in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 story wise) ."

You can have places like a single Chinese province grow 150 tea, enough for the whole world.",

            "Yeah, it is really weird. For example, Russia by the middle of the 19th century imported nearly 4,8 million kgs of tea. And, by 1901, this number increased to 24,5 million kgs. And I am talking only leaf tea. It was so huge that 1/4 of all tariff income was from tea (it fluctuated, but was around that size from 1890 to 1913).",

            "They should add a drinks need that is made up by coffee thee and sugar. Maybe add soft drinks as well that are produced in food industries using fruit sugar and sulphur. It should kick in from SoL 10."
