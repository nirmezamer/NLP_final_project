            "What do you feel were the most important improvements in 1.7?  Has there been anything that has worked better than expected or the team is particularly proud of?  Generalist Gaming says the late game performance is vastly improved, so I'm certainly looking forward to that...",

Are there any plans to maybe include the goods buildings require as part of Economic Dependency, maybe on a lower modifier?",
            "How does the ai handle the creation of new power blocs? Specifically what I am curious about is how they decide their central identity pillar and name. Does a France with Napoleon III form the French Empire power bloc, and does a Japan form a Co-Prosperity Sphere, or do they have default names?\n\nAlso, is the ai inclined to destroy a power bloc in case of a regime change in order to create a new bloc? (Say that Britain transitions to a council republic, will they still be the British Empire?)",

After the death of his daughter Mary the territories became part of the Habsburg domain and the rest, as they say, is history. \n\nI think during WWII some Belgian fascists wanted to recreate this great Burgundian state with the Low Countries at its centre, but I\u2019m not entirely sure about that."

        "title": "Discrimination in Vic3 is unrealistic and ahistorical.",
        "score": 119,
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/victoria3/comments/1dqwyer/discrimination_in_vic3_is_unrealistic_and/",
        "content": "Title, the way the game handles discrimination and discriminated pops makes no sense whatsoever and makes some nations fundamentally not work or resemble their historical counterparts whatsoever, especially not with the new system of manor houses etc. \n\nTake the Boer republics as an example. In the case of Transvaal (or the South African Republic as it was called irl), white people were the *only ones* allowed to own land and be citizens. This should mean that in spite of Boers being a minority, they still have the vast majority of power and wealth. Before the new update and SoI dropped, this was somewhat replicated in-game by most of the already existing farms having Boers employed as aristocrats, but now with the new system wherein nations start with manor houses, Sothos (a discriminated pop) make up the majority of the aristocrats in Transvaal in 1836.\n\nThis in turn leads to other problems, like because they have by far the biggest upper strata population they have more political strength than the only group that was even allowed to be citizens of the republic. Something about the ownership shares and discriminated pops earning more money than accepted pops also means that their Standard of Living is much higher (while the accepted pops quite often literally have lower SoL than the slaves they own) and regardless of education law, they actually end up having higher education access than the accepted pops (despite the fact that discrimination is meant to massively impact education access), which ultimately means they\u2019ll have way more qualified pops to fill any new aristocrat jobs created throughout the game. This only serves to widen the gap and make the problem more and more severe as the game goes on.\n\nI get that simulating the level of discrimination found in the Boer republics is neither very appealing nor realistic for most countries (wherein the meaning of \u201cdiscriminated\u201d is less harsh, if still bad) in the game, but with the way the system currently works it gives an idea of the Boer republics that\u2019s entirely opposed to reality. It paints the picture of black Africans as one of, if not *the* main perpetrators of slavery and exploitation in South Africa during this period, as well as giving the impression that they had any kind of influence or power over the white-only political system. \n\nThere should realistically be different levels of severity to discrimination, because the nature of discrimination varied wildly across different countries, and those variations played a huge role in shaping said countries. Whereas in some places it would be harder for a discriminated person to become rich and powerful, in other places it was literally impossible or against the law.\n\nSo to summarize, I think the discrimination system in Vic3 is broken, particularly so with the new SoI system of manor houses employing aristocrats. Realistically, in a place like Transvaal, there\u2019s no way discriminated pops should be able to be the largest landowner group, have the highest education access and political strength, let alone have any amount of those whatsoever. It\u2019s a complete misrepresentation of the actual social mobility and political influence afforded to black South Africans at this time, which was basically less than zero irl. It should be reworked to allow for different severities of discrimination, which could be a lot more historically accurate in all countries (like the US, for instance, because historically the discrimination faced by black people and native Americans was not the same).",

            "Boer republics is a very specific scenario but I do agree with you somewhat. Imho, there should be a new law category for \"Permitted Ownership\" which reflects what pops are permitted to have shares from businesses, be it only your culture, culturally similar, your religion or whatever.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Fwiw improving culture and discrimination, particularly adding a separation between legal and non-legal discrimination is in the roadmap, so it's something they're definitely working on",

Perhaps the culture of the people in Manor Houses/Financial districts was simply set to be proportional to the population of the state they're in, since it's ultimately a pretty small detail.\n\nMaybe a law that outlaws ownership by discriminated cultures could be an interesting addition for colonial countries, but for most countries the current system were discriminated pops receive debuffs to wages, political power and qualifications already does a decent job at preventing scenarios like the one you describe.",
            "Not to mention the questionable assimilation mechanic being arguably backwards",
            "I'm more amused by the Russian Empire with Russian national supremacy. Historically, before Alexander II and III, the Russian Empire in fact discriminated only against Russians, who were mostly powerless slaves on the plantations of the landlords, while the most privileged aristocrats and numerous in the highest government were the Ostsee Germans. Very amusing to see the North Germans discriminated against in the Russian Empire of 1836! Not to mention that the \"Romanovs\" were actually the North German Holstein-Gottorp dynasty. You can notice this when you look even at the Russian characters presented at the beginning of the game, like Beckendorf. And there are so many examples of this. Even the famous Russian general Ermolov at a meeting with the Emperor of Holstein-Gottorp asked him how he could become a German. And also on the territory of the Ostsee provinces did not apply the laws of the Russian Empire, which actually makes them not a puppet, but a dominion.\n\nI think this will be fixed with a mod if the developers continue to present Gottorp Russia as a Russian nationalist empire that can't invite any agitators to join due to cultural discrimination.",

            "Yeah well it's a game first. I for once think it's entirely unrealistic the way they keep productivity under council republics the same as it is under a profit-based system, showing zero awareness of \"post-money\" societies as they existed. \n\nHowever, I concede they adhere to a materialist view of the economy, and under a materialist views of course worker ownership is the endgame. \n\nSo yeah. It's a game. They make gameplay choices and adjust the historiagraphy to match their vision, and that's ok. It's a game after all. And after playing SoI I think it's a great game",
