        "content": "Hi friends,\n\nAfter hearing your feedback and having discussions within the mod team, we've decided to do away with the megathread. It was originally put in place to corral posts on our most frequently repeated topics: medication, diagnoses/\"Do I have ADHD?\", and hormones. We've heard from many of you (and seen for ourselves!) that the megathread is unruly, difficult to search, and at times feels like yelling into the void. Thus, we are saying goodbye to the megathread and allowing general posts on these topics once again.\n\nWe've taken the following steps to support the thread's removal:\n\n* Removed the rule and report reason related to the megathread.\n* Added new post flairs to cover the topics from the megathread: Diagnosis, Medication & Side Effects, and ADHD & Hormone-Related Issues.\n* Removed the automod rules that were delaying posts for review if they contained keywords related to the megathread topics (if you've had a post delayed in the last few weeks - this is likely why!).\n\nWe'll be sure to monitor this change and are willing to re-evaluate and/or explore some alternative options if repeated topics become a major complaint. Please feel free to [share your feedback](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/adhdwomen) with us as the change takes place!\n\nAnd finally, if you'd like to revisit the megathread, you can find it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/wcr9dy/faq_megathread_ask_and_answer_medication/).\n\nHave a great rest of the week!",

What sparked me writing this is the second episode Killing Eve where Eve goes to speak with Carolyn Martens and Carolyn says \u201cI\u2019m not very good at \u201c\u2018How are you?\u2019 etcetera so I\u2019m just gonna dive in.\u201d and this literally made me pause and put my head in my hands because I wish I could say this to people \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d thats exactly how I feel. \n\nI\u2019ve always felt an aversion to this kind of greeting. I wish we could just say \u201cHello!\u201d \u201cHi!\u201d and move on. \n\nIt\u2019s always felt awkward and forced. I wish I could skip it \ud83d\ude2d I never ask, I\u2019m always being asked and then feel pressured to return the question. And I do because I don\u2019t want to seem like a dick. \n\nThe root of my dislike is that there\u2019s really only one right answer people want- variations of well, good, fine, alright- and if you say any other than, then it becomes a *thing*. Rarely does anyone actually want to know how you are, it\u2019s just a thing we say. And I\u2019m so tired of wasting my breath. It\u2019s empty. It\u2019s theater. If I don\u2019t have anything to say or if I don\u2019t mean something then I won\u2019t say it. But if I don\u2019t engage in this with people, strangers, cashiers, coworkers, etc. then I\u2019d be rude. Idk. It\u2019s always bothered me. Anyways, back to Killing Eve! Lol ",

It's great \n\nWhat I do REALLY hate is that good morning is a perfectly normal thing to say, but good afternoon/good evening sound pretentious as fuck. I work night shift, wtf am I supposed to say thats proper at 1am? Good morrow ole chap!? I just say good morning no matter what time of day it is and watch people's wheels turn ",
            "you dont have to respond in the Right Way. spice it up.",
            "I never saw the point of these either...until the pandemic forced me to spend two years basically in my own house, with no one to talk to except my immediate family. And it turned out one of the things I missed the most, was small talk! Trips to the grocery store became purely transactional when nobody talked to each other, and work meetings were straight to the point, with no \"how was your weekend\" or chatting about the weather. It was awful. \n\nIt turns out that superficial connections matter just as much as deep ones. By definition, most of the people in your life are *not* your nearest and dearest - they can't be, because then everybody would be the same and you wouldn't have nearest and dearest at all. Most people have an A group of close family and best friends; several B groups of neighbours and work friends and gym friends; and a lot of individual C people - the clerk at the grocery store, the bus driver you always say hello to, that one friend of a friend who you can never remember their name but they've always seemed really nice. Those groups each have their own function, and they're all important in their own way.",
            "I just left a call center type job and my number one pet peeve was when I would answer the phone with Thank you for calling [business], how can I help you? And the caller would respond with Hi, how are you? JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION SO WE CAN BOTH MOVE ON WITH OUR LIVES.\n\nOn the other hand, Im really bad at small talk so having this script can be useful sometimes.",
            "I usually just start telling them how I actually am... Realize halfway through but it's too late now, you are getting to hear it now. And I might even forget to ask you the same!",
            "I hate it when I call someone to say something important that I know I will forget if I stop thinking about it for 1 second. I have called people to tell them something and instead I end up forgetting after the 'hello how are you's and we just make smalltalk, only to remember again the next day or sth. Just let me tell you what I called you for and then we can make smalltalk.",
            "I agree. I have a few friends that will strike up conversations like this over messenger. Like, fuck off if you don't have something you actually need to say. Awkward small talk is for when you run into people. It'd uncomfortable. You don't message someone to initiate it on purpose!"

        "content": "But I was dead wrong. \n\nI can now understand what he meant by that, cos YEAH! Literally life changing! \n\nI cant believe I've lived 34 years not feeling this way, and looking back, no wonder i felt as awful and unwell as i did. My mind was chaos!!\n\nI initially struggled when my gp brought up adhd to me. Then I struggled accepting the psychiatrist's diagnosis of adhd. Surely it was just anxiety. That's what I've been told my whole life.\n\nBut nope! I don't have anxiety. I'm not depressed. I have adhd. And I'm so f*cking proud of myself when I look back on what I've accomplished and done whilst dealing with all the things going on in my head, being unintentionally gaslit into thinking I should be able to deep-breathe my way into calm. Why couldn't i??\n\nNow, I actually can deep-breathe my way out of anxiety when it pops up at times when you would expect it. Its quite easy lol.\n\nI just wanted to share this cos I was hugely sceptical and wary. I hated the thought of being on meds my whole life, and I was very untrusting of my doctors. \n\nAnd here I am. I feel calm. Peaceful. Content. So much happier. So much more confident. Easy going. All the qualities I have fought against myself my whole life to try to be. And with one little Vyvanse pill a day, I am that person. \n\nNow, I don't hate myself. I don't blame myself for everything. I don't feel like a failure or a loser just for existing. The intense emotions are gone, its just.. peace. \n\nSo I accept it now and I have thanked my doctors for persevering with me through this. \n\nAnd for anyone starting out and unsure why the meds aren't life changing from the first dose - it took me awhile to get to the right dosage. So it wasn't instant, which worried me cos others often posted that from day 1 they felt better. I started low, working up and even though it was good on lower doses, once I got to this current dose, the real improvements started ie. Very very clear thinking. \n\nAbsolute best of luck to anyone starting their journey. ",

I was 38 when I finally got diagnosed (thanks Obamacare, because I was *literally* avoiding diagnosis/\"having a pre existing condition\" until then), it's been a half dozen years medicated - the change in my brain from \"gigantic tornado of thoughts & ideas continually internally roaring, while I REACT to everything I absolutely *have* to in the real world\"\n\n\nto\n\n\n\"background commentary of thoughts & ideas still plays (at a reasonable volume), but I now have the bandwidth to do the self care stuff, *finish* (a lot more of) what I start & and *not* just let every thought I have fall out of my mouth\"\n\n\nthat change has been such a relief.\n\n\nEspecially helps because I'm in full blown medical menopause & the hormone wonkiness is hitting me *really similar* to how puberty used to, oof",
