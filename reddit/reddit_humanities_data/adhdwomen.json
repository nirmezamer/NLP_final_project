        "content": "Hi friends,\n\nAfter hearing your feedback and having discussions within the mod team, we've decided to do away with the megathread. It was originally put in place to corral posts on our most frequently repeated topics: medication, diagnoses/\"Do I have ADHD?\", and hormones. We've heard from many of you (and seen for ourselves!) that the megathread is unruly, difficult to search, and at times feels like yelling into the void. Thus, we are saying goodbye to the megathread and allowing general posts on these topics once again.\n\nWe've taken the following steps to support the thread's removal:\n\n* Removed the rule and report reason related to the megathread.\n* Added new post flairs to cover the topics from the megathread: Diagnosis, Medication & Side Effects, and ADHD & Hormone-Related Issues.\n* Removed the automod rules that were delaying posts for review if they contained keywords related to the megathread topics (if you've had a post delayed in the last few weeks - this is likely why!).\n\nWe'll be sure to monitor this change and are willing to re-evaluate and/or explore some alternative options if repeated topics become a major complaint. Please feel free to [share your feedback](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/adhdwomen) with us as the change takes place!\n\nAnd finally, if you'd like to revisit the megathread, you can find it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/wcr9dy/faq_megathread_ask_and_answer_medication/).\n\nHave a great rest of the week!",

I've been on wellbutrin for 2 years and after an incident at work I decided to press for something more effective. \n\nOne place won't fill it because my doctor is 3 hours away, another won't because they want to see other medications fail first, and the other said they dont have it. Meanwhile,  I'm 34 years old, eating compulsively, spending compulsively, STRUGGLING at work and struggling to keep my house clean enough to keep the bugs out, no time for my child because I'm working so much to pay for my stupid credit card debt I've accrued because I can't follow a budget to save my life. I'm getting so fat! And I thought that relief was in sight. Waiting on something that may completely change my executive function is torture. \n\nThis is awful. ADHD has affected my life in so many ways, and I didn't even know that was why everything was so hard. I finally got diagnosed two years ago, and everything is still so hard and I'm so sick of waiting for reprieve.",

America\u2019s health system is too fucked up for that to be a requirement.  \n\n\nAlso confused about the pharmacy wanting to see you use other meds first. That\u2019s literally not their job?",
            "Do you live in the US? If so, I recommend asking your doctor to send your prescription to Costco. Several of the pharmacies in my town would also not fill my prescription but Costco does. My insurance also does not cover Adderall for adults so I also have to ask for generic.",
            "A pharmacy refusing to fill because they want to see other meds fail first is ..wierd to me. Seems like overstepping? I am so so sorry. I feel for you. I really do. \nI went 8 years being unable to get my ADHD treated properly. All that my psych would give me is stratterra because he was uncomfortable prescribing stimulants to anyone, and would often lecture me that there is a direct pipeline between being prescribed stimulants, and becoming a drug addict. Like, to street drugs. Stratterra works for some people and that's great! For them. For me it massively increased my depression and suicidal tendencies, and searching for dopamine wherever I could find it  It wasn't till I moved across the country I could get a doctor to actually prescribe me medication that works and I'm on Vyvanse and Adderall combo and it works wonders WHEN I CAN FILL THE PRESCRIPTION. no problem during the shortage for the first 8 months I was prescribed. Now I'm waiting an extra two weeks minimum sometimes way longer between fills because my pharmacy can't get them and all the progress I made seems to be slipping away, to the point I wanna see if doc will switch me to something else",
            "I'm also confused about how a pharmacy can refuse to fill a prescription for those reasons...\n\nI get mine filled at Kroger because no other pharmacy in my area has adderall in stock consistently. I had to call a lot of pharmacies to find this one.",

I\u2019m sorry for what you\u2019re going through, OP, I hope you find a solution asap!",

            "Not sure if you have yet, but try a hospital pharmacy. Mine is open 24 hours, and almost always has my medication either same day or the next day if they have to order it.\nIf the script is written as brand only, maybe theyd be more amenable to dispense a generic instead? (If its about the cost to the insurance company)",

            "I experience this and bouts of hypersexuality. Since we\u2019ve been trying to conceive theres been a motivation beyond feeling \u201csexy\u201d to at least attempt. What ive learnt is that theres not a lack of sex drive in me. Im easily suggestible and easily aroused (sorry tmi) but the problem is i can easily forget sex exists when other things take precedence in my mind. \n\nSo to get in the right mood, i need to think about sex as a planned thinking activity. It feels strange to need to be so planned with it but lust is a fleeting feeling for me until its not. \n\nPlus add in antidepressants and a mix of dissociation and i have an uphill battle to stay aroused. So i guess there stopped being an incentive until wanting a baby.",

It\u2019s so hard for me to get in the mood and even if I\u2019m in the mood, my concentration is garbage. I almost always need to have music on to help distract me.

Times of hyposexuality, times of hypersexuality (though more the former than the latter). \n\nOne thing I sort of accidentally discovered was, uh, kink. Specifically, for me, I found out that I enjoy impact play and, idk what to call it but \u201csensation play\u201d in general. Crops, flogs, massages, ice, candle wax\u2026basically I\u2019ve found that it snatches my ADHD attention by giving me something novel and interesting to *physically feel* and that kind of grounds me in the moment a lot better and gets me ready for sex much more quickly and effectively than anything else I\u2019ve done. OBVIOUSLY ymmv but I was really pleasantly surprised by this and I\u2019m planning to expand out into sensation *restriction* like playing with blindfolds and earplugs and stuff to see if that also works. \n\nAlso, I have been reading a lot of romance books in the last couple years, and I\u2019m a subscriber to Quinn Audio - both of those as \u201chobbies\u201d I guess keep sex a little closer to the forefront of my mind.
