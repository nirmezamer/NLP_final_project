            "Looks great, the only nitpick for me is probably the pitch-black hair blob. Maybe try some lighting/shading ? It's stylized too, but general purpose maybe the neck area complete black areas might use a bit lighter shades ?\n\nObv don't take this as a good critique tho, i'm quite shallow at art",
