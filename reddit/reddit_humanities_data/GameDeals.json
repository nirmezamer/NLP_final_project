You can choose to live solely by making game engines. You can also choose to try and make the perfect game, and even the more-than-perfect game. \nPlus City Game Studio takes up the history of video games. The crash of 1983, or the console wars of the 90s... And that's what Software Inc lacks, I think. Here, at least, we're in the game creation business, and we're reliving the history of video games. No kidding, negotiating with console manufacturers is really cool, and brings games to life.\n\nI tried to keep it short."
