            "I'm considering picking this up for when I eventually get a VR but at this point I'm not sure if I ever am going to.  With how much stuff is exclusive to each platform, it's quite frustrating to want to buy any of them.  I want to play resident evil but it's only on Playstation. I want to play some of the Jurassic park ones but they're only on meta.  So I'm afraid of everything I buy is going to be locked out of the other platforms.  \n\nIt's a good bundle. I'm just griping on the current state of VR gaming.",
