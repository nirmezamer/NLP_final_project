            "Yes. \n(And if that seems like too narrow a reason to invest, remember that you can do BotW and then when you\u2019re done, TotK. \nAnd if you need more convincing, ok add one more game- Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, say. Thousand hours of entertainment right there between just those games, done!)",
            "I bought mine more than 5 years ago just to play botw and I had never been a gamer. It was worth it.\u00a0",
            "I do think it\u2019s worth it. But there are a ton of fantastic games I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll end up checking out too.",
            "I mean itswhy I bought my Switch but there's so much more than just Zelda",
            "Switch OLED would be a great Zelda machine.  No need to wait on new hardware - the games run amazing on the current console",
            "I originally bought a switch just to play BOTW so I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth it especially since getting TOTK",
            "If you\u2019re truly getting it just for BOTW, you can get a used Wii U for pretty cheap and run it on that. But I\u2019ll bet that once you play BOTW you\u2019ll want to play TOTK (which you should), so short answer, yes, go for it"
