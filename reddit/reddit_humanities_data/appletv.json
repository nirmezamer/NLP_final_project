Besides, Microsoft might be bringing all Xbox games to the cloud this year so Apple TV would be even more useful. \n\n  \n",

I bought a Sonos beam gen 2 however returned it after numerous issues. I was looking around for other soundbars when it hit me, if I get an Apple TV 4K plus air pod max would I be able to use them together and access Dolby atmos? \n\nI\u2019m aware this is more expensive solution to a dedicated soundbar however I live in a flat with kids above and below me and can\u2019t blast loud content at night. \n\nSo in theory my setup would be\nPro max -> Apple TV -> TV over eARC \nA PS5 would be connected to the tv aswell for 4k blu rays \n\n\nHow are the pro max for film Dolby atmos content? I currently have air pods pro 2 and always impressed with how they sound on my iPhone through Apple Music \n\n\nEdit: my two main options are the setup above \nOr alternatively Harmon/kardon",

            "I use my AirPods Max in the evenings sometimes and they sound awesome with the AppleTV. Both for music and videos. The surround sound effect is very convincing. They will provide a more convincing surround effect than a sound bar. But not as much as a properly set up and calibrated atmos speaker system with ceiling speakers etc. \n\nThe downside is needing to charge them and wear them. Whereas a sound bar or speaker system is justalways there.",
            "AirPods Max headphones (they are called AirPods Max not pro max) sound incredible while watching movies and television with AppleTV. You will not be disappointed. \n\nIf you go cheap and want to buy a $300 used pair, dont do it. There are a lot of fakes out there at places like EBay and Facebook Marketplace. Buy them new directly from Apple, Amazon, CostoCo, Target or Best Buy.",
            "Or two of the big HomePods.",
            "Thank you for the insight. \nI do plan on investing in a proper atmos system in a few years when I have a larger space just for now I just want to enjoy atmos content at night without disturbing the neighbours. I think Ive convinced my self with this and go through with the pro max and Apple TV combo. \n\nI am torn between this and grabbing a Harmon/kardon MultiBeam 1100 for 290 pounds but it would barely fit with my setup"

Lots of apps have this navigation bar on the top which I really like. The animations are the same from app to app, which isn\u2019t the case for Tizen. On tizen some apps have good animations (Netflix, Youtube) and some have bad animations (Max, Amazon). The only app with bad animations on my apple TV was Plex. The slight glow and tilt when you select something and slightly rub your finger on the touch surface is a nice too. The remote is extremely uncomfortable and weirdly laid out tho.  I swear, the edges can cut vegetables. I\u2019m thinking about getting a case for this thing. I wish the buttons were smaller.",

            "Smart TVs are notoriously underpowered. AppleTV is a premium stand-alone device with dedicated internal memory.",
            "Part of the reason is because the AppleTV has a seriously fast processor in it. Made possible because of Apples decades-long investment in their own chip fabrication and supply chain. They basically put last years iPhone processors in the AppleTV for a low cost. \n\nBut its also because Apple actually care about user experience. They figured out in the 1980s that years user experience is a competitive advantage.",
            "Im not sure exactly what type of processor the TV has, but I imagine it is nowhere near the power of an Apple TV. That is the primary reason for everything running smoother.\n\nAlso, as others said, the apps being optimized for the Apple TV go a long way.",
            "Forgive for the retelling of history but Apples emphasis on consistency dates back to the original Macintosh. Apple provided a toolbox of interface routines in ROM. It was much easier for a developer to use the toolbox to implement, say, a scroll bar in the way Apple recommended than to code their own. Add to that the fact that reviewers of Mac software brutally criticized apps that deviated from the Apple Interface Guidelines.  Windows followed suit attempting to be more consistent but to this day have not achieved the consistency found in Apple products. Thats not to say there are no inconsistencies in Apple products, there are too many.",

My theater needed a shield pro which is supposed to be the closest but it was trashed compared.   Love being in closed controlled eco systems on my pointless tech devices.
