        "content": "I\u2019ve been using the Apple TV for the past 3 days. the animations and the overall look are extremely consistent. Lots of apps have this navigation bar on the top which I really like. The animations are the same from app to app, which isn\u2019t the case for Tizen. On tizen some apps have good animations (Netflix, Youtube) and some have bad animations (Max, Amazon). The only app with bad animations on my apple TV was Plex. The slight glow and tilt when you select something and slightly rub your finger on the touch surface is a nice too. The remote is extremely uncomfortable and weirdly laid out tho.  I swear, the edges can cut vegetables. I\u2019m thinking about getting a case for this thing. I wish the buttons were smaller.",

            "Smart TVs are notoriously underpowered. AppleTV is a premium stand-alone device with dedicated internal memory.",
            "Apple\u2019s magic I guess.",
            "I\u2019m not sure exactly what type of processor the TV has, but I imagine it is nowhere near the power of an Apple TV. That is the primary reason for everything running smoother.\n\nAlso, as others said, the apps being optimized for the Apple TV go a long way.",
            "Part of the reason is because the AppleTV has a seriously fast processor in it. Made possible because of Apple\u2019s decades-long investment in their own chip fabrication and supply chain. They basically put last year\u2019s iPhone processors in the AppleTV for a low cost. \n\nBut it\u2019s also because Apple actually care about user experience. They figured out in the 1980s that years user experience is a competitive advantage.",
            "Forgive for the retelling of history but Apple\u2019s emphasis on consistency dates back to the original Macintosh. Apple provided a \u201ctoolbox\u201d of interface routines in ROM. It was much easier for a developer to use the toolbox to implement, say, a scroll bar in the way Apple recommended than to code their own. Add to that the fact that reviewers of Mac software brutally criticized apps that deviated from the Apple Interface Guidelines.  Windows followed suit attempting to be more consistent but to this day have not achieved the consistency found in Apple products. That\u2019s not to say there are no inconsistencies in Apple products, there are too many.",
            "Remember your aunts old Hewlet Packard? They took it out the dump and put the cpu in your tv.",
            "Apple has style guides that 3rd party apps should adhere to. 3rd party developers know how important that is to Apple customers. Android/Tizen customers tend to not care so the developers don't care either.",
            "A weight silicone slip cover does wonders on the Apple remotes.  Yeah I\u2019ve been using Apple TVs for years and hate having to use anything else. My theater needed a shield pro which is supposed to be the closest but it was trashed compared.   Love being in closed controlled eco systems on my pointless tech devices.   Let them function how they are supposed to.",
            "My Bravia's Plex app does an infinitely better job processing mkv files than my Apple TV. It can handle 50GB files that choke the ATV. Same with my new TCL. And the apps on my Comcast box are more than adequate. I find myself using my ATV less and less.",
            "Assuming OP has Apple TV 4K Gen 3, that little box is crazy overpowered for media playback with A15 chips..even without Apple\u2019s optimization the raw power alone will eat those smart TV chips alive like potato chips lol"
