            "Hello, we have a Galaxy A90 5G (SM-A908N) secondhand bought from South Korea. i've already confirmed that LTE is usable in my country. 5G is a different matter as our area currently isnt within 5G coverage. Now I'm wondering if there's anything I should do before and after factory resetting the device? I've atleast memorized the path to the language settings to change it back to English and there's also the matter with samsung account. This device isnt planned, just something someone I know felt like buying unaware of the variants and country compatibility.",
            "The phone should be factory reset in the settings and not the recovery."

            "be interesting to see exactly what is being released.   The only device I might be interested in is the ring.   If it has the ability to make mobile payments, I will most likely get it.  If not, forget it.",
            "No subscription for the ring\ud83e\udd1e",
            "I'm excited for the ring, but I refuse to buy If there's a monthly subscription",
            "This year I\u2019m focused on the Z flip 6, watch 7, and the ring. Perhaps buds pro 3 but I\u2019m ok without an upgrade from the pro 2 unless I get a sweet deal. The wife already said she\u2019s buying me the ring if it\u2019s under $500 haha",
            "What all are we expecting here? S25 is definitely another half a year away since the 24 line was announced in January. The ring will definitely be something I'm interested in but I'd really like to see some updates to the WearOS for watches.",
            "Do you guys think they'll be announcing the Galaxy Buds 3 pro? I need to buy new earbuds but i want to wait until they release just because its been about 3 years since the buds 2 released",
            "The desired s24 ultra camera update that has been delayed since April? Haha",
            "If they put dex on the flip I'm getting it. Gotta be one of three people on the planet with this opinion",
            "I love my Watch 4 Classic but feel it's definitely time for an upgrade. I want to check out the new Buds Pro too. The 2 Pros have been fantastic, so I'm hopeful we get a pretty cool upgrade!",
            "So far the rumours about Z Fold 6 cameras aren't encouraging. I hope the camera quality will be more in line with the S24 Ultra's."

            "We had s21 ultra and it said no sim.  We took to att and they replaced the sim and nope. No sim\n..",
            "Oh my gosh! I had the same problem! I was worried I was going to have to get a new phone, but thankfully, getting an e-sim worked so my phone is still functional. Interesting to know I wasn't the only one.",
            "I remember one Mrwhosetheboss video about this exact issue with Samsung smartphones. Batteries suddenly started to get inflated but only for the devices which aren't in use.",
            "Can't you just flash older firmware? I was able to flash multiple firmware on my S23, but I didn't have any problems on the phone. \n\n\nMy first flash was to see if I could make my carrier unlocked phone a factory unlocked phone. It worked perfectly,  then decided to see what would happen flashing previous firmware again worked perfectly. \n\nI have flashed 4 different firmware on my phone all went well. \n\nSo I know S23 will flash different firmware without any problems, don't know about older phones. \n\nIt's worth a shot though.",
            "It's Odin + a factory specific rom for your phone. I'm going to be a problem at a brick and mortar store in a last ditch effort, so in the snowball's chance they will replace it I don't want to void any warranty.\u00a0\n\n\nPerfect. 3 so far. Now all we have to do is file and wait 5 years for a 100 check in the mail lol",
            "Yea. I'm not about to void any warranties\n\nI'd ask ppl at work, but we all closed for the summer...\n\nAlso, it's Samsung. You can't just unlock the bootloader",
            "The best part - while searching for an old backup phone I found a battery bloated S8 that pushed off the back glass. So at least one faulty Samsung product allowed me to find the other faulty Samsung product that was going to burn down my house...",
            "I could definitely be wrong, but I think companies now get people to agree to arbitration in class action lawsuits, so it\u2019ll get thrown out as an \u2018elected\u2019 investigator will conclude no foul. Although an update bricking your phone is definitely grounds for support as that is horrendous. Thats Microsoft levels of incompetence.",
            "Yea. Heard about that an awful lot. Glad I disabled updates on phone and Google acct.\n\nI feel bad for you guys though.\n\nMost people don't think to cancel updates like I do ( i cancelled bcuz they happen at worst possible time)\n\nSue 'em\n\nReally, really sue 'em. I'll join in your fight\n\nIt's my first and last Samsung. For shame!\u00b0\n\n( ps I think there's a way to downgrade but I'll have to look into that)"

            "Hype is fine but it needs to be backed up. While the Ultras are fantastic all rounders, Huawei, Chinese top dogs and Apple/Google are still ahead of Samsung, and it is a shame, as Samsung certainly has the resources to compete in the camera department IMO. (not a camera guy and a S21 Ultra main here)",
            "Needs more optical zoom.    \nMegapixels is not a substitute for optical zoom.   \nUnless you like noise in your photo.",
            "It's crazy because the Xiaomi 14 Ultra, Vivo x100 U, and Oppo flagships are better all rounders now then Samsung. The only thing the S24U has left is the pen and it's magic box identity (also OneUI but that's subjective.) Sammy is just cutting to many corners and it's starting to show.",
            "The article talks about the HP9 which is already being used by Vivo. Samsung will not use this which is a shame",

            "To have more software overhead to process that, less accurate color reconstruction without more complex algorithms and worse low light performance when not binning?\n\nTo be honest I don't understand why Samsung keeps going for needlessy high MP sensors when they could achieve better results with \"more standard\" 12 or 50 MP sensors while having an easier sensor to produce, faster shutter speeds, better low light performance when not binning and so on...",
            "Yep. Imho Samsungs are no longer worth the prices they're asking new. Refurb I'd be tempted by an S23 and my S21U was a good deal but new absolutely not.",
