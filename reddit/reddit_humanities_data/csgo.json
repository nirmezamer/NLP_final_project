Plus, their ping is always too high and they lag the fuck out of every encounter u have with them. \n\n  \nThey CANNOT speak english (Istg I've only met, at MOST, 5 russians that could speak english) and they curse you out for not speaking russian.\n\n  \nFfs just get them their own servers already and make it so they can't join our European Union servers.

There is no surprise to happen. Next radar check would be if either its been a certain amount of time, say about 20 secs without anything happening. Then you glance in case a teammate has abandoned his post and Ts could slink past.\n\nAlso in such situation the cue for where a teammate has died is very easy to spot and evaluate the situation without needing radar.\n\nUsing the various informations efficiently is also key.\n\nGetting caught out by looking at radar is so rare for me that i dont even remember if it has happened to me for a very long time.\n\nMaybe all the years of experience i have just learned to read all the sound and visual cues and experience of all the various timings of maps that i dont need to extensively rely on something like radar to the point it causes me pain in game.\n\nA big part people forget about is learning to use visual and audio cues effectively but also learning the timings and such. Its not just aim and utility.\n\nAs mentioned in the situation you are in, there is no need to worry about anything other than what is gonna be happening in your area for the next at least 10 secs.",
