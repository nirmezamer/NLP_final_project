            "Hi, currently a second year who received a contract to live on campus next year. Just wondering, where do third years typically get placed, or how likely is it to get a room in Rita apartments? Would you recommend staying on or just living off-campus in terms of living and everything? Any insight is greatly appreciated",
            "Hello, I'm a current male second year looking for some off-campus suite mates. I'm looking for someone that's down for a single ($1333) or two people that are willing to share a room ($1600 split amongst two). I would prefer someone that cares for cleanliness, isn't too loud, has no pets, and doesn't smoke. The property is quite stunning and only 2 miles from campus. The lease should run from 5/15/24 to 6/15/25 although that may change. PM if interested.",

Also did anyone do this last year and were you able to get a double in a nice living space like 6th or muir?",
