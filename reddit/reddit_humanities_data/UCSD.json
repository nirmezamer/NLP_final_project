            "Hi I am planning on getting a single at Sixth College (female), so the numbers are not really working out for my current group, so I am thinking about still getting a single, but in the apartment next to them.  Their earliest enrollment time is 9:30 am, so if any group has an enrollment time around there would be ideal! I am clean, caring, drama-free and would also love meeting new people, although at night I do really value my quiet time because I have a hard time sleeping. That is something very important to me. I\u2019m still not completely sure yet about leaving my current group, but let me know if anyone is open to suiting with me and picking the apartment next to my current group. That is a lot to ask, so I understand if people aren\u2019t able to. Nevertheless, if I do join your group, I would be really happy too and looking forward to meeting you guys and talking it out in person :)",
            "Hi, currently a second year who received a contract to live on campus next year. Just wondering, where do third years typically get placed, or how likely is it to get a room in Rita apartments? Would you recommend staying on or just living off-campus in terms of living and everything? Any insight is greatly appreciated",

            "Hello, I'm a current male second year looking for some off-campus suite mates. I'm looking for someone that's down for a single ($1333) or two people that are willing to share a room ($1600 split amongst two). I would prefer someone that cares for cleanliness, isn't too loud, has no pets, and doesn't smoke. The property is quite stunning and only 2 miles from campus.
