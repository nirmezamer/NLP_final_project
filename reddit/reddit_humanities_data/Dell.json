Individual posts of this nature may be removed at the moderators' discretion.\n\nSome good starter tips would be to,\n\n1. State what laptop you are interested in buying (if applicable)\n2. State what you will be using it for (e.g. word processing, internet browsing, intensive gaming, etc.)\n3. State what country you are located in, as well as your province/state.\n\nEveryone is encouraged to help!",

            "Ok I dont know if this suits here but:     \n\nWhat is one laptop you recommend NEVER getting, like, the 12 inch MacBook of dell laptops, which is the WORST",
            "I want a dell laptop for personal use and mainly required for MS office use as I am a research analyst. I want to know which edition would work\n\nI live in India",
            "I wish Costco sold latitudes.  Oh well. Good thing I'm still in my 90 days.  \n\nThanks.",
            "What are their other good laptops?  How is the XPS line?",
            "I'm disappointed that the Latitudes don't come with 1 TB SSD's.  What's up with that?",
            "They are designed for business use and often bought in the hundreds or thousands. To meet such orders, Dell orders large numbers of SSDs from their suppliers and in capacities that most businesses would order. I'm guessing very few businesses want 1TB in their laptops (since most businesses don't need such a capacity and there are other machines that do offer 1TB).\n\nFortunately, the SSD is user replaceable so you could swap it out yourself. If you do it properly without damaging the machine, the warranty is still valid. However, if you ever need to send the machine to Dell for in-warranty repair, you should put the original SSD back otherwise you might lose your replacement SSD because Dell has no obligation to return your SSD - it will return the original SSD since it's considered to be part of the whole machine.",
            "Daughter starts college in the fall, majoring in electrical engineering. We are an Apple family and are somewhat lost on all of the Dell options. She wants a 16 laptop so weve focused on Precision, XPS, and Latitude options. \n\nMinimum requirements: 32 GB memory, 1 TB storage, Intel 7 or 9 processor, Nvidia graphics card. \n\nSince a computer is one of the approved 529 expenses, cost isnt a major factor. \n\nSorta focused on Precision 5680 but appears it may be due for a refresh. Would need to buy by mid-August so we have some time. \n\nThoughts?",
            "Is there somewhere a comprehensive list of the Precision or XPS line covering the options with 13-16\" screens and dedicated GPU from 2019-2023?\n\nBasically, I would love to find a similar chassis to the 9550 with similar I/O.\n\n1. Dell Precision or XPS (hopefully smaller than the 16\" versions)\n2. Photography and minor video editing, Internet browsing, beginner comp sci classes and into machine learning (starting a master's in public health)\n3. Oregon State, USA\n\n4. Coming from: XPS 9550 (2016), 16GB ram, 2TB SSD \n5. Wanting: 32GB+ ram, Intel core i7, dedicated GPU (3050+?), full SD card reader, 2TB+ SSD\n6. Don't need: newest model year, touch screen, oled, Intel core i9, separate number keypad\n7. Avoiding: touchbar Fn keys of the modern XPS line, AMD",
            "I bought an Inspiron 16 Plus 7630 at Costco last week, but now I'm wondering if I'm better off with a Latitude.  I paid $999.97 for the Inspiron.\n\nIt has a 1 TB SSD and 32GB RAM.\n\nIs the Latitude a better laptop?  I only need it for internet browsing (Youtube) and Quicken, mainly.  But I'm not happy with the Inspiron's limited ports.  At least the Latitude has an ethernet port built in and two USB C ports, where as the Inspiron only has one USB C port and also comes with a USB C power adapter.\n\nI'm repurposing my old Lenovo ideacentre as a monitor so screen size isn't super important.\n\nThanks.",
            "I've had a Dell Inspiron 15 5559 for about 8 years. I've been very happy with it. Not a single problem with the hinges. But it's becoming slower and has some issues now, so I'm searching for a new laptop. I'm just considering Dell, given my satisfaction with the durability and reliability of this Inspiron laptop, but I'm seeing some terrible reviews about the company, so I was wondering if Dell's reputation has fallen in the last few years...\n\nI would like a laptop to use at work and for my spare time. I am a data scientist and might work with large files, so I'm looking for 1 TB of SSD storage and 16 GB of RAM. Specs-wise, I don't think I need too much for my day to day: I mainly program some code and use Office. Since I often use media (watching videos), I would appreciate having a good sound and screen (16 inches). And of course, I would like something reliable (although having a laptop for another 8 years is probably asking for too much)\n\nGiven these needs, I was considering either the Inspiron 16 2-in-1 or the Inspiron 16 Plus (the new 7640 series). The specs are very similar (they seem to be powerful) and probably beyond what I need for my day to day life. The design looks elegant. The 16 2-in-1 probably has a better screen (2.5k, mini-LED, HDR600, 90Hz; maybe at the expense of shorter battery life?), but I'm not sure if I will make the most of a 2-in-1 with a 16-inch screen. And maybe it will have more problems with the hinges. Anyway, what worries me is that I'm reading a number of very negative reviews on the Inspiron 16 series, and I'm not sure about how representative they are of the general situation. The Latitude series seems to be more reliable (according to what I see here), but having only 500 GB of SSD is my main concern. And, at first sight, the Inspiron seems to offer better specs for a similar price range. I'm not considering the XPS series or more powerful Latitudes due to budget limitations. I would appreciate your help a lot! I live in Spain."

            "Go for the latitude, I had a latitude 3420, which has the same construction, they do scuff the lid easier, but they are quite solid, and nice to use, most people assume that 3000 series latitudes are poor quality, and they used to be, because they used to be built on inspiron bodies, but these recent ones are quite good.",

I wont buy Inspiron for any reason.\n\nYears later you will never second guess buying the Latitude. \n\nBuy the Inspiron and your ignorance will be bliss.  You will just think everyone has computer issues that cant be resolved or repeated.",
