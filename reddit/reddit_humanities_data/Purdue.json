It's at the top of the screen and it's very likely that you'll find the answer you're looking for.\n\nAlso, we have a Wiki with common questions, student resources and more. If there isn't a post about it, it might be in here: [https://reddit.com/r/Purdue/w/index](https://reddit.com/r/Purdue/w/index)\n\nIf you're looking for admissions stats, that can be found here: [https://www.admissions.purdue.edu/academics/freshmanprofile.php](https://www.admissions.purdue.edu/academics/freshmanprofile.php)\n\nIf you're wondering what First Year Engineering means, here's a great post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/s/21CXvBm4bR](https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/s/21CXvBm4bR)\n\nIf you have questions about getting into competitive majors, an EXPL advisor made this great post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/195wv60/info\\_about\\_getting\\_into\\_cs\\_proflight\\_nursing\\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/195wv60/info_about_getting_into_cs_proflight_nursing_and/)\n\nIf you want to learn more about the Purdue Indianapolis campus, you can check out the IUPUI subreddit. Purdue operated it as a joint venture, but is splitting it off into a separate college this year. It won't be super accurate, but it should give you a good idea: [https://www.reddit.com/r/IUPUI/s/kFMSPWzoWn](https://www.reddit.com/r/IUPUI/s/kFMSPWzoWn)\n\nWe also have a new subreddit for people going to the Indianapolis campus branch. You can still post here, but you can also now post on r/PurdueIndianapolis !\n\nIf we start seeing repetitive questions, we will start removing them and redirecting them to here. Thank you!",

I found my roommate through there, and so can you!\n\n# r/PurdueHousing\n\nWhen using the housing subreddit, make sure to leave a comment in addition to messaging the person if there's a post you're interested in. Private messaging doesn't always work for new accounts.\n\nPosts about subleasing aren't allowed here on the main r/Purdue subreddit because of their repetitive nature, so use the housing subreddit instead.
