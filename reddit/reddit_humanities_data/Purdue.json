Purdue operated it as a joint venture, but is splitting it off into a separate college this year. It won't be super accurate, but it should give you a good idea: [https://www.reddit.com/r/IUPUI/s/kFMSPWzoWn](https://www.reddit.com/r/IUPUI/s/kFMSPWzoWn)\n\nWe also have a new subreddit for people going to the Indianapolis campus branch.

Also what are some necessities I should pack, that most people gloss over, (apart from bedsheets, pillowcases, chargers, toiletries(not the liquid ones), umbrellas). And if I need to get household electronics like an iron or a microwave or a fan or a bidet, is it best to pack it or is it easily available there? ",

            "if you already have something for winter, then bring it along but don\u2019t buy any winter jackets in your home country specially for Purdue. You will probably need to buy them again in USA as the ones from home will probably not be warm enough for the sub -25\u00b0F winters.\n\nWinter Jackets: Basically try and get a knee length winter parka or jacket with hood. Filling preferably Down with filling 650 and above for maximum warmth (I got 700). You should prefer those jackets with a waterproof outer shell (Goretex or similar). Great Brands to look for include Patagonia, The North Face, Outdoor Research, Arcteryx, Columbia, LL Bean and Eddie Bauer.\n\nLook out for deals on the following websites;\n\nSteepandcheap.com,\n\nMoosejaw.com\n\nSierratradingpost,com\n\nBackcountry.com and\n\nEddie bauer\n\nPhysically, Burlington Factory, located in Lafayette Pavilions Mall, is said to have great prices especially for winter clothes shopping/ winter coats. The Kohls and JC Penney at Tippecanoe Mall are also worth a visit.\n\nRead more on. https://lnshah.com/purdue/2024/04/04/climate-winter-clothing/\n\nFor a broader post on things to pack or buy..
