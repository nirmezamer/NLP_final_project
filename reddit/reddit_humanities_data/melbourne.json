Feel free to link to your local DnD meetup, a concert a few months away from now, a farmers market down in Doreen so we can share ideas within the subreddit. \n\nThe mods will eventually collate a lot of these into a wiki to help anyone looking for resources. If there is a need for it, we can create this mega thread monthly as well (feedback is always appreciated). ",

As two solo female travellers we felt completely safe the whole time, and so many lovely people went out of their way to help us. One that stood out was at a market, their currency denominations are bonkers and theyll often drop some zeros off when a price is written down - you kind of have to be a local to know what the correct price is because sometimes 500 can mean 50,000 or 500,000 rials. Anywho, we handed over the equivalent of about $10 after a kid at a market calculated our price and showed us the screen (it was abbreviated as usual) which seemed roughly okay, if cheap, for what we were buying. As we walked away, this kid comes chasing after us, so upset because we had paid him 10x the amount and he wanted to make sure we got our change back. \n\nI always said this would not happen anywhere else in the world and Im so glad to be proven wrong.",

I buy 95% of my groceries there, my produce is fresher and far higher quality, all while saving around 30% on average compared to Colesworth. \n\nOn top of that, I get to have similar interactions with the wonderful folks who run the stalls. My one complaint is that I have to use extreme willpower to avoid the fresh jam donut truck. They seriously must put crack in those things.\n\nIf youve got a market near you and youre sleeping on it, seriously run there. Ive only been to a couple in the suburbs, but they were great too."
