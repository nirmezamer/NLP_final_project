As in, not a function room, just a table, and the host will likely be going out after to other places. I never know what to do in this situation, because bringing something means burdening them with something to carry around all night. What do others do? Does everyone just not bother with gifts, or do they give them something on a separate occasion where it's more convenient?\u00a0",

Feel free to link to your local DnD meetup, a concert a few months away from now, a farmers market down in Doreen so we can share ideas within the subreddit. \n\nThe mods will eventually collate a lot of these into a wiki to help anyone looking for resources. If there is a need for it, we can create this mega thread monthly as well (feedback is always appreciated). ",

People are doing what it takes through sheer desperation, and others doing what they like out of sheer a-holery and lack of empathy. \n\nLike who is desperate enough to steal the metal plates from kids graves?  Why clip all the metal doovies to plug your trolley into at the shopping trolley bay?  Does disabled parking mean nothing? Well off people cleaning out the foodbank?\n\nWhat do you see as signs that the social contract is broken?",

You all are getting such a crap deal and it is disgusting to see.\n\n\nThis country has broken its contract with the people. For a representative democracy, none if us ordinary people are represented.\n\n\nAll of the representation goes to the corporate party donors and politicians' investment portfolios.\n\n\nThere is no social contract. It now is everyone for themselves. No wonder people are behaving in these ways.\n\n\nI am glad I'll be dead soon. I can't stand this place.",
            "I always gave people the benefit of the doubt. Went out of my way to do the right thing. Tried my hardest not to be a burden on others in all situations and circumstances. Genuinely tried to believe that everyone else was just as caring and considerate, and thoughtful at heart. \n\nThis went on for about two decades. Then covid happened. My attitude and approach hasn't changed, but I'm under no illusion that by and large, my fellow citizens give absolutely zero fucks about me.",

He was in a fairly new, expensive car as well.\n\n\nI wouldn't do that because I was raised better, but if I did my wife and kids would say something along the lines of 'what the hell are you doing?' because it's just such a basic act of decency.",

It's not broken, there's still SO MANY of us who care, who help, who do small quiet acts of niceness for no reason. Become one of us. Donate a cup of coffee or a meal at a cafe. Smile at that tired invisible middle aged woman shopping after work. Hold doors open. Hop onto a charity thing as a volunteer, I bet you there is a mobile kitchen in your area. Go walk the dogs at your local shelter. Don't focus on the assholes, look for the good.\u00a0",

I don\u2019t know when listening to music or TikTok videos with no headphones and the sound cranked up became the thing to do, but now every train carriage has some fuckwit doing it.",
            "Agree completely. I think COVID broke like 20% of the population, and lost their patience and compassion, and now conduct themselves like angry kids at all times. On the roads, in the train, at the shops, walking their dogs. It\u2019s everywhere.\n\nPeople like that always existed, but the number is far higher now.",
            "These are signs of struggle, no? And yeah, when society fails to take care of you within the (unfair) systems it has set up (e.g. you can\u2019t afford a roof over your head, can\u2019t afford your meds, can\u2019t afford food) then the social contract is broken. What comes after that for people is survival, as you say.",
            "Social contact was broken long ago but our prosperity had a sort of momentum to it so we didn't immediately feel it unless we were already at the bottom rung in which case nobody listened.\n\nDecades ago the narrative was shifted from \"governments have an obligation to look after their taxpayers\" to \"stop asking for handouts you entitled fuck\""
