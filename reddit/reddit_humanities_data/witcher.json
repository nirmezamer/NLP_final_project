        "content": "I saw the ratings...and Google shows it like it's one of the best shows out there. It is rated 4.6 and every second website follows 8/10 rating. \n\nI honestly dislike Witcher season. I am a hardcore fan having played all games and having read a few of the books. This makes me wonder if I am in minority. \n\nP.S. Netflix had the gold mine of the decade. A literal step by step guide, well established fan base, and tons of money to grow that franchise into a billion dollar diamond. And one of the best possible lead actors...  \n",

            "I didn't even bother with season 3. There are lots of deviations that I can let slide, but they made Eskel a carbon copy of Lambert and killed him off. Later I found out how they cast the actress for Margarita and I felt so relieved I didn't continue watching.",
            "Stopped watching after season 1...",
            "Oh you're still watching? I stopped on the last episode of Season 1. It's insanely disrespectful not only to the fans but to the author, story and game producers.",

            "Stopped after two. One was pretty neat and I was cautiously optimistic. What a tragedy.",
            "I did not, nay *could* not watch season three.\n\nNetflix did Henry and the source material dirty and it broke my heart.",

            "Huh you kept watching? S2 was so bad that I dropped it entirely."
