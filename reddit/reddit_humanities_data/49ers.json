Lots of old jackets, jerseys and shirts from the 90s and 2000s. I got a sweet Kaepernicking shirt for $8. The nice jackets are very expensive though but definitely worth it.",

For me personally, the two losses that still hurt the most are the most recent Super Bowl and the 2013 NFC Championship against Seattle",
