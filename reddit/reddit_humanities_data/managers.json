Let's call him John. \n\nI have tough communication (in general) with John and common problems looks like theese:\n\n* Defensive reception of most of my decisions and hypothesis. I need 2-3 times more time and efforts (than my usual conversation with other subbordinates) to convince him to do something or find some arguments and evidence against my direction.\n* Defensive and arrogant relationships with sales team. John's team is currently making a recommendation system to reduce manual labor and enhance efficiency of our sales team. The sales team want to know and interpret how the new system works to have an impact of developing process. John refuses to elaborate how the algorithm works, insisting that it is responcibility of his team to do an engineering part and the business team should not put their noses in development.\n* We had a talk about my concerns with John and I noticed that he is refusing to accept and work with my complaints. I see that there's no space for improvements with his attitude and overall communcation with John.\n\nAlso it is important ot mention that my department is expanding, we hire new people and managers, and I don't want to spent more time (like next 2-3 years) for fixing problems with John or keep this problem for another manager.\n\nConsider these problems I feel that I need to make tough decision and fire him. The problem is that he is a good engineer and make his work very good. Another fact that confuses me is that he is refusing to accept any of my complaints. This make me feel less confident and I have doubt that these problem exists, because no one else can evaluate my struggles with John.\n\nHave you ever had this type of people in your team and how did you manage it?\n\n^(sorry for mistakes, English is not my primary language)",

I get the feeling that he will be.",
