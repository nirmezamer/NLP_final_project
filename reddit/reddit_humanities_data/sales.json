        "content": "If you dug into my past posts I got promoted twice in one year to a sales manager role at a large corporate gym over a year ago. It was my first sales manager role at the age of 23, and I was completely nervous. My goal when I started that position was to get my club ranked #1 in the country in terms of performance out of 200+ clubs nationwide. Well, I wasn\u2019t able to achieve the #1 spot, but I achieved the #3 spot for two consecutive months and have sustained top 9 in terms of overall growth over a 6 month span! \n\nSince then, my team and responsibilities has grown greatly from leading a team of 6 to a team of 16 now! Unfortunately, I\u2019m not being paid enough for the amount of work I put into my role, so I decided to start looking for other jobs. I found one job that was hiring a sales manager role and decided to apply based on the values of the company, the role itself, and my values and aspirations. It was the ONLY job I applied to, I did not apply to any other single job except for this one. \n\nI spent two hours getting my resume ready with all my accomplishments and a cover letter, sent it out, and got a call back within a day. Fast forward and I had my interview with them, they offered me $83k salary with benefits and bonuses which is a 59% increase from my current salary! My mentor is helping me re-negotiate the offer currently, and I\u2019m doing my due diligence to see if the culture is the right fit by having planned observance times within the company itself to see how the team interacts. Im just blown away that my one and only application resulted in this response right away! This is exactly how I got my job at the gym, I applied to only one company and got the job instantly. Idk how I have such a high success rate/conversion rate of these applications but I\u2019m super excited!",

When asked about their experience from the interview process to now they said they thought our job post was catfishing but it\u2019s far more than they expected. Tbh I was a little shocked. I didn\u2019t know it was so tough out there, but you certainly put in the work to make a great impression. You should be excited and proud! And as we continue to interview I\u2019ll think about what a grueling process it is for them.",

Am I hearing an EMOTIONAL reason for change, not just a logical reason?\n\n3. If this pushes to next quarter, does it really matter to the buyer?\n\nAnd the most important thing: when he spots an issue, he takes action. He sends one-line follow-ups to dig in. They're 1:1 with an off-the-cuff vibe: \u201cHey, thinking more about our call earlier. You mentioned Alison. Should she be in the next meeting?\u201dIt's shocking how much just asking can de-risk a deal.\n\nAccording to him: \"Deals are lost in discovery.\" As sellers we know this, but ego gets in the way.
