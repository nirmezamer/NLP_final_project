When I asked him his secret, one thing stood out:\n\nHe\u2019s PARANOID\n\nHe told me the trick isn\u2019t to see why a deal could work. It\u2019s to look for the holes. The reasons it WON\u2019T close.\n\nSo when he comes off a discovery call, he's convinced there's a problem he's overlooked. No matter how the meeting went, his task is to identify why it won\u2019t close. \n\nHe interrogates deals by asking himself 3 questions:\n\n1. Did my customer articulate the pain themselves?\n\n2. Am I hearing an EMOTIONAL reason for change, not just a logical reason?\n\n3. If this pushes to next quarter, does it really matter to the buyer?\n\nAnd the most important thing: when he spots an issue, he takes action. He sends one-line follow-ups to dig in. They're 1:1 with an off-the-cuff vibe: \u201cHey, thinking more about our call earlier. You mentioned Alison. Should she be in the next meeting?\u201dIt's shocking how much just asking can de-risk a deal.\n\nAccording to him: \"Deals are lost in discovery.\" As sellers we know this, but ego gets in the way. It feels great to hype up your pipeline in the team meeting. \n\nBut happy ears don\u2019t close contracts. Paranoia does.",
