Because it'll deteriorate and we don't need to buy another mouse because of this. Logitech claim about sustainable, so make things right. And of course, sell this in a reasonable price;\n- Increase the polling rate for at least 500Hz. Kust because it isn't a \"gaming\" mouse that the sensor needs to be at 125Hz in 2024!\n- Try to do something in shape to support the pink finger.\n\nAnd a personal choice: make a beige version of this!",
