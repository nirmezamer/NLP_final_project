I hate this stuff.\nGet Isopropanol or rubbing alcohol, a bunch of paper towels and ho ham on it.\nAlways cleans off, always leaves a nice, smooth plastic that is 10 times better than this garbage \"soft touch\" crap.",

        "content": "Hi! \n\nI'm starting to have too much. Since upgrading from Win10 to Win11 - where the mouse worked flawlessly before - I've been experiencing an issue where the cursor sometimes randomly teleports a few hundred pixels upwards. This is very, very annoying especially with multiple monitors. I've already updated both the software and firmware without success. I've also checked the common mouse settings. Windows recognizes the mouse as an HID-compliant mouse.\n\nCan anyone help with this? PS: It's clean. But as mentioned, the issue seems to be directly linked to the update.",
