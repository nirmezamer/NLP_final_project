For example, *Wonder Woman* discussion would go in the replies to the \"Wonder Woman\" comment. Clicking the titles in this post will take you directly to that comment, too. In other words, you should only be replying to other comments. **Do not post top-level comments**. \n\n**Keep discussion civil.** Do not harass other users for having a different opinion. Do not use this thread to push your personal one-sided grudges against creators.
