For example, *Wonder Woman* discussion would go in the replies to the \"Wonder Woman\" comment. Clicking the titles in this post will take you directly to that comment, too. In other words, you should only be replying to other comments. **Do not post top-level comments**. \n\n**Keep discussion civil.** Do not harass other users for having a different opinion. Do not use this thread to push your personal one-sided grudges against creators.

            "Really wish DC didn't save the last two chapters for the same week, but aside from that small issue, I loved the entire \"House of Brainiac\" storyline. This had some really great Lex moments in it and I'm really curious to see how they're going to follow up his >!memory wipe!<\n\n>!Doomsday about to escape Hell, that could be interesting!<",
            "So the Queen was built to be his heir, to be immortal and consume everything the way he had been trying to do piecemeal for centuries. I dig it, its the ultimate contrast with Superman. Supermans family is built on people being inspired to live up to his example in their own way, Brainiac meanwhile reduces everyone to an extension of himself and his greed, even his family and offspring. Also contrasts with Lex growing to care about something other than himself. When he sold Lena to Brainiac he was no different from Brainiac in that he only cared about Lena insofar as her existence could benefit him. But after Superman saved her and returned her to Lex, Lex started to value Lena not as an extension of himself, but as a person.\n\nGuess the next arc post Absolute Power will be Doomsday leading the forces of Hell against Superman, that sounds fun.",
            "Pretty explosive and action-packed finale as Lex makes the ultimate sacrifice, Brainiac grapples with his failure as a family man and trying to create his own legacy, Superman gets to Superman, another big Clark and Lois kiss, Colu lives, Lex is basically gone right after his daughter and nemesis finally accepted him...and Doomsday is coming back. \n\nWe never did find out who Kara's date was, though.",
            "I like the general idea, but it really wasn't given the time to cook. The vast majority of characters that Brainiac kidnapped do nothing beyond exist in the background of fight scenes, which imo is disappointing if the overall idea of this event is supposed to center around family. Why not actually emphasize that with more scenes of the Superfam? It needed another issue or two but had to be ready for Absolute Power to start.",
            "I like that the Superman Family (including Lex, Lena, and Livewire) were able to defeat Brainiac and save the bottled cities before Lex sacrificed himself to diminish Brainiacs intelligence. I find it sad and shocking that Lex had no memory of who he is. Lets hope that Clark and Lena restore all of Lexs mind and memories so that he can continue as a reformed person and not ruin character growth. Overall, this is a great comic and a great finale to the House of Brainiac!",
            "A little disappointing finale, but overall I enjoyed this story.",
            "A satisfying conclusion. This whole story arc from start to finish was great, feels like lately thats less and less the case with event comics. Heres hoping absolute power can be as good.",
            "This sorta ended in a whimper didnt it. Heres hoping the amnesia plot isnt an excuse to make him go full antagonistic again just in time for the movie in some weird synergy move",
            "Damn, Zatanna, you didn't have to blow that kid up for heckling you. I know she was also a kid but damn. So we got Phantom Stranger as a woman here, coming to Zatanna's show to keep an eye on her and what happened in the past with Zatara, whom she seem to have killed. I guess Zatara was not exactly a good father here, especially when it comes to dangerous magic.",

            "The legendary Golden Glider (any of her versions). She was the first non-speedster villain to find out that The Flash is Barry Allen and used this information to try to kill Barry and Iris. She had the ability to kind of fly with her ice skaters, freeze characters with technology, and spin around like a top. Since New 52, she could phase through objects and stuff. She hasn't had much since Barry died even in New 52 with her new origin but at least she featured in Lego DC Villains as a character with a voice. And her brother is Captain Cold!\n\nI think she needs a shout out.",
            "I nominate Cobalt Blue AKA Malcolm Thawne, Barry Allens evil, magic-wielding twin brother, whos blonde like his brother. I find his origin story very creative and interesting, and I think his costume, villain name, and magical powers are cool. Its cool how he can drain a Flashs speed, and I like his blue fire powers and how he can use his fire to create constructs. And his revenge obsession is a classic villain motive.",
            "Im just curious, how come you didnt nominate him a couple months ago in the April Apes vote? Did you miss that one?",
            "Wasnt there on that day.\n\nSorry.",
            "You dont need to apologize, you didnt do anything wrong. I was just curious.",
            "I nominate Congorilla.\n\nA remnant of a time when adventures in distant Africa were just as exciting to readers as superhero stories, Congo Bill started as a simple explorer, but time and changing tastes caused the original character concept to mutate.\n\nToday Congo Bills mind inhabits the body of a giant golden-furred gorilla, but youd better believe he doesnt let that stop him. His partnership with Mikaal Tomas, during which he revealed his ability to fly a biplane, remains one of the only enjoyable parts of Cry For Justice. Its time this blonde behemoth got the love he deserves.",
            "I'm nominating [Stargirl](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fn4OECMWQAEMHEo.jpg:large). One of the more successful additions to DC in the moment era. She's the perfect bridge between the old school superheroes and next generation. And even had one of the better DC shows to be aired on CW.",
            "My vote is for [Gotham  Girl](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/4/41/Gotham_Girl_Prime_Earth_0001.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20190808025253), she is such a breath of fresh air for Gotham City, for now she is underused but if DC decided to use her more... it would be so interesting to see a character with superman powers (Batman used Platinum Kryptonite on her which is interesting in itself that he put so must trust in her) in Gotham City. I really wish she would be someone like Bat Family \"final\" plan for some bad guys."

I dont especially love reading a whole book of his painted art, tho the differently colored art in his Fantastic Four graphic novel is pretty incredible (extremely Jack Kirby). \n\nI think Ross is one of the most skilled and respected artists in comics.

            "What's the definition of \"allow themselves to be bound\" since I've seen comic panels where she got bound and it was not something she seemed to be up for. Like it stopped her from being able to fight and such",
            "Part of the core concept from Day One.  William Moulton Marston's purpose in creating Wonder Woman was to create a powerful female character who used persuasion to reform criminals and defeat violence.  He believed that male leadership had led to greater and greater wars, and that as humanity developed greater and greater weapons, eventually men would lead the world into a war that wouldn't have any survivors.  \n   \nHe helped invent the lie detector, and created the DISC Theory in psychology (Dominance Inducement Submission Compliance).  He believed male-run societies tended to align with Dominance through force, and Compliance out of fear or conquest.  Female-led societies, he reasoned, would align with Inducement by reason or emotional persuasion and Submission out of choice and/or affection.  That's what he modeled Paradise Island on.  The Golden Age version had a whole smaller island devoted to reforming the violent, imaginatively named Reform Island (it had to be separate because men were not allowed to set foot on the main island until all men had accepted peace).  \n   \nSo, yeah, restraint, persuasion, and changing behavior by rewarding good behavior -- that's been part of Wonder Woman from the beginning.",
            "All Amazons had that weakness, but it was that their strength was negated if they *allowed* themselves to be bound by a man.  It didn't have any attachment to the lasso.  \n    \nIt tied back into the deception of Hippolyta by Heracles.  In the Golden Age origin of the Amazon's in DC, they prayed to the goddesses of the Pantheon (Aphrodite, Hera, Artemis, Athena, Demeter, and Hestia) to free them from the chains that Heracles' men had placed them in.  Aphrodite answered and gave them all superhuman strength so they could break free, but told them that they must wear their bracelets of submission (all that was left of the shackles) to remind them not to be deceived again, and their strength would leave them if they allowed themselves to be deceived and bound again.  \n   \nSo all Amazons in the Golden Age were superhuman, but Diana was specifically blessed by all the goddesses (and Hermes) and is on a whole other level of power.  She does still have to wear the bracelets and does still have the weakening effect if she allows herself to be bound, though.  Notably, it doesn't negate any of her other powers -- it just takes away her strength."
