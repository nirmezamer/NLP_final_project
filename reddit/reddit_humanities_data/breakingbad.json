            "Greetings All. So I'm a newbie. I just watched Breaking Bad about six months ago. Then Better Call Sal and  El Camino.  Now I'm watching Breaking Bad again. I have a question I'm hoping someone will answer for me. What is up with Hank and the gold teeth thing? Why does he act like he is spooked by that square of plastic? Also, Skylar and Marie irritate the heck out of me. Do others feel this way? Especially Marie. Arg!",

Honestly, not knowing Walt's illegal activities, it's not a bad \"joke\" either. \"Better check you're not secretly a rich criminal\" isn't something Hank would have ever thought of in that moment.\n\nSay, however, the bag had split open and the money fell out. It's not enough on its own for Hank to suddenly think \"drug dealer\". What probably happens is the \"gambling\" lie comes into affect much sooner.",

            "So I\u2019ve noticed that as the show progresses, the attendance at their parties decreases.  For Walt\u2019s 50th, the house was packed.  For the party celebrating Walt\u2019s good news from the doctor, probably half the people.  For Walt\u2019s 51st birthday, he\u2019s expecting a surprise party.  He gets home and opens the door, expecting a crowd of people but it\u2019s just Flynn watching TV and Skyler is in the kitchen.  The only people to show up are Hank and Marie.\n\nIn my head, the White family were social prior to Walt\u2019s diagnosis.  As one other commenter said, Jesse was probably Walt\u2019s first friend since Elliot.  I also have a suspicion that some of their \u201csocial friends\u201d became suspicious of the White family when they suddenly bought a carwash and two new cars.  Man, I wish we could just see some of the reactions when Walt is revealed to be Heisenberg.  Like Walt\u2019s doctor was probably just eating breakfast and saw his face on the front of the newspaper. \u201cWhoa!  That seemingly timid man that I treated is a multi-million dollar drug lord??",
