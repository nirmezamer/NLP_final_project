            "Etsy\u2019s fees are absurd. When we run a promotion in our store, they charge fees based on the product\u2019s original price, not the discounted price. They should be encouraging promotions; promotions are good for customers who get to buy at lower prices, good for us because we can sell more, and good for Etsy because they generate more revenue. But Etsy is very greedy, so they charge fees based on the product\u2019s non-discounted price. This is ridiculous.",

Will for sure focus on trying to have my sales back on track for June and get that average of orders per month up.",

            "May has been the best month so far this year. But every single month this year revenue/orders have been down at least 50% from last year. Is there a way to provide feedback directly to etsy about how their seo is broken and gift mode is ruining sales for sellers?",
            "$29k, took a dip from April but not terrible. So far this year March has been my best month.",

            "Last summer I added a new product that is the most expensive thing in my shop. All of a sudden it has taken off. As a result, while my number of orders decreased 4% from last year, revenue was up 90%, making it one of my best months since starting my shop in 2019! (April was up, too.)",

            "I can feel your frustration. It\u2019s ok to feel that way. I was the same at the beginning. After a while, after 10ish fool reviews, i forgive myself. It just not worth to argue with people that cloud be in any state you don\u2019t know. They probably have low knowledge level or just had a bad day. I will just try to get them change review first. 99.9% of time they wouldn\u2019t. I will just public reply with claim and  explain the situation. So other buyer can do they own judgement.

I have no idea what they are even referring to! \nMessaged the customer and said I'm shocked someone stole my sheet and asked for a link,  but they didn't respond yet. If needed I'll respond to the review but I'm hoping the customer will delete it, seems very unfair.",

            "This is just a tax deduction tool, there are hundreds for the US but hardly any  for Canada. It's not so much of a unique idea, but a smaller market. I sold about 5 over the years but none in 2024 until this sale (because tax laws change this needs to be regularly updated)."

            "In 10 years the only packages I have lost to theft were stolen out of the USPS drop box out in front of my local PO. Some \"enterprising\" folks had taken to using powertools on them in the middle of the night. I now only drop inside the building. YMMV, and it would certainly suck if my local USPS was one of the ones that sucked hard that I hear others talk about, but I can't complain, not even about the destination POs.",
