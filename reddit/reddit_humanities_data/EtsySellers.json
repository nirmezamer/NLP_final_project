Will for sure focus on trying to have my sales back on track for June and get that average of orders per month up.",

            "May has been the best month so far this year. But every single month this year revenue/orders have been down at least 50% from last year. Is there a way to provide feedback directly to etsy about how their seo is broken and gift mode is ruining sales for sellers?",

Very anxious/eager to see how this next holiday season turns out in comparison. \n\nOverall, $20k in revenue after ads/fees since launch, and about $9k in total profit.\n\nFor anyone wondering, I spend an average of 10 hours a week on my shop, and currently offer about 1,200 listings.",
            "Last summer I added a new product that is the most expensive thing in my shop. All of a sudden it has taken off. As a result, while my number of orders decreased 4% from last year, revenue was up 90%, making it one of my best months since starting my shop in 2019! (April was up, too.)"

That said, we prohibit pornography, illegal or exploitative items, and used intimate items. Beyond that, we allow but place restrictions on mature content so that people who are offended by this kind of material don't have to see it. If you are selling mature content, we ask that you be respectful of differing sensibilities by listing and tagging your items properly.\n\nNew:\n\n> We work hard to balance keeping our community safe while allowing creative expression. We prohibit pornography, sexual services, illegal or exploitative items, and some types of adult toys. In some cases, adult nudity is permitted, though we require some photos to be obscured as a heads-up to people who may not want to see this type of content. If your listings contain mature content, which includes photographic depictions of breasts and buttocks, we ask that you be respectful of differing sensibilities and require you to list and tag your items properly.\n\nThe Adult Nudity and Sexual Content Policy was modified to absorb some of the previous language.\n\n\"Graphic materials, such as items with violent, gory, or profane text or imagery, must follow our policy for Listing Mature Content Correctly.\" was added.",
