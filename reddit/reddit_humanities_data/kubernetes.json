On another note: learning on frontend dev with elysiajs/eden+tanstack/router/query+prisma/yup and loving the simplicity and type safety.",
            "Our setup has cluster autoscaler. It worked as it was supposed to. It added a new worker node when existing nodes had no capacity. It also shut down one of the nodes when the traffic to the application Pods reduced. In doing so, it removed critical Pods from the infrastructure that were required for running the applications (cert-manager, external-dns, kubeplus multi-tenancy operator, ingresscontroller). Learned that when using cluster autoscaler, we need to annotate key Pods with \"cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/safe-to-evict\": \"false\" annotation.",
            "Used entirety of last week figuring out why my eks cluster was failing load test even though cluster autoscaler and HPA are working perfectly,found out few days ago it was just my PC not being able to handle that much clients for testing,felt so stupid lol",
