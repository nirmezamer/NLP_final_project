        "content": "I've been at my company for 4 years since graduating, having been a complete excel noob and forced to learn everything by myself. Now I reckon I'm the best excel user at my company; using things like pivot tables, formulas like index match, macros often.\n\nMy role is changing to be more involved in accounting (such as management accounting) and financial reporting (preparing several kinds of budgets for various projects with supporting work such as transaction lists, BVAs, forecasting).\n\nI feel it I should try and develop my excel to a level further beyond but I'm not sure what would be most beneficial, cost effective and time efficient?\n\nIn the past, I always felt the excel certifications were never worth it and when I skimmed a few recently, I actually felt I have developed my excel skills independently to a level above most of them, although maybe someone who has done these can give better insight.\nI'm interested in learning about power query, power pivot, power BI. Also, maybe learning more about VBA or even a coding language like python (I have had several people tell me I should have taken up programming based on how I operate my excel sheets)\n\nIf anyone has been in a similar position or has knowledge and insight about this, would be grateful!",

            "We can\u2019t tell what role you started in here.  If you were outside accounting and moving in, I\u2019d recommend strengthening your accounting skills.  Your Excel skills are probably at this point better than most people I know in my team.  The arcane art of accounting speak does not always require much IMO, beyond skills in Pivots, Query, and dashboards.  But depending on your company size, that may be meaningless.  I just came from a multinational company with two Financial analysts who were solid in SQL. Moved to a family owned company with 2 \u201cFinancial Analysts\u201d whose advice to me when I started was \u201cdon\u2019t touch that area because that\u2019s *live data*.\u201d Points to a Pivot, pulling off a VBA Query, pulling financials out of Microsoft Dynamics.  I laughed when each said it\u2026wait\u2026\u201d\ud83d\ude33 Oh you think that\u2019s for real!\u201d  Then I slowed them dumb magic tricks, and now they let me do whatever I want to their Pivot. But you can\u2019t bluff your way through accounting because you must dot your Is and cross your Ts. And maybe that area is newer knowledge compared to your last position.\n\nIt\u2019s always easier to learn when you\u2019re on a team of highly skilled people.  If you\u2019re in your early career, you might consider the advantage of joining a bigger team, where you\u2019re not the smartest guy in the class.  There\u2019s usually money in that. Good luck.",

            "I was once in your position and I looked into those time consuming processes and further expanded from excel functions to automation stuff like Power Query for biggie data n presentation, VBA to move files n creating folders and any other daily tasks that I hate doing. But the vba is not just limited to just excel stuff. Lets say the company is using google workspace , then u can connect to it for whatever u see possible \n\nBut yea if the company is worth it, it\u2019s not necessarily a good thing to flaunt all these coz after all we\u2019re \u201ceasily replaceable\u201d but definitely look into these as part of your personal skill set",

Having said that, more will help, but the right kind of more.  We have a guy at work who can do absolutely amazing things with formulas, but has no idea how to do basic design or error-checking, so his wonderful formulas break when someone enters a number as text, causing a cascade failure across 20 different workbooks and resulting in several hours of clean-up trying to find the problem...\n\nDon't be that guy:  learn spreadsheet design, error-checking, and data validation",

And maybe that area is newer knowledge compared to your last position.\n\nMy last position was more linked to financial analysis within a specific department and based in the HQ office. I'm now doing more \"pure\" accounting but also I'm extending the scope of financial management to multiple departments and also multiple international offices.\n\nMy uni degree was in accounting and finance so I have the acamedic knowledge but I'm still learning the application of the work using things like accounting softwares (SAGE) and how to use excel to make my life easier."
