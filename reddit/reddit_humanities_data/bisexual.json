        "content": "While I definitely feel pretty even between the gay and straight sides of myself I find that what makes me hesitant to enjoy gay porn is seeing penises so big and going so fast that it definitely looks like it hurts. I don't want my asshole to be hurt. I'd like it if a guy with medium to small penis gently and slowly pushed it in. I have some hesitation both receiving and giving anal and the reverse is true with oral. Vaginal is just in the middle. I also find those giant penises in porn going into vaginas with so much speed looks like it hurts or the same into mouths and it's just such a turn off. I wouldn't want to replicate that in real life. \n\nFor both women and men I fantasize a lot about oral. Always giving. I've not thought much of receiving a blowjob for some reason. Probably because I fear my penis being bitten off.\n\nI noticed I'm mostly a submissive giver and rather feminine twink. ",

            "Just in general porn of that type is just not it.\nThat's why i stopped watching straight porn that includes penetration. It just looks like it hurts.\nWholeheartedly believe it would be better if done with someone you like. (more passion, more slow)",
            "I'm also more of an oral person. I've Topped guys quite a few times and enjoyed most of it, but even being a Top I hate it if the guy wants to be rammed to the point of my balls hurting. And with oral, I hate rough aggressive head. Both giving and receiving. I'm also more into sucking than being sucked but I can't deepthroat and hate having Dick jammed in my mouth. I don't mind sucking fast or being sucked fast but it's gotta be gentle and sloppy. I like when a mouth feels like pussy. It's more enjoyable to have the Dick slip in and out of my mouth smoothly and it's also easier to get that swirly tongue action going that way."
