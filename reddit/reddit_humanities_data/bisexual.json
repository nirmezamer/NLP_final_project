        "content": "While I definitely feel pretty even between the gay and straight sides of myself I find that what makes me hesitant to enjoy gay porn is seeing penises so big and going so fast that it definitely looks like it hurts. I don't want my asshole to be hurt. I'd like it if a guy with medium to small penis gently and slowly pushed it in. I have some hesitation both receiving and giving anal and the reverse is true with oral. Vaginal is just in the middle. I also find those giant penises in porn going into vaginas with so much speed looks like it hurts or the same into mouths and it's just such a turn off. I wouldn't want to replicate that in real life. \n\nFor both women and men I fantasize a lot about oral. Always giving. I've not thought much of receiving a blowjob for some reason. Probably because I fear my penis being bitten off.\n\nI noticed I'm mostly a submissive giver and rather feminine twink. ",

            "Oral is great! Love to give it. And penises are actually really tough and, like, elastic, too. If someone bit it, it would obviously suck really bad, but it would be incredibly difficult to actually sever it with their teeth. It would probably make a complete recovery!\n\nUh, I know that from weird internet cooking shows that, like, try to make bull penis or something into a viable meal. Not personal experience. I am definitely not a blowjob assassin with many high profile kills, and I don't rely on obfuscating my trail by having certain details omitted from reports due to the embarrassment. Certainly not that.",

Fucking either men or women, or in-between, should be about enjoying yourself and building a connection with someone. If it's a one time thing, or a serious relationship it doesn't matter, it's all for enjoyment. Communication is huge, say what you like, listen to what they like, observe their body language and how they react to you. Having said that, giving oral slaps, I love burying my face between a pair of thighs!",

            "I prefer penetrative sex because then we both get that feeling of sexual bliss. For me, oral is more of an appetizer to get ready for the main course."
