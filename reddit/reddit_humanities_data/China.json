            "Hello! I am 28 years old and I\u2019ve been estranged from my dad since March 2019.  My dad was born in Guangzhou but lived in Hong Kong until the age of 30 before emigrating to the USA.  I was born in California\n\nGrowing up he has always tried to help me but I feel that he went too far and made me resent him. Do you think he went too far in any of his actions? I am especially interested in hearing from people from China so that I can better understand the context of my father's actions\n\n1: in high school I ran for class office. My dad showed up unexpectedly one day to \u201ctalk\u201d to my opponent. This led to him having a big argument with the school principal because my opponent felt intimidated by him\n\n2: my dad really wanted me to go to an elite university so he threw away my college application and forced me to use the personal statement he wrote for me. He told me to memorize it.\n\n3: I struggled in college (no surprise given #2 above). I lived at home and my dad\u2019s solution was to have me write down everything I did minute by minute. This way he could review how many pages I studied and when I went to the bathroom. He also locked me out of Facebook and regularly checked my internet history.\n\n4: I was working in a restaurant and my dad would sometimes visit and jokingly ask my boss when I\u2019d be getting a raise. I felt embarrassed by this.\n\nAlso keep in mind that I was paying $1000 a month in rent to sleep in the living room (no privacy) and that I'm also an only child.  Looking forward to hearing your responses!",

            "In the heart of Suzhou, amidst the everyday bustle of city life, a tragedy unfolded that would forever etch the name Hu Youping into the annals of heroism. On an ordinary morning, outside a Japanese school, Hu Youping, a dedicated school bus attendant, demonstrated extraordinary courage in the face of a horrifying knife attack, shielding a Japanese mother and her child. Her bravery would cost her life, but her legacy will live on, immortalized by the lives she saved and the hearts she touched.\n\n**The Incident:** It was a serene day when chaos erupted at a bus stop in Suzhou. A 52-year-old Chinese man, consumed by malice, attacked a Japanese woman and her child. Without a moment's hesitation, Hu Youping intervened, throwing herself between the assailant and the victims. She fought valiantly, her only weapon being her unyielding spirit and her desire to protect those in danger. Though she suffered grievous injuries, her actions saved the lives of the mother and child, who sustained non-life-threatening wounds.\n\n**Tributes and Honors:** News of Hu Youping's heroism spread like wildfire, sparking an outpouring of grief and admiration from around the world.

In a heartfelt statement on Weibo, the embassy expressed its sorrow: \"We believe \\[Ms Hu's\\] courage and kindness also represent that of the Chinese people. We pay tribute to her righteous deeds. May she rest in peace.\"\n\n**A Community United:** The Chinese social media sphere was flooded with tributes. \"We will remember your kindness and bravery, for you protected the safety of our Japanese friends and preserved the reputation of ordinary Chinese people,\" read a poignant comment on Weibo. Another user hailed her as an \"ordinary, virtuous, courageous Chinese sister.\" These heartfelt messages reflected a collective reverence for Hu Youping's sacrifice, transcending national boundaries and fostering a sense of shared humanity.\n\n**A Sombre but Uplifting Ceremony:** In a grand ceremony befitting her heroism, Hu Youping was laid to rest with honors. A sea of mourners, both Chinese and Japanese, gathered to pay their respects. The atmosphere was a mixture of somber reflection and uplifting gratitude. Dignitaries, officials, and ordinary citizens alike stood side by side, united in their admiration for Hu Youping. The ceremony was a testament to her bravery, a celebration of her life, and a solemn vow to remember her sacrifice.\n\n**Legacy and Impact:** Hu Youping's story is a powerful reminder of the strength of the human spirit. Her actions on that fateful day embody the ideals of courage, selflessness, and the unbreakable bond of humanity. In the face of senseless violence, Hu Youping's bravery shone as a beacon of hope. Her legacy will inspire future generations to stand against hatred and violence, to protect the vulnerable, and to uphold the values of compassion and unity.\n\n**Conclusion:** Hu Youping's sacrifice is a story of extraordinary heroism that transcends borders and cultures. It is a tale of a woman who, in the face of danger, chose to act with unparalleled bravery. Her legacy will continue to inspire and remind us all of the profound impact one individual's courage can have on the world. In honoring Hu Youping, we honor the best of humanity. May she rest in peace, her spirit forever a guiding light in our hearts.",
