            "My family and I moved from Niagara Region in ON to Edmonton in 2022. It was an insane experience but if anyone has any questions on moving here, just ask \ud83d\ude0a I will say though I am in my 50\u2019s and got my first speeding ticket on my first day in Edmonton. Cameras everywhere are a traffic hazard! \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude0a",
            "I was about to post in the main reddit but I'll post in here. Looking for reputable property management companies. Wanting to move sooner rather than later, but I haven't seen any glowing reviews. If it makes any difference, I'm looking to move around Whyte/Bonnie Doon areas. Don't need much, just safe buildings and timely responses to any maintenance requests (I know I'd be better off going private but it's slim pickings right now)",
            "does anyone have experience with renting a motel room for a month? coming to edmonton feb 6 and looking for a cheap motel room for a month while i sort my employment out and find a place",
            "Wishing you all the best, welcome to Edmonton! :)",
            "Looking to move to Edmonton. Are condos or apartments a bad idea? Can I hear people above me walk around all the time and do I have to tip toe around? I have a dog and a 5 year old son.",
            "How is the area around NAIT to buy a home for investment and appreciation? I am looking to invest in a property in the NAIT, Alberta Avenue, 112-120 Ave area. I lived in the north side a decade ago and I remember this side of the city feeling sketchy. Just want to hear different perspectives and whether the area has changed.",
            "Not very familiar with downtown area but I am looking to move into a condo that is relatively safe. The new mercury block condo looks great but is the surrounding area pretty safe compared to other parts of downtown? It is on 102 ave NW, next to Evolve strength"

        "content": "Are you all seeing massive rent increases this year?? Our rent is going up 22% if we sign for another year, & a whopping 28.7% if we decide to go month to month. We live in a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom apartment in Brewery area. This seems absolutely ludicrous to me. We saw a large increase last year as well, but nowhere near what they are trying to charge this year. We have decided to definitely leave this area, as there are many 3 bedroom 2+ bathroom townhouses that would be the same or cheaper rent than what our renewal would be. ",

            "Alberta has no rent protections. Call your MLA",
            "As much as I'm frustrated by our increase that we received today, I'm apparently lucky it's going up by 15% and not higher. \nHowever the building continues to have issues and repairs are a struggle to get done. Laundry facilities are laughable. We've had 1 thing fixed in our almost 3 years renting here.\nComing from Ontario where there was rent control at least on how much a landlord can increase, this sucks and the UCP can suck a d- for removing caps. \ud83e\udd2c",
            "I\u2019m honestly shocked ours hasn\u2019t gone up in 2 years. We pay $1535 for a 3 bedroom townhouse with 2 parking spots, a private yard and a full basement. In the NW (Oxford area). Pet friendly too.",
            "That's why rent control matters.",
            "Edmonton is one of the fastest growing cities in North America right now. People are flocking here, and rents will increase accordingly.",
            "Pretty soon it will be time to move to the next province with the lowest rent. Manitoba, Saskatchewan on the radar.",
            "Just sold my rental. I was operating at a small loss to keep good tenants, but my mortgage was due to go up ~$500/mo at renewal. Property tax was up $400/yr, insurance went up $400/yr... Shits expensive.",
            "In a Sherwood Park apartment I went up like 40% from 2020 to 2021 and in 2022 they wanted to do it again, so we bailed and found a basement suite instead.\n\nI'm guessing you're just catching up...",
            "My landlords luckily feel guilty about making money off of my need for housing (I rent privately in an apartment condo they were struggling to sell) and i just cover their costs making my apartment cost way under market value. It went up last year by $50 just to better cover the surging electric prices at the time, but im incredibly lucky and thank my stars every day"

            "As a fun activity, we can use accidents like this to actually quantify the self-importance of these drivers. \n\nEach Valley Line LRV has a capacity of 275 people, with as many as 20 LRVs (arranged into 10 trains) on the track at peak hours during five minute frequencies. As an accident can shut down the entire line, using a productivity of about $20/hr as an estimate, a driver running a red light and hitting a train, shutting down the line for an hour, can cost the city over $100,000 in lost productivity. As most lights are on a one-minute frequency, this means the driver, in attempting to beat the train, implicitly place their own time at about $6,000,000/hr by placing the value of their one-minute delay above that of the lost productivity from shutting down that rail line."
