            "I tried making a post and was told to post it here by the mods. \u201cFirst day in Canada. Starting a new life after leaving an abusive situation. I have questions and I\u2019m sorry if they\u2019re dumb.\n\nI\u2019m 21, a woman from outside Atlanta, Georgia. and my friend from college moved here for work, as they have dual citizenship. \n\nI left an abusive situation at home and the shelters were full or wouldn\u2019t take me AND my dog. My friend here in Edmonton heard and sent me a ticket and a few bucks for dog food. She\u2019s out of town for work until Thursday, but has a keypad on her apartment and I got in.\n\nI have to hit the ground running tomorrow and she\u2019s really busy at work. I deleted my social media accounts for safety when I was running from him, but feel safe now that I\u2019m in a new country. \n\nI need to apply for a temporary resident permit first, from what I understand, they will probably issue me a 6 month work permit, too. Does anyone know if that\u2019s true?\n\nDoes anyone know what the requirements are to goto the food bank? My friend sent me everything she could and she\u2019s doing so much. The one back home in the us I tried had a bunch of restrictions. Is there a food bank you suggest? I\u2019m nervous about but I\u2019m hungry and my dog is too. Her apartment has no food.\n\nBank account: Will I be able to get a Canadian bank account after I get the TRP approved? Part of the reason my friend here can\u2019t help me until she gets back is that I don\u2019t have a Canadian bank account. She wanted to do an etransfer but it won\u2019t work with my us bank. She couldn\u2019t add a card to PayPal, so she could only send the few bucks in her balance.\n\nWhat restaurant would you apply to in Edmonton if you were me? I have serving experience. Do people tip the same here as the us? What should I ask for in terms of an hourly rate for basic entry level jobs here?\n\nIs there a place in town that assists with clothing for interviews? \n\nAgain, sorry if the questions are dumb.\u201d",

It was an insane experience but if anyone has any questions on moving here, just ask \ud83d\ude0a I will say though I am in my 50\u2019s and got my first speeding ticket on my first day in Edmonton.

            "I was about to post in the main reddit but I'll post in here. Looking for reputable property management companies. Wanting to move sooner rather than later, but I haven't seen any glowing reviews. If it makes any difference, I'm looking to move around Whyte/Bonnie Doon areas. Don't need much, just safe buildings and timely responses to any maintenance requests (I know I'd be better off going private but it's slim pickings right now)",

            "Kicking tires on the idea Edmonton at the moment.  Any areas that check a few of the following boxes?   We're currently in Vancouver but lived in Calgary for a number of years.  \n\nMy wife and I are thinking about it in the next year, I'm 100% WFH and she's a Registered Nurse.  So back and forth given how awful the provincial government is but we're hoping after the AHS shit show it'll be reasonably predictable for her to find work.  The $100m plan to add bike lanes is incredibly compelling as we are very infrequent drivers and prefer to walk/bike/transit whenever possible, within reason.\n\n\nIn terms of what we'd be looking for: \n\n- SFHs or Townhouses, ~3 bed ~2 bath  about $400-500k that aren't teardowns\n- Reasonably walkable to a grocery store\n- Within 15 minute walk to LRT\n- Inner-city or nearby, i.e. not far from Stollery/U of A and ideally within proximity to the river valley\n- Ideally older street with streets not major roadways\n\n\nAnyway, any neighborhoods that might meet that criteria?   I've been to Edmonton a few times but not since my priorities have changed and the idea of a new car dependent suburb became less appealing.",

            "Hellooo! My partner and I are thinking of making the move to Edmonton from NB (will be renting) and I have a few questions:  \n  \n- How hard is it to do the whole rental process? Is it super competitive and unlikely that you'll get the first place    you fall in love with sort of thing? My credit is also not so great (consumer proposal filed in 2019), but I have a perfect rent payment history and 7-year employment. Anyone here have trouble renting despite having a steady job/rent related payment history? \n\n- Any property management companies to look for listings/work with that you would recommend or steer clear of?\n\n- It seems like Edmonton has that big city convenience and amenities without the feel of somewhere like say, Toronto in the sense of how cramped up it is. Do you find it relatively pain-free to drive around most parts of the city?\n\n- In terms of places to rent, it would be nice to have a place that really feels like a slice away from everything, it doesn't technically \\*have\\* to be away in the middle of nowhere, but just a relatively quiet and safe neighborhood, maybe slightly away from the busier parts of town. Should I steer clear of certain areas? Any recommendations? \n\n- and last question! What's the healthcare system like in Alberta? I know it's currently strained everywhere in Canada right now, but if you needed urgent care and go to the emergency room, will you be waiting upwards of 15 hours to be seen? Can you get ahold of walk-in clinics easily? Are the wait lists for family doctors less than 5 years? (NB in this regard is abysmal, unfortunately)\n\nThanks to whoever takes the time to read/reply to this!"

We saw a large increase last year as well, but nowhere near what they are trying to charge this year. We have decided to definitely leave this area, as there are many 3 bedroom 2+ bathroom townhouses that would be the same or cheaper rent than what our renewal would be. ",
