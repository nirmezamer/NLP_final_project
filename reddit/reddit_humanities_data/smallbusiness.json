            "I started my own cash advance company. I did it for almost 2 years for someone else and all I learned was that the loan industry is disgusting. The amount of greed and entitlement that surrounds the people in the industry is too much and I got sick of it and quit. After almost a year of working back in a restaurant I decided to take the knowledge I learned and try to do something about it. I woke up and devised a plan to slowly bleed out and destroy the greedy industry and give small business a chance again. I created two cash advance companies, almost a year apart. The first was simply to distract my competitors while the second slowly grows like a tumor on his side, until it\u2019s too late. I wake up every day now with the drive and motivation to cripple my former bosses company along with all others like his. I work 7 days a week, 5 on my business and 2 at the restaurant. I will succeed and help others along the way. AMA",
            "Is there a chance I f'ed up?\n\nSo I'm co-owner of a small business dealing in B2B industrial components and supplies. One of our bigger clients (which amounts for roughly 6% of our annual turnover) was in urgent need of 100 pieces of a certain part. When I say urgent, I mean they needed it delivered within two hours, it was an emergency. We only had 63 in stock, so I had to get the rest from a competitor who offered a lesser quality equivalent for about half the price (our product is made in Japan and has a shit ton of certificates and strict quality control checks, theirs is made in God-knows-where without any certificates available).\n\nI offered them both the 63 Japanese ones and the 37 knock-off ones as a single product with a 15% discount to account for the low quality ones, which I explained albeit over phone instead of an email. The purchasing officer expressed his dissatisfaction over our pricing, but then proceeded with the order.\n\nThe next morning, the head of the purchasing department called me to complain about our prices compared to the competitor that offered the knock-off version for much cheaper. I explained to them the situation and he seemed to accept it. At around 2pm of the same day, I got a heated email in all caps from the owner exclaiming that we betrayed their trust by overcharging them, implying that we have been scamming them for years. He also claimed that he will take any legal measures possible so that they won't pay us any amounts owed based on this incident.\n\nIs there any possibility they will screw us over and actually dodge payment by taking us to court? I doubt it, however I am very stressed about this whole situation.",

        "content": "Hey all, \n\nI\u2019m the owner of a software development agency and we have a client that struggles to pay their bills. They give me a lot of business, but they\u2019re slow to pay, primarily due to poor operations & cashflow on their end (considering they just laid off their one and only project manager, now the owner absorbed that role). \n\nThey\u2019re 7 days late on an invoice that was net-30. This is a recurring issue. I started to slowly cut them off late this week - things took a little longer than they usually do. I\u2019ve sent their invoice to their operations manager 7 times with QuickBooks showing they\u2019ve looked at it 19 times. I also personally emailed the ops manager Monday. No response. The ops manager is the wife of the owner. \n\nThe owner came to me yesterday & today with a few \u201curgent\u201d things, but I responded in a few hours instead of ASAP. \n\nSo today, in my responses explaining code, I included to the owner an invoice to the outstanding invoice. The owner sent me a note saying that made him feel uncomfortable, saying my communication had been lacking, they need things done urgently, and it doesn\u2019t work for him that I don\u2019t let him know urgently when things will be done. Emphasis on urgently. Oh, all while saying it\u2019s typical for him to take a say to respond to things. \n\nI responded to him saying it doesn\u2019t work for me that he pays the invoice whenever they want, and I can commit to responding faster if they pay their invoices on time. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m 26, only 3 years into this business full time, and it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve stuck up for myself. I feel proud of myself but for some reason a little caught up in my head about it all. Is this normal practice to do, or at least I shouldn\u2019t feel bad about it? \n\nI sort of chalked it up to the saying \u201cfuck you, pay me\u201d but curious for your thoughts. Thanks! \n\n",
