        "content": "I own a landscaping business in Arkansas. We install drains, clear and grade land, and install gravel driveways. \n\nI have a customer that accepted our bid and signed a contract. We completed their project as outlined in the contract. They are threatening to sue us now because they thought that the price they paid for sod included sod for their entire yard. That was never discussed, my partner clearly explains to them that we only cover the areas we disturbed. The contract says 3 pallets of sod, which is about 1350 square feet. \n\nTheir argument is that they thought the price was for the whole yard and they have no idea how much a pallet covers. So they think we should pay to have the rest of the yard done because the contract wasn't clear (to them) how much sod was included. They chose a very expensive premium sod and we just can't take that hit.\n\nI thought my contract was pretty iron clad but it doesn't specify the square footage of the sod.Just amount of pallets, the type of sod, and that installation is included in the price.\n\nI already know what I am going to do in this case and I do have my own attorney for legal advice. I am just curious how you'd handle this type of situation in your business. Thanks!",

            "They didn't even see square footage, just paid for it by \"pallet\"? They're lucky they didn't get scammed, a pallet could hold any amount of sod, the same amount they got could have been spread over twice as many pallets and cost them twice as much.\n\nFor me, threat of law suit is end of discussion. If they do go that far, I'm not giving them any more ammunition. They get the invoice with a hard deadline for going to a collector, and all further discussion can go through lawyers.",
            "I would say you fulfilled contract. Maybe see if he wanted to work out a deal with sod at cost and he pays labor. That would be about the only concession Id be willing to make. Other than that you did what was stated and agreed upon.",

            "The point is if they paid you for the work done or not. If not, start lien proceedings on the house. If they have, just tell them you would gladly give them a quote with how much more pallets are needed for the rest of the area and if they want to sue, we will wait to be served and go from there.",
            "Nah thats on them 100%. A pallet is pretty standard naming since they are almost always 450 sq ft. If they didnt know they should have clarified. That price isnt reasonable for a whole yard and they know it",
            "Ultimately did you deliver goods and services in line with what's on the contract?  If so they'll have a hard time with their \"case,\" regardless of their perceived and supposed lack of undertanding."
