            "Roxxxy reminded me of Maya Rudolph in that lip sync. Absolutely 10/10.",
            "Making Jorgeous come out after Plastique was so shady of the producers LMAO. Also, if you were to tell me that Nina West was going to create a better look than Mik in a sewing challenge I would not have believed you. Roxxy and Plastique were stunning and that star train was insane.\n\nI continue to feel bad for Shannel as each week goes by",
            "RuPaul cant edge Shangela anymore so she choose Shannel",

            "When Shannel was talking about how on season 1 she decided to leave meaning it wasnt Ru who sent her home; thats when Ru decided no badges for Shannel in these last few episodes",
            "damn these threads are always quieter than the Ross Matthews meet and greet ",
            "Justice for Nina! \n\nBut srsly, she fucking did that! I feel like it was the first time she got her proportions just PERFECT, and the fit on everything was sooooo right, esp considering garment construction is not her gig.",
            "It's feels wild to say this but I think Nina should've been top 2 in this design challenge. \n\nI do understand the judges' decision to prevent her from lipsyncing though, none of us need to see another one of those.",
