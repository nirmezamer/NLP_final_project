            "With them bringing in Bob, Monet and Raven so far. I was fully expecting Asia to show up on that slapping scene referencing her actually getting slapped by Ru on S10.",
            "Acting challenges are not my favorite, because of the terrible scripts, but this was just crazy. Eight similar scenes in a row with Ru and the queen acting just standing there and never looking at each other. Nina did ok and Jorgeous\u2019s wig was fun, but otherwise it was unwatchable.",
            "How does Roxxy have the nerve (delusion) to say Angie was being too dramatic with the snippers after all that nonsense she pulled last week?!",
            "The camera angle made it so clear that they were reading all the dialogues. That on top of the challenge just dragging on really made this a difficult watch",
            "As bad as the acting challenge was, the extended slapping scene did make me lol when Raven turned up.",
            "It suffered by the challenge requiring each to have their own scene with Ru, playing very similar characters and all slaps. If there were half as many queens it wouldn\u2019t have been so repetitive.\n\nI did think Angie was the correct winner.",
            "The challenge was good in theory but in execution it went on and on lmfao the filming process though  was fun to see",

Right now I\u2019m in the section where they are on drag race and it\u2019s basically going episode by episode.  Some real interesting behind the scenes logistics stuff about getting/going on the show too.  I understand it will get juicier but it\u2019s already a wonderful read about a wonderful queen.  \n\nShe has a virtual meet and greet event on the 25th hosted by fanroom live if you can\u2019t make it to a signing.  Attendance ticket includes a copy of the book!  She really is a doll to her fans, so go meet her on the tour if she\u2019s near you, that ticket also includes a boom!  \n\nOddBless!",
