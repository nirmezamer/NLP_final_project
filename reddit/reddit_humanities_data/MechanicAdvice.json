        "content": "I have a 2005 Corolla. I (regretfully) agreed to have sway bar links replaced at a local Midas. Later in the week (unrelated), I took it to a Jiffy Lube for coolant issues and asked to check the brakes too. The Jiffy Lube guy noticed that these bolts were loose and could not be tightened. He recommended that I report the Midas work bc the car is in \"dangerous\" condition.\n\nObviously, this was alarming to me. Car seems to drive fine but I keep worrying the front end might collapse or fall off. Finally get the Corolla back to Midas and they say it's not that serious and that, to tighten the bolts, they would have to make holes in the frame. Nobody seems to know what the bolts do exactly but ofc they're there for a reason. Couldn't find any specs on Google so now I'm hoping you Redditors can help. \n\nIs this really dangerous? What should I do? I have about 2 weeks to decide whether to make Midas warranty their work. Jiffy Lube guy thinks I should have them buy and replace the whole subframe. I honestly feel lucky that I got away with a car intact the first time (turns out Midas messed up my brakes when they did the sway bar). Do I really want to press the Midas for free work that might open an even bigger can of worms for this old car? Or if they end up cutting holes to fix the bolts, would that create other problems I'd want to avoid?\n\nNot sure which sub to post this in, so I'm trying a few. Ideally I can continue driving the Corolla for another year, at least (as I pay off the sway bar work in installments). The car is very reliable otherwise with great pick up. Thanks in advance for your comments and advice.  ",

            "Those bolts are holding the subframe to the unibody structure of the car, so yeah, kinda dangerous. But also, these bolts shouldn\u2019t have been touched and have nothing to do with replacing sway bar end links. Did they possibly replace the sway bar itself?",
            "Go. Back. To. Midas.\n\nSombody fucked up and thought it would be overlooked long enough for it not to be linked back to them. If they say it was like that before, then they 100% would/ should have told you about it",
            "Doesn\u2019t look like they\u2019re stripped. Looks like the nut they thread into which is usually spotwelded inside the frame or whatever has broken apart when they undid them for whatever reason, causing it to be loose and not able to tighten up, the whole thing just spins.",
            "So after doing some digging, I think your bolt size is M16x1.5. Not 100% on the pitch, but it\u2019s a 19mm socket = m16 bolt. Other models with compatible also use m16\u2019s on the subframe, and those are 1.5 pitch. \n\nAre you sure they just replaced the links and not the bar as well? Removing the bar would cause the mechanic to loosen those bolts. From what I\u2019ve seen, this is a fairly common issue. Toyota used a threaded sleeve instead of a nut, and it\u2019s apparently pretty easy to strip/gall the threads when using a pneumatic/electric gun.\n\nAs far as safety, there are probably worse cars on the road. It is still not great. Looking at it, there\u2019s 4 bolts holding your front suspension and front half on your powertrain to the car, and you\u2019re rolling around without 2 of them. Depending the condition of the two bolts you have left, a big pothole could be a very bad day for you. I would go back to Midas as soon as possible, and try to sort things out.",
            "Here's another picture of the bolt placement:\u00a0[https://imgur.com/a/Jwth7Il](https://imgur.com/a/Jwth7Il)\n\nBoth sides are loose",
            "Everyone is saying go back to midas. But i dont see a reason they would have touched those bolts, incidentally or otherwise. The sway bar link procedure for sure doesn\u2019t call for dropping the subframe so not sure how you could prove they caused it",
            "This might actually be common on this particular year Corolla.",
            "Go back.  Push back as much as you an at least get them to fix it right",
            "Those bolts don\u2019t have anything to do with your sway bar end links. \u00a0Those hold your subframe in place.\n\nI\u2019m not familiar with corollas, but I get the feeling that maybe the threaded portion of the nuts, seeing how the bolts didn\u2019t just fall off. \u00a0Maybe they\u2019re welded nuts that snapped off the unibody. \u00a0So now you have the bolt and nut dangling on the subframe.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case the fix would be to lower the subframe or remove it. \u00a0Weld the nuts back into the chassis again and reinstall. \u00a0\n\nIf it\u2019s not nuts on the other end it could be threaded sleeves. \u00a0\n\nAs for safety well now you have two instead of 4 bolts holding it in place. \u00a0Could last forever or it could fail on you. \u00a0It\u2019s a lot like driving a car with two lug nuts off each wheel. \u00a0 Will it hold? \u00a0Maaaaybe?"
