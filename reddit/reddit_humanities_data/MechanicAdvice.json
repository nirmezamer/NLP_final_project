I thought it may just be leaking coolant, so I kept an eye on it and added some here and there when it was low. Today while I was sitting in the car, I started hearing weird noises so I turned it off and popped open the hood to see this. I took off the coolant cap because there was obvious bubbling in the reservoir, so I wanted to relieve some pressure. After doing so, the liquid started overflowing out of the reservoir. Just to mention, we\u2019ve had this car less than a month and this is the second thing wrong with it. First the alternator and now this. I\u2019m obviously going to have to take it to a shop but I\u2019m curious what this could be. ",

            "On older cars (even with low mileage), the bushings for the motor mounts oftentimes dry rot and break apart, causing the jerking you see. You can DIY it, but they can be a pain in the ass to change yourself. A mom and pop shop will probably do it for a couple hundred bucks, but the dealership is gonna try to sell you entire new motor mounts which you don't really need. Also, top off your coolant",

If the engine was running properly even with the missing motor mount, it would remain relatively still.\n\nThere are numerous things that can cause the engine to lope like this.  Knowing what the DTCs are would help a lot.",

However, I don\u2019t know if my torque wrench is broken or if I just couldn\u2019t get enough leverage, but I was unable to tighten the m14 bolts to 126ft-lbs like the specs say. On one of them, I tightened it as far as I possibly could and still couldn\u2019t get a click out of my wrench.\n\nThat said, is it goofy for me to bring my car in just for someone to tighten those bolts to spec? Or should I just go buy a new torque wrench?\n\nThanks",
