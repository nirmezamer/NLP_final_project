            "I was waiting for someone to do this turns out Disney did it themselves. Maybe Disney can also allow more content for this show that they are trying to milk every last view out of",
            "I\u2019m pissed that this still isn\u2019t the definitive way to watch season 3 because they put the end credits scene at the bottom left of the screen at the end of the finale. Best way is still to switch to the end credits video so you can actually get a fullscreen \u201cbye\u201d",
            "When the doctor says you have 2\u00bd hours left to live",
            "This is basically Disney\u2019s way of saying: *We done f**ked up.*",

            "Disney really trying to milk that ad revenue huh.",
            "TFW Disney comes right out and tells you \"Yeah. We really did make Dana boil the whole S3 down to essentially 4 episodes.\"  \n\nWhatever. We should get this one up past 2M views in 24 hours too, just to keep driving home how dumb Disney's decision was.",
            "It\u2019s actually kinda hilarious to imagine what the Disney execs are doing now that their biggest animated show is dead and they have no one to blame but themselves. You can just feel the panic seeing how many different ways they aired this finale"
