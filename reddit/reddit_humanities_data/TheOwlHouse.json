I'll admit it took some time before Hooty officially won me over, but even before that happened there were times when I felt like Hooty deserved better. I felt like the mistreatment was a bit much, especially when one of the most important lines in the show is \"Us weirdos have to stick together\". Hooty may be unnerving at times, but he's still family and he does his job. I'm glad he was treated better later on.",

            "On one hand, Hooty is majority of the time just existing, and loving life, while causing mild annoyance to others. On the other hand, he did say it would be funny if Luz went out into the boiling rain, but that might\u2019ve just been a joke. Or, he sees people do it a lot, and sees humans as no different to anything else",
            "Idk, I never liked it tbh\n\nImo seems like a joke the crew wanted no matter what because sometimes iirc it just felt almost ooc some of the times a character was way overly mean to him\n\nI get weirded out by him or acared of but they definitely overdid it imo.. genuinely felt bad for him and I like when cjaracters suffer unfairly",
