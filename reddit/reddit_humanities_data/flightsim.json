            "lol, one dude in the forums said he took PTO today for the release. That was not a smart move, at all. If you were gonna take any day, should have been tomorrow, but even thats not a guarantee. RIP his PTO.",

            "I'm starting to hate that 737 picture in the home page...",
            "At this point I'm just ready for the inevitable message from PMDG that they ran into some very vague issue that they won't disclose and delay it every day for the next week before randomly releasing it at 2 AM on a Monday",
            "I dislike how they interact with their customers and think that they need to hire someone \"normal\" to do it for them, but you cannot deny that they make good shit. Whenever they release a product it's an event and that's very telling of the quality of product they make.",
            "Well you can buy it, you just can't download it. These fuckers.",
            "They just changed their FB banner to a taxi out, hopefully we see it in the next hour or so."
