            "Yes, it was Microsoft Flight (2012): https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Flight",
            "Ah yes. The flight sim that was literally and utterly destroyed by X-Plane. So much so that they decided to just stop this piss poor attempt at rejuvenating the series. Not even worth trying. Simply too little, too late. To be fair, it was not meant to be a detailed flight Sim. \n\nI sometimes think Austin Meyer never took MSFS seriously and underestimated the impact of its return because he thought Microsoft was going to come out with another version of this steaming pile of crap.\n\nBut then, to the surprise of many in 2020, Microsoft and Asobo unexpectedly released a groundbreaking piece of tech and an amazing flight sim in its own right. So good in so many ways, the return of this storied franchise is now loved all over the world and growing in reach by the day. In a short 4 years, MSFS has amassed thousands of add-ons, hundreds of millions of users, and a billion flights. It\u2019s an unstoppable juggernaut of flight sim goodness.\n\nMSFS 2024 is going to continue to kick ass and just gap every flight sim in existence. It will be yet another generational leap of really cool tech to enrich the flight sim experience, particularly those seeking VFR.\n\n\u201cOh how the turn tables\u201d - Michael Scott\n\nI guess the moral of the story is never underestimate a company, a project, and/or a person with something to prove.\n\nI would also warn that this is exactly possible from Laminar as well. They make an excellent flight sim and although not even remotely close in visual fidelity to the stunning MSFS, we should never ever count them down. They could very well have a trick up their sleeves graphically. Very smart folks over at Asobo and LR. But I feel like Laminar are now the ones with something to prove.\n\n\nWe live in a competitive era of flight sim awesomeness.\n\nWow, I laid it on thick, didn\u2019t I?",
            "Hot take but I actually enjoyed Microsoft Flight (2012) when it came out. I was just starting to get really interested in flight simming and aviation at that time and I believe it was a fun entry for casual players. It had an extremely low bar of entry, running well enough on my laptop at the time with just a keyboard and mouse. It was free, though it heavily featured micro transactions. The skill bar was very low, though I wouldn't consider it to be a useful training tool so much as just a fun game that might lead new simmers into a more realistic title. \n\nThe missions it featured, though largely unrealistic in some cases, tied it all in to make a fun casual entry. I have found myself re-downloading it a few times over the past few years just to enjoy the novelty of it, but it's not officially available anywhere. Definitely abandonware.",
            "Yes, Microsoft Flight. But it was a bit limited. Only Hawaii and Alaska were available, few planes, microtransactions etc. There were positive aspects like graphics and it could be ran on most PCs. But the limitations made most users hate it. Also, it wasn't Aces (FSX developer) developing it.",
            "MS Flight, yeah, I kinda liked the arcadey approach. I feel MS Flight is to flight simulation what Forza games are to simracing",
            "Where is that a screenshot of? I want to do a casual fly over in the MS2020 and compare it.",
            "Let\u2019s also not forget dovetail\u2019s crapware *Flight Sim World*. Literally abandoned a year after development, shortly before MSFS 2020 was announced.",
