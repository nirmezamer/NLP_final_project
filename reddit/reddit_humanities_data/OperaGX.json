        "content": "Hi all,\n\nI recently made a custom animated WebP wallpaper which I want to use as the wallpaper for my browser Speed Dial. I have made similar backgrounds before with this method, and they have worked perfectly fine. However, when I click on the file to add it to the wallpaper collection, it doesn't seem to add to the collection. I have a feeling this is because my file is too big (483 MB). As such, I wanted to ask if there is a maximum size allowable for such wallpapers on Opera? Googling this question has provided no real answers unfortunately.\n\n  \nThanks yall.",

Can that picture be anything, or does it specifically need to be the first frame?",
            "It can be anything.\n\nIf you need an example of the persona.ini and first_frame setting, install one from <https://addons.opera.com/en/wallpapers/?tag=animated>, goto the URL ```opera://about```, take note of the \"profile\" path, goto the \"Themes\" folder in the profile folder and extract the zip file for the wallpaper.",
            "Not sure if there's a file-size and or resolution limit.\n\nAre you talking about just a webp file that you add by going to the URL ```opera://settings/opera-gx```, setting \"Wallpaper\" to custom and clicking \"Add your wallpaper\"? If so, make sure the filename doesn't have any parentheses in it.\n\nOr, did you create a wallpaper package (zip file with the webp file, the first_frame.png file and a persona.ini file that references them in it)? If so, what's your persona.ini look like?\n\nOr, did you create a mod (like the ones at <https://store.gx.me/mods/> that has an animated wallpaper (using the webp file) in it?\n\nAlso, after you set the webp wallpaper, did you goto the URL ```opera://settings/opera-gx``` and keep clicking the left arrow for \"All wallpapers\" till you get to the front to see if your wallpaper is there so you can select it?"

            "By default, a shortcut won't be created on the desktop anymore. It'll just be pinned to the taskbar. But, starting with Windows 11 23H2, you have to have Notifications turned on in settings in Windows so that you get a notification asking if you want to pin the taskbar button. If you never get the notification, things won't be set up right. But, once they are, \"Restore icons\" will indeed add a desktop icon. \"Restore icons\" will also show a notification asking for permission *if* the pinned taskbar icon is gone.\n\nSo, the first thing to do is to go to System -&gt; Notifications and turn on notifications. Then, if Opera is in the list of apps there, might sure notifications for it are enabled and click the &gt; at the end to make sure the settings for Opera's notifications are correct.\n\nNow, if you're running an insider build of Windows 11 24H2, some others have said that the creation of profiles is broken there (probably due to some changes in Windows). But, I can't test myself."
