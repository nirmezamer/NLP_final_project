            "So I really enjoy the game and IP, collecting the tabletop miniatures as well, but I struggle so much with maintaining a level of coherence in battles, where I'm overwhelmed by the amount of micro that I need to do. I've watched loads of youtube videos, but haven't really figured it out how to best manouvre my army, or what general approach I should take. I see some having their whole army in a locked group formation to move around, but in the campagin battles there are often so many obstacles in forests and such, that it seems better to move in smaller groups. Some group all their ranged together, others have blocks of melee and ranged. I'm not sure how people even ensure that the units are fighting their proper counterparts, as in, here are some melee piercing infantry, so I have to ensure they fight x unit of the enemy... \n\nOverall, I wanted to know if some of the more experienced players out there can share some tips in terms of not ending each battle in a massive blob, loosing sight of units, etc, essentially effectively micro-ing. Was there a \"aha\" moment where you changed something in your buttons or general approach that made it much more manageable to fight battles? I find that I'm not enjoying battles as much because I suck so much at them, and tend to avoid them with auto-resolve which kind of defeats the whole purpose. Just for info, I already use the debug camera",

            "is there an estimate when the pharao update/extension comes? im kinda over fantasy units for now and was kinda hyped for it",
            "In WH3, does the Master Rune of Spite still work for the Dwarfs? I looked up google reviews on it and it had some glowing recommendations, well it hasn\u2019t seemed to do much of anything for me. Ungrim already racks up a high kill count, but I noticed no increase as far as I could tell. \n\nSo I have changed it around to a couple other heroes, and none seem to be doing any better than before. I notice no effect of it in game either while watching (and I do have the hero/ lord engaged in melee).",
            "Trying to figure out if this was a bug. Was defending a siege as Dark Elves against Valkia that AR said would be a decisive defeat. I lined up my dark shards on the walls, hoping to focus her down. She flies ahead of her army and doesn\u2019t take much damage on the approach. She then lands on the wall in the middle of one group, and I start to lose hope. But after about 30 seconds of fighting, she explodes and is gone. That one group of dark shards took like 50% damage from the explosion but survived. I basically won the defense because her army couldn\u2019t do damage fast enough with her gone, but I\u2019m not sure what happened to her.",
            "Was there not a thread on this sub for the post released by Julian McKinley, the former AI programmer on Rome 2? He released a statement the other day and I wanted to see what this sub thought about it, but I can't see any mention of it.",
