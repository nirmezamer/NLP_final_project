            "Warhammer battle LoS is a bit odd. I just came from an Atilla campaign and a couple MP game where I was able to hide my troops behind hills but I found it was far harder in WH3 even if enemy has no flying unit. Did they change something or did they make it harder to hide naturally?",

            "Aside from Channeling stance, is there another way of generate more winds of magic? I\u2019m doing an Ostankya ROC campaign and the magic situation in the Chaos Wastes is absolutely awful. I\u2019ve got all these cool new spells but don\u2019t have enough magic to use them. Is it all RNG?",
            "Does the Huntsmarshal's Expedition have any specific doomstacks; or is usual empire stuff the way to go?",
            "115 turns into Boris campaign. Can confirm it's hard as shit. \n\nWhat's the consensus best way to play his start? The only thing I know for sure is that the way I've been doing it (whack-a-mole with every evil faction east of Malus and north of Kislev) is not it.",
            "Please can someone recommend a chilled-out RoC campaign. Considering buying the latest DLC but want to re-try the game first.",
            "(I'm playing warhammer btw)\n\nWhen do you guys fire up a new army? I have a consistent play pattern that I'd like to break - that play pattern being, I only use one army until maybe i reach my T5 buildings, then any subsequent armies are my endgame setups. I find I do this because in the beginning hero slots tend to be in short supply, and it takes time to build up buildings. I also find it more entertaining to stick with my initial army since they'll have the better units and my lord to make battles more interesting.\n\nHowever, I know other people will have multiple armies really quickly. Any tips on breaking this pattern? When do ya'll spin up a new army? Do you just take small settlements with your weaker armies until they're able to stand on their own?",
            "Can we still report bugs/glitches?\n\n\nFound out during my Beastmen campaign that you can't increase the Research Rate anymore apparently.\u00a0",
            "This is a silly question probably already answered a thousand different ways but hey uh I'm new to playing Total Warhammer 3 and I'm bad at it. How do I get good at it?\n\nSpecifically battles. I can read unit stats and get a broad idea of how they function in an army but I have no idea on tactics beyond the extreme basics like \"protect vulnerable units\", \"use cavalry to hit squishy ranged guys\". I often hear that auto-resolve is going to give you a worse result than playing it out yourself but there's nobody better than me at pulling a pyrrhic victory from the clutches of a close one. \n\nAll my battles end up being a big blob of units smashing into one another and then eventually one side wins. \n\nAre there any good resources you recommend for learning battle strategy? Warriors of Chaos are what I like to play but ideally I'm looking for broad tactics that can be applied to any army."

That one patch that gave us stuff like +100 ap or more from some random drop weapons, which was a debatable idea. \n\nIt's not the only one like this, so it's just one of the many balance issues that specifically make items a complete cointoss in terms of effectiveness.",

            "Why are there so many people in the replies talking about the fucking ward save\n\nDid they only read the first sentence in the title? It has nothing to do with that part. It's about the part makes just barely difference. You could remove the +10AP and you wouldnt notice because how how small of an impact it is.\n\n\"its just a bonus\" lol",
            "Yea. Items are just not given a good amount of thought imo",
            "Well some lords can have multiple items that give flat damage and % damage. All which stack with skill tree buffs. Having a few +10 +20 flat can scale quite well with % damage. If they made it higher like +50 etc it would become insane. This item also gives 16% ward save. Small numbers can count for more than you think."

        "content": "Just a quick story that opened my eyes to the powered of gyros. Playing as Malakai, Astragoth launches an invasion with a full 20 stack against a completely unprepared border (already in wars in numerous fronts). Well, I ceded a few settlements to fall back so I could recruit the basics. Got a thane, 3 dwarven warriors, 2 miners (blasting charges) 2 quarrelers, and some grudge settlers (quarreler, slayer, grudge throwers). The last turn before he reached me, I also managed to recruit 2 gyrocopters and the skybomber RoR. His army consisted of a Frontline of tier 1-3 units, mostly t2. His back line was a mass of goblin archers. Auto resolve told me it would be a close defeat but it normally fares better than I do so I didn't feel great but wanted to try.\n\nThe battle starts and the first big swing in my favor was the terrain. I started on top of a hill at the perfect range for my grudge thrower to get some hits in. I focus down his tier 3 units pretty well before they reach my Frontline.\n\nThe second big swing was baiting his lord on a flying mount in range of my quarreler using the gyros. He charged straight after them and then got baited into combat way to early. He had died before our lines were fully engaged.\n\nThe deciding moments came at the line clash however. I didn't want to expose my copters to missile fire so I held them in reserve until the lines were engaged and the missile infantry had started exchanging fire with mine. Fortunately, they deployed their missiles in pretty much a straight line. I took the bomber, lined it up and dropped all 5 bombs on one pass of his missile line. 3/6 instantly routed. 2 of the others were wavering. I then took my missile troops to focus down their last and used the bomber and 2 gyros to fire straight into the backs of their Frontline, which was superior in both numbers and quality to mine.. Ended up being a heroic victory! Probably one of the most fun battles in recent memory. I will now be pausing all offensives to retool every army to include at least one bomber and two copters.

            "Gyrocopters were always a cool concept, just borderline unplayable before Thrones of Decay. Gyrocopters used to have 4 instead of 12 models, bombers used to be just 1 instead of 4. CA also nearly doubled their ammo and increased armour piercing damage.\u00a0\n\n\nAll in all these are my favourite unit changes so far. took two meme units and turned them into serious damage dealers.\u00a0\n\n\nafter years of avoiding them like the plague it was a very pleasant surprise to see that they finally became useful.\u00a0",
            "Gyrocopters are game changers! Never underestimate the power of dwarven air support again!",
            "Well done! That had to feel awesome. Nice job baiting in the enemy lord.\n\nI do think that gyrocopters may work better firing from the side along the length of the enemy's line, if you want to experiment. Dragon breath and other abilities work similarly.",
            "Yeah, while the empire can now essentially play ww1/2 while going up against medieval peasants, the dwarves can now crank up CCR while napalming athel Loren.",
            "The changes they made to Gyrocopters/Gyrobombers were perfect honestly, I always keep 1 bomber(its more than enough, but can go 2 if a battle needs it) in all armies with 2 Gyrocopters(sometimes i use the trollhammer torpedoes one from the Grudge) and honestly they delete stuff easily as long as you distract the enemy units.\n\nThey are very strong but at the same time very weak if they get focused.",
            "Unpopular opinion:\n\nWhile I absolutely enjoy the Gyro changes (increased ammo, entities, engineers buffing them like crazy), I believe CA went a little too far and they are overpowered from a balancing perspective.\n\nYou get them super easily on T2, as well as Engineers who buff them to an insane level (speed, weapon strength, ammo, ammo restocks). In a Malakai campaign especially, you can have a doomstack with 3 Engineers and filled up with Gyros by turn 10, absolutely unstoppable for the AI on any difficulty, because AI can\u2018t counter them. Malakai\u2018s campaign ofc also makes this more exponential through the adventure mechanic and giving him additional recruit capacity for engineers in skill tree + an engineer as quest battle reward + gyro buffs through the first adventure you can run.\n\nIf you want easy mode campaign, there is almost no reason to recruit anything else for Dwarfs, I\u2018m sure its the same for all dwarf campaigns wven if Malakai\u2018s is \u201emost broken\u201c.",

Turns out Hellstorms struggle to hit helicopters, grenade launcher cavalry have the \"can't hit air\" trait, and Steam tanks can (eventually) be killed.",
            "I haven't used them since ToD, but I did try gyrocopters in a few campaigns well before the dlc and my god, they were awful. I'm glad they got buffed. =)"
