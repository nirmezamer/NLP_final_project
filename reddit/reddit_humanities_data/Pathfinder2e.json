            "Hello! Question about the Grab trait in the Zombie Shambler attack. Does 'Grab' as a trait of the claw attack mean that if the Strike is a success, the Zombie can spend an action to automatically grab the target? Or does it mean that as a function of the Strike Action being successful the Grab attempt is also made (and you then make a Grapple check on behalf of the zombie, with a success meaning the target is hit for damage AND grabbed within one action)?",
            "Aside from what Blawharag said, I recommend you check out pathbuilder. Its a great, very easy to use tool for players to build characters. AND it can export those sheets into VTT with a module! Handy!",
            "Each damage is it's own instance of damage so you'd take 0 damage.",
            "This was a change in the remaster. Before it was an action to auto grab. Now it is an athletics check with no MAP. The athletics check still costs an action and is a separate check after hitting the strike. \n\nHope that helps.",
            "Thanks. \n\nJust to clarify, if the one damage somehow has 2 damage types, like 5 damage (piercing and slashing) vs. resistance 3 to all physical damage. Then, in this case, I would take 2 damage since it's one damage instance, right?",
            "It does - thanks a bunch!",
            "Effects which cause this would specify how that's happening. For example, many firearms have the \"concussive\" trait, which makes the damage count as bludgeoning or piercing based on whichever damage type the target has less resistance/immunity to. Diabolic Dragons have a passive that makes all their fire damage count, instead, as spirit - unholy damage if that would be \"worse\" for the person taking the damage (GM decides what's \"worse\").\n\nThere won't be a case where something is just labeled as \"piercing/bludgeoning\" and you're left to figure it whatever the fuck that's supposed to mean.",
            "The other common case where a single source of damage can qualify for multiple weaknesses are Swarms, who generally have weakness to area and splash. For example, if you hit a swarm that also has fire weakness with a fireball, you only use the highest applicable weakness to the area fire damage.",
            "How does resistance to all physical damage apply to an attack that has multiple damage types?\n\nFor example, if I have resistance 3 to all physical damage and an enemy attack with 3 slashing and 3 piercing damage. Would I take 3 or 0 damage?\n\nFrom my understanding, the rule said to refer to weakness and weakness only trigger once, so I would take 3 damage. \n\nUnless \"resistance to all physical damage\" uses the same rule as \"resistance to all damage\"?"

        "content": "A couple of years ago, I posted Variant Proficiency, a guide for Proficiency without Level. It went relatively under the radar, but I still got some useful feedback. Now, with that feedback, more ideas and more testing, I am ready to present a new and improved version, now named Flatfinder.  \nI realized that it is better marketed as a system hack than a variant rule, because it really feels like another game, despite the text being just a few pages long. The name change, inspired by Minotaur Games' Hopefinder and u/RussischerZar 's [Half-Finder](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/kqfqai/i_present_halffinder_the_variant_rule_no_one/), is meant to emphasize that. I don't want newcomers to see this and think \"Oh, yes, this is the definitive way to play Pathfinder\", rather \"This is not Pathfinder, but based on it\".  \nThinking of it as a hack also allowed me to get a bit more creative with the changes. Removing level from proficiency is a significant shift in game design philosophy, and requires a shift in approach when playing and running the game. This inspired a new tool/mechanic: I am sure you will be able to tell as soon as you read it.\n\nWithout further ado: [https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/Dn-97Ro82ibq](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/Dn-97Ro82ibq)",

            "I realize that the new Treat Wounds is a bit clunky, but a key feature of Treat Wounds in Pathfinder is that expected healing scales with level. Flat DCs with flat proficiency and flat healing amounts can't replicate that, so I decided to scale healing amounts.",
            "I appreciate you sharing. \n\nI am having trouble seeing the need for this. The introduction cites that an adventure for a level 10 party is trivialized by a level 18 character. (This may not be true, because 1 character may not be trained in all the skills, but I grant the argument to ring true.) The other example was that characters revisiting a challenge after several levels come back to find its not a challenge anymore. I dont see a problem with this. In a game where your hero eventually rivals Gods in power by gaining levels, why should crafting +1 armor remain a challenge for them? Its not see easy a problem to solve, because level does come into play with skill checks in a variety of ways. (See below.)\n\nYou seem to be chasing realism in a game, where as you level up, you can no longer die from a single sword hit. As for me, I like the idea that increasing in level makes you a more potent hero in both combat and out of combat. The issue is that you seem to want to keep the combat level scaling and not the skills. I dont see a reason to have one and not the other.   I will grant you that it is weird on its face that DCs for PCs to face go up with level somewhat arbitrarily. But so do the monster hit points. An alternative solution would be to not increase difficulties for characters that are not part of the core adventure.  So, yes, the merchants do not get better at haggling as you level up, but you are better at haggling. \n\nOffering some constructive input here. One problem you have is that some skill check results are tied to level. This means you may need to rewrite more rules. \n\nEarn income and crafting are tied to level. Treat wounds is also affected, which you have rules for. Regarding earn income, I suppose now a lvl 1 would have the same chance to earn money as a lvl 14 level (maybe at -4?), which completely breaks the gold economy, which is based on combat level.  (Even if they fail the check, they make buckets of money.) So then, you have to add a level restriction to what tasks you can attempt, in lieu of adding level to the DC.   And now you just broke verisimilitude, which you were trying to accomplish. This problem is demonstrated in the treating wounds hit point result is based on the combat level.\n\nI see your competence checks could address these problem with further development. But right now, the competence check lacks the granularity of every +1 mattering.  And since every level does matter for creating and earn income, you need this.   But then it seems we come back full circle to lvl affecting outcome of the skill."

They were away last week and honestly the session was way more fun and everyone (there are 5 players) seemed to get more of a chance to engage with NPCs and make fun things happen. Before, the loud person was virtually driving the plot forward themselves. I don't hate this person, I actually only just recently noticed this was happening, I have played a whole campaign with them in the past. We are playing SOT at the moment, so there is a lot of role play, it's so it's coming through a bit stronger than before.\n\nWhat do I do? How do a talk about this without sounding like a complete asshole? I don't want them to feel bad or to get kicked out or anything, but it's really bothering me that the quieter people in our group are not engaging with the story very much when they are around. They are also not the face of the party but insist on talking to virtually every NPC, and insert themselves in every conversation between party members. It's a shame because I like playing with this group allot.  How can I approach this in a way that doesn't come off like, \"you talk too much\" or \"you are playing wrong\".\n\nEdit: Thanks for the replies everyone ill talk to the gm and if he bounces me out ill have to find another game.",
