I have the cheat codes I want to use for the game, but I have no idea how to apply them to the game.\n\nOf course I searched for a tutorial before making this post, but all that came up was how to install cheat.db (I assume it's a database of cheat codes that exists in PPSSPP).

            "Additional question copied from a post about a month old that nobody ever responded to:\nI\u2019m trying to use controllers on Mednafen, but can never seem to get it to respond properly. I\u2019ll have to check the frontend I\u2019m using, but it only seems to work with my SteelSeries Stratus Duo, and even then I can\u2019t set up my own control mappings, which means I\u2019m stuck with the default, which uses the joystick instead of the D-Pad - needless to say, it does not work very well. I tried using a USB SNES controller, hoping it would recognize it, but it didn\u2019t, and I can\u2019t seem to select a specific input device to use like Dolphin. I just have to rely on its own autodetection. Does anybody know how to fix this? I hate how uncooperative this can be, I really wish Saturn emulation was more readily available.\n\nEdit: My frontend is Mednaffe",

Everything is literally just fine, it runs well, connects. The only god damn problem is that for some reason Mod Loader 64 doesn't recognize my XBOX ONE controller and I have no idea why. I tried replugging controller, launching ModLoader with Administrator, rebooting my pc, nothing seems to work. Even after all that, when i go to Input Config, and the I press on Device, it only shows me the keyboard, nothing else. Does anyone know what can I do to fix this and play?"

            "I really want to point out the progress made on the NES core this release (and the last release really). At this point the NES core is just about on par with Mesen in turns of accuracy (Mesen still has more unlicensed/aftermarket mapper support though). But a fairly new contributor took it upon themselves to really improve the NES core and has done a tremendous job. Both the APU and PPU pretty much pass all known tests at this point, and the entire licensed library runs as intended with no known glitches, which moves ares into the forefront of accurate NES emulators now. \n\nAnother contributor has been working hard on the Gameboy Advance core as well making excellent progress. ares now is close to passing the AGS Aging Cartridge test rom, and is doing much better compared to other well known GBA emulators.   \n  \nLots of ares cores are in the upper echelon of accurate emulators, but its always great to see new contributors show up and really work at improving some cores that typically don't get a lot of attention. Everyone really appreciates the time and commitment these folks put in to improving these cores. \n\nWould love to see someone or someones show up and pick up the PC-Engine & CD-ROM and really push that core forward. They are not in terrible shape, but really need someone familiar with these systems to complete support. The Famicom Disk System also needs a tiny bit of love - there seems to be an issue with swapping disks with some games that needs some attention that would correct most remaining games. And there a few cores that have a few games with issues that would be nice to wrap up, like a handful of Game Gear games that need improvements to EEPROM emulation. Lots of opportunity to contribute, so if you have the necessary skills it is easy to get involved.",

            "RetroAchievements is on the roadmap, but unfortunately, we are blocked by a design flaw with the RetroAchievments system.\n\nFor a long time, RetroArch was the only frontend/suite that supported retro achievements, and this has led to achievements for some systems accidentally relying on internal implementation details of various emulators: specifically how they represent guest memory.\n\nSome emulators store memory in the same endianness (byte order) as the real console, and others byte swap as a performance optimisation and/or a way to simplify the code.\n\nMany achievements written for big-endian platforms (MegaDrive, N64, etc) are assuming little-endian byte order and are incompatible with emulators that maintain original guest byte order.\n\nI/we are reluctant to implement RetroAchievements until this is resolved.\n\nSee https://github.com/RetroAchievements/rcheevos/issues/302 for further discussion."
