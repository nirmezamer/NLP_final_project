I have the cheat codes I want to use for the game, but I have no idea how to apply them to the game.\n\nOf course I searched for a tutorial before making this post, but all that came up was how to install cheat.db (I assume it's a database of cheat codes that exists in PPSSPP). I only want to use a few specific cheats, so there's no need to download the whole database. If someone could tell me how to do it here or give me a tutorial video that would be helpful, that would be great.",

            "This might never be answered but I am running outta patience and options. I am setting up ModLoader64 to play LOZ Majora's Mask with a friend. Everything is literally just fine, it runs well, connects. The only god damn problem is that for some reason Mod Loader 64 doesn't recognize my XBOX ONE controller and I have no idea why. I tried replugging controller, launching ModLoader with Administrator, rebooting my pc, nothing seems to work. Even after all that, when i go to Input Config, and the I press on Device, it only shows me the keyboard, nothing else. Does anyone know what can I do to fix this and play?",
