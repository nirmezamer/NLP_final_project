            "Love bill saying he wouldn\u2019t want a big draft room in case the players a bust and they have video of you celebrating while also having a clip of him fist pumping when the Celtics drafted James young",
            "As if Bill watched more than five minutes total of college basketball this year",
            "\"If he's gonna be a bigger Jrue Holiday that'll be the best pick in the draft.\"\n\nA bigger Jrue Holiday would be one of the most impactful players of the last decade.\n\nBS really leaning on Bilas as a credible source, Ryen had to point out that he just doesn't know anything about the foreign players and is in the tank for NCAA guys.",
            "\"Two swings at the apple\"",
            "Bill being fully in on McCain based on body language and \"swag\" just because he saw him play his kid's school a couple times is peak Bill.  Do you think it occurs to him at all that most of these guys probably looked like alphas in high school, he just didn't see it?",
            "Laughing at Russillo saying that \u201call of Reed Sheppards misses were awesome last year.\u201d Guess he missed the Oakland game",
            "Really big dumb guy energy from Bill in this one.\n\nThe few players he likes are swinging tons of games next year and circling games on their calendars, but also this draft doesn\u2019t matter because everyone is bad so the pistons should have just traded down to 9 because who cares?\n\nSo stupid.",
            "Love the criticism of Portland taking Clingan because they have Ayton and Rob \u201cIR\u201d Williams. \nDid he forget the axiom that you never ever draft for need when you\u2019re a terrible team? \n\nI\u2019m not even a big Clingan guy, but that critique was ludicrous.",
            "\"Bill getting his guy at 30.\" They've shat on every single guy in this draft for the last 6 months despite knowing less than a handful of names, basically called everyone unplayable but yeah the guy the Celtics got is so great, furshure Bills guy..."

            "I'm guessing anyone not funny will just get downvoted I'm sure the bill Simmons audience is one of the most balanced left to right of most subs or fandoms",
            "I think I'm around option 3. You need to create at least some nexus to the establish simmons subreddit lore. like i did a stupid post saying we need jacko back on (it flopped, nbd) but like i think that's fair game because i both sincerely think it would be fun and also people wanting jacko back on the pod is like a somewhat recurring thing on here.",
            "I feel like the mods have a good read of what kind of posts to take down.  Generally I think the sub should probably lean more into jokes and sports/movie nerd shit, but there's probably someone in the community with something actually interesting to say on politics now and then.\n\nI also enjoy that the response tends to be more banning a user than taking down their post, because the sub has way more of a recorded history you can dig through than other subs where mods tend to be a little more overbearing in the way they censor their subs.",

            "Wild Biden is getting ran by people right now, he at least has people around him that will make decent choices. Trump is actively poison and fully aware he is running this country into the ground because yuge ego and the biggest baby hands in the world",
            "I might vote for a Nixon or Goldwater style Republican over Biden, who could easily be mistaken for a moderate Republican himself in pre-MAGA times when such things still existed, but Reagan did his second term with basically no cognitive capacity left at the height of the cold war and managed not to nuke anyone by accident so Dr. Jill being the de facto president for a term is still better than Trump.",
            "I genuinely don't think the DNC gives a fuck one way or another.  If Biden wins, they control the executive another term and make bank off donors.  If Trump wins, they probably raise even more money hawking the concept of how desperately people need to give them donations in order to fight the GOP.\n\nMoney train keeps rolling either way.",
            "When Trump wins again can\u2019t wait for the democrats to blame the left of the party once again. Who have been saying this about Biden for 4 years, after supporting him in 2020"
