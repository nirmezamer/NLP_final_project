You need to create at least some nexus to the establish simmons subreddit lore. like i did a stupid post saying we need jacko back on (it flopped, nbd) but like i think that's fair game because i both sincerely think it would be fun and also people wanting jacko back on the pod is like a somewhat recurring thing on here.",

Generally I think the sub should probably lean more into jokes and sports/movie nerd shit, but there's probably someone in the community with something actually interesting to say on politics now and then.\n\nI also enjoy that the response tends to be more banning a user than taking down their post, because the sub has way more of a recorded history you can dig through than other subs where mods tend to be a little more overbearing in the way they censor their subs.",

If Trump wins, they probably raise even more money hawking the concept of how desperately people need to give them donations in order to fight the GOP.\n\nMoney train keeps rolling either way.",
