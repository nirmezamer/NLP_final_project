        "content": "The [2024 Morrowind Modathon Modding Competition](https://imgur.com/KW3sVhP) - the 10th anniversary of the Modathons, celebrating 22 years of Morrowind, has officially come to a close! It was another exciting year with a ton of great mods! Though not quite as many as in past years.\n\nOverall, 173 new mods were released for the 2024 Modathon by roughly 89 individual modders with tons of new content! Exciting new quests and adventures, new stories to be told, massive new dungeons to delve through, new card games to play, new mechanics to transform the experience of exploring Morrowind, and plenty more besides!\n\nMore so than in past years, 2024 was a year for content mods, with a record number of new dungeon mods and a massive number of quest mods tying with last year's record, not to mention a surprising number of new landmasses. We had new stories and adventures co-written by original Morrowind developer Douglas Goodall aka AFFA and Melchior Dahrk with [Red Wisdom](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54525) and [The Popular Plague](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54730).

From [two new dungeon overhauls](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/stonedoughnut5/mods?gameId=100) by Vennin, to Markond's [The Woe of Indalen Tomb](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54661), to Lord Zarcon's massive dungeon overhaul for the sewers and ruins of Mournhold with the [UnderCity](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54773), to Glittegear's [numerous overhauls for the shrines and caverns](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/GlitterGear/mods?gameId=100) of Vvardenfell, the amount of content here is staggering. And that extends to new dungeon-delving adventures too! Including a new landmass dungeon mod by Juidius, Melchior Dahrk, and Seelof [Baal Duun - Cursed Isle of the Four Corners](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54780).\n\nThere were new [puzzle-based dungeon delves](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54586), immersive new audio and voice additions with [S.W.I.T](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54390) and [S.E.R.A](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54396), a new card-game for you to play with a [Round of Flin](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54755), turn-based combat overhauls with [Baldurwind](https://modding-openmw.gitlab.io/s3ctors-s3cret-st4sh/baldurwind/), stunningly atmospheric locations with [Balmora Trading Post](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54534) and [The Song of the Grazelands](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54652), new Skyrim-style [dynamically animated actors](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54782), a massive landscape overhaul for the Inner Sea with [Waters of Morrowind](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50203), and so many more highlights besides!\n\nAfter 22 years, there is still so much more new content being produced for this amazing game, the Morrowind Modding Community continues to grow and expand, to ever improve and add onto this beautiful alien world! The future is very bright indeed, and there has never been a better time to play Morrowind than right now!\n\nBut of course, as always, we have a full breakdown of all 173 mods submitted for the 2024 Modathon down below, organized by category for your convenience!\n\n**Animation Mods:**\n\n1.
