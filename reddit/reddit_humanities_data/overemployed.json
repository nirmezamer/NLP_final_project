            "Like you're going to get promoted anyway.  Look at the org chart.  It's shaped like a pyramid.  That means as you go up the chart there are fewer and fewer positions, which means your odds of being promoted decrease dramatically.\n\nIt's not \"climbing the ladder\" because it's not a ladder.  It's more like a competition where you have to defeat everyone else to win.  No thanks.\n\nI've built a career out of avoiding management.  After 34 years I'm still just a developer, and totally happy with that role.  I've seen several times were someone gets promoted to project manager, then their skills stagnate for a few years, then they get fired at the next recession.  And presto:  unemployable because your skills are stale.",

            "There are all sorts of safety-related limits to how much flying and when a pilot can fly next, etc.  This is irresponsible.\n\nIf they were up-front about it, there is a single log-book for flight hours, and the the two corps can do the right thing, start hiding hours... bad news for everyone.",
            "It's crazy she got away with it, even if only for 6ish months, but it crosses the line of when overemployment is not ok. She is not only putting hundreds of people in danger if she makes a careless error from exhaustion, but also because if something happens where people are hurt and the pilot's dupe work is discovered as a result, it could lead to real jail time, steep fines, and a lifetime ban from commercial flying (in addition to likely being wracked with guilt).\n\nCall me crazy, but the risk/reward here is way out of whack.",
            "You have to record your flight hours and can only fly 1000 hours a year (commercially). This is just dangerous because pilots are required to get a certain amount of downtime to rest.",

Usually, I\u2019m against most articles that trash OE\u2019ers or whatnot, but this woman literally was risking lives.\n\nBack when I was 19 and a fresh-faced, full of energy teen, I was training to be a paramedic. I was on night shifts while training and \u201csupposed\u201d to sleep during the day. That\u2019s what you\u2019d do on a day shift, having a few hours before bed to relax.\n\nWell, it was daylight, and guys, world of Warcraft was in its prime. I would get home and game until 2 pm then get 3 hours sleep. I fucking fell asleep - ASLEEP - in front of a patient in the back of an ambulance, sitting upright, blue lights blaring.\n\nSleep deprivation doesn\u2019t care what situation you\u2019re in, you just won\u2019t get a choice, and then 200+ people die.",

I said that they could keep me on retainer for 1/2 my salary, and would be available 1 hour a week to consult with my replacement. Figured I could get a month out of it. My replacement kept telling them he needed more help, so one month became two, became three, and after a year, I started to think of it as J2...\n\nAnyway, my golden goose finally went to the farm upstate, and I found another J2 that I start next month.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm pretty friendly with the guy who brought me into J1. Love working with him, he's a mentor. He's been telling me for months that he's been looking for another job, and finally found one. Now he's OE, and I know about it.\n\nHe's been hinting to me like \"when are you going to find another job?\". He's much higher up in the company, and now he drops it on me that layoffs are coming.\n\nI really want to tell him that it's all good, I have been OE for 2 years, and I'll be OE again in three weeks. But I can't and have to get it off my chest here.\n\nGood luck out there, keep your cards close to your chest.\n\n",
