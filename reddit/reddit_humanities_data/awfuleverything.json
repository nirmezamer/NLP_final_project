        "content": " Hello r/awfuleverything community,\n\nWe want to inform you that we will not be permitting content depicting conflicts related to the Israel-Palestine war. \n\nSimply put, **our mod team is not equipped to handle these discussions effectively.**\n\nRecent articles, such as [this one](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/technology/hamas-violent-videos-online), highlight how groups like Hamas are using poor moderation to their advantage. Our team is comprised of volunteers, and we lack the resources and capabilities required for thorough fact-checking in an event as complex as this conflict. We want to avoid contributing to misinformation and ensuring the accuracy of content.\n\nFurthermore, this community is not well-suited to handle content like this. While the situation is undoubtedly awful, we initially disallowed political content for a specific reason. Time and time again, this subreddit has proven itself unable to discuss such topics in a civil and constructive manner.\n\nWe appreciate your understanding and cooperation in this matter as we strive to maintain the quality and integrity of our subreddit.",

I\u2019m not defending their decision, just adding context because maybe 5% of people actually read the articles on Reddit posts past the headline.",
            "You can love or hate Jordan Peterson, I'm meh on him myself, but he does use an amazing term about people \"Being victims to their compassion,\" which has made me think more deeply than most quotes in the last few years. Being accepting and having equality is good, but this kind of thing goes so far that it is now being considered racist or bigoted to protect your own people, enforce your own laws. This has to change. The guests and refugees being taken in need to be aware they are guests and refugees, not the new masters, free to make their own laws to follow which the natives must embrace. Perhaps it is time to start considering an expulsion.",
