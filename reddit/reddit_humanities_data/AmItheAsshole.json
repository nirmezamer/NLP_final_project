So we thought we\u2019d take a break this month, and revisit something we did in an earlier open forum. Hence, the call to ASSemble! (We had a few names that we were throwing around. ASS (Assholes Sharing Stories), Asshole Amnesty Month.\n\nTell us about a time when you were the asshole. We can relax *some* sub rules a bit (a revenge story is probably fine, since you\u2019re recalling, and not asking for judgment). But, other sub rules still apply (no violent encounters, for example)! Let us know about a time when you knew you were the asshole. Maybe you didn\u2019t mean to be, but after the encounter, you realized you were TA. Or, maybe you knew what you were doing, and went through with it anyway! \n\nPersonally, I've always felt the more low-stakes the issue, the better. Those are always my favorite AITA stories, but feel free to share whatever you may have. And most important - have fun with it! \n\n___\n\n#As always, do not directly link to posts/comments or post uncensored screenshots here. Any comments with links will be removed.\n\n---\n\nWe'd like to highlight the regional spinoffs we have linked on the sidebar!

One time he went to the bathroom and she immediately got some guy to buy her a drink and then when BF came back, she cried about this guy coming on to her, won't take no, tried to grope her, etc. BF grabs the guy, but before he could do anything I yelled out she's lying to you. Everything stops, people around start agreeing with me, BF looks around, tells GF they're leaving.\n\nTwo years later I married him, married 30+ years now.",

He and I were both huge fans of a particular TV show, and he dropped into conversation that he'd introduced his partner to it and they were watching through it together. That got us talking about the show again, bouncing off each other about things we enjoyed about it, aaaaand I got overexcited and dropped a massive spoiler for the final season.

Went out about 3 am and egged both of their parents cars.  You can imagine the mess.  Heard the parents talking about it, and I chimed in with, \"Yeah, I got hit twice this week..wow!\"",

During our early dates he continually references to what a high paid job he has, he hasn\u2019t given me a figure but has suggested mid 6 figures.

He makes a big deal about it and I\u2019m very excited and look up the menu. \n\nWhen we arrive at the restaurant, it becomes clear that he has pre-ordered/paid in advance for their saver menu, which only allows choice between 2 dinner options and desserts for a substantially reduced price. I didn\u2019t really like the look of either of the two mains but ordered what seemed like it would be the best. \n\nNow I\u2019m all for getting a bargain but what I don\u2019t like is someone who claims to have a very high salary saying he\u2019ll take me to a fancy restaurant and then not being able to order what I want to eat (I\u2019d never take the piss but it felt so limited). The expectation from him was then that I was meant to be so grateful to him for \u2018giving me a taster of the High life\u2019 when reality the saver menu was actually cheaper than most local restaurants. I\u2019m always grateful for any date who offers to cover my meal but this didn\u2019t sit well with me here. At the end of the date, I said it was a shame I couldn\u2019t have had what I really wanted off the full menu and he told me I was ungrateful.\n\nI appreciate this isn\u2019t life changing but AITA for being a bit disappointed and annoyed at this, and letting him know that?\n\n",

I would have left when he told me to order off the saver menu only. \nWhat was he thinking?? He would have been better to not take you out at all rather than do that. Its not giving you a taste of the high life when youre not allowed to order any of the food! You dont take a kid to disneyland and tell them they cant go on any rides!!

        "content": "My cousin is approaching six-hundred pounds and requires a mobility scooter, as walking even short distances is very painful for her.  In July, she has an out of state wedding to attend, and I was asked to taxi her to and from the event, as I'm not currently employed so my calendar is open.\n\nUnfortunately, my car will not carry a mobility scooter, so my cousin will be required to use a wheel chair.  The problem is that this event is being held in a public park.  I can barely push her wheelchair on a paved surface, let alone across grass and dirt.  I tried contacting a couple rental agencies in the area but they would not lease scooters in this case because of the off-road use.  My aunt and uncle have also declined to loan me their truck, which is how my cousin normally gets around, because I have a pretty shitty driving history.\n\nI did look into renting a vehicle that could carry the scooter, but my cousin cannot afford to pay for that and obviously with me being jobless, I can't either.\n\nThe distance from parking to the event area is about forty-yards, which my cousin cannot handle walking.  About the best solution anyone's come up with is that the party has a flat bed they're using to tote supplies from the cars, but my cousin says she would feel humiliated having to be rolled in like that.\n\nMy cousin is furious with me, saying I'm shaming her by saying I cannot push her, but I feel it's the honest truth.  Like 100% the thin wheels of the wheelchair are going to dig into the ground, and I am not strong enough to handle that.  My cousin has done a lot for me in the past, so I do feel bad saying no, but I feel like I've looked into every option at this point.  AITA for not being willing to just go and give it the college try?\n\nAlso, please don't degrade my cousin.  I know I can't stop you, but it's all been said before.  Please and thank you.",

            "NTA The reality is that most people can't push 600 lbs around on flat pavement much less harsher terrain. It's not a fat-shaming issue, it just isn't something most people can do.",
            "And I also want to say that I mean absolutely no offense, but is she even capable to take a long car ride?    I watch my 600lb life, and a lot of those people aren't capable of going on long car rides.     Idk the situation here though.   Just something to think about.",

Unless you have a pickup, and she rides in the back, your car is NOT made for that kind of heavy duty work.  For example:  A Dodge charger can only carry 865lbs total if the weight is equally distributed.  Yes I know it can probably handle more, but tell your family it simply isn't safe.   Maybe this can be her wakeup call?  She's too big to attend a wedding.",
            "NTA. She needs to accept that her size comes with limitations. Its not mean or rude to admit that you physically cant handle pushing her in her wheelchair around. Im sure thats hard for your cousin to hear but its not on you.\n\nETA: shell be even more embarrassed if you do give it a go and you cant push her and shes stuck and you need someone elses help.",
            "NTA. Is your cousin an adult? If so she is responsible for figuring out her own transportation. I cant imagine anything more humiliating for her than getting stuck in the dirt/grass in a wheelchair, so that doesnt seem like a viable option.\n\nIf your aunt and uncle are typically responsible for transporting her, then I would shift responsibility back to them. They can either drive her, ask someone else to take her who they trust with their truck, or hire a driver.",

            "You are NTA. My wife weighs 230 lbs. I weigh 135. I am reasonably fit. My wife has dementia and has increasing balance issues. I picked up a transport chair (wheelchair designed to be pushed not wheeled by the person in it). I thought that it would mean that we could take walks again. She could walk for as long as she wanted and then I could push her the rest of the way. Well, not so much. On our first use of it, I discovered that I could push her in it on flat, perfect pavement, but any incline or rough surface was not possible. I cant imagine trying to push someone over 600 lbs."
