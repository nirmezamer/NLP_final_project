So we thought we\u2019d take a break this month, and revisit something we did in an earlier open forum. Hence, the call to ASSemble! (We had a few names that we were throwing around. ASS (Assholes Sharing Stories), Asshole Amnesty Month.\n\nTell us about a time when you were the asshole. We can relax *some* sub rules a bit (a revenge story is probably fine, since you\u2019re recalling, and not asking for judgment). But, other sub rules still apply (no violent encounters, for example)! Let us know about a time when you knew you were the asshole. Maybe you didn\u2019t mean to be, but after the encounter, you realized you were TA. Or, maybe you knew what you were doing, and went through with it anyway! \n\nPersonally, I've always felt the more low-stakes the issue, the better. Those are always my favorite AITA stories, but feel free to share whatever you may have. And most important - have fun with it! \n\n___\n\n#As always, do not directly link to posts/comments or post uncensored screenshots here. Any comments with links will be removed.\n\n---\n\nWe'd like to highlight the regional spinoffs we have linked on the sidebar!

One time he went to the bathroom and she immediately got some guy to buy her a drink and then when BF came back, she cried about this guy coming on to her, won't take no, tried to grope her, etc. BF grabs the guy, but before he could do anything I yelled out she's lying to you. Everything stops, people around start agreeing with me, BF looks around, tells GF they're leaving.\n\nTwo years later I married him, married 30+ years now.",
            "Okay, here's something that still keeps me up at night. I was at a friend's house, hanging out with him and his partner. He and I were both huge fans of a particular TV show, and he dropped into conversation that he'd introduced his partner to it and they were watching through it together. That got us talking about the show again, bouncing off each other about things we enjoyed about it, aaaaand I got overexcited and dropped a massive spoiler for the final season. I realised immediately what I'd done and I was absolutely moritfied. I wasn't invited back :/",
            "I was an AH...but.  When we were first married, we rented a 2nd floor apt from a really nice widow.  I had to park in a small graveled area right by her house, but not on anyone's property.  Couple of the jagov kids tomatoed and egged my car because they couldn't play wiffle ball there.\n\nPut a couple of eggs in my trunk, for a couple of weeks (it was a hot summer).   Went out about 3 am and egged both of their parents cars.  You can imagine the mess.  Heard the parents talking about it, and I chimed in with, \"Yeah, I got hit twice this week..wow!\"",

We had a double whammy of a day to get through because my parents had a lunch meal for the day, my spouse\u2019s grandparents always did a very fancy evening dinner, and then everyone would convene at a local bar that we had all been going to since before we were legal to enter bars.\u00a0\n\nThings got very rowdy, especially for those of us who had already sat through two Christmas meals with wine and who were now very deep into their cups. But finally the lights came out and it was time to leave.\u00a0\n\nOne of the family members who owned the bar came up to me and took my wine out of my hand. Well to my drunken mind, this would not stand. I lectured him loudly and vehemently about how he had no right to just take my drink and that maybe I wanted to finish it and he wasn\u2019t the boss of me, and I finished up with \u201cWho died and made you Elvis?! You ain\u2019t the king!\u201d He stared at me. Silently poured the remainder of my wine into a roadie cup (this was an area where Togo cups were permissible, as long as the open container was not in a moving car), and handed it back to me. I said \u201coh.\u201d And he walked away.\u00a0\n\nI was mortified for days after.",

            "I used to be really terrible about spoiling books for people. To the point where when I got HP book 5 my brother (who was my roommate at the time) had me read it out loud to him. We were fairly rural so it was delivered via UPS late in the evening. I read almost 900 pages to him that night so I couldn\u2019t give away anything. \n\nNow I read books nobody else in my life cares about (free or cheap ones on Kindle Unlimited) or \\*after\\* someone recommends it.",
            "I once had a roommate with whom I split grocery bills. We were on bad terms when I was moving out (kind of an everybody was an asshole situation, although I will hold in my own mind that she was the bigger asshole, but I digress) and so she started going around the kitchen like \"well you ate more cheese than I did, so I get to keep more cheese. You used more flour than I did, so I get to keep more flour.\" That kind of nonsense.\n\nSo I was like oooooooooh I can play that game!!! I had paid for the command hooks, so I walked around the apartment and took down EVERYTHING that we had hung on the walls (a lot of things, mostly hers) and took all the command hooks (leaving her pictures and art and stuff leaned against the walls all over the place). I didn't want them for anything, and ended up donating them down the road, but if she was going to nickel and dime me about flour and cheese she sure as hell was not keeping those command hooks!\n\nHonestly, this was an asshole move and I'm usually not an asshole, but I will die proud of it."

They're physically identical, to the point where even my parents get them mixed up when we visit, and my wife's parents just call them \"the twins.\" This is extremely frustrating for me, and I don't think it's healthy for them. There are so many people where we live who see two girls with similar features and decide that makes them the same person, which they are not, and I'm beyond sick of it. I'm sick of getting two of everything at christmas and birthdays, even though they have drastically different interests, personalities, and styles. I'm sick of hearing how they're \"creepy\" or look like dolls, or having my daughters referred to as a \"set.\" At their pre-K, the teachers always kept them together, and often called them the wrong names, which apparently led to some critical information being attributed to the wrong child. \n\nI'm done with this. They're going into Kindergarten in September, and I'm enrolling them in different schools. They're both private Catholic schools, similar price range, similar prestige, as much as a kindergarten can have prestige. Elsa has a longer commute in the morning than Anna, but that's the only major inequality here, and honestly, I think the extra fifteen minutes in the car is worth it in order to have my daughters each recognized as individuals at school. If they're not in the same class, teachers don't know them both, students don't know them both, then my girls will each get the same individual attention as any other kid, rather than half.\n\nMy wife thinks I'm setting them up for resentment if one school turns out better than the other, and that I'm being unfair to Elsa by having her commute be longer. I let my daughters choose which school each one wanted to go to, and Elsa chose hers because there's birds on the logo. I get that ideally, it would be great to send all our kids to the same school, but I also genuinely believe that giving them this experience apart from one another is crucial for their social and emotional development into emotionally stable adults. \n\nAITA? \n\nTL;DR: Sending my daughters to separate schools of similar caliber in order to keep people from seeing them as extensions of one another, is this unfair?

            "As someone with a twin sister myself, I totally get where you are coming from. My sister and I were regularly called the twins, called by the wrong name, seen as a set, always had both of us included. This led to major issues in the differentiation process, when we started wanting to be individuals. We also had a hard time learning how to create social bonds as teenagers/adults.\n\nThankfully my school was clever enough not to put us in the same classroom.\n\nThere were tensions because of unequal amount of homework, and friendships, etc. But compared to the times people would confuse us, and not see us as individuals, it was preferable.\n\nThere is no right or wrong answer, but it's definitely healthy to give them space, although it might not always be easy. Be prepared to navigate jealousy and comparison because people will compare them anyway. There's a whole branch of psychology specialising in issues twins face, if you're interested.\n\nEdit: adding judgement because I forgot, NTA",
            "I think what you're doing is a good idea IF-- and only IF-- you're willing to listen to your daughters and change their schools if they ask for it. If one school ends up being better than the other in later years, if your daughters find they want to be at the same school, whatever. Listen to what they voice about the situation after they've tried it. NAH.",
            "NAH. BUT. For future reference it may be worth finding a larger school and enrolling them in separate classrooms. Private schools especially can have wildly asynchronous school year calendars, and you are going to be sad if spring breaks don\u2019t align, random inservice  days off school etc. Not to mention the risk of the kids having music concerts or school plays on the same night, etc. They won\u2019t have any school friends in common so you can look forward to twice the amount of commuting to birthday parties, sleepovers etc. \n\nI applaud you for cherishing their individuality. Other fun stuff like different haircuts, hair color streaks etc can help them help other people see them as individuals.",
            "NTA. If you can arrange that when you drop Anna off in the morning then you also pick her up first as well. This way both girls have a chance to talk to you privately (Elsa in the morning after Anna is dropped off and Anna in the afternoon on the way to pick Elsa up) and it not just one kid having that opportunity everyday. \n\nThey might not have anything that they need to say privately or interesting when they are this young but the benefits will manifest when they are older.",
            "NAH, though shouldn\u2019t this be a decision you and your wife make together? It would be an easier decision to support if the schools were more tailored to each individual child than a preference over a logo. I think traditionally this issue is handled by having the girls in separate classes at the same school, so I think you need a particularly strong reason to deviate from that. Especially since you haven\u2019t even tried it yet \u2014 though I also get that\u2019s a decision you don\u2019t want to be making later, so it\u2019s a now or never type of thing. So, I get it, that\u2019s the reason for my NAH vote.",

            "NTA, i'm an identical twin and I wish my parents had put us in separate schools. I'm in my 40's now and I look back at my life and there is a lot of anxiety, depression and lack of overall social skills that I can trace back to my being a twin. We were never treated as individuals, even though my parents did insist on us being in separate classes in grade school we defaulted to having the same friends because if you're friends with one sister why not the other? We became very co-dependent socially and were constantly compared to each other which resulted in extreme depression in my sister and a suicide attempt and by the time we were out of highschool  and we finally did manage to separate and start living separate lives, neither of us knew how to do anything without the other and it was extremely isolating. In my opinion I would have been much better off in the long run if my parents and other adults in my life had seen fit to keep us separated as much as reasonably possible so that we could learn to stand on our own and not rely on the other.",
            "YTA, mostly because this shouldn't be a unilateral decision. Your wife's opinion is valid, too.\n\nI think this is a monumentally bad idea. Could you not just send them to a school with more than one class for each grade and make sure they're not in the same class?",
            "YTA bc all you talk about is how you feel and what you think. \u00a0None of this was based on what your daughters feel and think. \u00a0Some twins love being twins. \u00a0Some hate it. \u00a0My twins have gone through phases. \u00a0I let them decide how much twiness they want because it is their lives. \u00a0"

Good on you OP. \n\nBut also, be aware that sometimes intentionally avoiding conversations around food or weight can become painfully obvious to your daughter. Really, the best course of action is to speak to a nutritionist, or a doctor and have blood work done: there's a myriad of reasons for this. And if there's nothing, and it turns out she's just genetically disposed to carry more weight, she can *still* be extremely healthy. \n\nOne of my girl friends in college is quite severely overweight and is extremely healthy, a power lifter, and unlikely to experience major health issues anytime in the near future. She just happens to be naturally fat, and that isn't bad or ugly at all. \n\nBody positivity, or glorifying obesity *isn't* the answer, but ignoring the conversation forever won't help either.

Absolutely absurd. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s okay to call out a doctor who makes a judgmental statement that hurts her feelings, without actually knowing her health yet, those providers are working from an incredibly out of date assumption that being a certain BMI automatically means unhealthy. A good doctor will check all the different necessary causes and go from there. \n\nWomen in particular have a hard time getting adequate care, especially those who are young adults. This is your chance to help your daughter before she is on her own without you to help her fight any battles. Stand up for her. \n\nI didn\u2019t find a doctor who would take my concerns about my health seriously (instead of just saying I needed to lose weight and refusing to do tests unless I lost weight first), until I was in my 30s.

She has no moral high ground to object to her sister also meddling. In fact, if you had meddled in her favor, she'd have been really happy about it. \n\nYou did the right thing in warning Blake about the three-person ambush.",
            "She's 26, maybe is time to stop going to mommy and daddy to talk to his BF.",
            "NTA-She pulled you all in her relationship and then wanted sympathy when it wasn\u2019t warranted. Your sister doesn\u2019t sound like relationship material for Blake. Kinda self-absorbed. You did right to warn him ahead of time. The only thing I wonder is why he felt it important to share your text with her?",
            "She don\u2019t get her bf a gift for any occasion but expects him to get her something \ud83d\ude44 then to bring the family in on it and try to bash him for not getting her a gift is crazy NTA for giving him the heads up.",
            "Why doesn\u2019t Blake just get himself a g-string and let Jenn know he will give her gift to her later?  If she complains that sex is not a real gift, he can ask \u201csince when?\u201d",

            "NTA. I would have wanted a heads up if I was walking into a trap too. \n\nJenn seems very selfish based on what you have said here. It's also kind of shitty that she is assuming Blake wants sex as a present? Intimacy is special, completely separate from a birthday or Christmas gift?",
            ">but I figure she was trying to get us involved in her relationship anyway\n\nNTA. Jenn already lied to Blake about the time of the dinner, and she doesn't consider what he might need or want for a birthday gift. They don't really sound long-term compatible. I think you did the decent thing in giving him the heads-up, although he should still have attended. Your parents sound like they indulge Jenn, and she has therefore never learned to take the consequences of her own actions.",
            "NTA - I hope that was a typo and you meant to say your sister is 16? Not 26?\n\nThe audacity of your sister and your parents to gang up on a dude over birthday gifts. Absolutely not ok. Super gross actually.\n\nI\u2019m glad you warned him.\u00a0\n\nEdit: typo\u00a0"

        "content": "My gf takes gifts really seriously. She said it's the main way she shows she loves someone. In the love language test, she would be acts of service I believe.\n\nHer birthday was last week and I got her a gift she loved, thank god. So liked all of our gifts basically except her brother.\n\nHer crockpot cracked, so her brother bought her a new one. It was a nice one, too, but I could tell the second she opened it she hated it. She hasn't nearly as enthused with the other gifts.\n\nShe has been complaining to me since about how dogshit that gift was. She was basically like.. A crock pot? I could buy that myself. What kind of gift is that?\n\nSo yeah, she takes gifts seriously. I don't know what she got her brother, but she bought me concert tickets, which is a pretty big gift to give someone. \n\nBut I don't get her hatred. This is her brother. Yeah, they're close. A tight-knit family. But it seems like a fine gift to get from your brother? \n\nI said my sister gave me a coffee machine once, and she said that was a really bad gift and lacked thought/origniality. But I thought it was fine? I needed a coffee machine and she bought me one. Great stuff.\n\nBut yeah, she was complaining to me again tonight and it's been like... a week since her birthday.\n\nSo I told her I don't get her hatred for the crockpot. It's something she uses everyday, and she should be more grateful that her brother took time out of his day to get it for her. I mean, he's a student and doesn't have much money but bought her something she needed.\n\nShe did not like what I said. She said no way in hell she's going to be grateful and that it's a bad gift. She said if I want to accept low effort gifts, that's my business, but she's not going to be grateful.\n\nShe has been mad at me since this happened. AITA?\n",

            "NTA he brother took the time to notice that her crockpot broke, knew that she used it regularly, and replaced it before she could. The gift is thoughtful and useful. Is she conflating the cost of a gift with the effort of the gift? Because getting you concert tickets is pretty low effort but probably expensive. If she thinks the only gifts worth giving or getting are expensive ones then I would say she has seriously missed the point of gifts. That said, this one is not a keeper, throw her back. And before you say this isn\u2019t the sort of thing to break up over, pretend her brother is her son. Would the way she is treating her brother\u2019s efforts and thoughtfulness be an acceptable way to treat your child? Because her behavior and attitude are seriously unlikely to change.",

With the idea of the crock pot in mind, if someone gave me a gift of something so that I didn\u2019t have to buy it myself, not only do I appreciate the thought of the gift, I appreciate that someone has saved me some trouble, no matter how big or small. If she\u2019s really about gifts being thoughtful, I think she defines a thoughtful gift differently.",
            "NTA for telling her to be grateful for a gift.\u00a0\n\n\nUnless she changes your life together is going to be miserable as tension builds each birthday, Christmas, mother's day, wedding anniversary in fear of getting\u00a0 the wrong thing.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nAnd, if you stay together for years and years you'll find it more and more difficult to find that perfect gift.
