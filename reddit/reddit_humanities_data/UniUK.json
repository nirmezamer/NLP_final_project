            "My first was a studio at Bristol, one of the cheaper ones at 1100 a month. Then, I found an ensuite house share beside my uni at 1100 a month and another studio at 1300 a month which I didn't take for various reasons. So, I'm still looking for accom. Most studios are around 1500-1700 a month if you want to be closer to the uni, ensuite can be anywhere from 750 - 1200 a month. You even have some fancy places that are up to 3500 a month.\n\nI chose Bristol because I thought London accom would be too expensive. I feel like a clown \ud83e\udd21",
            "I lived in the townhouses dedicated to mature students on my university's campus. Kitchen/living area downstairs, then three floors of bedrooms with four on each floor. The bedrooms were large and had a small double bed, a good sized desk with large drawers, and a wardrobe. We shared a bathroom with the person in the room next door to us so I got a very good deal because my neighbour, who I knew before going to uni, was away most of the time anyway. \n\nCost me \u00a399 a week between 2019 and 2020, then even less between 2020 - 2021 because we were never on site for that entire year. Rate went back to \u00a399 in Sept 2021 before I dropped out in the December.",

Our rooms were huge lol. One bathroom but we had our own washing machine which was nice. It was \u00a3145 a week (although again, for next year the price has changed to like \u00a3169 a week which is insane)",

To avoid the extortionate accom prices, I commute two hours each way from a small town outside ldn- that\u2019s a train and taking two tubes just to get to campus. I usually leave the house any time from 7-9am and get back at 9-10pm (I try to avoid the evening rush). I\u2019m on campus all day and on days that I\u2019m not, I\u2019m busy catching up with the stuff I\u2019ve missed out on cause I can\u2019t go in everyday (plus I can\u2019t focus during lectures and need extra time to go over them \ud83d\ude2d)\n\nThis commute has really been a big blip in my uni experience but it has helped me save a lot of money, which I\u2019m now wondering would it be worth moving out for third year to make up for everything I have missed?? My parents are pretty strict and overprotective so I\u2019ve never drank, been to a concert, gone to a club etc etc and this town isn\u2019t any better; I don\u2019t have any friends since we recently moved here \ud83e\udd72 but then I think, what is the point of moving out for all the social stuff I\u2019ve missed out on when I\u2019ll be too busy with third year content and lab work ?? So here I am trying to weigh the pros and cons \n\nI seek for your guidance and insights fellow redditors \ud83d\ude42\u200d\u2195\ufe0f thank you \n\nEdit: forgot to mention I\u2019d like to stay moved out once uni ends because I certainly would not want to come back home :\u2019) so how rare is it that students don\u2019t move back home once they\u2019ve graduated?",

            "I commited for my third year which worked out alright for me, I was only in for 2/3 days a week (and most weeks just 1 for my dissertation). But due to my course it meant that I could work from home, especially for my dissertation which may not apply to you. I know for alot of people they wouldn't have been able to finish their course or pass with a good grade if they didn't live close, just because they would have to be in labs, work in-person on group projects, or use university equipment. So I guess it depends on your course, and how flexible it is.\n\nBeing at home generally means you don't have to worry about food shopping, and cooking for yourself as (if you live with parents) generally (at least for me) that part is more or less taken care of. Which is worth considering.",
