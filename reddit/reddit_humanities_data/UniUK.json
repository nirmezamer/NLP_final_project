        "content": "I recently submitted a written assignment and have just gotten a call saying that I will achieve 0 marks on the assignment due to inadequate in text citations.\n\nFor example in my assignment I wrote:\n\u2018In a study performed by X, the results show that \u2026\u2019\n\nIt should have been written like this:\n\u2018In a study performed by (X, 2024) the results show that \u2026\u2019\n\nI had also properly referenced X at the end of my assignment in Harvard Style. However, they said that because I didn't adequately in text cite X it's plaigarism and my paper is voided.\n\nThis seems completely unfair. I understand  getting point deductions for incorrect citations but voiding my whole paper makes no sense since I never tried to pass it off as my work. There were only 3 instances of inadequate citations in my entire work, all written similar to the first example. The other 2 references I had were correctly written.\n",

            "If you have acknowledged that the findings belonged to X by stating their name rather than passing it off as your own findings, Im not sure how this could be considered plagiarism - all youve omitted is the date but this appears in the reference list. I would contact your module lecturer about this, then the module leader (if its a different person) if the outcome is not desirable, then your programme coordinator. If none of this brings a desirable outcome then I would appeal the grade.",
            "That does seem unreasonable. Indeed you havent cited correctly, but you clearly havent tried to pass off others work as your own. There are a range of referencing systems available, so it seems unfair to punish you severely because you made a mistake.",
            "Thought it would have been \"study cited by X (2024)\" personally, but that is weird, or at least extremely and unreasonably harsh.",
            "Are they actually calling it plagiarism or just saying inadequate citation? Plagiarism can have you kicked out of university, if its just them giving you a 0 on one paper I don't know if they're actually treating it as plagiarism",
            "Did you give the page or paragraph number in your end citations? \n\n5 citations seems very low to me - is there a chance that they think you have absorbed ideas from others works and not cited them at all?",
            "That second example seems wrong mainly because it doesnt read very well, if the Author is part of the sentence it would be silly to reference them again literally one word later. Referencing definitely accepts forms such  In xs study (date) or In a study performed by X (date). You have to make sure the date is included though. \n\nI guess dating the in-text citation is so blatantly obvious, especially for 2nd years, that youre being punished (albeit harshly) for a complete negligence on your part. 0 is harsh, 40 or less wouldnt have been though, which I guess ends with the same outcome of reassessment anyway. Either way Id appeal simply for the purpose of clearing that plagiarism suggestion.",
            "Should be in a study performed by X (2014)...",
            "Your \"correct\" referencing is actually incorrect. It should be \"in a study by X (2024)\", X shouldn't in the brackets in that case or the sentence doesn't make sense. Sorey, I know this is not the main point but still.\nAlso, I agree that it's overly harsh.",
            "Did your module leader deduct marks directly, or was there a formal plagiarism process before marks were deducted? I ask this, because as a course director, I have seen so many colleagues taking similar matters into their own hands and deducting marks at the module level, when typical university regulations would require a separate process involving independent academic/panel to review plagiarism cases. Most module leaders do this out of convenience and probably not knowing the proper regulations themselves. I would advise you to look into your universitys regulations on how such cases should be dealt with. If you do ever appeal this decision, you are within your full rights to question if the proper process was followed. If the module leader alone made this decision, then my suspicion is that proper process might not have been strictly adhered to. With that said, even following proper process, it might still end up with the same outcome - though, my point is it shouldnt be up to one module tutor alone to decide.",
            "Thanks  I'll do this. I put so much effort into this assignment too, so getting 0 for it is just so frustrating."

        "content": "In the traditional educational and career path, students typically spend 3 years at university followed by 1-2 years as a graduate in a job before truly starting their careers. \n\nI propose an alternative pathway that streamlines education and work integration for non-vocational degrees, providing a more efficient and practical approach. Here\u2019s how it would work:\n\n\n1) Students apply to companies while still in Sixth Form/College.\n\n2) University Year: Upon acceptance, companies sponsor an intensive 1-year university program in Liberal Arts. This program would provide a broad foundation of knowledge and critical thinking skills.\n\n3) Residential Company-Hosted Educational Course: After completing the university program, students attend a company-hosted educational course tailored to their future roles. This course would consist of:\n\n6 months of general knowledge and networking: Building a broad understanding of the industry and fostering connections.\n6 months of role-specific training: Focusing closely on the skills and knowledge required for the specific position the student will fill.\n\n4) Employment Commitment: Students commit to working for the sponsoring company for a minimum of 5 years. This ensures a return on the company\u2019s investment and provides students with job security and career development opportunities\n\nThis is something I have thought about for a while. It was interesting to learn that the Military do this to an extent with Medics.",
