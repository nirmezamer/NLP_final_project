        "content": "Hey r/tax, I'm a relatively new mod to this group in the last 3-6 months, looks like the long time mod quakerots left a few months back and quite a few of the AutoMod actions are outdated from the pandemic, so I'm looking at updating the rules and AutoMod commenting and would like to get feedback from subreddit users\n\nAs a reference, [here's the post](https://old.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/3zf1bs/before_you_post_see_if_you_can_find_your_answer/) that used to be pinned with a bunch of the IRS links, unfortunately I don't think people in general tend to look at pinned posts if they're looking to get a specific question answered\n\n**AMA Announcement**: There will be an [AMA on Feb 12th with USAToday](https://old.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/1anizkt/upcoming_usa_today_ama_feb_12th_noon_to_3_pm_et/) personal finance team 12-3pm ET\n\n## Rules\n\n### [Current Rules](https://old.reddit.com/r/tax/about/rules/)\n\nThey're pretty simple - be nice, don't solicit business, no self promotion\n\n### New Rules\n\nNo AI generated comments/content - it's low quality, and we're not here to be AI fact checkers\n\nNo discussion of tax fraud - openly suggesting/supporting tax fraud calls into question the reliability of the comments here, of course people should always take reddit advice with a grain of salt, but suggesting fraud on top of that just degrades the subreddit\n\n**Anything else specific that frequent subreddit users would like to see added?**\n\n## AutoMod Commenter\n\nI've removed all the oudated auto-comments/removal, here are the new ones I'm thinking of adding - note that these would just be an FYI comment on the post, the post itself would not be removed, just saves frequent users the effort of linking the same things or re-iterating the frequently asked questions around this time of year\n\n -  **Explaining how tax brackets work** - users could comment \"!ELI5taxes\", AutoMod would reply with a breakdown that's frequently repeated here - if someone has a preferred example they've seen here please link it in the comments\n\n -  **Explaining how tax refund works** - users could comment \"!ELI5refund\", AutoMod would reply with the paying cash at the grocery store example plus explaining lower refund vs lower paychecks\n\n -  **Return vs refund** - I've seen this one frequently mentioned as an AutoMod request, but I suspect figuring out the right regex trigger would be tricky as I wouldn't want it to just be blindly commented on every single post mentioning a tax return or refund\n\n -  **IRS withholding estimator** - [links to tool](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/tax-withholding-estimator) for updating W4(s) with summary of frequent mistakes like double counting dependents for married couples or not properly accounting for multiple jobs\n\n -  **Dependents** - links to [IRS dependent tool](https://www.irs.gov/help/ita/whom-may-i-claim-as-a-dependent), if someone wants to draft a summary with it then you're welcome to comment it here, just not sure if that's necessary as it could get lengthy \n\n -  **Do I have to file** - link to [IRS tool](https://www.irs.gov/help/ita/do-i-need-to-file-a-tax-return) plus summary\n\n -  **Others** - wishlist that may be helpful, but not sure if these are really needed/not sure of regex trigger\n\n  - $600 threshold for 1099-K\n\n  - Do I have to include x income?\n\n  - How do I report income without a 1099/Do I have to? (similar to previous)\n\n  - When will I get my refund?\n\n - 1099 vs W2 misclassification\n\n - Can I claim x if I work from home? (Think these have mostly died down the last 1-2 years)\n\n**Open to any reasonable/genuine feedback on these from frequent users of the subreddit**",

However, we need to address a recurring issue.\n\nRecently, there have been several comments suggesting that \"taxes are voluntary\" or claiming that there is no legal requirement to pay taxes. While we welcome diverse perspectives on tax policies, promoting such statements is not only misleading but also illegal. This subreddit does not support or condone the promotion of illegal activities.\n\nTo clarify:\n\n* **Tax Policy Discussion:** Constructive conversations about tax laws, policies, reforms, and their implications.\n* **Illegal Promotion:** Claims or suggestions that paying taxes is voluntary or that there is no legal obligation to do so.\n\nIf a comment promotes illegal activities, our practice is to delete it and consider banning the user, either temporarily or permanently, based on their comment history.\n\nThis policy is in place to ensure that our subreddit remains a reliable and law-abiding resource for all members.

            "It probably doesn't help that the IRS literally says that taxes are based on voluntary compliance.\n\nOf course by \"voluntary\", they mean that you're expected to to comply without being asked. It doesn't mean you can choose not to. You can either voluntarily comply, or you will be forced to involuntarily comply when the IRS catches up to you, those are the two options. Usually voluntary compliance is more pleasant.",
            "Should this be included in the subreddit rules?",
            "I think voluntary compliance just means they don't take the taxes from you until after you earn the income.  In some countries, income tax is automatically taken out of income, like 9% out of every income source, and there are no tax returns to file.  They never see that money."

            "Hi!\n\nNOT a tax professional but I recently went through this same thing with my mom but she was 10 years non compliant. \n\nIt depends on if he owes money to the IRS or not. If he owes, they could put a lien/levy on his SS benefits. \n\nIf he doesn\u2019t owe, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll do anything. When filling out the SS application it doesn\u2019t ask if you\u2019re current on taxes but it will ask about income and health insurance coverage (approximate income amounts, dates coverage began, etc). \n\nTo find out if your dad owes, you can create him an account on the IRS website using ID.me (he\u2019ll have to have a valid ID) OR you can request his transcripts online. \n\nYour dad should file 6 years of back taxes (2018-2023) as that is generally what the IRS requests to get back in compliance with them. You can do this for free or hire a tax preparer. If his tax situation is simple, I\u2019d recommend doing it yourselves. He\u2019ll have to mail in 2018-2020 while 2021 - 2023 can be e-filed. \n\nThe statute of limitations for the IRS to COLLECT money is 10 years but the statute of limitations for us as tax payers to get refunds is 3 years - so who knows, he might even get some money back for the 2021-2023 tax years. At a minimum, he should get a stimulus check back\u2026.assuming the IRS withheld those payments due to non compliance?\n\nYes, wage garnishments go through pay checks and not through the IRS. I think the IRS only levies money owed to them directly.",

(Not filing his tax returns is a separate issue.)\n\nBut his benefits won't start until he submits an application.  Also be aware that there is NO benefit to waiting until after age 70 to submit a Social Security application.  Maximum monthly SS benefits are paid when benefits start at age 70.  (Note I said maximum monthly benefits, not maximum lifetime benefits.)\n\n  \n\nSo the solution is to his benefits problem is to contact the Social Security Administration and submit an application.  The solution to his tax problems is separate.",

            "His Social Security and Medicare benefits will be based on the FICA taxes paid and reported on Form W-2, which is done by the employer and so will have happened regardless of whether he filed.\n\nHe should attempt to obtain as many years of records as possible to confirm that he did not owe additional tax in any year (this is not certain either way).  If he owes, the IRS will usually catch up eventually based on their records, and assess tax with interest and penalty.  If he overpaid (and was due a refund) in all of those years, there is basically no consequence other than the fact that the refunds from more than 3 years ago are forfeit (and he would not have succeeded at avoiding child support anyway).  The 3 most recent years of refunds (2021-2023) can still be claimed.",

It does not matter what the decree says, IRS only looks at their physical address.\n\nSchool or daycare records should indicate the custodial parents' address.  Medical records might show the other parent as the responsible party but SHOULD show the custodial parent's address as the child's address. If Head of Household was involved, IRS also questions that most of the time. They will want proof the parent paid more than half the rent (full rent  before subsidies) utilities, food (and food stamps counts against them) etc.  But on very low income Head of Household does not make any difference other than make it likely the IRS will send a notice asking for proof. Head of Household requires paing more than half the cost of housing, groceries, utilities, and if there are subsidies the taxpayer has to pay half of everything as if there were no subsidies. \n\nBut as someone said, file your return including the child. You WILL get a notice from IRS with form 556-something asking for birth certificate, proof of residency (school, medical records, lease) etc.  It will take them many months to fix it, but you'll get paid interest on the taxes they owe you.
