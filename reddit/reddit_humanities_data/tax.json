        "content": "Hey r/tax, I'm a relatively new mod to this group in the last 3-6 months, looks like the long time mod quakerots left a few months back and quite a few of the AutoMod actions are outdated from the pandemic, so I'm looking at updating the rules and AutoMod commenting and would like to get feedback from subreddit users\n\nAs a reference, [here's the post](https://old.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/3zf1bs/before_you_post_see_if_you_can_find_your_answer/) that used to be pinned with a bunch of the IRS links, unfortunately I don't think people in general tend to look at pinned posts if they're looking to get a specific question answered\n\n**AMA Announcement**: There will be an [AMA on Feb 12th with USAToday](https://old.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/1anizkt/upcoming_usa_today_ama_feb_12th_noon_to_3_pm_et/) personal finance team 12-3pm ET\n\n## Rules\n\n### [Current Rules](https://old.reddit.com/r/tax/about/rules/)\n\nThey're pretty simple - be nice, don't solicit business, no self promotion\n\n### New Rules\n\nNo AI generated comments/content - it's low quality, and we're not here to be AI fact checkers\n\nNo discussion of tax fraud - openly suggesting/supporting tax fraud calls into question the reliability of the comments here, of course people should always take reddit advice with a grain of salt, but suggesting fraud on top of that just degrades the subreddit\n\n**Anything else specific that frequent subreddit users would like to see added?**\n\n## AutoMod Commenter\n\nI've removed all the oudated auto-comments/removal, here are the new ones I'm thinking of adding - note that these would just be an FYI comment on the post, the post itself would not be removed, just saves frequent users the effort of linking the same things or re-iterating the frequently asked questions around this time of year\n\n -  **Explaining how tax brackets work** - users could comment \"!ELI5taxes\", AutoMod would reply with a breakdown that's frequently repeated here - if someone has a preferred example they've seen here please link it in the comments\n\n -  **Explaining how tax refund works** - users could comment \"!ELI5refund\", AutoMod would reply with the paying cash at the grocery store example plus explaining lower refund vs lower paychecks\n\n -  **Return vs refund** - I've seen this one frequently mentioned as an AutoMod request, but I suspect figuring out the right regex trigger would be tricky as I wouldn't want it to just be blindly commented on every single post mentioning a tax return or refund\n\n -  **IRS withholding estimator** - [links to tool](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/tax-withholding-estimator) for updating W4(s) with summary of frequent mistakes like double counting dependents for married couples or not properly accounting for multiple jobs\n\n -  **Dependents** - links to [IRS dependent tool](https://www.irs.gov/help/ita/whom-may-i-claim-as-a-dependent), if someone wants to draft a summary with it then you're welcome to comment it here, just not sure if that's necessary as it could get lengthy \n\n -  **Do I have to file** - link to [IRS tool](https://www.irs.gov/help/ita/do-i-need-to-file-a-tax-return) plus summary\n\n -  **Others** - wishlist that may be helpful, but not sure if these are really needed/not sure of regex trigger\n\n  - $600 threshold for 1099-K\n\n  - Do I have to include x income?\n\n  - How do I report income without a 1099/Do I have to? (similar to previous)\n\n  - When will I get my refund?\n\n - 1099 vs W2 misclassification\n\n - Can I claim x if I work from home? (Think these have mostly died down the last 1-2 years)\n\n**Open to any reasonable/genuine feedback on these from frequent users of the subreddit**",

            "A couple of years back we had an auto-mod that said if your return was rejected, try it again using an AGI of $0 or $1.   The $1 was because of the tax returns claiming the pandemic tax rebate and we don't need that any more.\n\nBut we desperately need an automod that says something like \"If your return was rejected because of an incorrect previous year's AGI, please try resubmitting it with a previous year's  AGI of $0.\"  We've already gotten a half a dozen of these posts today and it's just going to keep getting worse.",

        "content": "Hi r/tax community,\n\nWe appreciate and encourage thoughtful discussions on tax policy and related topics. However, we need to address a recurring issue.\n\nRecently, there have been several comments suggesting that \"taxes are voluntary\" or claiming that there is no legal requirement to pay taxes. While we welcome diverse perspectives on tax policies, promoting such statements is not only misleading but also illegal. This subreddit does not support or condone the promotion of illegal activities.\n\nTo clarify:\n\n* **Tax Policy Discussion:** Constructive conversations about tax laws, policies, reforms, and their implications.\n* **Illegal Promotion:** Claims or suggestions that paying taxes is voluntary or that there is no legal obligation to do so.\n\nIf a comment promotes illegal activities, our practice is to delete it and consider banning the user, either temporarily or permanently, based on their comment history.\n\nThis policy is in place to ensure that our subreddit remains a reliable and law-abiding resource for all members. We've had several inquiries about this topic recently, so we hope this post provides the necessary clarification.\n\nThank you for your understanding and cooperation.\n\n* r/tax Mod Team",

            "That is a good policy.  A few decades ago I regularly participated on a tax message board.  It was basically destroyed by those who in those days were known as \"illegal tax protesters.\"",
            "It probably doesn't help that the IRS literally says that taxes are based on voluntary compliance.\n\nOf course by \"voluntary\", they mean that you're expected to to comply without being asked. It doesn't mean you can choose not to. You can either voluntarily comply, or you will be forced to involuntarily comply when the IRS catches up to you, those are the two options. Usually voluntary compliance is more pleasant.",

            "Who is responsible for the notice clarification? U/tax_ninga? There is an example of post that say xyz.  Is an opinion or assumption that its illegal.  There is a difference between illegal and ethical. One can not pay tax is not illegal and its not illegal to owe taxes in the United States . Its a discussion not a dictatorship . Its not illegal to say anything .  People are assumed to be adults who make their decisions based on their beliefs. If I said dont pay tax .. that is ridiculous to believe that I am your owner , . But to remove information is to promote illegal activity because if you dont know what tax evasion means is evasion of evidence that it exists.criminal dont post on this . The criminal is evading the discussion . Do you know what a pass through is ?  Its voluntary.,no one makes anyone pay for anything. But if you dont talk about t . Then you are the one protecting it",
            "I think voluntary compliance just means they don't take the taxes from you until after you earn the income.  In some countries, income tax is automatically taken out of income, like 9% out of every income source, and there are no tax returns to file.  They never see that money."

I\u2019ve been waiting for that refund since then despite complying with all IRS requests repeatedly, timely, and even sending things certified. I do currently have my congressman handling it for me. \n\nHowever, I called the IRS back in April for an update before getting my congressman involved. I NEVER gave them my spouse\u2019s information. Somehow along the way they thought I was referring to my husband even though I wasn\u2019t aware of that when I was on the phone with the agent. Today to my surprise I got a notice LTR 18C saying that I need to provide the date of death for my HUSBAND. We haven\u2019t gotten the locked SSN notice, yet. \n\nI am so upset. It\u2019s been 2 years fighting this organization for my dad\u2019s refund so I can close his estate, and now my husband got somehow wrapped into it and it\u2019s an even bigger mess. It is honestly abysmal that this is evening happening. I wish I could sue this organization for distress but that\u2019s a pipe dream. \n\nAny recommendation here? I emailed my CPA but hoping maybe y\u2019all could also help. The internet says my husband needs to call SSA and then go from there. However this is due to the IRS making an error, not the SSA. Im trying to avoid another frustrating call to the IRS but if it must be done then I will do it. ",

They assessed my home and property had gone up by more than 50%. Previous value was 224k and now it's 341k. 116k increase in the value. And I'm curious how it will effect my taxes on my property going forward. At first I had no idea what mill rate even was and I'm still a bit confused about but I really don't want my taxes going up by 50%.  Can anyone help give me some clarity here please?",

            "This is a little state-dependent but the gist is that you will pay your mill rate times (your assessed value/1000). So if your mill rate is 15 and your assessment is $341k, you'll be paying $5115 in taxes.\n\nThe short answer is that, all else equal, your assessment is what drives your taxes. If your assessment increases by a certain percentage, so will your taxes. Your mill rate will change slightly with bonded indebtedness but it won't be a huge factor in most states.\n\nI assume you're in a state with assessment cycles, so your home was last assessed 3 or 4 years ago, which was right before the housing boom. I know it sucks, but think of it this way - you've been underpaying for two years."
