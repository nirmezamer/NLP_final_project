I am one of [seven candidates ](https://www.pdga.com/news/get-know-2024-candidates-pdga-global-board-directors#pdga-number-63994)up for three board positions so fire away with any questions you have and I will answer what I can. \n\nI've no set deadline for when this will finish and will drift in and out throughout the day... and being one of the mod team here, I will be around for the foreseeable weeks/months/(years?) and happy to answer any questions posted in here for however long they keep coming in. \n\n",

            "Being a Reddit mod, are you worried about social media pushback about Board decisions if you get elected?",
            "assuming you get elected, what candidates do you think should get the other two BoD positions?",
            "How many kangaroos have you hit with a disc?  \n\nIn all seriousness, How do you plan to make PDGA membership valuable?  As an am that rarely, if ever, plays tournaments I have little to no desire to ever join.  I see no benefit to it and nothing but hassle.  Blocking tournaments behind membership only made me not play tournaments.",
            "What are some things your have achieved during your time with ADG that you are particularly proud of?",
            "Why does the PDGA continue to ignore issues related to AM division splits? With an average player rating of 860, there should be equal divisions above and below that mark, not just MA4 below.",
            "Who is your daddy and what does he do?\n\nAlso, do you support a position to make fruit snacks a required provision for all C tier and up tournaments?",
            "Are you wanting to work for MORE or LESS integration into the DGPT/DGN as a potential representative of the PDGA? Do you feel that the PDGA's involvement hurts or helps the DGPT?\n\nWould you consider handing Majors over to the DGPT to run and handle outside of the PDGA?\n\nIf I can be honest, the PDGA doesn't really offer me much anymore. I have to scrape up a couple of last second tournaments every year just to get my 5 in to make it \"worth\" the cost. There's no benefits to being a member that I can see for a more casual player.\n\nWhat kind of incentives are there that you'd fight for to make that decision easier every year? Improved uDisc relationship? Cheaper DGN subscriptions? No more magazines? Free PDGA discs when signing up? DGPT Spectator Passes?\n\nAlso, don't require bathrooms at C-Tiers. I don't want to pay another $10 on my entry fee just so that the TD can pay for a rentable bathroom that I won't use.",
            "I will mail you 500 usd in sequential 20s in an insured certified envelope if you petetion to get the tobacco rule repealed.\u00a0\n\n\nAlso what's your least favorite pdga rule and how do you plan to change it?\u00a0",
            "Not overly, no. I've already signaled my intent to step down as mod here as well as my current role as Chairperson of Australian Disc Golf if I am successful in my election campaign. The PDGA interview committee said that they wouldn't expect that, but I think any potential conflict of interest, whether actual or perceived, should be reduced or eliminated where possible.",
            "I think the PDGA board needs more diversity - in terms of gender, ethnicity, geographical location and professional status. I think it's also important to have new people with new ideas on the board to capitalise on the growth of the sport post COVID.\n\nWith that in mind, two from Terhi Kyt\u00f6 from Finland, James Koizumi from Canada or Leah Tsinajinnie as the only current Pro representative."
