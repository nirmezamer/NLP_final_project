Sometimes there is a problem in the building and your landlord needs to call pest control for extra treatments. Sometimes something you're doing is encouraging them and you can clean, take trash out."

Turns out I missed the deadline. \n\nI\u2019m returning for my junior year as it was my first semester this past spring. \n\nIt seems that orchard downs apartments are cheaper than Sherman hall (where I was last semester). \n\nI\u2019m 31 years old and I think I had to live in Sherman hall due to my age. And I\u2019d rather not do the more expensive Danial\u2019s hall. \n\nDoes anyone have any input or guidance on this matter?  I was abit irresponsible enjoying myself after my studies along with having a job off campus. Im also the first to leave home for university so I really didn\u2019t have  guidance on this stuff. ",

It's a very nice and brand new (or was before I moved in lol) \"luxury\" apartment with a gym, etc and a reserved parking spot I prepaid. Wifi, water, electricity and trash is also covered. Has great AC and heating power and a balcony too. Basically I'm moving out this Sunday and the lease doesn't end until the end of July. Rent is usually $1500+ utilities per month but I can let you sublet for very cheap for a month if you need a place to stay for cheap for a month. I gotta pay the rent anyways and no one is using the apartment, so  just throwing it out there.\n\nAfter July you'd have to start your own lease if you wanna stay. But I can help you cover July if you just need a temp place to be.",
