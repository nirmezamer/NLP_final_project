Turns out I missed the deadline. \n\nI\u2019m returning for my junior year as it was my first semester this past spring. \n\nIt seems that orchard downs apartments are cheaper than Sherman hall (where I was last semester). \n\nI\u2019m 31 years old and I think I had to live in Sherman hall due to my age. And I\u2019d rather not do the more expensive Danial\u2019s hall. \n\nDoes anyone have any input or guidance on this matter?  I was abit irresponsible enjoying myself after my studies along with having a job off campus. Im also the first to leave home for university so I really didn\u2019t have  guidance on this stuff. ",

Has great AC and heating power and a balcony too. Basically I'm moving out this Sunday and the lease doesn't end until the end of July. Rent is usually $1500+ utilities per month but I can let you sublet for very cheap for a month if you need a place to stay for cheap for a month. I gotta pay the rent anyways and no one is using the apartment, so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f just throwing it out there.\n\nAfter July you'd have to start your own lease if you wanna stay.

I leave before the end of July, and my lease ends in March/you can take over the lease! \n\n-First it will be sublet to you until my name is off the lease in March, and then you can renew on a monthly, 6 month, or a yearly basis!\n\n-It\u2019s a 4 Bedroom apt with each room being individually rented @ $480/month for ALL utilities, wifi, and your own private shower/bathroom included! \n\n-Roommates are matched to you based on lifestyle needs! Usually segregated by gender, but exceptions can be discussed if other roommates consent to co-Ed living! \n\n-Predominantly foreign and domestic students, but also a mix of families with children, older/elderly individuals, locals and transplants from elsewhere! \n\n-Literal 50 feet from the building, just across the street, there\u2019s a Bus-line to the university that\u2019s free!\n\n-There\u2019s also an indoor pool, and indoor koi pond, indoor mass laundry room/numerous washers/dryers, indoor mail system, and vending machines, a billiards table, and tiny, but functional indoor gym too!\n\nMessage me for more details!!\n\nThank you all!"
