The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/15186wx/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxiv/).\n\nThe panel is an informal group of Redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.\n\nMembership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!\n\n\\-------------------\n\n**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**\n\n* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,\n* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.\n\n\\-------------------\n\n**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**\n\n* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).\n* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)\n* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)\n* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?\n* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.\n\n\\-------------------\n\nIdeally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.\n\nHere's an example application:\n\n`Username: /u/foretopsail`\n\n`General field: Anthropology`\n\n`Specific field: Maritime Archaeology`\n\n`Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction.`\n\n`Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.`\n\n`Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.`\n\nPlease do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.\n\nYou can submit your application by replying to this post.",

            "Worth adding that human birth rates slightly favor men\n\nApproximately 51/49.\n\nOvertime, men tend to take riskier behaviours which get them killed and overtime leads to women outnumbering men around the 30 year mark.",
            "There are evolutionary pressures for the ratio of females to males to be close to 1:1 in many species (not all), including humans.  This is explained by [Fisher's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_principle).  Briefly: if the population skews female, there are reproductive advantages to being male and those genes favoring males being born are thus favored by natural selection. As a result more males are born, evening things out again.  It also works in the opposite direction.\n\nIn reality, cultural and historical contingencies like war, mean maternal age, etc. have some impact on these numbers, so they vary a bit (sometimes dramatically) for different times and places in human history.  However, in the long term the \\~1:1 ratio is a stable one that evolution tends toward in humans.\n\nEdit: it\u2019s worth noting that a [2020 study](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2019.2849) did not find any significant heritability of sex ratio in humans.  The authors conclude that Fisher\u2019s Principle does not explain sex ratio in humans at present.  This interpretation has been [disputed](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2020.2632), though (here\u2019s [another paper](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2020.2638) calling this conclusion into question).  It may be most accurate to say that this study did not provide evidence for Fisher\u2019s Principle in humans, not that it falsified it.  In any case, as always with science, we should take any truth as provisional and not absolute.\n\nEdit 2: a more complete explanation would include the fact that, unless there are specific reasons (selective pressures) for a male to produce an imbalanced number of X and Y sperm, the default ratio of X and Y sperm will be 1:1 because of the structure of the genome and how meiosis works.  The default ratio of males to females born will thus be close to 1:1, all else being equal.  Fisher's Principle would tell us that if this default situation already exists on evolutionary timescales, there is no reason for a genetic bias towards male or female offspring to emerge.  This may be why we see inconsistent evidence of any such biases in humans -- while gender imbalance has existed in various populations in history, these may not have been longstanding enough to have an influence on evolution of genes that might influence sex ratio within most human populations.",
            "The supply of humans is approximately 50% male and female (as sperms have equal probability of containing X or Y chromosomes). Unless something drastic happens like a war (mostly males get killed) or female infanticide (culture causes killing of female babies), biologically there is nothing to prefer either sex.",
            "The 50/50 ratio follows from how chromosomes are distributed among gametes. You can draw out all possible ways that sperms and eggs can mix in order to see this.\n\nEggs and sperms essentially only carry one sex chromosome, because they are formed from a parent cell whose genome essentially split in half (called meiosis). Because females are XX, their eggs will always carry an X chromosome, as the parent cell will be XX, so that's all you can get. Because males are XY, whenever a parent cell splits to form sperms, it will always create one X sperm and one Y sperm.\n\nSince the egg will always have an X (except for certain rare exceptions), this X or Y sperm will essentially determine the sex of the child (except for certain rare exceptions). Hence, the probability of having a male or female child is going to be 50%, because the process that generates sperm will always make 1 X and 1 Y sperm.",
            "Just a quick note to say that 50:50 male:female isn't necessarily the case!\u00a0\n\n\nThere exists selective pressure for sex-determining chromosomes to compete with each other to favour their transmission (e.g. it is advantageous for X chromosome linked genes to inhibit Y chromosome carrying sperm to increase how many X chromosomes are passed on).\n\n\nThis is called intragenomic conflict and can distort the sex ratio equilibrium, that as others have pointed out would otherwise lead to a 50:50 ratio by the law of large numbers.\u00a0\n\n\nFurther reading:\n\n\n\nPress piece on \"first evidence in mammals of a battle between the X and Y chromosomes\" : https://www.crick.ac.uk/news/2012-09-13-sex-chromosome-battle-leads-to-more-female-mice\n\n\nMathematical biology paper on maternal sex ratio disorders: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ece3.2498\n\n\nReview paper from 2014 on sex chromosome evolution and Intragenomic conflict: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4292157/",
            "Because there is a roughly equal chance that a given child will be male or female. \n\n>Why hasn't one sex increased/decreased significantly over another?\n\nThere would need to be some underlying reason for there to be an increase/decrease among one over the other.  \n\nOne example is China's previous 1 Child Policy.  Due to cultural elements male children were considered more important/valuable, so many female children were abandoned or outright killed so the parents could try again or a male child.  At its peak the imbalance was 120 males per 100 females.  But even that was limited within a specific age range.",
            "Because the chance of fertilization resulting in a male or female is also 50/50 because the distribution of X and Y chromosomes is also 50/50, because that's what male's testicles are programmed to do. If that programming changed so would the human population distribution.",
            "The Law of Large Numbers.  Basically, there is a 50/50 chance (not quite, but close enough) for a sperm cell to be an X or a Y.  So there's a 50/50 chance that an egg is fertilized with an X or a Y chromosome.  Flip a coin a couple billion times and the result will be very close to 50% heads and 50% tails.  Fertilize a few billion eggs and it's going to average out very closely to 50% male and 50% female.\n\n\\*\\*For the sake of this conversation I am ignoring the \\~1.7% intersex population and simply using XX and XY definitions.  Sex and gender are more complicated than that.",
            "Generally any species with a mostly binary sex distribution will tend towards 50/50. There are many reasons but one of the most prominent is sexual selection. If females outnumber males, each male will have more partners and have more children making male children more advantageous. This advantage will drive the ratio back towards 50/50. The same process happens when males outnumber females but for slightly different reasons",
            "Statistics. Flip a coin five times, and there's a good chance that the results will be overwhelmingly heads or tails. But if you flip a coin ten thousand times, the results *will* be very close to 50-50. The more times a random event happens, the closer the results will be to the average. This is a concept known as \"regression to the mean\".\n\nIn terms of human reproduction, individual families have a reasonable chance of being overwhelmingly male or overwhelmingly female because it's about a 50-50 chance (yes I know it's more complicated than that) but it's a small sample size, often of just one or two children. But on a global scale of *billions* of children, it is astronomically unlikely to have a significant deviation from the average."

If you can get it from a swab inside someone\u2019s mouth/throat/nose, there\u2019ll be a little bit of it in the droplets they spew into the environment.\u00a0\n\nWe all regularly inhale genetic material that came from the cells of other people\u2019s bodies. That\u2019s how respiratory viruses spread. If we inhale a bit of human DNA detritus along for the ride it won\u2019t do anything but presumably this does happen at a very low level.\u00a0\n\nActually detecting genetic material in air samples is hard but it\u2019s been done before.

DNA isn\u2019t* just floating around in the body, it\u2019s bound up in a small set of balls, in the nucleus, within the cells. There is some dna that isn\u2019t broken down soon enough after cell death and probably floats in the blood long enough to be breathed out almost certainly. \n\nBut it\u2019s not a normal thing. You don\u2019t just breath out such a huge molecule. What you might have in very wet breath is a couple dead skin cells from your mouth/throat, which we as smart humans could do a dna test on after we\u2019ve broken the cell walls, and opened the nucleus. \n\nSo for that reason you question is kind of based on a dodgy foundation, we aren\u2019t breathing out dna molecules. If there is a trace amount yeah it\u2019s going to be wiped off in the same way anything is be it water, dna or hand sanitiser. \n\nAnd no if I breathed a skin cell onto you it\u2019d die/be dead , you aren\u2019t growing to have a colony of me growing on you, unless I\u2019ve somehow breathed a cancer on you and you\u2019re my twin so your body recognises it as friend plus gets a lucky fluke.

If this isn't the situation, feel free to ignore the rest of my comment. \n\nThere are several important ideas to grasp here  \n1. The only type of vaccination that even has the potential to cause viral shedding are live attenuated viruses (LAVs).  \n2. There are no LAVs for COVID currently or previously in use. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_COVID-19_vaccine_authorizations  \n3. Even if it were a LAV, intramuscular vaccines don't get close enough to your respiratory membranes to shed a meaningful amount of viruses or viral particles.  \n4. Viral shedding, when it does happen via an LAV administered nasally, is often so small that the chance for infection an disease is nearly zero with a scant few exceptions.\n\nTo make a long story short, COVID vaccines don't shed, even if they were capable of shedding the way we administer them makes it nearly impossible, and even if it were possible the chance for any meaningful transfer of material is negligible.",

Yes, another person could possible breathe these cells in, but they\u2019ll almost certainly be quickly destroyed by any number of processes after you breathe them out or after another person breathes them in. I doubt they\u2019d be able to be breathed out by you, breathed in by another person, and then breathed back out and still look like a cell. The DNA inside the cells would probably be more or less destroyed too.\n\nIf you\u2019re asking if we breathe out free floating (not part of a cell) DNA molecules, the answer is no, we don\u2019t.",
            "Much of the dust in your house is made up of dead skin cells. Those contain DNA and you breathe them all the time.\n\nMost probably stick in the mucus membranes of your respiratory system and get broken down, but I'm sure a few get exhaled back out due to the sheer number of them.",
            "Yes, when we breathe, we do exhale microscopic DNA molecules into the air. This primarily comes from the shedding of cells in the respiratory tract and mouth, including epithelial cells and other cellular debris. These DNA-containing particles can be released in small amounts and can potentially be detected in the surrounding environment.\n\nRegarding your second scenario:\n\nTouch DNA Transfer: When you touch an item that has been previously handled by another person, you can transfer some of that person's DNA to your own skin. This is known as \"touch DNA.\"\n\nTransfer to Nostrils: If you then touch the inside of your nose or nostrils, it is possible to transfer this touch DNA to your nasal mucosa. However, the amount of DNA transferred in this manner is typically very small.\n\nExhalation of Foreign DNA: The likelihood of then exhaling this DNA as part of your breath is extremely low. The DNA from another person would need to integrate into your respiratory or oral epithelial cells in a way that allows it to be shed naturally. Typically, the foreign DNA would not integrate into your cells and would instead be broken down or cleared away by your body's natural defense mechanisms.\n\nIn summary, while we do exhale microscopic DNA molecules, and it is possible to transfer touch DNA from one person to another through indirect contact, the scenario where you breathe out someone else's DNA after touching your nose is highly unlikely. The foreign DNA would not persist in your respiratory system long enough to be exhaled in measurable amounts.",

            "The direct answer to your two questions are - (1) We don't know for sure that there wasn't life on Proto-Earth (or Theia, i.e., the impactor) before the Moon forming impact because (2) Yes, all of the evidence of any life would have been destroyed (on either body) by the impact process. \n\nHowever, it's not considered likely that there would have been life on either body because of the time frames involved. Specifically, the impact of Theia with the Proto-Earth and the subsequent formation of the Moon, happened very early in the history of the solar system. The exact timing has been updated a few times, but recent results from [Greer et al., 2023](https://www.geochemicalperspectivesletters.org/article2334/) suggest that this happened only ~110 million years after the formation of the solar system, or about 4.46 billion years ago. If we consider evidence for formation of life on Earth, whether we're thinking of the oldest preserved microfossils (e.g., [Schopf et al., 2017](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1718063115)) or preservation of biosignatures more broadly (e.g., [Homann et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825219300741)), the earliest dates are ~3.5 billion years ago, i.e., nearly a full billion years after the Moon forming impact. It's hard to extrapolate from a dataset of 1, but if we consider that it took ~1 billion years for life to develop on Earth and that Proto-Earth / Theia as planets had only existed for ~100 million years before they collided, it becomes relatively unlikely that sufficient time had past for life to develop on either body prior to their collision. Even less so if we consider that this early period of the solar system would have been very chaotic, with *lots* of impacts from planetisemals and the like disrupting the surfaces of most every planetary body frequently.\n\nThe above was borrowed from a response in an [earlier thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/17lz6cy/i_was_just_reading_up_on_the_ancient_theia_planet/) that posed a similar question, and some of the discussion besides the part I grabbed from my prior answer might also be interesting or relevant here.",
            "If you mean extremely primitive life it\u2019s possible but still unlikely.\u00a0\n\nIf you mean advanced life, including and up to intelligent life like us? \u00a0It\u2019s basically impossible.\u00a0\n\nThe Earth is roughly 4.5 billion years old.\u00a0\n\nThe Earth/Theia collision is estimated to have occurred between 4.4-4.45 billion years ago.\u00a0\n\nThat means life had about 100 million years or less to form. \u00a0 Which admittedly sounds like a lot of time to you and me, but in terms of the evolution of life is a blink of an eye.\u00a0\n\nLife as we know it started around 3.5 billion years ago. \u00a0It was primitive single celled organisms akin to bacteria today. \u00a0The first multi-celled organisms didn\u2019t appear until about 1.5-2 billion years later. \u00a0That\u2019s a lot longer than 100 million years that life would have had to show up before Theia came along. The earliest plants and animals didn\u2019t come along until less than 1 billion years ago. \u00a0And humans? \u00a0We\u2019ve been around less than 2 million years. \u00a0A blink of an eye on such time scales, it\u2019s taken almost all of the last 3.5 billion years for us to exist. \u00a0\n\n100 million years is just not much time for life to have done much on pre-impact Earth. \u00a0\n\nAdd to that how violent things were back then. \u00a0The earths landscape was hellish, with frequent voclanic activity and bombardment from space debris left over from the formation of the solar system. \u00a0Were any primitive life to have formed it would have been tough for it to stick around long under the circumstances. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t until after this chaotic period began to calm down that life as we know it emerged. \u00a0",
            "Whilst everyone is right about what we currently know. This question is impossible to answer because we are using current knowledge. It's easy to say life took billions of years to evolve, but that's based on evidence we have, basically a fieldset of 1..\n\nNo one knows if life didn't just accidentally happen quicker.. Its unlikely but not impossible, what is impossible is proving that, so we don't bother..",
            "Always a pleasure to read well informed, accessible, and source backed answers like this. Thank you.",
            "Didn't it also take until about \\~3.7 billion years ago for the earth to cool to the point that it could even support life? Not that it really matters, because a few hundred thousand years for single-cellular life to emerge is crazy, but a couple billion years for complex life to emerge is pretty damning.",
            "TIL the thing that hit Earth had a name. :)\n\nIs the moon what was left of Theia after the impact? Or is a chunk of Earth that got knocked out? Or a combination of the two?  Is Theia still wandering around out there somewhere?",
            "Were Gaia and Theia even solidified, if that's the right term, before the impact or were they still sort of molten rock balls?",
            "Add to that a compelling argument that tides drive so much motion in the ocean and create predictable diffusion gradients.",
            "This is partly covered in the linked prior thread. E.g., there's general arguments that Earth could have had at least some formation of water oceans within ~100 million years after the moon forming impact (e.g., [Elkins-Tanton, 2011](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10509-010-0535-3)), so I would question the suggestion that it took until 3.7 Ga to cool enough to support life.",
            "Borrowing again from a [previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/qdbx6r/did_theia_actually_smash_into_the_earth_or_is/):\n\nThe canonical view is that the proto-Earth was around 90% of the mass of the current Earth (e.g., [O'Neill, 1991](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0016703791901696)). As described by O'Neill, the general idea is that impactor hits the proto-Earth, the impactor is vaporized along with most of the mantle of the proto-Earth, and that much of this proto-Earth/Theia mixture recondenses to form the modern Earth with the rest forming the Moon. This is generally what is seen in a variety of models of this impact (e.g., [Canup, 2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0019103503002999), [Wada et al., 2006](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/499032/meta), etc).  The requirement of a decent amount of mixing and then this mostly homogeneous material accreting both back onto the Earth and forming the moon is a requirement to honor a variety of geochemical/isotopic constraints (e.g., [Jacobson et al., 2014](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13172), [Young et al., 2016](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aad0525), etc). \n\nNow, there are a lot of details here and while we have some constraints (e.g., the variety of geochemical and isotopic details mentioned above, observations of the masses and angular moments of the Earth-Moon system, etc), the outcomes of the types of models used to simulate this are sensitive to a variety of details. For example, there is the suggestion that significant amounts of the impactor + proto-Earth could have been ejected from the Earth-Moon system and ended up elsewhere in the solar system (e.g., [Jackson & Wyatt, 2012](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/425/1/657/1002593)). Similarly, depending on the properties and ratios of proto-Earth to impactor, different models can reproduce some (if not all) of the details of the canonical view. E.g., [Wade and Wood, 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X16300784) suggest a slightly larger impactor with reduced material is required to reproduce all of the geochemical details. In contrast, [Nakajima & Stevenson, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X15003805) simulate a few different scenarios, including the impact of an impactor about the same mass as the proto-Earth (which they ultimately reject as it produces too much mixing of the mantle to honor some geochemical observations which suggest that there must remain a primordial, unmixed portion of the Earth's mantle)."

Occasionally, there can be pigment dropout where the pigment drops into the dermis and are consumed by macrophages called \"melanophages\".\u00a0 This can happen from severe skin inflammation (like a bad sunburn) or skin conditions where there is inflammation affecting the DE junction (interface dermatitis). When this happens, the pigmentation can last longer (months to years) and also appear greyish or brown",
            "Most sun tans are from the lower epidermal layer upwards. There are three primary layers in the skin from lowest to uppermost: Dermis, epidermis, and stratum corneum. The melanocytes responsible for pigment production are found at the lower epidermis and distribute pigment into keratinocytes found in the epidermis. As the keratinocytes mature and eventually die, they form the stratum corneum with the pigment remaining. Extensive sun exposure can cause pigment to be distributed into the dermis.",
            "Ever peeled from a sun burn? About as deep as the thickness of that skin. Maybe a hundred microns? \n\nAnother question I would have: does your skin color effect penetration depth? E.g. darker skin\u2014-> less penetration?",
            "[removed]",
            "As far as I know melanin is found in melanocytes in the basal layer of the epidermis, so it would affect penetration starting from there but not for the first few layers",
            ">Another question I would have: does your skin color effect penetration depth? E.g. darker skin\u2014-> less penetration?\n\nYes, that's the function of melanin.  When you tan it reduces sun penetration.",
            "Melanocytes actually release melanin in response to exposure to UV light.  They release melanin into surrounding cells and it remains there as they mature."
