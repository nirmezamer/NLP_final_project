The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/15186wx/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxiv/).\n\nThe panel is an informal group of Redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.\n\nMembership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!\n\n\\-------------------\n\n**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**\n\n* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,\n* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.\n\n\\-------------------\n\n**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**\n\n* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).\n* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)\n* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)\n* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?\n* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.\n\n\\-------------------\n\nIdeally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.\n\nHere's an example application:\n\n`Username: /u/foretopsail`\n\n`General field: Anthropology`\n\n`Specific field: Maritime Archaeology`\n\n`Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction.`\n\n`Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.`\n\n`Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.`\n\nPlease do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.\n\nYou can submit your application by replying to this post.",

            "An ion is an atom/molecule that has a non-neutral charge due to an imbalance between its electrons and protons. Ionising radiation creates ions by effectively knocking an electron out of the original atom/molecule.",
            "It's ionizing, in the sense that it has enough energy to kick away electron from a molecule/atom creating an ion. The following chemical reaction will damage a cell (but also tons of material, for example some plastics become brittle when exposed to radiation)",
            "An ion is an atom or group of several atoms that has a charge. This means the number of electrons and protons don\u2019t match. Ions can be made in many ways but one is ionizing radiation. It is literally particles or light that has enough energy to rip off electrons from a molecule. When you rip off these electrons with radiation the molecule becomes unstable and often falls apart. When this happens to dna it can lead to cancer, cell death and a host of other things.",
            "Basically the radiation has enough energy to remove the electrons from atoms, this turns them into ions, the ion is the atom or molecule with a net electrical charge (if it losses a electron its postively charged iand if it gains one its neg charged) this changes the charge of the atom which can change its chemistry",
            "This is very true. However one correction I\u2019d like to add is that DNA does make a small but good portion of a cell\u2019s cross-sectional area  and does take damage from radiation quite often.\n\nOne common DNA damage that lead to mutations is called the pyramidine dimer. And that is caused by UV radiation directly hitting a TT or CC sequential pair. If this is not repaired prior to replication, a permanent downstream mutation can occur.",

            "X inactivation isn't perfect, some genes on the X chromosome are still expressed to some extent. That means there's still excess dosage of those gene products with karyotypes like XXY, XXXY, XXX etc.\n\nX inactivation makes the symptoms of such abnormalities much milder than in other abnormalities of similar sized chromosomes would - the only trisomy of a non-sex chromosome is Down syndrome, from an extra copy of the smallest chromosome (chromosome 21), which is much smaller than the X chromosome. There are no syndromes for an extra copy of other chromosomes than X, Y, or 21, as any embryo with such an abnormality will fail to develop and die.",
            "Most of the inactive X chromosome is covered in the repressive lncRNA Xist, but not all of it is shut down, so there is still a dosage effect from genes on the rest of the chromosome. It's a lot weaker, but when going to higher ploidy will cause issues.",
            "Another active chromosome means that gene dosage is increased and therefore may also inflict abnormalities in the cell/organism.",

Animals are only allowed one copy of each chromosome\". There's 0 reason for OP to *expect* that evolution would turn one of each pair of autosomal chromosomes off.     \n     \nThe problem with e.g. down syndrome isn't that you have *multiple* copies of chromosome 21 (people are supposed to have multiple! They're supposed to have 2), it's that you have the wrong number for your species.",

I know that there are A LOT of variables, such as what specific type of virus and bacteria or what antiviral and antibiotic is used, but there has to be some data comparing their relative effectiveness.",
        "num_comments": 25,
        "comments": [
            "I'll take a shot at this. Almost all antivirals suck. A lot of that has to do with the mechanics of viruses(intracellular, they use more of our own cell mechanics rather than their own separate proteins for replication) that make them harder to target. You look at something like oseltamivir(Tamiflu) and the benefit of taking it is really minimal, it barely outstrips side effects if at all. Some antivirals, like HIV and hcv protease inhibitors, work very well but given how the viruses work the hcv drugs need to be taken for weeks and the HIV drugs for life. Viruses are very hard to target, which is why if you have a vaccine it's gonna be a better option for almost all cases",
            "Well, let me gently push back here.  Perhaps our definitions of \"suck\" differ, but the examples you give, HIV protease and Hepatitis C protease inhibitors, absolutely changed the treatment of these horrible diseases.  Prior to the HIV protease inhibitors, HIV infection was a death sentence, and the inhibitors turned it into a completely manageable disease.  Hepatitis C is *cured* by the inhibitors.  Otherwise its a lifelong miserable affliction, including the non-trivial potential for liver failure and liver cancer.  These two classes of molecules revolutionized the treatment of their respective diseases.  Are they without challenges, and side effects?  Of course not.  But compared to what preceded them, misery and death, they are hugely successful.",
            "To add to this, with antivirals you're often just suppressing the outbreak, like with shingles or herpes. The virus isn't eradicated, just forced back into dormancy.",
            "Also, the same drug at the same dose for the same bacterial infection can work differently for diffferent parts of the body, mostly based on pharmacokinetics.",
            "May I ask something? The one question I'm left with is whether there are certain viruses that we can say confidently respond well to ant-viral therapy. I think this removes the many variables because the answer I'm asking for is whether there are any conditions for which anti-virals are pretty consistently prescribed and considered the main and best form of treatment with a fairly consistent successful outcome.",
            "That's fair. But we're talking about comparing to antibiotics which, by and large, are stellar. Pneumonia was once a death sentence, to the point that it was referred to as \"the old man's friend,\" but take the right pills for five days and it's gone. Hcv therapy is great, but it just isn't as big a deal penicillin, a drug so remarkable that you probably know the name of the guy who discovered it. Syphilis was once a bigger scourge than hcv, but no one really worried about it anymore because you can take one shot of penicillin and it's gone. If I had to do without one or the other been antibiotics or antivirals, there is no question on a population level",
            "Anti-retroviral drugs, while not perfect, are extremely effective at treating HIV and preventing AIDS. They have given millions of people extra decades of life. They have almost single-handedly turned the tide in the ongoing HIV pandemic.\u00a0",
            "I do agree that antibiotics are amazing and  completely transformed  the world that existed before them.  But the new anti-virals are amazing in their own right.",
            "To be a pedant, treatment for syphilis is months of antibiotics (nearly a year) to fully clear it. But in general the vibe is right, ABs are very good.",
            "Worth noting that not all antibacterial antibiotics work by \u201ckilling\u201d bacteria. Certainly the penicillin-derived classes do for the most part, but sulfa antibiotics, tetracyclines, macrolides, clindamycin, and linezolid all work by suppressing protein production (some more directly than others). I think aminoglycosides can do either depending on which drug.  \n\nClindamycin is a great example because it is fairly often given alongside a bactericidal antibiotic, so that the bacterioside can kill the cells but the clindamycin can prevent them from continuing to make toxins as they die. Without clinda, a lot of toxin-mediated infections would be far more damaging even while being treated. All that to say, direct killing vs suppressing protein production isn\u2019t always a very good measure of a drug being \u201cmore effective\u201d than another."

The goal is essentially to slow the water flow enough that a shallow pond forms behind the obstruction, at which point the extra weight presses water through faster until it reaches an equilibrium between the pond's in/out flow.\n\nIt's common for beaver dam sections to fail and need repair, overall though that's very different picture than the failure of a large human dam with hundreds of feet of water column behind it. The forces are far more devastating.",
