        "content": "if you're looking at a car at any dealership and have a trade but have bad credit, how do you negotiate?\n\nat what point in the conversation do you find out what **actual finance rate** you'll be getting? or do you have to already commit to the deal (put money down) before they tell you what shitty rate you'll be getting? \n\nfor example., I see a car for $10k on their website, go down there and see it, like it, want it. i Say \"i'd like to trade my current vehicle, how much will you give me? give me a good dollar value for my trade and we'll sign the deal right now.\" we go back and forth with the trade, they finally give me a trade value i'd accept so I know the purchase price $10k minus the trade value = overall price. Do I have to now put money down before they crunch numbers and tell me what interest rate I qualify for? or can they do this before committing to the sale? I dont want to be paying 15%+ for the loan.\n\nhaven't bought a car in over 20 years and it was cash back then",
        "num_comments": 16,
        "comments": [
            "You really do need to look at the overall price and not just the financed price. Do whatever you can to have as much of a cash down payment as possible. If you have bad credit and are purchasing a used vehicle, you're looking at minimum 10% interest these days.\u00a0",
            "Usually, you settle on the purchase price (not much wiggle room other than asking price these days at dealerships). Then you negotiate the trade value. You shouldn't need to put money down unless your trade doesn't not have enough value to secure the loan. If that's the case they would let you know what difference you'd likely have to kick in before they go to the lenders. Now, what's left is what you're borrowing. I'll use my experience here. I went to Birchwood Ford. They now approach their lenders, they came back to me with 3 options, ford credit, td auto finance and I forget who the other one was, the basic differences was the interest rate. Then basically you choose who you would prefer to deal with. I went with TD which was the lowest interest rate.",
            "I would get the \u201cout the door \u201c price of the vehicle then tell them you have a trade in. Don\u2019t let them know before. And don\u2019t say I want monthly payments to be x amount of dollars as they will find a way to get you there. Just my opinion",
            "They will have certain thresholds based on your credit rating. So what would happen is if they approach the lenders, let's say with a 3000 trade value and you put in a 1000, because in past experience the dealership knows most high risk loans require let's say 20% of a $20000 loan=4000. Having said all this, that is what happens with traditional lenders. Banks and auto finance companies. You could just go to like ridetime or someplace that has in-house financing, and they'll tell you exactly what they want down and exactly what they'd give you for your trade.",
            "Well, what I meant is that the dealership does the financing themselves. So yes, Birchwood is one that does that for new and used cars. Then there's the places that cater almost exclusively to folks with poor credit, bankruptcies, and the like, such as ridetime. Where they aren't actually creating a loan, they are giving you the car with a promise to pay them an agreed upon price over an agreed upon time frame, the caveat here is, is you fall behind in payments they just disable the car remotely and come pick it up as technically they are still the owner of the vehicle. Whereas if you go to a lender, you've borrowed money, bought a car that is yours, and if you miss payments, there's a legal process of repossession the lenders have to go through.",
            "most places won't finance a car older than a certain ago as well as lower than a certain price, so.im gunna say if it's a 10k car with a trade in of a few thousand then you'll need to have the rest on hand. you can also contact Canada drives to see what interest rate they'd be able to get you.",
            "In my experience, the salesman will want to know if you're financing, you'll figure out the purchase and trade in price with him, and then you'll go to the financing office, where they will use the numbers from the salesman, and your credit info, to give you a rate and a payment.",
            "if you're looking at an older used vehicle and your trade is newer with less km, will they always lowball your trade? ie, they'll never give you 1/2 off the purchase price with your trade?",
            "hi thanks. so you mean they know right away if my trade will be too low to secure financing on poor credit? they have a minimum number to meet as a down payment before even attempting financing?   \nwhy do they give you a choice of financers? wouldn't everyone one pick the one offering the lowest interest?",
            "thanks you but i'd be driving there with the car that I want to trade. I'd assume they'd know it might be a trade. Are all financing open? meaning I could pay it off sooner than term? I'd be more comfortable have a lower biweekly payment but I know they'd have to extend the loan to ridiculous lengths of time. I'd prefer that though because once I start getting my finances back in the right direction, I'd put more money down on paying it off sooner."
