In order to keep the sub organized and keep information centralized, all future Push30 discussions will be removed and redirected to comment in this Megathread.\n\n**What is Push30?** - It's a free 30-day challenge where participants can earn prizes at their studio for taking at least 12 classes and committing to 3 out of 7 daily habits for the 30 day period.  You can sign up on the app or at your studio, and your studio should have free paper trackers, however some subreddit members have made and shared tracker templates as well!  [Tracker 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/orangetheory/comments/1d59ja9/push30_custom_template_all_challenges/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) by u/haziiedaiisy | [Tracker 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/orangetheory/comments/1d95l7h/2024_push_30_challenge_google_spreadsheet_template/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) by u/toddersbud \n\nPush30 runs from June 15-July 14, 2024 at most studios (some studios may have a different date range).  You can only register at one studio, but you can take classes at any studio.  Orange 60, Orange 90, Strength 50, and Tread 50 classes all count.  Only one class per day will count.  *Prizes and eligibility for prizes will vary by studio.*  You can view the official promotion terms [here](https://www.orangetheory.com/en-us/promotion-terms).\n\nIf you need ideas for the \"nutritional opportunity\" challenge, u/bonniejo514 made an amazing list of ideas [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/orangetheory/comments/1ddlsx2/ideas_for_the_push_30_nutrition_challenge/).\n\nSince we can only have 2 pinned posts at any given time, the June monthly post had to be unpinned, but you can still find that post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/orangetheory/comments/1d51dqc/its_your_june_2024_monthly_post/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).  The key dates from that post are reproduced below for your convenience:\n\n**Key Dates for The Month**\n\n* **June 20 (Thursday):** Strong & Steady; signature workout.\n* **PLEASE NOTE:** Many international studios, especially Canada, and some US studios, may be doing **Marathon Month** in an extended 6 week format from June 17-July 31. Why longer than a month? Why not in August like usual? We have no idea.\n* Run/Rows 6/23, 6/25.\n* Switch templates 6/26.\n* Upright (Incline?) Bench on 6/19.\n* Low Bench on 6/25.\n* BOSU on 6/27.\n* Mini Bands on 6/23.\n* Medicine Ball on 6/26.\n* **Repeat templates are as follows**: 6/17 = 6/1, 6/18 = 6/2, 6/19 = 6/3, 6/21 = 6/5, 6/22 = 6/6, 6/23 = 6/7, 6/24 = 6/9, 6/25 = 6/10, 6/26 = 6/11, 6/27 = 6/12, 6/28 = 6/13, 6/29 = 6/16, 6/30 = 6/15.

Well my last coach went totally rogue on this template last time. I was dying with the first block but as it turns out he had upped all the paces. This time round it felt a lot more manageable. You start with the endurance builds - base, base to push, push and then a push to all out with a 30 second walking recovery. Start with the 30 second efforts then 45 seconds and then a minute. Two minutes to walk and then you are into the \u201cpower\u201d efforts where you are expected to keep increasing your paces as the durations come off. Start with a 45 second progressive build where the main difference is that you are now tacking on an all out at the end. Work your way down to a 15 second build and you are done. Good distance today of 5.59km (3.473 miles). \\\n\\\nOn the floor you have two blocks. First block has a very awkward swing lunge with rotation. I think the last time I did this the coach explained this well and we should think of this like you just have one foot stuck in the mud and you are are just moving the other leg into the lunging position and rotating over the leg that is in front. The transverse step up to knee raise is done without weights and is your active recovery. I break this up into two movements so I am not twisting the knee too much. Bird dog low row I always go lower weights than I could low row just as it can place a bit of extra pressure on the lower back trying to stabilize. \\\n\\\nOn the second block this is much more power focused. Single arm clean to press the coach said we should be picking a weight heavier than we would normally just shoulder press so we are forced to use more of our legs to drive up the weight to shoulder and then overhead. Lateral hop overs and then a pushup to high side plank before a 200m all out row. Managed to shave 0.1 of a second off my last time with a 31.3 second effort so happy with that. Getting ready for the benchmark next week! \\\n\\\nTreadmill still pretty rough but not as bad as when the previous coach got us to do all outs in the first round. I would give today a 2 (\ud83e\udeb6 \ud83e\udeb6) out of 5 for gentleness. !<",
            "Appreciate the early intel, as always. I really like this template. Wish my location did 2Gs on Saturdays. We only have 3Gs that day though. It will be my very first 3G, so I don\u2019t really know what to expect, and I am very nervous about the rowing block because the rower is my nemesis.",
            "Click the \u201c16th of June\u201d link above in description and you will find the 3G format.",
            "Thank you so much! Although, now I kind of wish I hadn\u2019t looked. I\u2019m glad I saw your comment before class though so I can at least mentally prepare myself. That\u2019s a lot of rowing without a break. I\u2019m still going to go and do the hard thing . Hopefully they don\u2019t have to wheel me out. LOL I\u2019m going to start doing 3Gs every Saturday so hoping to build up my rowing stamina."

Then up to 4.5 mph as a base and, about 2 years later, I\u2019m up to 5.2 mph as my base. But, today, when I jumped into the 5k, my pace was faster than 10min/mile (6mph)!  I guess I can up my base again!\n\nThis is all to say: if you\u2019re like I was and feel like even a 4.5mph jog is too much, stick with it!  Progress takes TIME. It took me years, but OTF has made it fun and safe to progress at my own pace. Now I can jump into a 5k without any training past what I do 3-4 mornings a week at OTF. \n\nTHANK YOU!",
