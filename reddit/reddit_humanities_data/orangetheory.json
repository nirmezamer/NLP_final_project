        "content": "Welcome to your 2024 Push30 Discussion Megathread!  In order to keep the sub organized and keep information centralized, all future Push30 discussions will be removed and redirected to comment in this Megathread.\n\n**What is Push30?** - It's a free 30-day challenge where participants can earn prizes at their studio for taking at least 12 classes and committing to 3 out of 7 daily habits for the 30 day period.  You can sign up on the app or at your studio, and your studio should have free paper trackers, however some subreddit members have made and shared tracker templates as well!  [Tracker 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/orangetheory/comments/1d59ja9/push30_custom_template_all_challenges/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) by u/haziiedaiisy | [Tracker 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/orangetheory/comments/1d95l7h/2024_push_30_challenge_google_spreadsheet_template/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) by u/toddersbud \n\nPush30 runs from June 15-July 14, 2024 at most studios (some studios may have a different date range).  You can only register at one studio, but you can take classes at any studio.  Orange 60, Orange 90, Strength 50, and Tread 50 classes all count.  Only one class per day will count.  *Prizes and eligibility for prizes will vary by studio.*  You can view the official promotion terms [here](https://www.orangetheory.com/en-us/promotion-terms).\n\nIf you need ideas for the \"nutritional opportunity\" challenge, u/bonniejo514 made an amazing list of ideas [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/orangetheory/comments/1ddlsx2/ideas_for_the_push_30_nutrition_challenge/).\n\nSince we can only have 2 pinned posts at any given time, the June monthly post had to be unpinned, but you can still find that post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/orangetheory/comments/1d51dqc/its_your_june_2024_monthly_post/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).  The key dates from that post are reproduced below for your convenience:\n\n**Key Dates for The Month**\n\n* **June 20 (Thursday):** Strong & Steady; signature workout.\n* **PLEASE NOTE:** Many international studios, especially Canada, and some US studios, may be doing **Marathon Month** in an extended 6 week format from June 17-July 31. Why longer than a month? Why not in August like usual? We have no idea.\n* Run/Rows 6/23, 6/25.\n* Switch templates 6/26.\n* Upright (Incline?) Bench on 6/19.\n* Low Bench on 6/25.\n* BOSU on 6/27.\n* Mini Bands on 6/23.\n* Medicine Ball on 6/26.\n* **Repeat templates are as follows**: 6/17 = 6/1, 6/18 = 6/2, 6/19 = 6/3, 6/21 = 6/5, 6/22 = 6/6, 6/23 = 6/7, 6/24 = 6/9, 6/25 = 6/10, 6/26 = 6/11, 6/27 = 6/12, 6/28 = 6/13, 6/29 = 6/16, 6/30 = 6/15. Yes, they do occasionally repeat out of order, we have seen this before.\n\n  \nHappy Splatting!\n\n- Your Modsquad: [u/lookie4dacookie](https://www.reddit.com/u/lookie4dacookie/), [u/jenniferlynn5454](https://www.reddit.com/u/jenniferlynn5454/), [u/pantherluna](https://www.reddit.com/u/pantherluna/), [u/neat\\_eggplant\\_8145](https://www.reddit.com/u/neat_eggplant_8145/) and [u/Rizzah319](https://www.reddit.com/u/Rizzah319/)",

I\u2019m trying to intake 5-10 fruit/veg servings a day. In about a week, I\u2019ve met that each day but usually am at 5, most I\u2019ve done is 6.

            "On this push30 do the 3 objectives have to be the same all the way through? If I do the 7k steps a day and the mindfulness can my third one be different throughout the challenge",

            "Is it 12 or 15 classes? I thought it was 12 but my app is showing 15\u2026"

When I started with OTF years ago, I could only manage power walking on the tread. I did that for a long time, then made power walking my base and a light jog my push. Then up to 4.5 mph as a base and, about 2 years later, I\u2019m up to 5.2 mph as my base. But, today, when I jumped into the 5k, my pace was faster than 10min/mile (6mph)!  I guess I can up my base again!\n\nThis is all to say: if you\u2019re like I was and feel like even a 4.5mph jog is too much, stick with it!  Progress takes TIME. It took me years, but OTF has made it fun and safe to progress at my own pace. Now I can jump into a 5k without any training past what I do 3-4 mornings a week at OTF. \n\nTHANK YOU!",

            "That's so great!  Congrats!!  I ran my first 5K race this year and now do it every week for the summer.  Once upon a time I would have shuddered at the thought of ~30 mins of timed, continuous running!\n\nOTF helps the most with *consistency*, and that is how to keep raising the bar for yourself!  Well done \ud83d\ude4c",
            "Good for you!  To me, this is a great way to see the impact that OTF has on your life outside of the studio. \n \nI started OTF as an overweight, unhealthy couch potato in 2015 and, after a break during the pandemic, two years ago I ran a half marathon with no training other than OTF.  Now, I don\u2019t recommend that but I did it.  This year I ran a full marathon (with proper training).  OTF has changed my life, and convinced me I could do things I never believed possible.  I am a fan forever.",
            "Great start!  Keep at it!  The hardest part for me was getting myself to stop comparing myself to others - once I could really focus on my personal progress, every small .1 felt incredible!  I even remember, at the very beginning, feeling incredibly proud when I could simply power walk the whole block as it was coached instead of \u201ccheating\u201d with unplanned walking recoveries!  That was my first real progress milestone \ud83d\ude0a",

I\u2019m very active even before joining OTF so I started off with pretty good conditioning but even then I can see improvement in my fitness after just one month.

I\u2019m finding the workouts easier each day which probably means I can keep pushing myself more. My target is to run comfortably at 7mph for base and 8-9 mph for push. ",
