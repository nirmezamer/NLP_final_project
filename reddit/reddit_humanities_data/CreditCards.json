I noticed that there was no SUB tracker under my CSP account on the Chase app so decided to give customer service a call. The first time I called (yesterday 6/20), they escalated my issue to the marketing team and I decided to wait 24 hours for an update.\n\nWith no update and after three rounds with customer service today, a supervisor decided it was an appropriate time to gaslight me. He told me that I agreed to a pop-up message stating that I was told if I want to proceed applying for the CSP, it would be with no SUB. I can promise you that there was no such pop-up and I even went in-branch today to talk to the bank teller who completed my application. She assured me that there was no such message and is going to see what's going on next week once her boss is back in the office.\n\nThe super condescending and rude supervisor also told me that \"last week\" a new anti-churning regulation came into play where ONLY ONE SUB is given for ANY Chase card every 48 months. I confirmed multiple times that I have never opened a Sapphire card and that this was indeed for ALL Chase cards (I opened a CFF in April of this year). I asked multiple times where the fine print regarding this new rule was, but he would condescendingly and continuously say \"\\[my first name\\], I assure you, you will not be getting the bonus no matter what\"\n\nThe whole ordeal with the supervisor left a terrible taste in my mouth and honestly would rather not do business with Chase again. I really do appreciate the bank teller who helped me out though, as she has been the same person who I have gone to open all of my Chase accounts with.
