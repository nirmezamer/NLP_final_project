I also received a QS SUB when I signed up in June 2023. Is it possible that they revoked the SUB without telling me, maybe some kind of rule around SUBs that they have? Or is the SUB still there?

On the other hand, both have a gas category, which the S1 does not have. The streaming overlaps BCP and S1, but is replaced on BCE with online shopping.
