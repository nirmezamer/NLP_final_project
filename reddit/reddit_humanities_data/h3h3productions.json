            "I still haven\u2019t figured out why Ethan decided to conduct the interview like that\u2026 that\u2019s not how you interview someone, especially when you have no proof they are in the wrong. A cat doesn\u2019t get that sick over night, she had plenty of time to take her to the vet. As a cat owner, I\u2019m always on high alert for any symptoms I notice. Cats are good at hiding their pain, so if it got to the point of what we saw in the video, she must have been suffering for a while. I\u2019m disappointed by how Ethan handled this issue.",
            "Appreciate Olivia and Dan, especially this episode.",
            "Dan proving once again why he's the most level headed",
            "PLEASE if you see a dying animal you should 100 percent try and rescue it. The fact that she had this cat for months sick and he tried to rescue this cat speaks volumes to each of there characters if you ask me.",
            "Am I the only one who is suspicious that she never took the cat to the vet EVER, like never a check up for vaccines or a microchip or nothing? Like or did she take him to the vet before but not recent enough.",
            "\nI\u2019m having a really hard time with the conclusions the crew are getting to\u2026.\n\nI think when they did the interview the guy was obviously flustered and forgetting specific details, but he was still implying a lot of things. Like to me it was obvious that he was at that house and was passively observing the cat for a decent amount of time and noticing the way it was being treated, to me it sounded like there was a conversation between the roommates about the condition of the cat and it seemed like they had all agreed upon taking action if this girl wasn\u2019t. \n\nOn top of that Olivia is right, during Covid it would\u2019ve been incredibly hard to get a pet in. And to top that, yes, urgent cares do not have the same amount of care an actual vet would. And why would you bring a sick animal to wait hours in emergency, just to get subpar care? Wouldn\u2019t you rather the animal feel safe and wait a day or two when you KNOW the animal will actually get treated and correctly observed? \n\nNot to mention the guy literally said he thought the cat was starving at first, and didn\u2019t realize that the cat maybe had more going on which is why it took an extra day or two to get to the vet. Also coming down on this guy for waiting 3 1/2 days compared to the MONTHS this girl had the cat.. like really? \n\nWith the seizures too.. cats don\u2019t randomly have seizures, usually that happens because of an underlying condition that requires medication. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that was happening in her care before he took the cat.\n\nWhen I originally heard about this situation I had watched her first tiktok about it. My initial reaction was that something was off because if I was in her situation and my cat got out and it was sick, I would be destroyed. Even years later I find it hard to talk about my dog that passed because I was away at college when it happened and I feel incredibly guilty that I wasn\u2019t there for her. Imagine thinking that your cat is sick, lost, and alone and just talking about how \u201cyou didn\u2019t kill your cat\u201d. Like please, and the fake in and out of crying on her videos\u2026 really girl? \n\nIn conclusion I would\u2019ve done the same thing that the guy did. I\u2019ve been in a similar situation before with a roommate and I did speak with him, eventually he decided to give the cat to someone who would care for it. But we don\u2019t know this girl, that conversation could\u2019ve been had between other roommates. Ultimately if the cat was this sick to the point where he brings it to the vet and their best advice is to put it down.. it was very obviously neglected, and it bothers me how this guy is on the hot seat and not the girl. \n\nI get they need to question every motive of this guy but they did it so harshly and focused on small things and it felt like they missed the point of what he was saying.\n\nI love the H3 podcast and I\u2019ll always be a dedicated viewer but I feel like they missed the mark with this one (as doobrik would say)",
            "BUT YOU WERE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY, GIRL. she\u2019s saying that Seven got sick often, and she never took her to get checked out. you were given the opportunity to address her health concerns multiple times and YOU DIDN\u2019T. \n\nthe guy who took her cat is definitely a bit strange too, but i don\u2019t think he\u2019s responsible for Seven\u2019s death at all.",
            "I knew this was going to go downhill when the girl dropped a superchat.",
            "This is sad, as someone who works in the vet field regardless of what happened the cat should not have gone 3 weeks without seeing a vet\u2026 also the shelter should\u2019ve been contacted only to discuss medical history and advice, she should have absolutely seen a vet a few days after symptoms pursued. Yeah it\u2019s her first pet but don\u2019t get a cat then if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing \ud83e\udd72 she has more than enough $$ I\u2019m sure to have gotten her adequate care."
