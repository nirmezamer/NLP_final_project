A big thank you to the three groups who took the plunge and posted their efforts here on Reddit, giving us the courage to follow suit - we have been sharing this privately until now\u2026  \n \nBoth files include the full translation of the book, complete with the two extras (extended chapter 11 and the \u201cLight shines through everything\u201d epilogue) which were originally posted on nihilist.fm and zaum.ee, the original writing/editing/worldbuilding credits, and the lists of hundreds of names of Elysium characters, geographical entities and assorted concepts that fill the inside covers of the printed copy.  \n \nPersnickety footnotes translate the instances of Russian/Polish/Swedish/etc text, add some Estonian context, and explore the many neologisms that don't appear in the game, from the \"epiphery\" sprawling behind ancient satellites to Seraise \"ensiferants\".  \nWhenever an Elysium term did appear in the game, like \u201cprotein masses\u201d or the updated correspondences of the International Language, we followed canon's lead, sticking to fayde\u2019s script search like so many limpets.  \n \nHappy reading,  \nGroup Ibex  \n \nPDF: https://drive.google.com/file/d/10hNiOLPy_xGX5VSnNp0fTx6aU5NHPhBX/view?usp=drivesdk\nEPUB: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XjBapU74VKRoC9BYk1lwhG8HeveQpVvS/view?usp=drivesdk",

            "Mods, I REALLY think you should pin this one, or at least make a 3rd party pinned post that links all fan-translated versions with equal weight--only pinning one version really devalues the work Group Ibex put into this and means this version gets hidden.",

            "As with the game, I have to be optimistic, in the end.\u00a0\n\n\nThe writers who gave us Disco Elysium had their universe stolen from them, and that's infuriating. Elysium is a beautiful idea, and you can tell that every contour of it was thoughtfully considered. I'm going to carry it with me in my heart for the rest of my life.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nDisco's impact has reverberrated these last five years. There are already games being made in its style, paying homage to it, to the point that \"Disco-like\" is a real term that gets used now. If the original writers return to making games, I'll be there in a second. If they don't, I'll still be thankful for what they've given us.\u00a0\n\n\nThere's a sea of creators who are as inspired by Disco as I am out there. That's exciting to me, and I can't wait to see what people come up with.\u00a0",

They have gone through hell.\n\nIn this world the Ultra Liberals won.",
