A big thank you to the three groups who took the plunge and posted their efforts here on Reddit, giving us the courage to follow suit - we have been sharing this privately until now\u2026  \n \nBoth files include the full translation of the book, complete with the two extras (extended chapter 11 and the \u201cLight shines through everything\u201d epilogue) which were originally posted on nihilist.fm and zaum.ee, the original writing/editing/worldbuilding credits, and the lists of hundreds of names of Elysium characters, geographical entities and assorted concepts that fill the inside covers of the printed copy.  \n \nPersnickety footnotes translate the instances of Russian/Polish/Swedish/etc text, add some Estonian context, and explore the many neologisms that don't appear in the game, from the \"epiphery\" sprawling behind ancient satellites to Seraise \"ensiferants\".  \nWhenever an Elysium term did appear in the game, like \u201cprotein masses\u201d or the updated correspondences of the International Language, we followed canon's lead, sticking to fayde\u2019s script search like so many limpets.  \n \nHappy reading,  \nGroup Ibex  \n \nPDF: https://drive.google.com/file/d/10hNiOLPy_xGX5VSnNp0fTx6aU5NHPhBX/view?usp=drivesdk\nEPUB: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XjBapU74VKRoC9BYk1lwhG8HeveQpVvS/view?usp=drivesdk",

            "Mods, I REALLY think you should pin this one, or at least make a 3rd party pinned post that links all fan-translated versions with equal weight--only pinning one version really devalues the work Group Ibex put into this and means this version gets hidden.",

I would suggest taking her dialogues slow, check words you don't know if you need, or as a last resort paste a sentence into a translator - it's a but of a time investment, but it's a great way to learn.
