It was nominally full time, but my schedule was erratic and unpredictable, so while my availability for work stayed high, the actual load averaged a lot less than full time.  I found this combo meshed well with my WFH routine and the fact my time-off was doing stuff on the computer anyway, so work was mostly confirming an empty in-box every hour or so for the most part.  The biggest change after retiring is that I no longer have to check incoming e-mails regularly, so I can go shopping or out for a long walk at any time.  I don't have the desire to travel, but my gig would have been ideal for a digital nomad type if they could live happily in a location with a time zone and shift preference that is compatible with the required available hours.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1dqsll8/5year_working_anniversary_fi_progress_update/",
        "content": "Hey everyone! I \\[27M as of today\\] am a long-time lurker and occasional commenter here. I discovered FI in early 2017 during my sophomore year of college at 20 after stumbling upon the ChooseFI podcast. Had minimal knowledge of finances at all as evidenced by this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6lm0qm/20_yo_looking_for_financial_advice/), which gave me a chuckle. The catalyst for my interest here was pretty much how awful being confined to a desk from 7 AM to 5 PM felt, even starting with my internships in 2017 & 2018. This post is partially serving for my own edification and records, but I am welcome to constructive criticism or advice from anyone pursuing FI.\n\n**Education**: \n\nI'm a first-gen college student, I graduated in June 2019 with a BS in Mechanical Engineering from a public state school in Northeast USA, with minors in Math and Aerospace Eng. Being a \"1st gen student\", I benefited from a few scholarships and only walked out of undergrad with $32k in loans constituted by a mixture of federal and private. I am grateful to my parents who assisted me, and I made up the difference with on-campus jobs as a TA and with money made during summers through interning. \n\nI graduated with a whopping $743 in my checking account, a -$31k individual NW, and was wholly reliant on my then gf (now wife) for financial support for the first 2 months of full-time employment. My GPA and experience were decent and I managed to land a government job as a Mechanical Engineer for $59k. \n\n**Debt:**\n\nI only saved 6% in my 401k for the match from June 2019 onwards, and I shoveled all my discretionary income into my loans and paid them off by December 2020. Conversely, my wife contributed 10% into her 401k and served as the emergency fund for our household unit. Extremely fortunate to have her in my life.\n\nI got lucky with the pandemic. It pretty much allowed me to focus on just paying loans off and not do anything else with my money (since everything was locked down). I keep this part quiet because almost everyone else in the world had an opposite reaction. Was a weird life duality to be honest. Everything was terrible for friends and family members, but personally me and my then-gf were doing OK.\n\nStarting 2021, after debt payoff, we kept our lifestyles the same and maxed our retirement accounts and worked hard. I got work to pay for my masters degree, which was a nice perk.\n\nWe are fortunate to have each other as a support system financially, and to have our friends and family to support us personally.\n\n**Work**:\n\nI went from Mechanical Engineering into Project Management in January 2020, with focuses on mechanical, electrical and software systems in the aerospace and defense sectors. There's a good amount of money and a decent amount of stability here. In January 2021, I started a masters in Systems Engineering to prove to myself I could (got work to pay for the whole thing), graduated December 2022. I had a 1-year continued service clause/contract, which ended December 2023, where I then leveraged it into a Program Manager role this past March with a lot higher of pay. \n\nMy proclivity for PM really comes down to being disinterested in technical engineering, and being much better at talking to customers and communicating requirements. I also did not feel that I would be \u201csmart enough\u201d for rising to the top of the technical mech engineering disciplines, but I just have strengths in other softer areas. Playing to my strengths, I suppose. I was pushed/prodded into presenting and interfacing with high up stakeholders and customers and lo and behold I was a PM. \n\n**Compensation/Salary Progression**:\n\nWife \\[27\\] and I got married in 2023, but have been together since 2015. Finances were always a transparent topic and we're pretty identical in terms of frugality.\n\nMy salary:\n\n* 2019: $59,222\n* 2020: $65,114\n* 2021: $72,413\n* 2022: $86,080\n* 2023: $108,160\n* 2024: $145,000\n\n  \nHHI:\n\n* 2019 - $111k \n* 2020 - $119k \n* 2021 - $154k \n* 2022 - $176k \n* 2023 - $214k \n* 2024 - $265k (on track)\n\nWe\u2019ve both been pretty keen on advocating for ourselves at our jobs and applying internally and externally. I was at a gov job until March 2024 where I had solid jumps due to the GS ladder. Leveraged a grad degree and experience for a big jump into private industry. My wife was able to move around internally 2 times and have great success at her current company in 2021 and late 2022. She is currently also pursuing a masters and we are expecting a big pay raise for that in 2026 or thereabout.\n\n**Net Worth:**\n\nOur generic NW history can be found [here](https://imgur.com/a/WXATtnm). We are DINK right now, and have had a dog since 2020. Kids are probably in the cards, but most likely not until ages 29 to 30. We bought a house in April 2023 which is reason for the flatline-spike-flatline (down payment flowed out, house equity flowed back in, improvements flowed back out).\n\n* June 2019 = -$31k\n* December 2019 = $0\n* April 2021 = +$100k\n* March 2023 = +$200k\n* November 2023 = +$300k\n* May 2024 = +$400k\n\nThere\u2019s probably 0 chance we hit $500k by end of the year, but we have hope!\n\n**Current stats (combined)**:\n\n* Checking/Savings = $67k\n* 401ks (90% trad 10% roth) = $241k\n* Roths (100% VTSAX) = $24k\n* HSA = $13k\n* House Equity = $78k\n* Total NW (including house) = $423k\n\nWe do churning (bank accounts and cc's) and our balances vary from -$3k to -$12k combined, and are currently sitting on about +$6k of points equivalent. Paid off in full every month, factored into the checking/savings line item above.\n\n**Philosophy/Goals:**\n\nMy goal in life has pretty much been to just focus on learning and excelling as much as possible. I will acknowledge that it has been a surreal ride and crazy salary progression. \n\nI feel very unmotivated by work, but very motivated by money and the option for freedom.\n\nMy ideal job is one with \"no boss required,\" and potentially pivoting into part-time consulting work if I can build up an extensive network and knowledge base.\n\nThat's pretty much it. Our focuses between now and age 30 are excelling in our careers, enjoying our respective hobbies, and spending quality time with friends/family and each other. \n\nOur expenses have been high for the past year but we've also been doing a significant amount of home improvements. \n\nCurrent Annual Expenses = $90k ($8.5k x 12)\n\nProjected Annual Expenses = $120k\n\nProgress on the way to \"FI\" = \\~14%\n\nI'll probably write another post in 5 more years, at the 10-years of working anniversary. Cheers everyone, keep on chugging along.\n\nTL;DR - FI good, we were lucky, and rewarded for continued tenacity and conviction in different life areas. I am immensely grateful for this community for shaping my life. ",
