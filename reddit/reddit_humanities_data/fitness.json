We ask you to respect that the people answering your questions are volunteering their time, knowledge, and experience.\n\nTo help answer your questions, get you started, or help you continue on your fitness journey, we have complied a comprehensive Wiki and FAQ.  [**https://thefitness.wiki/**](https://thefitness.wiki/) is the result of community discussions on best practice, expert opinion, emerging science, and general know-how from those who have made fitness their lifestyle or profession.\n\n# The r/Fitness wiki is moderator funded, and this year we are asking for your help to make it community funded.\n\nDomain registration and hosting costs over $500 per year, but it is important to us to house this resource off-platform.  Why?  To keep it ad-free and prevent any undue sponsorship or marketing influence, to keep it organized, to ensure content and links to outside resources work regardless of app or browser, to enable proper search functionality, and to make sure it's available during site outages.  **If you'd like to contribute**, you can anonymously donate any amount via [an Amazon e-gift card](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-1_US_Email-eGift-Card/dp/B004LLIKVU) to [purplespengler@gmail.com](mailto:purplespengler@gmail.com).
