I cannot edit my training maxes, no matter what I try\n\nfrom my understanding, editing them will also edit the precentages for training automatically, so that's great.

I felt a little sore after the workout but no that im home i feel fine. Does this mean i didnt do enough and i should do more with heavier weights?

I was wondering, for stuff like the barbell row and romanian deadlift, should I try using straps if I can\u2019t feel the weight working the muscles it\u2019s supposed to be? My form might be wrong, but also I\u2019m only using like the barbell with 5\u2019s or 10\u2019s on each side. It feels like I\u2019m too tired/can\u2019t hold onto the bar itself to do enough reps that fatigue my muscles or even practice the hip hinge movement. Same with the deadlift, even though you drop the weight to the ground for each rep, I feel like my arms/back are too tired to start the initial pull after a few reps. I can do the bar with lighter weights though and the movement feels easier to do than with just dumbbells. Any advice?",

            "Hello! I recently decided that I wanted to get better at dips and pullups, so I added some variations of these into my routine alongside my other non bodyweight exercises like bench press, pulldowms, rows etc and I run a Upper/Lower split. Now my question is, since I can only do a total of 1 dip, 0 pullups and 2 chinups, would it be even worth it to try to get stronger on these if I am currently bulking? The main way I'm currently doing these, is starting a set trying to do as many real reps, then following that up with 3-4 sec negatives. I do those until the lowering portion gets too fast. And about weight gain, I gain about 1 to 2 kg a month, and have been bulking now for 6 months, but I've been hitting the gym for a year now. I'm currently 82kg and 180cm tall. So what do you guys think? Is it worth it, or should I just stick to non bodyweight stuff for now?",

            "In an attempt to increase side delt training volume, I've recently started doing something (maybe) a bit strange. I start workouts with two hard sets of cable lateral raises (one regular set and one drop set), do the rest of my workout, and one hour plus later my side delts feel recovered enough that I'm able to hit the same two hard sets at almost the same performance level.\n\nMy question is: is this a bad idea for any reason? Asking because almost every program I know puts all the sets of the same exercise back-to-back (with the exception of supersets), and I've never seen any program put an exercise at the start and at the end.",

            "Is there such a thing as too much heel elevation for (high-bar) squats? I have the Rogue Do-wins which have a .75\" heel, and while it helps me hit slightly below parallel while remaining tight, I was wondering if adding another .5\" to the heel ([using something like this](https://www.amazon.com/VersaLifts-Strength-Heel-Inserts-Small/dp/B08QJS6LB3/ref=asc_df_B08QJS6LB3/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=693666498182&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=11699610241078936116&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9003279&hvtargid=pla-1584199693869&psc=1&mcid=6146447e9ee5304a9d7ebc195868d248&gad_source=1)) would be too much, even though it would probably let me hit ATG comfortably.

However, every time I started with basic calisthenics exercises like wall pushups, i ended up with irritated ulnar nerve in my elbow. I also worked as a barista.. and we have to lift up jugs, pitchers, urns. And i hurt my elbow at work when lifting a bucket of ice.. and my wrist has been hurting as well. Sometimes it feels like my forearm and elbow is about to explode, like having shin splint. My question is\u2026 how can i improve with all this pain.

I started lifting weight mid last year and due to health issues had to stop in December. I finally got back into weight lifting back in April. I did the full body workout program from the wiki page for beginners. I been working out 4 days a week with that routine and been recovering very well. I am towards the end of my first week of doing a P/P/L split 6 days a week. For progression my idea was once I was able to hit the top end of a rep range for all sets I would up the weight 5 lbs for upper body and 10 lbs for lower body. I take a 3 minute rest between each set currently. Also I can\u2019t really do body weight movements such as pull-up/chin ups, push ups, or dips. I just do not have the upper body strength currently for these exercises. I cannot afford the gym, I do have a budget friendly home gym. I have a rack, barbell, adjustable bench, and adjustable dumbbells though they only currently go up to 50 lbs. The routine: Push A: barbell bench press 3x8-10, dumbbell shoulder press 3x10-12, and dumbbell skull crusher 3x12-15. Pull A: bent over row barbell 3x8-10, dumbbell row 3x10-12, dumbbell bicep curl 3x12-15. Legs A, barbell squat 4x8-10, RDL 4x10-12, single leg dumbbell calf raises 3x12-15. Push B: overhead press 3x8-10, incline dumbbell bench press 3x10-12, dumbbell tricep extensions 3x12-15. Pull A: barbell upright row 3x8-10, incline chest supported row 3x10-12, barbell bicep curl 3x12-15. Legs B sumo deadlift3x8-10, Bulgarian split squats 3x10-12, single leg calf raises 3x12-15.

That way the day 2 exercises won't always suffer from immediately following after day 1. \n\nAnother tweak could be to go a bit easier on Sat than Sun each week, regardless of whether you're doing day 1 or day 2 on Sat that week. I don't mean change weight and reps, but rather maybe leave a few reps in the tank each set on Sat and then only push sets all the way to failure on Sun.",

Remember that you've basically re-started your noob gains phase. The gains will come from even a very sub-optimal routine at first.

In comparison, picking something up off the ground is a very natural movement and people naturally brace for that. And bench press  is close enough to a pushup, that people often  can do it fairly well.",
            "In addition to what others have said here, \"beginner\" is a *suuuuuuper* vague term when it comes to lifting weights. There are basically 2 main factors to how advanced a lifter is: how much muscle you've built, how much you've refined your skill in the lift. The first is a super-slow process at best, the second is incredibly difficult to quantify.\n\nYou end up with some people saying \"beginner is your first few months where you're just learning how to do the lifts\", some people saying \"beginner is how long you can run a Linear Progression before hitting a wall\", some people saying \"it's [6, 9, 12, 18] months (some longer period than group 1 says)\", some say \"it's until you can lift [X]% of your body weight on [Y] lift\".\n\nIt's just a weird thing to try to draw boundaries around, so not really that useful to use as a metric for progress. It's good to have milestones to aim for, but ultimately if you're stronger than the person you were a couple weeks ago, you're doing awesome.\n\n(And yeah, some people are just good at squats.

Even DL was weird for me for a while, even though now it feels easier for me than squats at the same weight do.)",

Tried to do ass to grass and felt like my legs were dying. Got used to that too after a few sessions. Now it is still hard but otherwise feels fine to do, similar to bench press.\n\n=\n\nAs a sidenote I felt extra weird about it because I had been doing leg press for many months and felt squat should thereby be fine and yet it absolutely was not fine for me hahaha.",

That is to say, if you put on about 4lbs over 8 weeks, you may put on something like 3lbs of lean mass, and only 1lb of fat mass. \n\nA faster bulk's tradeoff is that you put on more overall lean mass, but you put on slightly more fat mass. That is to say, if you put on 8lbs over 8 weeks instead, you might put on something like 5lbs of lean mass, and 3lbs of fat mass.\n\nHere's the thing though.

I've had some injuries that still act up, it takes a lot of effort, and I seem to get really bad DOMS in my legs no matter what I do. I found it really hard to not skip leg days and it was messing with my overall momentum.

            "those calculators are not entirely accurate, but they do provide a good starting point.  if your brother consumes 2000 calories a day, he will lose weight.  watching the scale for a month will reveal how fast.  at that point you can add or drop calories based on your results and your goals, and of course how sustainable the nutrition plan is.  after all, no plan will work if he's unable to perform it.  motivation is fleeting especially when you combine hunger with historically disordered eating patterns.  500 cal deficit is very reasonable.  here was my exact nutrition from today, to give you an idea of the amount of food you can consume in a 2000 calorie budget provided you make good choices rather than the pizza:  \n  \nbreakfast -  \n1/3 cup oatmeal made with 1 1/4 cups almond milk  \n2 eggs / 6tbsp egg whites scramble using 1/4tbsp butter, an entire roma tomato diced, 1 cup of baby spinach, and 1/4 cup feta cheese  \n75g blueberries   \n  \nlunch -  \n5 oz salmon fillet  \n100g grilled asparagus  \n100g sweet potatoes  \n  \ndinner -  \n6oz grilled chicken breast  \n3/4 cup quinoa  \n3oz steamed carrots  \n150g steamed broccoli  \n  \nprotein shake -  \n1 1/4 cups almond milk  \n1 banana  \n140g strawberries  \n2 scoops of iso protein powder  \n3 tbsp peanut butter powder  \n  \n1832 kcal, 193g protein, 170g carb, 45g fat.  \n  \nthese are big plates, my maintenance is 2500 and im not feeling starved during cuts by any means.  good luck to you both",
            "I mean, I hit PRs all the time, in that I hit rep PRs. You don't necessarily need to train in the lower ranges. \n\nI find that I grow best with high rep sets for my lower body, which is why I tend to aim for sets of 15-20. I just aim for rep PRs. \n\nMy current workout has me working up to an easy top set of 2-4 reps, around 2-3 reps in reserve, then drop down and do a lot of rep work. I find it's very effective. \n\nBecause rep PRs are still PRs. If you can squat 315 for 20, your legs and back are absolutely going to be strong.",
            "Weird mindset to bring.\n\n> The only program I know I will do without losing motivation is the one I created myself.\n\nIt's worth noting that this is a science with decades, arguably centuries to millenia of research behind it and you're willfully ignoring it in favor of what \"feels good\" to you. Based on the questions you're asking, I'd wager you're overcomplicating things to the degree that your homebrew program will end up *harder* to maintain than a proven, simple-but-effective program.\n\n> perfect is the enemy of good\n\nSure, but I'm advocating for you adopting simple and good rather than complex and bad.\n\n> I'm looking to improve it, not change it.\n\nHow do you intend to improve a routine without changing it?",
            "Yes theoretically, but the only way to find out is try it and see what happens. After 3-4 weeks if you're losing weight too fast, increase your cals. If you're not losing weight fast enough, decrease your cals. Everything else is just an estimate, the real data is what you get from stepping on the scale.",
            "At some point this becomes a question for a medical professional since we're bordering on \"this lift is painful\". I don't want to give any specific advice, and I'd recommend taking any you receive with a grain of salt. General advice: add some regular stretches into your daily routine to work on shoulder mobility.\n\nAgain, *generally* if you are doing the proper movement, you're recruiting the rear delts and upper back muscles that a Rear Fly is supposed to. Sure, one can micro-optimize the movement and argue whether they way *you're* doing it is the most effective way, but it may not be the most impactful thing for you to worry about.\n\nBent Over Rows, even wide grip, aren't gonna hit quite the same muscles as a Rear Fly. Whether they overlap *enough*, depends on your goals.",

Another 450 from 6 eggs, plus 300 from 3 tbsp of butter brings us to 2,250. \n\n2,250 would already be close to maintenance for me so I'm assuming you're bigger or more active than I am. That said, unless every other calorie is the world's best fibre...how do you poop??",

            "i disagree, the rest times of most of those exercises are very low (1 minute rest), if i count up the time to do the upper body day of one of the things you linked it comes out to about 60 minutes, but thats not include going to the machine you want to use, reracking your weight, changing, putting your bag in the locker etc.. and since the rest times are very low id increase those too, so i'd come out to about 1.5 hours in the gym at the minimum.\n\nAnd I don't really get why you are giving me advice on a upper-lower split anyway when my current split is quite literally the opposite, PPL i would have gotten, but i don't really understand this advice since its basically wiping what i said in my question off the table.\n\nnot trying to be rude or anything but the advice seems a little silly considering my training style.",

Now we're working on meals for him as well.  Ty for the TDEE mention, that got me finding a calculator which is helping me make a few slight adjustments to my own nutrition plan.",

Gives the next day's workout a zing.)\n\nI never ran the actual total calories.  Just tried it as a experiment, weighed daily in the morning, and watched my \u2206 week to week.  I'm down 35 lbs this year.  (205 to 170 lbs.)",

            "It varies but my usual flow is:\n\nBreakfast \u2014 oatmeal with peanut butter and high protein, high fibre cereals mixed in; usually ~750 kcal altogether with ~35g protein and 50% of daily recommended fibre\n\nMidday \u2014 Protein shake with 5g creatine and fibre supplement; ~330 kcal and ~65g protein\n\nDinner \u2014 whatever I feel like as long as it's minimum 30g protein and max 750 kcal\n\nBefore bed \u2014 Protein shake with fibre supplement (same as midday just no creatine); ~330 kcal and ~65g protein\n\nThat all brings me to about 2,150 kcal total or about a deficit of of 350 from a rough TDEE of 2,500 with ~190 g of protein a day on about 180 lbs of body weight. I'm cutting right now, hence the super high protein. Also, as you can see, my body needs A LOT of fibre to keep things moving with that much protein. I'm probably hitting ~200% of the daily recommended amount. \n\nIf I was bulking or at maintenance, those protein shakes go down to 30-40 g each and dinner gets nice and satisfying at 1,250 - 1,500 kcal.",

            "I think Google is giving a figure for 30% fat ground beef, which I\u2019ve never seen for sale.",
            "No.\n\nIMO Do your chest flies in a bench so you can actually do full ROM, you will have stronger and more flexible shoulders and reverse flies will no longer be a problem.\n\nAlternatively, doorway stretch. But I like option 1 wayyyyyy more.",
            "I work out from home and have been considering adding a bench to my equipment. I don't want to overstretch my shoulders, so will probably have to get an assessment first. This'll give me something to think about, thanks!"

            "I'm waiting in line to refill my water bottle. In front of me is one of the strongest guys in the gym, easily deadlifting 3x his body weight and not breaking a sweat, that kind of level. He never really speaks to anyone and just keeps to himself.\u00a0\n\n\nAnyway, while I'm waiting for him to fill his bottle, a teenager walks diagonally toward us and just cuts in front of me! I take a lil step forward to say like ermm but I'm too shy to say anything... The strong guy, without missing a heartbeat, slowly turns to the teenager and looks at him for a looong half second and just asks \"Isn't she [me] already waiting?\" with the most deadest of glares I've ever seen.\u00a0\n\n\nThe teen mumbles something and takes a step back lol. Strong guy turns back to me very briefly and gives me the smallest of smiles. Of course I'm still embarrassingly too shy to say anything but I couldn't control my smile, and grinned like a golden retriever being given a treat \ud83d\ude48",
            "I went for a mid session wee break and a guy comes in after me, doesn\u2019t wash his hands. 5 minutes later I\u2019m in one of the two squat racks and he comes up to the one next to me and proceeds to set up his barbell curls. This guy is the complete package of grossness behaviour at the gym. I hate him. I hate him with all of my heart. That said I obviously just silently seethed rather than actually saying anything. My gym is so gross.",
            "I've always struggled to keep \"leg curls\" and \"leg extensions\" straight. Today I realized that leg curls are the one where you're curling your legs, and leg extensions are the one where you're extending them.\n\n(I swear I'm reasonably intelligent...)",

I know for a fact that no one cares. But knowing and feeling that never stops.\n\nI am squatting today and every rep I am doing, despite feeling so easy, I am telling myself - you are strong you are strong you are not fucking weak.\n\nNo sense to this story, just thoughts that I can't share with anyone else in my life.",
            "My gym currently has people living there.\n\n Not literally on the gym floor, but there\u2019s [currently over 50 of them](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crgg19dr4g2o) sleeping in a room off to the side. The leisure centre gets used for a lot of different things, but this is definitely on of the more unusual",
            "I seem to have this need to clean up the gym when I'm there, usually in the morning.\n\nAn older expat, I live in a country where almost all of the gyms are almost always a mess. I hate the mess, but I'm not compulsive, honestly. I like this gym, so I want it to be in order.\n\nI don't talk to people while I'm cleaning up the weights around them. I don't stare at them. I just clean up. \n\nWhat I've noticed is that it's just some people not putting their weights away. I don't understand their mentality (because I'm from a different culture). They just walk away from it. They don't incorporate clean up  as part of their routine.  They don't care whether everything is put away.\n\nThe gym itself has no notices or warnings. Some of the staff clean up in the morning. (It's a 24/7 gym.) Some of the weights are too heavy for them though. It's apparently the culture in this country just to leave everything a mess and let someone else clean it up.",

He would always wear a polo with jean shorts, long flowing half blond half gray hair. He would hang out on the machines, with no discernable program. But he would be constantly burping, loudly. I haven't seen him there in 6 weeks. Was wondering today what happened to him.",

            "Been hitting the weights 6x a week for two years straight at my current gym, smaller gym so I've made a few different friends that I see all the time and chat with. The people who I like to talk to the most are the old men that have been lifting for decades. This guy in my gym is 84, training since his teens, and is wildly jacked for his age. Was a powerlifter most of his life. \n\nI have learned so many good tips from him. He knows so many different lifts and has really helped me up my game, and I just love chatting with someone who honestly is just from a very different time and has wild stories from his youth. Even told me about having a jaguar cub in the 60s (before exotic pet laws) that he eventually gave to a zoo when it got bigger, said it so casually \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I highly recommend talking to the older folks in the gym who have been going at it for decades. Great tips and great stories await \ud83d\ude02",
            "So i was in a normal commercial gym pretty late last night. And there were three dudes chatted for like, 1 and half hours. They all wore headphones that they refused to take off, so they were screaming the whole way through. The gym was empty so their sound was echoing throughout the entire building. It was the most annoying experience i ever had holy fuck.",
            "I went on vacation with my family this week.\n\nFirst, I have to say that the hotel \"fitness centers\" are typically afterthoughts. To my surprise, this particular fitness center wasn't as bad as I had been expecting. It had a Smith Machine, free weights, and a variety of decent high quality machines, including an assisted dip and pull up machine. I was able to get a workout in, although not exactly the same as I would from my regular gym. I am happy that I got something in that sort of resembled my routine. \n\nThat said, my wife said.. \"We're on vacation, you're supposed to relax and not worry about working out!\". Unfortunately, we did so much walking on this trip, averaging almost 15K steps per day, that we were literally exercising every day regardless.\n\nSide note: I've only stayed in one hotel where the fitness center was as good as the gym I go to. If you are ever in Chicago, the Marriott Magnificent Mile is the place to stay if having a real fitness center is important.",
            "Scene: fairly early on a Saturday, not too busy at the big gym\nMe (little old white haired but fit lady): goes to a bench, prepares to use, notices phone sort of tucked underneath, looks around no one in sight.  Puts towel on bench, starts to get ez bar.\n\nBig black guy with hoody over eyes: comes over, says he\u2019s using that bench\n\nMe: you sure you\u2019re here?\n\nGuy: I\u2019m using this and that (gestures to machine halfway across the gym)\n\nMe: states (not asks), I\u2019m working in\n\nHim: silence for a bit, then sits for awhile and finally does a set\n\nMe: doing pistol squats a few feet away\n\nHim: gets up, goes to other machine\n\nMe: gets bar and does couple sets hip thrusts\n\nHim: Continue trading spots for a few sets, no words, picks up phone finishes \n\nMe: offer fist bump and smile\n\nHim: accept fist bump, not smile",
            "so I don't do it as consistently anymore, but when I first got back into the gym and my partner was informally coaching me, he pointed out this thing I do on machines where I always put the pin back in the top slot. I didn't even really notice myself doing it, but I thought about it for a second and said, \"well it's so the next person doesn't feel bad about having to lower the weight.\"\n\nI think there's also a bit of the \"tidying up\" component. it's like tying a bow on the exercise, the way it feels when you put your plates back. but I've definitely had moments where I've sat down to use a machine and felt slightly bad about having to move the pin to a lower weight. probably more when my gym anxiety was more severe. I think I've been doing this since I first started going to the gym back in high school.",
            "Only 4 people in the gym at midday today. 2 of them are a lady and her boyfriend. She\u2019s going around the gym doing a single set of several exercises while her boyfriend films each set.\n\nNot sure what the purpose was. Maybe she wants to check her form on each exercise?",

It holds a surprising amount of sway as to whether I'll put in an offer. \n\nBeen in a rut at my current gym the past few weeks. None of the workouts have me feeling quite as good as I expect them too afterwards. Change of scenery could be what I need.",
            "I went to another local gym today because my standard local gym is closed (yearly maintenance period, I hate that they do this, but love that they maintain their equipment), and some guy I see regularly at my standard gym was also at the other local gym. We still don't talk, but we chuckled when we saw each other today.",
            "Ever tripped on a treadmill? Yup, that's me. But the real gem? The guy who bench-pressed his phone. Biceps for days, brains, not so much. And don't get me started on the dude blasting 'Eye of the Tiger' like he's training for Rocky VII. Gym's a circus, man. But hey, amidst the chaos, I found a squad who push me harder than any trainer could. Grunting through squats, cheering over protein shakes, we're in this grind together.

            "Weighted cable crunches\u00a0are probably the best crunches but its important to remember that \"crunching\" is not the primary function of your core muscles. Their main purpose is to maintain spinal stability and rotation / anti rotation of the torso.\n\nThis is why people with big squats and deadlifts always have bulky cores cuz stabilizing that heavy as bar activates and trains a lot more muscle fibers in the core than a crunch.\n\n[Same thing with rotation.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHIEp_2D_Dg) If you leave it out of your core routine your just not working a huge chunk of the muscle fibers that make up your abs.[ If you look at pro kayakers for example a lot of them don't lift weights consistently but they all have super bulky core muscles ](https://www.indulgexpress.com/life-style/sports/2018/Jul/13/one-on-one-with-extreme-kayaker-and-red-bull-athlete-dane-jackson-8789.html). Its because of the sport is 1000s of reps torso rotation against resistance (the water in that case).\n\nPeople fixate on the rectus abdominis but the internal and external oblique as well as the transversus abdominis is really what makes up the \"bulk\" of your core (at least the front of it).",
            "If you've only been cutting for a month you probably can keep going a bit further if it's not too hard.  I think you will hit the point where it's better to bulk or maintain fairly soon. \n\nYou're about the same height at me but 10 lbs lighter and stronger, so good job \ud83d\udcaa",
            "If you\u2019re new to training for the first 6-12 months you\u2019ll likely put on muscle while losing fat. After a while that stops being possible as you lean out, and putting on muscle requires a bit of fat gain. Having said that, you should probably focus on at least 100-140g of protein daily, whole foods like veggies and leafy greens. \n\nIt isn\u2019t obsessive to calorie count and weigh yourself until you have an innate understanding of nutrition and your body. So for a little while just track what works and what doesn\u2019t. Don\u2019t forget weight can vary up to 5% in a day based on hydration, glycogen and recent workout. Day after a hypertrophy workout you\u2019ll weigh more from water retention in your muscles, that\u2019s good \ud83d\udc4d. \n\nFeel free to ask more questions. Don\u2019t forget to hit legs, it\u2019s critical for strength development and fat/weight loss.",
            "I can't really comment on mental health. What I will say is cutting is significantly harder than bulking.  As a newer lifter and newer to the fitness space, can you really trust yourself to maintain a high protein/low calorie diet for months? When I am in my cutting phase I meal prep and plan out everything. I eat the same 2 and a half meals every day with a protein shake at the same time every day. A light deficit means you count every single calorie every single food. You will not be allowed to deviate. So keep in mind what your headspace maybe if you yo-yo your weight. You see constant up and downs AND little to no progress in the gym. Or you can take an easier route, enjoy food. Still eat clean ofcourse but much more. See your strength and muscle grow which inevitably makes you look and feel better regardless. At the end of the day what separates body building from general fitness is diet. If your goal is purely aesthetics which it sounds like it is priority number 1 is going to the gym consistently. Priority number is locking down your diet.",

            "Hi,\n\n  \nSo recently I started training back which I've neglected my whole life gym life. Now I used to be able to do pullups, but only with a considerable sway and momentum and could not do any clean reps. Then I did assisted pullups to get form down and I started at like 33kg and then dropped it all the way down to 12kg (lowest possible) by last week => this process was about a month and a half. Now fast forward to today and I just did my first unassisted pullups without sway and I feel great. I did 4-3-3 so 10 in total, but I noticed I started to need some momentum/sway on the last reps of each one of those. So what do you guys think for the next stage of development? I don't really know if I should just try to match this, or go just do an additional set as I get stronger, or should I just go for max 1 set and try to hit like 7-8 in 1 month's time or should I go back to assisted pullups but with more reps (I was doing 5 reps for 4 sets last week for example). Thanks all.",

Was recently able to use the barbell for almost all relevant exercises but OHP (literal bane of my existence). To be honest though I\u2019m a little bored of it because I\u2019ve been running this since last September (fell off the wagon in March a little but restarted in May) and looking either for tips for motivation to continue a boring workout/ways to \u201cspice\u201d up the workout or get advice on switching to a different workout plan (primarily looking at [this](https://thefitness.wiki/reddit-archive/a-linear-progression-based-ppl-program-for-beginners/) one, is a PPL compared to the full body one I\u2019m doing right now).

My \u201caccessory lifts\u201d are pretty good in terms of weight. Probably because most require dumbbells.

I am currently running a PPL routine found here, although I feel as though I could be doing more work. https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/3-day-PPL-workout-for-beginners\n\nAny help is appreciated (and I have gone through the suggested routines on the wiki numerous times)",
            "So last summer i decided to go on a massive cut which saw me go from 84kg to 67kg (19M, 170cm). i was quite lean at the time and made minimal strength gains in the gym from around the time i stopped my weight loss to now. I\u2019ve decided for this summer im going to increase the weight of all my lifts. for the last 2 weeks i\u2019ve been monitoring my weight as well as how much my lifts went up by, here\u2019s a small sample of some of the exercises that I have increased the weight in:\n\n1. bench press: +5kg for 8-12 rep range sets. +10kg for 5-8 rep range sets\n2. lateral raise machine: +2.5kg for 8-12 rep range sets. +5kg for 3-5 rep range sets\n3. lat pull down (close grip): +10kg for 5-8 rep range sets. +0kg for 8-12 rep range sets (however made the movement more slower and controlled than before)\n4. RDL: +5kg for 8-12 rep range sets (can go higher but fear of injury holds me back xd)\n5. dumbbell bicep curl: +0kg for 8-12 rep range sets, +2.5kg for 3-5 rep range sets\n\nAs you can see, some of my lifts have increased in weight as i have been holding back from increasing the weight previously. After these 2 weeks, I feel slightly bigger however, my abs have become less visible (they weren\u2019t very visible to start with but you can slightly see my upper abs) and so have my veins. my calorie intake has gone up ever so slightly (200-300 calories) but i try to eat as much protein as i can while doing 30 mins of cardio 4 times a week. since the start of the summer i have went from 67kg to 65kg (this is when i started lifting heavier) and now back to 67kg.\n\nHow do i maintain my weight while getting leaner and building more muscle.

            "Hey everyone, total fitness noob, never been into it, no clue what I'm doing, just \"doing it\"\n\n\n\nStarted my fitness journey about a month ago, 32M , started at \\~220lbs and am now at 199.8lbs. My goal is to get around 185ish. Main goal was to get rid of the dad bod and I am seeing progress in the mirror, nothing crazy but I can see it now when I look at my starting pic.\n\n  \nQuestion I have is, this is my current routine for food and working out below. The thing is im not sure after a month ive made any real gains lifting wise, im still right about at the same weight levels I could do starting and cardio on the treadmill doesnt seem to be \\*much\\* easier either.\n\nFood:  \nI have been eating a calorie count of about 1500 for the day, sometimes doing OMAD. my day will usually go like this.\n\n  \nMorning: Nothing but water.\n\nLunch around 1:00pm-3:00pm, im at the office and work buys, one of my go to's has been a Panda Express bowl with  Super Greens & Kung Pao chicken.\n\nSome days will avoid lunch all together, just water for the day.\n\n  \nDinner: 7:00pm-9:00pm\n\nI have been \"meal prepping\"  and eating the same meal every single evening, unless a cheat thing on the weekend.\n\n- Chicken Breast, marinated in \"Japanese BBQ Sauce\"\n\n- Rice / Quinoa \n\n- Mixed Organic Veggies.\n\n  \nDuring the week I have completely cut out soda, I will allow myself 1 can or fountain drink per day on Sat / Sun.\n\nI have cut drinking alcohol down to one evening a week. Now drinking basically nothing but water.\n\n  \nWorkout:\n\nMon / Thursday : Bicep machine / Free form bicep machine, Tricep Machine. & 30 minutes of treadmill.\n\n Usually doing the following for example. 20 pumps at 30 lbs, 15 pumps at 45 lbs 10 pumps at 60lbs. then repeat in reverse order until I literally cannot even pump the 30lb anymore.\n\n  \nTuesday / Friday : Chest / Back machines & 30 min of treadmill.\n\n  \nWed: Just cardio - 30-45 min on treadmill.\n\nSat - Maybe cardio / Rest day.\n\nSun - Rest day.\n\nOn the treadmill I am usually doing 4mph at 4% incline for 30 minutes or so. This makes me ABSOLUTELY DRENCHED in sweat, Like I dont even see people running who get as soaked as I do, I have to bring two shirts every time I go because it gets so bad. Its embarrassing but it is what it is. Was hoping it would get better / easier with time but here I am still dripping in sweat.\n\nBut as I stated above, while I do \"feel\" better and I have lost weight, I havent really seen any gains in the amount of weight or the effort for cardio. Should I start increasing to 45min-1 hour on the treadmill?\n\n  \nRight now im feeling like 99% of the weight I have lost was thanks to the food changes and drinking changes but that the gym has helped very little. \n\nIt does make me feel amazing, especially hitting the sauna afterwards, I love it and am completely hooked, even addicted to going now, but was just wondering what should I change to get better results?\n\n  \nAppreciate any help / advice!",

            "I started my anchor cycle this week (classic 3/5/1+ and FSL), with +3 PR sets. I'm on a cut but my strength is real bad compared to october-november 2023 period. Back then I did almost double the reps I did this week for squats and DLs (BP is almost the same, 1-2 reps short). Is this normal? Maybe my form is better now or something? I doubt it. I might need to record my lifts just to check and post form checks.\n\n  \nAnother question I have is with regards to assistance, recovery and progress. I'm not really progressing on my assistance lifts, (esp. pull ups and weighted dips), and as I go into the week I'm just getting more and more tired and \"spent\". For example I did 11-13 pull up reps on monday and today I did less and in fact I did one set less because I just felt weak, 2 instead of usual 3. Am I not recovering properly and should I try doing less? Especially now during anchor PR week and a cut. I just feel like I'm spinning my wheels for quite some time now and not seeing a lot of progress other than becoming slightly leaner due to the cut and muscles are more prominent. \n\n\n\n*\\*\\*\\*Just some additional info about my assistance*\n\nFirstly, I tend to do ALL of my assistance sets to failure and beyond. Is this way too much? Also, I superset them, 1.+2. and 3. + 4. So pull ups + dips and cable row + split squats for example. And I tend to go for heavier weights, up to 10-12 reps.\n\n I do my main + SW lifts and then go for assistance lifts. After than I do 20 minutes of cardio (140-160 BPM), on Wednesday I do 30 min and on weekend I ride my bike. Generally, I have to rest for quite a while even during assistance. Takes more to finish assistance than main+SW.\n\n**Monday:** \n\n* 3 sets pull ups (9-13 reps, depends on the day)\n* 3 sets of weighted dips (10-12 reps)\n* 3 sets cable row (12-15 reps, I'm inconsistent with my form and strength so its hard to track)\n* 3 sets of leg extensions (15-17 reps, the only lift I notice improvements and a relatively new addition)\n\n**Tuesday:** (Easier day because its either BP or OHP. My back is usually rekt since monday so I started to either do only BB Rows or nothing for pull)\n\n* *(Optional)* 3 sets of BB rows (\\~10 reps)\n* 3 sets of Incline DB BP (9-12 reps, this one is real bad and heavy)\n* 3 sets of weighted leg raises (Abs) (\\~10 reps)\n* 3 sets of cable lat raises (\\~10-15 reps)\n* 3 sets of Pec Deck (9-12 reps)\n\n**Thursday -** Everything same as Monday except leg assistance\n\n* 3 sets of Split Squats (12-16 reps, this one just destroys me physically, I literally have to stop after one leg and wait a couple of minutes to be able to do the other leg)\n\n**Friday -** Same as Tuesday except DB OHP instead of DB BP and Triceps Pushdown instead of Pec Deck.",

You just won't get quite the results you would with better form.\n\nStrive for improvement, but it doesn't have to be perfect, and don't sweat the small stuff.  Having said that, with something like pushups, you could try elevated pushup progressions, either with a barbell in a rack, or if you're at home, the edge of the couch, or a chair, or even if you can start lower, like with a piece of 4x4 wood or something.  Off the edge of a chair, like 16\" off the ground, can you go all the way down?  Great, do that for a while, then find something lower, and see if you can go all the way.

Sooner or later a complete lack of focus on form will come back to bite you. \n\nRemember that progressive overload doesn't always have to mean more reps or more weight. Progressing to better and better form as your body gets stronger and more capable of each movement is absolutely a valid way to progress. With that in mind, I'd maybe aim at doing as many 'good' pushups as you can and then finish with the 'ugly' ones and then only progress past 10 once you can do all 10 with good form.",

Sure, maybe you'll progress a bit more at first, but eventually cumulative fatigue catches us all. Proactively giving your body a chance to catch up will hurt your gains a lot less than waiting until your body forces you to stop with an injury. \n\nOn top of that, some other key points:\n\n- It takes about two weeks for muscles to start to atrophy, so a one week deload won't cost you any of your existing muscle; \n- Muscles that you've built before are easier to rebuild than muscles you're building for the first time so, even if you do somehow lose muscle, it will come back quickly and easily; \n- It's possible you've been progressively cheating rather than progressively overloading. I use deload weeks to focus on the most perfect form I'm capable of. More than once I've discovered that my deload weight is enough to push me to failure with proper form and that I've been cheating to try to go heavier. \n\nBut yeah, as others have said, nobody can listen to your body but you. \n\nThe last thing I'll mention is age.

While it absolutely has a place in the extremely exclusive 'supplements actually backed by science' club, that same science has shown that the boost to gains is pretty short lived. \n\nIf someone who doesn't use caffeine ever starts taking it pre-workout, they will feel an energy boost and have more to put into each workout...for a while. Once your body gets used to it and builds up a tolerance, the gains pretty much go back to baseline. \n\nFor that reason, I think you're better off focusing on improving overall nutrition and rest to boost your energy levels rather than looking to a supplement. Whole grain carbs burn slower and more evenly with less of a spike and crash than simple processed carbs. Going to sleep at the same time every day can help your body use that rest time more effectively. For a quick energy spike in the gym if I'm flagging, I just eat a couple of regular old gummy candies about half way through the workout. \n\nPeople always want a magic bullet but the real answer is usually boring and requires effort. For example, testosterone is a big one right now. We know it helps gains and a lot of supplements are claiming to be able to boost it. While some of them may end being shown to have a small effect, the current indication is that none of them will boost your T levels nearly as much as just a good night's sleep.

            "What's wrong with it though?\n\nlp is very common and works very well, especially for young men which rippetoe is directing these two programs to. Being squat heavy is a great idea for beginners, it's a large, and very underused muscle. Beginners benefit a lot from doing it every session. It helps all lifts with the release of growth hormone, and it's probably the first muscles you will see progress in, which is super encouraging and motivating. Rippetoe also encourages you to stop following this simple program when it stops working, which he says should be fairly quickly, so why would it cause you to stall? It's the fastest way to progress as a beginner and then you switch once it's not making efficient gains any more.\n\nTexas method is a fairly natural modification to the progression; from every session to once a week. With 3 times a week training, that's one third the progression rate, so it's quite a bit slower. Also you only have one 5rm set per week so should allow for much better recovery as the weights have gotten decently heavy by now. these changes should allow you to progress quite a bit more, but he reiterates that this method won't last for that long either and should just be an introduction into better and more complicated programming.\n\nI didn't do SS but I did SL when I started, and I absolutely loved it. without it I would not have stuck with lifting.\n\nbut ye I'm not sure what about these would result in you stalling and quitting. If you followed it, you would've switched to a different program once you stalled.",
            "Bit of a blog post but I thought this might help somebody stalling.\n\nI sort of did a similar thing, going from SS 3x5 for 6 months then straight to a Texas Method template for my \"intermediate\" phase. I haven't really followed Rippetoe for maybe a decade so I'm not sure what he's saying now but there's a few trainers associated with SS that suggest a few changes when stalling (as opposed to adhering to a strict intermediate program).\n\nFirst change from 2.5kg/5lbs increments to 1kg/2lbs. That will be the first thing to prevent stalling. Also lighten your squats when doing deadlift sessions for obvious reasons.\n\nSecondly, the presses will stall first but they're not taxing the whole body like a squat or deadlift, so you might need to move them to an intermediate phase sooner than the squats (don't do what I did and change the whole program even though I had heaps of room to improve my squats with linear progression). So you'd still aim for 3x5 for the presses but if you fail a set, you'd still aim to get in 15 reps in whatever form that may be (triples, doubles, even 15 singles if you have to).\n\nIntitially I thought that if my overhead press stalled, it was because I didn't recover from such a relatively heavy weight. So I'd deload. Instead I should've been aiming for a volume target instead. This doesn't compromise recovery because the overhead press in particular doesn't have you lifting a lot of weight say compared to a squat..\n\nEventually, you'll move the presses to a Texas-lite program while keeping your squats on an intermediate program. Don't treat every lift the same.\n\ntldr Incorporate programming changes in small ways rather than following a template.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byPW7c6NPFM&t=2927s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byPW7c6NPFM&t=2927s) (hour long Youtube video explaining these concepts better than I ever could.",

After a few more sets it was fine so, being an idiot, I did the entire rest of my workout and went home. A few hours later my lower back started to spasm. And it won\u2019t stop.

I see him stand up, step up on to the seat , grab the handles and start doing  SHRUGS. Our gym has 2 specific machines for shrugs as well as cages, smith machines, squat racks , anything you could imagine to do shrugs with. \n\nI go over and ask the dude again how many sets left, to which he replies \u20186\u2019 , so I say to him \u201ccan I jump in with you, given I need to the shoulder press machine to do shoulder press\u201d to which he grunts , stands up and walks off, leaving 4 plates on each side and dried up mud on the seat from his shoes. \n\nProbably a story for Saturdays gym stories, but this dude really f\u2019ed me off and it warranted a rant.",

Think big dudes and boxing, they get worn out faster. \n\nIf you want to put on muscle, you are going to have to lift weights and lift heavy (relatively speaking.) Talk with your BJJ professor about a lifting program that is suitable for BJJ and for what you\u2019re trying to do. I can\u2019t imagine you want to get to like bodybuilding size, but probably put on some lean mass, so they should be able to put a program together for you.

The bulk of posing is trying to maximize muscle recruitment when flexing.\n\nThere's incredible value in being able to mentally hone in and maximally recruit the muscles that are intended to work the hardest in a given lift. You're not wrong that if you do a lat pull down, your lats will be recruited,  but bad form and the poor recruitment that accompanies it can and do lead many to do workouts that negatively impact potential strength gains.",

My favorite was the shockwave, as it turned my back into jello.\n\nI'm lucky that all my back injuries have been in the upper/middle back. Lower back injuries are the worst. I\u2019ve had them before, and the only thing that fixed them was yoga and stretching.",

It might go away after a short while or it might linger on for a long while. \n\nBut doing the exercises makes it manageable and the days I do them I feel much better than the days I do not.

I would make absolutely sure to push those sets to 0-1 RIR. You'll get more out of it that way.",
            "At 700 calories per day, you are only burning your muscles away. Get on a real deficit and eat at least 1500 kcal a day.",
            "I find it next to impossible to believe that it takes 700 calories to create a deficit for you. I would double and triple check the food that you're tracking. If most of your fat is stored in your stomach and you think it would only take 5 kilos to have visible abs the rest of your body has to be pretty lean. I find it more reasonable that you're lying either to me or yourself rather than you needing to eat only 700 calories a day to lose weight and having pretty lean rest your body but pretty fat stomach. Depending on how long you have been dieting it may be a good idea to take a break and sit at maintenence, like dont gain any weight but don't lose any either, and try another fat loss phase after. You could also go into a slight surplus and try to do a muscle gain phase, but this would add a little body fat.",
            "It's not just about your weight though. Last year I was 71kg and 19% body fat. Now I'm 70.7kg but 15% body fat and now my abs are starting to show. 700cal a day is way too little, you're losing muscles... I suggest trying to find out how much is your maintenance daily intake and go on a 500cal deficit, it's probably roughly around 1800 cal/day for you. Also maybe do one of these body scans to see where your body comp is at?",
            "700 calories a day is starvation mode my guy.",
            "The good news is: if you really are consistently doing ab exercises, you have abs whether you can see them or not. Being able to see them is purely an equation of bodyfat % being low enough, usually around 8-10% or lower. Just don't go lower than 8 because it's unhealthy and unnecessary; our body does need fat afterall. Hence the existence of fat soluble vitamins in nature - the freakin sunshine has a fat soluble vitamin(D) FFS, haha.",
            "literally make it part of the plan next time lmao. flexible eating attitudes seem to be predictive of success and \u201cmaintenance days\u201d have their time and place for gym performance and hunger. plus if im seeing someone id rather not subject them to hungry deficit day me where things might not be as ready to go down there as if i were a bit more fueled",

            "All right. But pretty much anything at all that you want to make any progress in is going to require some amount of trial and error, and two days is about the smallest amount of trial you could have done.",

            "I never said I needed to eat 700 to be in deficit, I just want to accelerate results, I'm assuming my maintenance is around 1500 from what I've seen. But yeah rest of my body is lean and I have some stomach fat. I'm not lying and why would I lie.",
            "I just want to know how low in kg I must get for that 8 to 10. I'm already pretty low to the point where I constantly think about food.",

But thought to go further to get that 10 lbs fat off. The problem is, the new programme is super challenging and I\u2019ve been trying to stay in a cut and that backfired \n\nThe weird thing is the calorie goal isn\u2019t bad, but I in think because I struggled to eat enough carbs so I was craving so much for carbs \n\nThe craving has since subsided, tbh I have no idea what happened. The only new novel things I\u2019ve introduced to my life just before of the cravings were pre workout and new programme exercises \n\nI actually work a full time job, part time masters, and training \ud83d\ude13 \n\nI\u2019ve refeed carbs in the past 2 days, that could be the reason why I no longer wanted them.

I think getting good balance of protein, fats, and carbs could help make you perform better in the gym and make you feel better. When you're ready to diet again just create a deficit of about 500 or so calories and continuosly track calories and weight and adjust as needed.",

Doing cardio can help create a bigger deficit while eating the same amount or can create the same deficit while eating larger amount of food.

When I plug my numbers in and set my activity multiplier to 1, I get 1,733 calories, and that is my BMR.  I know that's right because I get the same result when I do it long hand before activity multipliers are factored in. That being said, for some reason he uses a 1.15 multiplier as a baseline for a sedentary person before any exercise is factored in, but every other resource out there uses a 1.2 multiplier. For me that's an 86 calorie per day difference, and that may seem insignificant, but it's really not for someone doing a lean bulk like I am, where the total caloric surplus per day over maintenance is only 200 calories. Logically you would think to use 1.2 to match the general consensus, but I also know Mike knows his shit, and his calculator is usually a lot more accurate that others, so.....\n\nThoughts?",

            "I was overweight at like 220 when I was 18 ; I'm 173 cm/  5'8 ish, male. I got down to about 160 doing just cardio only but I was scrawny. I gained back some weight because I weight because I developed an ED so the way I lost weight was unsustainable.\n\nThen I ended up at 180-ish, skinny fat and did 531 for beginners on and off for a year when I turned 19 . I floated down to 160 because I was still overweight at this point, but I was eating around maintenance still and focused on eating clean and took a break from calorie counting.\n\nI started off super weak - it was strange how weak I was for my weight I suppose I had a lot of muscle atrophy when I first lost weight and then when I gained it back, it was all fat. When I started it was like ( this is after a month or two in gym from where I picked up 531B, prior I did machine exercises but changed my ways)   :\n\nBench 3 x bar\n\nOverhead press - I couldn't even do the bar until 1 month of training so I think I started at like 5 x 20\n\nSquat - 100 x 1 (can't remember)\n\nDeadlift - not even a plate, took me a few months to get comfortable with form as well.\n\nI had a lot of disruptions to my first year of training because I moved, among other things. Eventually I settled down and continued 531 for beginners consistently, started running and playing sports more.  I started college so my nutrition wasn't super dialed in with dining hall food but I just tried to eat clean and lift. During that second year of gym, my weight fluctuated a bit and I never really committed to bulking or cutting. My maxes now look more like (some I tested, some I extrapolated from regular AMRAP sets)\n\nBench 3 x 135\n\nOHP 85 x 5\n\nSquat 185 x 5 (did 225x1 a while ago)\n\nDL 225 x 5\n\nThat's after a year and a half of training - which is... pretty terrible. I can't really go back in the past to fix anything but I'm committing to a cut currently to get down to 150 from 170 that I started this year at, and then do a proper bulk now that I track my food. Plan to switch to 531BBB when I start bulking as well.\n\nI only stalled progression on 531 mostly due to lengthy breaks (during the first year of gym), or random hiccups once or twice (OHP is stubborn to grow)  but otherwise it's been progressing smoothly. The problem is - I'm still weak but the progression on the training plan doesn't seem that off so I don't know what I'm doing wrong - was my starting point just awful?",

            ">lack of sleep, lack of food and lack of effort.\n\nI would put volume on this list. Volume is critically important.\n\nI think the topic of failure is a bit more nuanced. It depends on the person and the exercise. There are certain exercises where I don't want to go to failure (squat, deadlift, Bulgarians) and others where I go to failure basically every set multiple times per week, often going past failure using forced or partial reps (cable rows, every tricep exercise, many bicep exercises. I know from experience where I can push all out and where that is a risky proposition.\n\nThe research at this point indicates that going to failure does not cause significantly more growth. The research shows volume and frequency are much more correlated with growth. So focussing on going to failure is probably misguided. I think your sets should be hard, but a set of 10.squats with a legitimate 1-2 reps in the tank is still really hard.\n\n>Is it possible to not give enough effort on the first few reps, indirectly sabotaging the later ones and thus failing in a \"non-productive\" but real manner?\n\nI honestly have no idea what this means. If you are using good and consistent technique, you only put in as much effort as is required to lift the weight each rep. The effort increases through a set. But it is normal for the first few reps to be easier.\n\n>How can someone judge whether or not he trained hard enough, or perhaps even too hard (if that is something that even happens)?\n\nA reasonable gauge is your rep speed slows down despite your best effort to maintain the same speed. So if you start the set by doing reasonably fast concentric portion, eventually you hit a point where you cannot maintain that same speed even though you are trying as hard as possible to do so. To me this is a good guide that that set was a hard set. For some exercises where I know I can do more without risk I go past that and push to where I only complete the most lengthened part of the motion.\n\nYou know you are going to hard if you are accumulating a lot of fatigue and feeling like you need really frequent deloads.",

If someone actually does know what a true all-out effort is then RPE 8-9 is probably more than enough if there's enough sets and they're not too infrequent (and it's still possible to go to RPE 10 and not do enough work to get much in the way of results)",

When you start exercising at a moderate to high effort your heart rate increases (duh) in the first 10 minutes a lot and then slows down a lot (the rate of change is slow) for 20-40 minutes but then usually it starts to increase more rapidly. This last part is called heart drift. The intensity remains the same but your heart rate increases with sustained exercise. This is partially due to attempting to regulate the temperature increases. Are you drinking water during your jog? staying hydrated can partially help. Your muscles may be getting fatigued, so need more resources. It can be due to the volume of blood being reduced with each beat. I'm not entirely sure the mechanisms and reasoning behind the last one. but ye it's a normal thing, but never hurts to express any worries to a doctor.

At my last comp I ended up with 17 reps on the axle deadlift, and after the first 7-8 I had to re-brace every single rep lol.\n\nOne of the key steps missing when you brace in the hole is that you can't set your pelvis (by squeezing your glutes) or \"pull down\" your sternum.

See how your weight responds to that amount. If it goes down, then its good. If it stays the same or goes up then reduce calorie intake and repeat the process. Do this until you are losing weight at your desired rate. At no point do you ever need to know how many calories you burn during exercise.",
            "Yeah that's gonna be the main one. Starting too light gives you room to focus on form and on keeping that good form as the weight gets heavier and to know when your form breaks down slightly. Its good to form the habit early and strong. As opposed to if you start with an already heavy weight so you are more pressured to just lift it even if it means having a bad form. This is a terrible habit and dangerous too. Having bad form is likely to lead to injuries and hinder progress.\n\nStarting light allows your body to gradually adapt and strengthen, if you start too heavy it takes weeks to fully recover, but you keep hammering your muscles the whole time so they never really recover well. It's also super important to give time to smaller muscles like tertiary and secondary muscles. They don't have much recruitment so it's important to start light, if the weight is too heavy for them you are likely to utilize bad form to overcome it. Similarly for joints and cns and cvs. Starting slow just makes sure that nothing is neglected\n\nBetter for mentality and habit and conditioning and consistency and confidence and all that.  \nit's great for learning to push through challenging weights (\"it's only a tiny bit heavier than last time so I can do it!\")  \nallows to focus, mindmuscle connection, cues, identify and work on issues  \nlearn to breath  \nlearn to brace  \nAllows you to get a really good and deep ROM  \nbetter flexibility coordination balance  \nmuscle memory/grease the groove\n\netc etc yada yada\n\nbut ye I strongly suggest restarting at 50% or less of your current 5rm for all your lifts. You can increase by 2.5kg every session to start off with, and then maybe slow the progression down. Also make sure your diet is good, plenty of protein, slight surplus. and your sleep is good. and again gonna suggest a program. Your program is fairly similar to stronglifts already so might be good to do that. It has a fantastic app that tells you what to do, and lots of good information on the website. run that for 2-3 months and then move onto 5/3/1 for beginners or whatever other one you like.\n\nDon't feel too bad about lowering the weight, I know it sucks, but like you've spent 6 months trying to go from 60 -> 62.5, If you start at 30 and increase 2.5 each session, you'll be back at 60 in 7 weeks (though you should switch to increasing once a week or less once you get to about 50)",

I do deadlift and squats right after the other. I dont wanna be hogging a squat wrack. The issue w pull ups though is that there isnt a dedicated pull up section.

            "Thank you for the time and effort to write this. Before creating my program, I actually looked into different strength training programs such as stronglifts, greyskull, candito, starting strength, alpha destiny's novice program etc. The reason I didn't choose stronglifts is because it lacked a vertical pulling movement, but I think it's part of the accessory not the main lift and I also didn't like the deadlift and squat at the same day.\n\nI started working out on March but doing a PPL-UL for 3 months and they said that full body programs are better and I should focus on getting strong first so I tried creating my own. I might switch to stronglifts as you suggested, I might get better results than the one I made.\n\nYes I really am not comfortable lowering the weight, it feels like I'm going to regress, I'm currently bulking and I don't wanna waste the calories that I shouldve spent for gaining muscle. But maybe I can increase the reps and just focus on technique.",
            "right on.  well here is my anecdote, just my personal experience so yours may differ.  activity wise i work in an ER, fast paced 12hr shifts on my feet, i rock climb 2-3x a week, lift weights 6 days a week, run 30 miles a week, and thats my baseline.  generally i find myself spending at least 1 leisure afternoon hiking or equivalent.  as far as TDEE calculators go, my actual nutritional needs align the closest with my revised harris-benedict result of \"lightly active\" on [this](https://fastfoodmacros.com/total-daily-energy-expenditure.asp) calculator.  with my height, weight, age, and \"lightly active\" selected, it puts my revised harris-benedict TDEE at about 2500, which is aligned with my lived experience cutting and bulking at this activity level with conscious nutrition and watching my scale.  2k per day slowly shreds me down, 3k per day slowly bulks me up.",

            "no, walking for 1 hour would generally not be considered intense exercise.  what everyone is telling you is that it's irrelevant to your stated goal though.  the bottom line is that if your goal is to lose weight, the answer is in your nutrition strategy.  there is no scenario where the intensity of your exercise brings you closer to that goal in a meaningful way.",

Telling someone that does SBD to \u201cjust go to failure\u201d is long term bad advice. The fatigue build up with that does make a significant difference that you don\u2019t understand. Sure take curls to failure every time, lateral raises, etc. but when you get strong enough taking big lifts to failure every time doesn\u2019t make sense for 99% of people.",

            "Hi All,\n\nSo I've been following a weight-training program, specifically Bigger Leaner Stronger by Mike Matthews. I started about a year ago at 154lbs, 25% body fat.\n\nOver a period of about 11 months, I slowly decreased my caloric intake (while carefully monitoring my macros). I also followed the 5-day strength training program religiously, and never missed a day.\n\nI went down to about 121 lbs, and 10% body fat. But, rather unbelievably, I was MUCH stronger at that weight than I was when I started (even though I worked out pretty much every day, just not with nearly the same level of rigor and discipline). At 121 lbs I was deadlifting more than 2x my weight, which to me is stunning considering my body was essentially running on fumes (1100-1200 calories a day). That and I'm in early middle age.\n\nThe next phase is called \"lean gain\" where you slowly build muscle weight and intake a slight caloric overage (about 10%).\n\nThe slight part is just not happening. I should be taking in around 2100 calories, but since I stopped cutting weight my appetite has been virtually insatiable, no matter what I eat. For example, if I eat a protein-laden meal, I may be full for a little while but in an hour or two I'll be just as hungry as I was before the last meal (as in super hungry, like stomach groaning hungry... the same thing has also been happening late at night close to or at bed time). As a result I'm taking in way more than 2100 calories, and probably gaining weight faster than I should (with a sub-optimal fat/muscle gain ratio to boot).\n\nIs this normal? This is the first time I've done a weight cut like this. I'm wondering if my body is in some kind of feast or famine mode.\n\nBy the way, this is a cyclical program\u2013you do cut/lean-gain cycles until you're happy with your results, then you switch to maintenance mode. I'm in my first lean gain phase, but at this rate it will be done in a few weeks as opposed to a few months. I should also add that my strength gains since I started eating again are stunning, at least to me. Today I deadlifted 1 more rep with each set with ease, yesterday I did the same thing on the bench press. Just amazing, at least to me.\n\nThanks!",
            "Just started strength training - noticed that whenever i do back workouts with the cable machine, i always feel it in my triceps but never have felt my lats get sore. Am i doing something wrong?",
            "Alright so this has been on my mind for a while and I figured I'd come here to open up a discussion on it.  \nIn the 'civilian world' we're constantly told not to overtrain, not to workout on tired muscles, rest a lot etc. However in the 'military world' I've been on many 'arduous' courses which involve repeated and relentless exercise on heavily fatigued muscles.\n\nIn my experience, the fitness gains over the period of a \\~4 week course of almost non-stop heavy exercise are tremendous, albeit a very uncomfortable experience. This kind of thing is commonplace in the military - 'muscle fatigue be damned, you're running today and that's that'.\n\nHowever, when I speak to people in the civilian fitness world about these kind of relentless, uncomfortable and draining weeks of exercise, they often exclaim that \"It's not good for you\" or \"You'll just get injured\", or \"Without rest you won't develop\". Now, I'm not necessarily denying their knowledge, they usually know far more than me, but it contradicts my experience.\n\nAnd so I'm confused basically. I'm now a reservist and trying to get myself as fit as possible. In my head I want to smash my body every day for the next week regardless of how tired my legs are, because that's how I and the fittest blokes I know got fit. However, I also have the luxury of being able to take rest days if I want to... and I basically don't know which side of the 'smash body/rest often' debate to side with.\n\nWhat are peoples thoughts and experience? Providing no injury occurs, what are the benefits/pitfalls of working out on tired muscles? Does working out on a tired muscle increase the growth signal?",

            "Hi all! I'm looking to (re)start my fitness journey after an extended break (\\~2 years or so?), and was wondering if this fitness video: [https://youtu.be/88rxP93ynsI?si=J5CE-XvzvxEgXGdY](https://youtu.be/88rxP93ynsI?si=J5CE-XvzvxEgXGdY) would be suitable for a beginning routine (all of the exercises are written in the description, btw). I tried a different beginner routine by Casey Johnston but it felt too easy so I'm looking to switch things up. For reference, I'm simultaneously eating \\~15% more calories to build muscle (female, 5'4\", 97 lbs) but am worried about excessive fat gain due to overly lax strength training routines; if one of you could lmk if this video would be sufficient to prevent fat gain on a bulk while building muscle that would be awesome. Not sure if that's a reasonable question at all, but honestly any advice is appreciated. Thanks!",
            "When calculating caloric intake for lean bulking, most calculators give you an estimate based on how much exercise you are doing. Example:  Someone that exercises 7-9 hours a week needs more calories to build muscle than someone who exercises 1-3 hours per week.  My question:\n\nDo you count rest times between your sets as exercise when calculating your macros, since a majority of the time you're resting, your heartrate is still elevated from the set's exertion and you are burning more calories as your body recovers from each set?\n\nI have to imagine you would. Otherwise, your typical 5x5 workout for 3 days per week would be 45 mins rest and only about 15 mins of actual work each workout, which would be 45 mins of active exercise per week. That would translate to about 190 calories burned per week, divided by 7, which is about 27 extra calories per day for you to stay at maintenance versus someone that doesn't even exercise. \n\nI'd find it hard to believe if the recommendation were; \"for a lean bulk, eat 227 more calories per day than someone that doesn't exercise at all.\" The recommendation is 200-400 calories over maintenance, but there is no way your maintenance as a weightlifter versus someone that doesn't exercise is only 27 calories per day, but that's what it would be if we look at it in complete black and white of actively exercising (during a set) versus not exercising (rest between sets). \n\nI guess to fully answer this question, we would need to know if the body burns calories during the ATP recovery process.  If it does, and you are 90% recovered after 3 mins of rest between sets, you could deduce that the large majority of your rest period should also could as exercise when trying to determine your true maintenance calories.\n\nI realize most of you will tell me I am overthinking this, and if that's you, then you must have good genes, because I have tried both bulking (3,000 cals per day) and lean bulking (200 cals over maintenance per day), and all I got was fat both times and had to spent months cutting back down to sub 20%. So no, it's not overthinking for everyone.",

Single leg RDLs, lightly loaded\n2. ATG split squats, bodyweight\n3. Calf raises and tib raises\n4. Good mornings with just the bar\n5. Cossack squats\n5. Back squat with just the bar (everything up to here is 8 reps each)\n6. Back squat with 60kg x 5\n7. Back squat with 90kg x 5 and my quads are suddenly sore as if I ran a 5k without warmup. This is barely 70% of my target weight for 5x5. I can still rep the weight but my quads are just complaining the whole way. I then tried foam rolling and massaging the quads but they're still not cooperating. Eventually I give up on the workout and move to a push session with OHP. Still feeling slightly offbeat but I'm able to move my usual weight without the cramped feeling.\n\nReally frustrating and it's happened a few times now. Always with squats, never with my push/pull days. And the soreness persists for hours despite the relatively trivial volume moved.",

And once I achieve 12 reps on the last set, I can use the heavier weight for all sets?\n\nI just feel like I spend multiple sessions trying to get that last set up to 12 reps but the earlier sets feel too easy",

My quads and glutes are pretty strong from that, as a lot of rock climbing is glorified pistol squats. \n\nTo even things out and get some strength for heel hooks, I've started doing some low weight RDLs, like bar only most times.

            "I just injured my right/arm (not while lifting), making it fairly useless. Seeing a doc on Thurs. The actual question:\n\nI've been lifting for a year now and like my progress. I'm too heavy, so I starting lifting for a few months, started targeted keto, and a few months in started dieting with the intent to recomp. It was working! I'm down 20lbs and my lifts are still slowly going up. Very pleased with how it was going.  \nNow this injury happened. My hand/arm took most of the force from a fall. I think regardless of if the final result is something fractured or just a bad sprain, I'm not going to be able to do any exercise with that arm for a while.\n\nThis massively bums me out. But now i'm not sure what path to take:  \n1. Say to hell with it and diet hard, knowing I will lose muscle but concentrate on getting the scale down and worry about rebuilding strength later; still going high protein  \n2. Forget the diet and increase intake with the intent of trying not to lose too much from inactivity, worry about diet later, since i will gain some fat back most likely (I'm not sure if this will even preserve any more muscle from inactivity)\n\nTLDR: I was in the middle of a long slow recomp that was working. Injured my arm which will prevent lifting for a while. Do I double down on diet, knowing I will lose strength anyway, or do I scrap the diet to attempt to minimize inactivity loss (if that even works)?",

Adherence can be nearly guaranteed in a military setting because, like, orders. \n\n* There IS a solid element of truth here though - fitness advice, especially that coming from or geared towards gen pop, does contain some hyper-conservative, discomfort-avoiding, bullshit. Most people that **actually** care about results, rather than achieving extremely mediocre results with a bare minimum of effort, will gladly state that achieving anything meaningful is going to require training well into the point where your point-in-time fitness is degraded and you are in at least moderate discomfort before taking your foot off the gas.",
            "> the fitness gains over the period of a ~4 week course of almost non-stop heavy exercise are tremendous, albeit a very uncomfortable experience\n\nDo you think you\u2019d be able to sustain that blistering pace for 12 weeks? Duration is the difference, you might be able to put in the effort but at some point performance will degrade without rest.\n\n> they usually know far more than me, but it contradicts my experience\n\nYeah I\u2019d say you both have blind spots.

Let\u2019s say you\u2019re squatting 3 plates 10x10; you\u2019ll be getting way better training than squatting 2 plates 10x10, especially if you\u2019re adding intensity over time. However, if you keep pushing too hard without recovery, your performance will degrade, you won\u2019t be able to squat 3 plates 10x10, and your training will be less effective. Rest is needed here.",
            "Sounds like there would be different goals and time frames. Makes sense that a 4 week training course would run on a different axis then a civilian training program meant to last years/decades/ a lifetime. Assuming most people in the general population are working out for general health and fitness goals their workout plan needs to be sustainable across long periods of time. Similar situation for bodybuilders and powerlifters where their training stretches across multiple years. Also a 4 week military training program that runs your body into the ground is probably aiming for conditioning (physical and mental) and a weight training program that has ample room for recovery would likely prioritize muscle growth.",
            "Short answer: people are full of crap. \n\nFor all the fear of overtraining, we sure do have a lot of people filling up every gym barely training at all. When I look around, I don't see lots of people on the verge of overworking themselves and orthopedic disaster. I see a bunch of people barely applying any physical stress at all. So overtraining is a real thing but frankly, most people are so far from it that their real issue is undertraining. \n\nInjury is probably the single most overblown concern of them all. For one thing injury rarely sneaks up on you: it has huge warning signs that develop over weeks in most cases. For another, lifting is incredibly safe compared to any sport/physical activity. It's odd that people are so preoccupied with injury when squatting a barbell but don't even blink when linebackers run into each other at full pace. \n\nIf you are properly applying effort, then there is a good conversation to be had about optimising your rest and recovery. You want to be able to get the most out of every workout if your goal is hypertrophy. You don't want your bench to suffer because you programmed it too closely to your overhead press work when you could have just have easily organised your schedule to do something else. You don't want to get unnecessarily hurt and set back your progress by weeks or months. That's all true, but people are still largely overselling it. \n\nThere's another component to this: being in the military in any kind of soldier capacity requires some mental toughness that you don't get from your 5 sets of 5 resistance program. I suspect that a large part of military fitness is about learning to push yourself beyond your current limits and being ok with that mentally. You don't get to put down the body you're dragging because you've hit your technical point of failure, etc.\n\nFinally, timeframe. You can go as hard as you want for 4 weeks, that's fine. You'll get very fit. Not sure if this is something you could keep up for years though. \n\nTo give a practical answer to your problem, why not do both? Go more or less as hard as you can on the days you train a specific muscle. Rest while you train other things. Whether this works for you or not will show itself in terms of how you're recovering. Figure out your own capacity for recovery. Fatigue accumulates over weeks, so you'll eventually know if you're getting stronger or simply more tired.",
            "firstly 4 weeks isn't that long a time\n\nsecondly the goals are vastly different, the military focuses on endurance, mental resilience and teamwork far more than anything else. Causing stress is an AIM of boot camp. Most people couldn't care less about endurance, focusing on strength and mainly hypertrophy. The military also highly values quick results, they need the soldiers as fit as possible within a short time. Whereas civilians aim to do this for the rest of their lives. You are expendable in the military, if you get injured, you can get replaced easily, and a lot of injuries do occur, 28% according to a pentagon study from 2004-2010 (which prompted some changes). Even boot camp style fitness classes have a high incident rate. A lot of people who lifted before boot camp have said how much their lifts and muscle mass dropped.\n\nTo answer how you should train. You have to ask what are you training for? If it's to run for days with 2 hours of sleep a day, dodging gun fire and shrapnel and starving and dehydrated, dragging another person, with a bullet in your arm. then does that sound more like boot camp or a day at the gym?",

The body adapts very well to exercise, but it takes a while.\n\n'Intense workouts' are great, but as someone who isn't conditioned to them it might be wiser to limit them to once a week, twice at max. Give yourself some slower, lower intensity workouts to pad the rest of the week. Things like walk/jog workouts at a conversational pace, a decent hike, or a steady cycle/row on a machine at the gym. Intensity every day isn't the best use of your time as it's only training one energy system; it also sounds like you might not be recovering enough, which as someone who isn't already physically robust, may cause injury.\n\nThe food you're eating before your workout isn't being utilized much as the high workout intensity is using your 'Anerobic Lactic' energy system, which uses energy far faster than it can absorb it from your food. It's important to eat before these workouts, but you need to give your body enough time to process the food.\n\nA fantastic exercise for someone in your situation is a nice long and hilly hike. Walking up the hills can get quite intense, but providing you aren't walking over mountains, should be over fairly soon and then your body has a nice cooldown as you walk on the flats and downhills. It uses a nice balance of all your body's energy systems and you can keep it going for much longer, thus burning more calories. It's also chuffing nice to be out in nature.\n\nThe same can be said for run/jogs. You'll be able to workout for much longer, and use a better balance of energy systems.\n\nFinally, it would be remiss of me not to end with the age old advice of \"You can't outrun a bad diet\"; It's really true.

And ultimately, lifting burns very little calories in the grand scheme of things AND trying to track calories burned is a fools errand. The best course of action is to track your calories/weight and find what is roughly your maintenance calories. Then add 250 calories to that for a lean bulk (of about .5lbs gained per week). \n\nThe biggest factors to your calorie burn are going to come from how active you are in your day to day life (NEAT activities). So how much you walk around during the day, how much you fidget, etc. Then if you do a lot of cardio, that's gonna burn a chunk as well. Then it will be lifting on top of that. So unless you're quite active in the first 2, start with sedentary or lightly active on a TDEE calculator. \n\nNow do you need 3000 calories a day? That's hard to say with what you've given us. That could very easily be WAY too many calories for you, or it could be fine. When i'm FULLY active (lots of walking and biking, lifting 4x a week) I'm lean bulking at around 3000 calories a day. But I'm also aiming to be insanely active with the intent on burning fuck tons of calories because I like food. If you maintain weight only at 2000 calories a day, then 3000 calories a day will absolutely just get you fat. You'd wanna be eating around 2250 calories a day instead. \n\nNow if you're gaining weight and you're literally just getting fat.... how fast is your weight gain?

It still makes tracking harder than just counting full rom reps, so my practical suggestion would be: just train full ROM, count your full rom reps for progression, and feel free to try out doing partial reps at then end of the set when you can't complete a full rep anymore if it does not negatively affect your next sets.",

            "How do you intend to hold the weights?\n\nI can back squat with a barbell much more than I can goblet squat. The heaviest I've done in a goblet squat is a 90lb kettlebell. Whereas I've done a 175lb back squat (i'm a woman, for context). For the goblet squat, it's ability to hold the kettlebell while keeping my balance that becomes the struggle, not the weight.  \n\nIf I was to have 2 kettlebells/dumbbells, I'm not sure where I would hold them really to squat. Down by my sides would get in the way of my squat stance. For kettlebells, I could do a double rack position BUT my ability to hold/balance them would have me holding about as much as a single bell in goblet position. \n\nNow I could deadlift a lot more weight than this though. My legs are closer together and I could have a dumbbell/kettlebell on either side of me and I could deadlift it up. But this is a different movement than a squat.",

I don't really have a stake in this but I trust the Stronger by Science guys and in [their review of the evidence on p-ratios they say](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/p-ratios/):\n\n>In summary, there are several good reasons why a lifter would implement fat loss phases in various stages of their lifting career. However, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that losing fat will potentiate hypertrophy or improve one\u2019s p-ratio after a lower body-fat level is achieved. A brand new lifter should not feel obligated to begin their lifting career by cutting to a magical body-fat range in order to gain muscle, and lifters should not worry that they\u2019ll struggle to gain muscle if they cross an arbitrary body-fat threshold.

I stop progressive overloading approximately when I start to lose form on the last set. I see that as a sign that I'm nearing my limit and need to slow down. With your 3x12 example, that would be a sign to me that I'm at my limit and if you're starting there then that means you're lifting too much weight. Because I'm adding tonnage slowly, the point where I'm struggling to get through a set is the point where I'm no longer improving at the rate I expect.

I like the sleek look, similar to an Apple Watch. Google's new line look similar but are way, way overpriced and seem to only hold one-day's charge. Garmin and other companies have similar products but they're big and bulky compared to the sleek, thin look of the Versa 4 / Sense 2 / Apple Watch. I want something I can wear 24/7 regardless of occasion and not need a charge every day.\n\nFitbit has an exceptional app -- tracking everything including food, exercise, water, sleep, etc. You can't find this anywhere else in a single app as far as I'm aware. They're just in a downward spiral ever since Google bought them out. I want a product I can continue to track food and water intake with, at the reasonable price that the Versa 4 / Sense 2 are at, and something that isn't big and bulky. I run, I do weights, and I play sports and swim, so a \"running\" watch alone won't meet my requirements. \n\nWhat is the advice of the Fitbit community? Is it worth it for the Versa 4 at the risk of discontinued Fitbit support in 2025 and given the clear downgrade from the Versa 3? How many people actually take issue with not controlling their Spotify from their wrist or not being able to load 3rd party apps to the device? Will any of it matter if I'm coming from a Charge 4 and Whoop where none of that was an option to begin with? \n\nPS I am an iPhone user",

So by doing leg press instead you take out the secondary muscles of the squat allowing them to recover more and not hinder your quad/ham/glute work.\n\nOn similar lines, though I can't think of an example of the top of my head, would be to train a different set of secondary or tertiary muscles for a more robust/full/complete training. ie exercise 1 uses muscles A and B and exercise 2 uses A and C. This way you are still focusing on A but you also get some work done on C. I guess wide/normal and narrow bench press would be an example.

            "it's okay to replace squats with other movements if they really suck. you can always pick them back up in the future.\n\nstill it's satisfying to be able to do them. it gives you confidence. I think of all movements, squats tend to be the most affected by differences in anatomy and leverages. for some people it's the most natural thing in the world but for others it's always going to be a little awkward. I'm in the latter camp (short torso + long legs), but I can say it's gotten significantly easier after working on it for a while, building strength in the relevant muscle groups and playing around with my stance. this was an issue for _years_ so it's a huge win to finally be able to squat and have it not be miserably awkward.\n\nfor your hips, [this video](https://youtu.be/ubdIGnX2Hfs?si=kpPgxJksF5GUBsyq) and [this related video](https://youtu.be/7FF6VLej_bY?si=86hIS-w4fiqEfChk) talk about how to accommodate differences in hip anatomy. personally, I was using a really wide stance and a wide knee ankle because of my limited ankle mobility and to make space for my belly, back when I was heavier. I was still doing it even with squat shoes, but it turns out my hips much prefer a more narrow stance with my feet pointed only slightly outward. only now for the first time do I feel like I'm actually using my glutes and quads on the way back up, I have so much more power.\n\nbut yeah you don't need to do all this work right now. that's what I ended up doing, I took squats completely off the table and just did leg press for a while until I got fed up with having a gap in my training and added them back in. l did notice a difference just from doing leg press, I think because quad weakness was part of the issue on squats. (glute weakness too, so hip thrusts helped. I really wasn't built for squats lol.)\n\ngoblet squats are another alternative that are a bit easier if you don't have optimal squat leverages, because you're more upright than on a back squat.",

For lunch, you can do something like hamburger helper or spaghetti with 3-4 pieces of toast or maybe a tuna melt with a hefty portion of tater tots and some dill pickle spears.

Always supersetting an upper body exercise with lower body - like bench press/reverse lunges or chin-ups/bulgarian split squats. Only exception is barbell squat, because, well, I just can't...\n\nAnyway, I love the way it feels. The feeling of having a higher pulse all the time. The sweat pouring.

            "M/30/285lbs I'm just starting my fitness journey. I'm working on losing weight and am down from my highest (~340lbs in 2022 ) through very loose dieting (not strictly counting calories, just portion control / trying to eat better).\n\nI'm starting to make an effort to get to the gym at my apartment complex and started by doing whatever on a treadmill or elliptical  20-40 min 2-3 days for a few weeks before starting the dumbbell ppl routine from the wiki. I selected that routine as dumbbells are basically all I have in the apartment  gym outaide of cardio machines and that weird 800-in-one cable machine in the corner. Right now my goals are really just to build consistency and get my but outta bed to do something. \n\nAll that said, I'm a complete noob to any sort of workout regimen and I have some stupid questions:\n\n1) what should a \"typical\" workout session look like? So far I've been treating my 1/4 mi brisk walk to and from the gym as my \"warmup/cool down\", busting out the exercises in the routine (resting between sets), and that's about it. I'm not working up much of a sweat but I'm still barely started on the progression so I'm guessing this will \"solve\" itself as I work up to higher weights.\n\n2) cardio? The wiki says to do resistance training and cardio but reading the program, there's no clear time included to do so? Do I treat them separately and follow 2 programs; one for cardio and one for resistance? I'm going on walks daily (~2mi) but I know my cardiovascular health isn't great so would like to do some work on that but I'm not sure when.\n\n3) mobility? Same questions as cardio, really. When / how frequently? \n\n4) I'm not sure I understand the bulk/cut dichotomy... I want to lose weight and get stronger / bigger muscles but if I understand things, it's not advised to do both at the same time? Am I shooting myself on the foot by trying to do resistance training / cardio / weight loss at the same time? Do I just need to temper my expectations with regards to progression while I'm eating at a deficit?\n\nAppreciate any input! Thanks for answering my stupid questions!",

As that weight gets easier over time, I increase it.\n\nWould a mixture of lifts and cardio each day be better than all cardio and all weight days? If so, why? I know push, pull, legs is popular and other splits. Time is a factor. My weight workout is about an hour cardio workout is 75 to 90 minutes. Can't give workout much more total time than that. I need at least 2 days off after lifting before lifting again but that could be accomplished while lifting every day by rotating muscle groups, right?\n\nWith the routine outlined above, am I missing any major muscles or muscle groups? I workout for a variety of reasons. It makes me feel good. I like to look good. Less aches and pains as I age.

            "I don't think its a stupid question but it's not short for the other thread so I am posting it here.  \n  \n**Very short backstory:** 5 weeks ago when it all started I was obese 134kg at 175cm at 22yo. In my younger years before I gained weight I used to do a lot of sports(no weight lifting though) but due to mental weakness id say I lost myself in food for a year atleast. So basically around 5 weeks ago I had a really bad case of some sort of food poisoning where basically for 4 days I would barely eat due to the fact that the next 30 minutes it would just come out of me and I would drink around 3-5 litters of water since I kept feeling very dehydrated. And this sort of really made my stomach shrink quite a bit and reset how I would feel my stomach itself. Before that I would binge eat a lot and whenever I had new space I would just eat again. (I know really sad tbh). But after those 4 days of really bad illnnes I noticed that I stopped feeling the urge for food and having my stomach empty didn't feel too bad (id still feel some hunger but more normal id say) But the big thing for is that since then when ever I eat normal sized diet focus meals I feel them trully being in my stomach and being used, I dont just feel my stomach like a bag, which to people who didnt struggle with binge eating in the past might sound wierd.\n\n**Now:**  \nFast forward 4 weeks from then, I have lost 11kg(123kg this morning) (I'd say atleast 4kg would be water probably because my water intake had increased by like 5 times, therefore my body wont be storing so much of it). My workouts feel amazing, I sort of always go to failure (safely) with my sets and I include cardio by swimming half an hour after gym sessions at least 2 times a week.\n\nMy calories intake till now was roughly around 1200-1400 kcal(very comfortably, not feeling starvation or weakness) not shying from carbs even though it would be mainly protein and good fats. Today I started hitting into my keto by focusing on protein intake around 180g baseline (still working on it).\n\nNow before people say that I am jumping ahead of myself (\"Lets hope you keep at it\",etc) I studied fitness but just never really truly had the ability to apply myself like I am now. Id say I have higher than average knowledge about fitness, strength building, hypertrophy, and the nervous system.\n\n***What I want to ask is what should I consider going forwards?***\n\nWhat should I consider? (decreasing the calorie deficit?, vitamins?, specific foods? Certain things I might have not considered?\n\nAlso I know that the caloric deficit is somewhat high for someone with such high weight, its well past any online calculators of extreme weight loss category which is like 2500kcals but I really am enjoying myself and feeling healthier than ever with this setup, My workouts are strong(thanks to preworkouts too) and results are crazy good, in the last 2 days I had lost 1.8 kg, and my weight lifting feels great my muscle connection really showing and differences start to be noticed(nothing crazy but noticeble).\n\n**Goal:**\n\nAlso I am considering continuing until around 105kg from where Id just focus on muscle building only without much weight loss dieting). Why not under 100? Because i feel like id start feeling small since even now at 123kg the fat is well distributed I dont have a round belly or anything like that and people think I am lying when I say how much I weigh.\n\n***I hope I dont seem annoying I am truly passionate about this so I felt like I should go in detail.***",

            "1) Sounds good to me. You mention 20-40 mins on the treadmill... if anything, I would lift weights first and do that 2nd if you do those back to back. But ultimately, it comes down to preference. Working up a sweat (or lack of one) doesn't really constitute progress or not. Sweat is just your bodies way of cooling down. I don't really sweat at all in a cold gym.  But usually as the effort increases, you'll likely sweat a bit more. \n\n2) Do cardio whenever you feel like it. How much also depends on you and what you can manage/recover from. Walking is fantastic (especially at your weight). Hell, if you can get in a pool, even better. Basically, take care of your knees. Keep to low-impact cardio for now if you want to do more intense cardio sessions. \n\n3) I personally never focus on mobility work, but I'm also pretty naturally flexible. So i'm not the best person here. But ultimately, do it whenever probably. \n\n4) To most optimally build muscle, you want to be in a calorie surplus. Trying to maintain body weight and build muscle/lose fat (aka recomp) is INCREDIBLY slow and honestly, isnt' worth it unless you are happy with your current physique. For someone of your size, you are not going to recomp your way into being a healthy weight, so you should cut to start (which you're doing)\n\nAs an overweight beginner, you are in the best possible position to build muscle while in a calorie deficit as your body has PLENTY of easily accessible energy. Will you build as much muscle as you would if you were a healthy weight beginner in a surplus? Dunno really... but don't matter since that's not the case. But lifting weights while in a calorie deficit is SUPER important, so no, you are not shooting yourself in the foot at all. In fact, you're doing the best thing possible. Lifting, combined with high protein intake, promotes muscle retention (at a minimum) so that the weight you do lose is primarily fat rather than fat+muscle. Then like I said, as an overweight beginner, you'll likely build muscle too\n\nSo basically, your roadmap should be continue to cut until you are solidly a healthy weight (take refeed breaks as necessary). Once you are a healthy weight, I'd personally take some time learning to maintain that weight (a month or 2?). Then from there, increase your calories slightly and get into a slight surplus. Gain like 15-20lbs, and then turn around and cut again.  (Don't just keep gaining and end up overweight again, stay in a healthy weight range for your build). And the whole time, be lifting.",
            "First off, great work dropping 55 lbs! As you've noticed by now, losing weight is 90% a function of your diet, but exercise brings lots of other health benefits with it. I'm gonna info-dump a *lot* of stuff on you, but keep in mind that you don't need to do all of this at once. Picking up one or two habits that you stick with for years is way better than picking up 10 habits that you stick with for weeks.\n\n1. Pick a program, and stick to it. If it feels easy, you're just stronger then the weights you're using...for now ;). After enough sessions and weight increases, you'll definitely feel it more and break more of a sweat. Your walk isn't really going to be much of a warmup for lifting purposes. Getting the blood flowing is good, for sure, but lifting warmups are also largely about warming up the actual muscles used in the lift. Particularly the small stabilizing muscles that get overlooked in favor of the big \"vanity muscles\" that are the focus of the training. Honestly, don't worry *too much* about this for now (beginners can get away with cold lifts for a while), but you can google \"warmups for [lift]\" to get an idea of what to do once you start to feel \"stiff\" going into your lifts cold.\n\n2. In general, think of your cardio and strength training as two different programs, rather than two halves of the same workout. If you do some hard cardio and then try to lift weights, your body just won't have the energy necessary to work your muscles as had as they need in order to get a \"true\" strength workout. You might consider a [full-body dumbell routine](https://thefitness.wiki/reddit-archive/dumbbell-stopgap/) that you do 3x/week, and then do cardio 3x a week using a program like [couch to 5k](https://runmoreapp.com/couch-to-5k/#workout-schedule) in between strength training days.\n\n3. \"Mobility\" is a pretty broad term, so this depends on your goals. Can't go wrong finding a Yoga series on Youtube and following that a few times per week.\n\n4. Building muscle requires calories. The best way to get those calories is to eat more than your body needs, so that it can put the surplus into muscle building. However, you are overweight and have plenty of fat reserves that your body can tap into for the energy necessary to build muscle. Don't worry about bulking for a while. Once you're down to a healthy weight, you'll find that it's much harder to put on muscle eating the same number of calories you have been. At that point, you may decide to bulk up [X] pounds above your goal weight, and then cut back down to your goal weight again. This is far more time-efficient than eating at \"maintenance calories\" and waiting for your body to naturally burn fat and build muscle. But again, looking at where you are right now, just keep on losing weight, you'll gain muscle along the way regardless.\n\nYou're not doing anything wrong by mixing resistance training and cardio (aside from the aforementioned \"burn all your energy on cardio and then trying to lift before replenishing your energy\" thing). Doing both is *great*, whether on a bulk or a cut.",
            "1) If you're just starting, not sure I'd worry too much.. But if you're getting after it for a few weeks, and you really feel like you're not working up a sweat or getting anywhere, then yes, you're definitely not lifting heavy enough.  It's okay to start \"too light,\" though.\n\nA brisk walk is fine as a warmup.  Basically getting blood in the joints and feeling \"warm.\"\n\n2) Put cardio wherever it's convenient for you.  Some people do it after their resistance training, some do it on separate days.  It doesn't matter.  Daily 2 mile walks is ABSOLUTELY cardio and is great for you, don't sell that short.  If you wish to improve on it, consider longer walks, or you can take up running, or do cardio any number of other ways.\n\n3) Mobility is more of an \"as-needed\" thing.  Sometimes it can be done as a warmup for a specific lift (eg. doing band pullaparts before bench press, banded ankle extensions before squats), sometimes it can just be because you feel you have weak mobility in a given area.  It's not \"mandatory\" to do them, in many cases the exercise itself LEADS to improved mobility (squatting more leads to better, deep squats with better knee path, etc).\n\n4) If you wish to lose weight, be in a caloric deficit.  Because you're new to the process, you may very well gain \"some\" muscle, and you will definitely gain strength/power as you train your body to do the movements.  This is called recomp, and it's real, it's just not an efficient way to long-term gains.  At WORST, lifting while on a cut will minimize your muscle LOSS.  So, pick what's more important to you right NOW--do you need to lose weight, or do you just want to build muscle?\n\nAnd honestly, for a beginner, if you don't feel like you need to lose much weight and you just want to see performance and strength gains specifically, I would worry less about calories altogether and just see how it goes in the gym for a while.  Worry about it after you get into the habit and find enjoyment in it.",

            "Let's get the little stuff out of the way, first. If you are 22-25%, you do not need to bulk. Cutting will not be necessary for you, either, if your goal is hypertrophy. Could you cut? Yes, but don't (at least not right now). Your weight is consistent which means you aren't overcomsuming or undercomsuming calories. That's good. Keep your calories there. You replied to someone else that you are consuming 1g/lb of protein. That's a little overboard, but fine. You can keep your protein consumption the same as long as you're not having difficulty getting the rest of your calories in. It's also great that your bloodwork if good, but I've seen people with horrible bloodwork get monstrously strong and big. Stay healthy, though, as poor health can end your training and everything else (literally) before your time. \n\nNow for your sleep. How do you know your sleep is good? Do you go to sleep and wake up at consistent times daily? Do you toss and turn all night? Do you wake up sore or achy? Do you crawl out of bed or bounce up ready to attack the day? Do you know how many hours of sleep you actually need besides the 8 hours every non-educated person says? There's a lot to sleep than people realize so saying it's \"good\" really doesn't mean much.\n\nNow for the part that most people don't want to hear. If you haven't made any progress in the past year, there is a chance your training is not effective or efficient for hypertrophy. Lifting isn't just lifting. All goals can be split into three main types: performance, health/wellness, and aesthetics. These all overlap to provide a few benefits from the other groups, but not much. This means that your lifting will be done differently depending on your goal. A prescription for the bench press, for example, might be 5x5 done explosively for performance, 8-12x3 with a 2-0-1-0 tempo for health wellness, and 10-20x4-5 with a strict 3-1-2-0 tempo for aesthetics. That's just for one exercise. You still need to look at total volume, rest times, frequency, etc. How you train is most often more important than what you train. \n\nIf my book for beginning lifters was done, I'd direct you to it, Unfortunately, it is not, so my advice is to find a trainer or coach that you trust and believe in and ask them if you can hire them for an assessment on what you're doing. You may not have the funds to hire them on a regular basis, but a single session may be all you need to start seeing results in your training.",

Plus, the one time I did make it to 130, I still had the belly pudge. So I accepted 135lbs for a few years, before deciding to get into lifting. Now a few bulk/cut cycles in, I'm actually still aiming for about 135... but with abs instead of pudge. My old 135 looks more like my 145-150lbs bulked weight.

Moderate intensity squatting with weights has such a low injury risk that saying bodyweight is safer is maybe true but not meaningful. Like, wearing a helmet in your car is also probably safer but nobody cares about that additional degree of safety. I would say it is the same here. The added safety is not important, and you also at a certain point have to weigh the lost benefits. Increased muscular, tendon, and bone strength have a protective function. If I never apply any stress to my spine and the muscles and connective tissues that support it, I'm not going to injury it acutely, but it will also become weak and more fragile in the long run.\n\nWhen does the lost strength and function become more beneficial in terms of wellness than the decreased acute injury risk? I honestly have no idea and am skeptical of anyone who claims to.\n\nI am sure that bodyweight squats build less strength in the muscles, tendons, and bones than weighted squats.

            "You need to pick one if you are not happy with your current lack of results.   \nAt your height and weight you can still bulk and not be too fat.  \n  \nDon't pay for routines when you are just starting out. Pick one from the wiki, find it's spreadsheet, and follow it as written.",
            "I go to a crossfit-like but not crossfit brand type place and I don't know what the program is ahead of time, I just turn up and do what's on the board.  It's a workout of the day functional fitness style thing. It's designed so over a 4 week period you improve your squats deadlifts bench and overhead but I don't have a copy of a plan myself. We mix lighter and heavier sets and conditioning and on week 4 it's kind of 'test week' where you should be able to go back to where we started but put more weight on.  So for example we will do what I outlined above plus conditioning like lunges, ball slams, kettle bell carry etc to also build up the muscles you need for squats and it's a little different each time.\n\nLong story short, can't really post it, but you might be able to use some of those key words and look up something similar.",
            "Is it PR for a sake for PR or just another set you will be doing later? \nIf you just want to check if you can lift that much then after warm-up. If this weight is supposed to become your normal set then normally after all other sets.",
            ">Early in my set or towards the end?\n\nAfter top sets (work sets), before down sets.  A true 1RM can negatively affect the rest of your heavy sets.\n\nI once hit a 1rm PR on bench, then lowered the weight for my work sets, *and failed*. Downsets went fine, but otherwise didn't get any \"work sets\" in.\n\nHitting PRs for the sake of it is generally discouraged, in part for this reason.  Stick to PRs on your set/reps, and save 1rm PR attempts for between cycles.",
            "That\u2019s a ridiculous comparison, because op asked for alternatives to bread.",
            "Thanks for the thoughtful and empathetic response; I\u2019m not sure I really deserved it (but maybe the onlookers did).\n\nI agree with nearly everything you\u2019ve written. I think my point of difference is that if somebody asks about pure safety as OP did we should just answer that at face value rather than reinterpret the question as \u201cwhat is best for me\u201d.",
            ">\u00a0I've seen far more patients with chronically painful backs that have never squatted at all than those who squatted too much.\n\nDon\u2019t you have a massive confounder here which is activity level? People who are inactive are more likely to have chronic back pain, and squatting is a form of activity. It doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s the safest activity that would create the same level of back pain reduction.",
            "For the sake. Few weeks ago I was hitting 290, but pushing more became difficult so I lowered the weight but added reps.",
            "Doing that 1RM must have been an *upset*",
            "Thanks! What are down sets?",
            "Did they say a replacement for bread? No. They asked for carbs. What's up your ass?",
            "Lots of active people get back pain, many people are active without squatting. Squatting has a lot of physiological benefits, and I can't really see many downsides beyond the relatively low risk of injury.",
            "Lighter sets hit after your heavier sets.  Examples:  last week was 5x1 followed by 2x9.  This week was 3x7 followed by 2x13.  The singles and 7s would be the top sets, the 9s and 13s would be the downsets.\n\nDual purpose of being proficient in multiple rep ranges, and getting a smidge more volume in the specific movement.",

While I don't really look overweight, I am about 10kgs over what I should be, with a BMI\\* showing that I'm just into the 'overweight' range and I was nudging at 73 kilos a few months ago. I'm also probably what they'd call \"skinny fat\" as in I look like a healthy weight but am quite unfit.\n\nFor the last few weeks I've been going to the gym three times a week (first time back at the gym in more than a year) and spending 1-2 hours there each time (half an hour cardio and the rest being strength/resistance/core training) and I'm already feeling the difference. When I started, I would only be able to do 10 minutes on the exercise bike and I'd have to stop and rest 2-3 times. Now I can do 15 minutes with no rest, or 20 minutes with one or maybe two rests on an off day. I'm not back up to where I was with strength when I was forced to stop going to the gym, but I was pleased to see that I had kept some of my strength and I seem to be quickly regaining ground on some machines. Eg. In 2020 I could only manage 2 kilos\\*\\* on the leg curl machine, but managed to get up to 7 kilos by mid last year. When I started back a few weeks ago I had to drop down to 5, but I've already been able to go back up to 6 again.\n\nAs much as I love chocolate and energy drinks, I've completely cut those out as well as of about 3 weeks ago. I thought I'd struggle with cravings or even withdrawal from the caffeine but even though I stopped them \"cold turkey\" I've had no ill effects.\n\n\\*I am aware of the issues with the BMI and how there are various situations where it's not applicable - eg. being a child, being pregnant or being an extremely muscular athlete etc - but none of those things apply to me lol\n\n\\*\\*I'm not 100% sure if the weights are 1 pound each or 1 kilo each or some other arbitrary weight, but as I'm in Australia I will assume they are kilos",

I have fixed that wider dips (elbows slightly to the sides) hits more chets And narrow (elbows straight along the torso) hits more triceps. I want to work mainly chest, but my problem Is -> when i do them narrow (hands shoulder width) i can go really deep without shoulder discomfort, but when i do them slightly wider (hands slightly wider than shoulder width) i feel too much idk stress on my shoulders when i go too low. So what im asking Is, Is it ok to do them narrow And still train chest, or Is it really for triceps ? thanks",

            "I've been lifting 3-4 times (2x push / 2x pull) a week for 3 weeks now (180cm/77kg). I\u2019ve (26, male) trained periodically, but unseriously, in shorter periods of my life, but never in a gym and never this hard and calculated. I'm eating at what should be a mild deficiency to loss fat while eating a lot of protein (160g). According to the scanner at my gym I\u2019ve only lost 1.3kg and 0.3% bodyfat (18.7% \u2013 18.4%) / 500g fat while also losing 400g muscle. So my weight seems to be going down less than 0.5kg per week, but I\u2019m also losing and not gaining muscle. I feel like my weight loss is going slowly, but I\u2019m also not building muscle. My body type is \u201cskinnyfat\u201d or what it is called and my first priority is probably getting rid of fat over building muscle, if I really have to choose \u2013 I\u2019d like to do both. But losing almost as much muscle as fat in the process seems off to me. I do not know what to do or what specifically to change and it feels a bit frustrating. Should I eat more calories to reduce loss of muscle? Should I eat less calories to speed up fatloss? Any tips or help at all is greatly appreciated",

            "It depends, a routine should be customized for you.\nI can give an example and write down some guidelines that are important to understand clearly.\n\n\n1. Upper body exercises are divided into pull and push movements, especially talking about bodyweight.\nA proper upper body day should be balanced for example 1 or 2 exercises of each category.\nThey are divided into degree too.\nVertical or horizontal, so 4 exercises. One of earch for both pull and push is the most balanced choice.\n\n\nBut a simple day can be just Push ups and pull ups for example, plus core maybe if you have 30min-1h.\nFinally you can add some isolation exercises and core.\nLike biceps curl and core (abs and trunk)\n\n\n2. Decide the type of split you ll follow.\nUpper/Legs.(2 days upper 2 legs)\nOr full body(3 days full body) For example.\nDont think \" 3 days are better then 2 days\". Because in this case the volume (sets and reps) are the same. Just splitted into 2 or 3 days. But the same.\n\n\n3. Gradual progression is a must. Dont do big jumps, neither about load, weights, neithers days, sets, reps.\nBody, joints, tendons (prone to overuse injuries) strenghten and adapt slowly.\nDo little steps. Not jumps.\n\n\n\n\nNow i paste an old comment where I write a sample for bodyweight schedule.\n\n\nI have to write that pull ups arent easy.\nBeing able to do one pull up, and being able to do a correct form pull up are two different things very different one from each other.\nBecause in bodweight training is very easy to \"compensate\" using wrong muscles (that why people develop gorilla posture etc).\nSo I prefer to recommend bodyweight rows. Or buy a band and do lats machine with a band at home and rows with a band in 3x8-10. Initially.\n\n\nSo learning proper form , technique, learning to retract and depress scapulas is very important and will your muscles grow up while improving your posture,too.\n\n\n4. Leaning scapula control. Proper form of exercises and rotate exercises during week.\n(Same exercise 3 time a week = big load on joints, while rotating for example just changing degree or grip, forearm supinated or pronated, you ll load less joints and tendons. For example one day vertical pull, one day horizontal pull. Different stimulus, less overuse load.)\n\n\nI could suggest 2 times a week.\nOr 3 times a week but lighter.\n\n\nA simple example can be:\nDay 1:\u00a0\n\n\nWarmup.\n\n\nPushups 4 sets.\n\n\nProne T, prone V weight free 3 sets of 10 for posture and back muscles.\n\n\nCore (abs, side plank, bird dog)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDay 2:\n\n\nWarmup.\n\n\nPike pushups 3 sets.\n\n\nProne V, A, or wall slides or bodyweight rows at a table 3 sets.\n\n\nCore again.\n\n\n\n\nThis is just a simple routine if someone want to train a bit at home without anything, just the floor.\nThe prone trapezius exercises(pull category) balance the push.\n\n\nProne exercises make your learn how to use back muscles\u00a0 before introducing pull exercises like rows or pull ups. Too.\nBut generally i recommend prone T and V, and rows initially.\nThen slowly adding \"scapulas pull ups\". Then when everything is mastered, add real pull ups. So you ll execute them properly without that ugly neck shrugs that everybody does.\n\n\n\n\nNow i paste the old comment, if useful.\n>\n\n\n<A:\n\n\nPull ups prone grip 7x1.\n\n\nDips 5x2.(not under 90degree)\n\n\nRows supine grip 5x3.\n\n\nPush ups 5x3.\n\n\nCore.\n\n\nB:\n\n\nPull ups supine grip 6x2\n\n\npike pushups 6x2\n\n\nrows prone grip 5x3\n\n\npushups 5x3\n\n\ncore\u00a0\n\n\nThese are from a calistenics courses.\u00a0 So can be an input from where to start.(if you want a calishtenic workout) 2 minutes rest first 2 exercises. 1.30 minute rest second 2 exercises.\n\n\nEvery 2 weeks, progress, remove 1 set and add 1 rep. For example next month will be: Pull ups 5x3, dips 3x5, rows 3x5 pu 3x5.\n\n\nThen (reached 3 sets) just add reps. But hard to explain. But pull ups and dips or generally first 2 exercises progress different. After 2 months: Pull ups 5x5, dips 5x5, rows 3x7, pu 3x7\n\n\nSchedule and plan is necessary, dont trust calistenics freestylers online or random idiots.\n\n\nTechnique too is very important. This is why I would prefer to do: Learning scapula movements with a stick. Retraction depression protraction. Bench press with correct techique, like lats machine, seated cable row and shoulder press dumbells. They are the same movements of bodyweight exercises but you can do them with light dumbell. So it s easier to learn proper techinques and scapula position.\n\n\nThis is why I still suggest a gym training with dumbells initially. After a learning period, switch to calisthenics.\n\n\nA trainer or instructor will teach you technique too, so it s recommended.",

Assuming you're training in a higher rep range like you're meant to with isolation movements, curls are hardly ever going to be too heavy to maintain control over.\n\nAt the end of the day all curls hit the biceps so do whatever's comfortable.",

I've been **barely able to walk/take a dump** for the last 4 days and please remember, I've lost 65lbs so it's not just \"soreness\".\n\nIt ain't a label chief, it's for former fatasses that have never trained.",

            "Firstly this study is 11 people.\n\nSecondly I don't think it proves your point at all. it shows that TDEE slows down, not metabolism. This is a big difference. For one, it's pretty expected that you're gonna feel lethargic on a very large calorie deficit. Did the participants maintain the same activity level?\n\nOne person even had a higher TDEE at week 1, 2 people had higher at week 3. How do you explain these?\n\nAlso note that the vast majority of the weight lost in the first week was FFM. why is this? is it because they were locked in a room or lethargic and doing far less exercise? Or because there wasn't enough protein in their diet? Either way, losing over 3kg of muscles is going to affect your energy expenditure, that's at least 40 calories just in bmr let alone TDEE.\n\nAlso, the difference, even if we attribute all of it to AT, is pretty negligible in terms of weight loss action plans, it's only a 7% drop with a 50% calorie deficit, well within the realm of measurement error. I imagine the effect becomes far more severe at lower bmi's (see starvation mode), but if you're overweight it's negligible.\n\nSo yeh I'm not really sure your point or how it relates to your original question, if you're overweight (or any time really) you can eat less than maintenance and lose weight.",

            "as much as you need to see solid progressive overload. chances are you could grow off less.",
            "That's true. But the op said elsewhere that his target bodyweight is 250 lbs at 5'10\". So I feel like it still doesn't work here.",
            "If you're an overweight, otherwise healthy adult it's impossible that you're eating less than 1000 calories and not losing weight. Either you are counting incorrectly or you just need to be patient.",
            "If you\u2019re eating less than 1000 calories a day, and you\u2019re even moderately overweight, weight loss is inevitable.\n\nWhat are your measurements?",
            "Are you weighing all your food to determine those calories? All snacks and drinks except water? No guessing or eyeballing?\n\n1200kcal a day is considered a lower limit. If are eating that much and not losing you need to increase your daily activity.",
            "Same here, I'm quoting literally,\n\n\"My current position looking back on the debate can be summarized by the following points:\nThe hypothesis that protein intakes above 1.8g/kg of total body weight will help dieters maintain muscle mass does not have strong support.\nHowever, there is a paucity of research of any appreciable time length that directly compares moderate (1.4-1.8g/kg) to high protein intakes (>1.8g/kg) in dieting lifters, so there\u2019s also not a strong case against higher protein intakes for dieting athletes.\n\nIf protein intakes above the moderate level of ~1.8g/kg do assist lean mass maintenance, they probably don\u2019t help everyone equally due to individual differences. Also, any lean mass sparing effect from a high protein intake would likely be relatively small.\n~80% of studies comparing higher versus lower protein intakes in people performing resistance training don\u2019t show a significant difference favoring higher or lower protein intakes\"\n\nThen in the last 100 words makes a 180 completely out of nowhere and says the opposite.\n\nSince he's name dropped in that page, if you're interested in someone who does research that I wouldn't say is good by scientific standards but at least is barely acceptable, Menno Henselmans is kind of the only one in the space.",

Maybe my face being as lean as possible is the important thing for me, which might still lean out slightly..

Hell, if you were to make sure your protein was on point, workout hard and slowly gain 15-20lbs and then cut that 15-20lbs off again to be where you are right now, you'd look leagues better.

I was given drugs that didn't work and a needle in the ass that didn't work. I was sent to physical therapy where she said it was adverse neural tension and I did her prescribed nerve flosses, nerve glides, and pelvic tilts for 6 weeks and it didn't help. I then got an MRI that showed an annular tear and was given oral steroids that didn't work. Then finally an epidural steroid injection that worked like magic. It was about 4 months between my first visit and the injection, and that was the only thing that did anything for me. Now 2 months after the injection, there is stiff soreness and stiffness and I have to be very careful with how I bend and pick things up, but that is infinitely better than the all-consuming and debilitating agony it once was.

Years of starting to get my squats or deadlifts decent and then tweaking my back and having to restart - this has really been helping.\n\nThe only thing I've added to this is side squats with isometric hold alternating with the deep squats with isometric holds, and single leg deadlifts (with no weight until each side is good enough to start increasing ) to help my back imbalances.",

I've been lifting weights for about a good year now running a split of Chest/Tris, Back, Legs and then Shoulders/Bis, but have been looking to change it up for a PPL split, 6 days a week. When it comes to volume, I seem to get a lot of conflicting results on how much is okay, sometimes I hear between 10-20 sets per muscle but then I also hear 10-20 sets per *muscle group.* I push my sets pretty hard so intensity isn't a problem, but as for structuring a program, I want to do it right as to not include junk volume. For example, my current chest routine runs as 3 sets of bench, 3 of incline dumbell press, and 3 of chest flys. Would it be worth it when running a second push day, 3 sets of say chest press, rounding up the total volume to 12 sets of chest for the week? Thank you!",

For example you're doing 9 sets of chest right now per week, just round up to 10 and split it evenly between both sessions, so you would have 5 sets of chest on each of your push days. Just do the same thing for each muscle group and you should be good. As long as you're still progressing and you have the desire to do more you'll be okay to add more sets slowly. I wouldn't worry a ton about what is junk volume and what isn't, if you're not done being sore before your next workout with that same muscle group it's too much. Also if you're getting stronger workout to workout or week to week and you add some sets and then you stop getting stronger it is proabably too much volume. As long as the workouts aren't a walk in the park, you're getting measurably stronger (usually session to session or week to week), and you're not crippled from the volume, you are probably doing just about as good of a job as you can.",

There's also the concept of diminishing returns. 10 sets might get you 90% of the gains, and then every subsequent set will grant you diminishing returns to get 100% of your potential gains. And then there's individual differences - are you a high responder to training or a low responder. \n\n\nIt's trial and error - do them all for 3 months each, and find what works for your particular biology.

For weight loss range, it\u2019s just referring to the range where your body is primarily pulling from fat for energy- this will only result in fat loss if you are in an overall caloric deficit for the day. Training at a higher heart rate range will burn more calories overall.\u00a0",
            "While benching in that rep range will help with strength to do pushups, you need to work on endurance. There are probably plenty of routines out there on building up pushups, but one thing I\u2019ve found effective, and that I use in the few weeks before my annual fitness test for work is called 1x3s.\u00a0 Take the number of pushups you can do in a minute with good form and divide by 3. That\u2019s how many you\u2019ll do each set. Set a timer for 3 minutes, knock out your set as quickly as possible without compromising form, then you get the remainder of that minute to rest. At the start of the second minute do another set, again taking the remainder of the minute to rest, and repeat again at start of the last minute. Add this to your chest workouts, I like to do them at the end, or do daily in addition to lifting, and gradually increase the reps per set. In basic we\u2019d do these a few times per day randomly to work on getting up to 50-60 in a minute for the test.\u00a0",
            "There is no accurate way to tell how many calories are burned from exercise. I\u2019d recommend weighing yourself daily at the same time, look at weekly averages to remove day to day fluctuations, and adjust your calorie intake as needed. 1450 is already pretty low, so unless you\u2019re <130 lbs, or just don\u2019t have a lot of physical activity throughout the day, probably want to make sure you\u2019re being consistent in your calorie tracking.\u00a0",

After that first year or so of lifting, progression tends to be less linear, so you may need to do higher rep sets for a while to prime your CNS and then go for a period of shorter, heavier sets to progress.\n\n531 is another good program (or range of programs) but quite frankly nearly requires an evening schools' worth of education to actually understand the nuts and bots of how it works.",

It's a dangerous game that I don't want to play.\n\nThe thing is, I've heard about \"parallel squatting\", which from what I see, it's probably close to the form I used to do when using the running shoes (I never took a video, but I assume I wasn't going too low). Perhaps if I only use this type of form, my knees will be okay on the long run.\n\nMy question is: is parallel squatting a legit way to increase quads and glutes size? Is it inferior to \"low/deep squatting\", as I assume? I used to believe that people who don't squat deep are basically cheating, so I was feeling like an imposter when not going low, but now I see this is a legit way to do it?\n\nI really don't want to lower the weight for weeks just so I can get my knees used to deep squatting, because honestly, I don't think it will even work on the long run.",

Depending on how you define \"supplement\", it may not even really count as one. It's just food.\n- Creatine. It's stored in your muscles because ~~it's a *very* close molecule to ATP~~ it helps your body recycle ADP back into ATP, which is the #1 energy molecule used on the cellular level. Adding this to your diet gives your muscles an extra energy store that can let you lift just a bit harder, which lets you do more of the \"good damage\" that leads your your muscles repairing themselves bigger and stronger. You get *some* of this through your diet, but nowhere near the amount from taking it as a supplement. It's also like the difference between 100% and 102%, not a total game changer, just a little boost.\n\nBoth are well-studied and have proven effectiveness with very little, if any, downside.

I can say, \"but my eating is not bad\" and have it mean something.. I am still weighing portions, I manage protein intake, etc. I do 2300 Calories, min of 250 protein. I haven't lowered my calorie intake as any calculator I use online says I my daily calories should be crazy high. So the deficit seems like it should be fine?\n\nDoes it just slow down at some point and there's no way around it? Should I lower my daily calorie intake even though I've successfully lost so much weight at my current one?\n\nMy goal this year was to hit 275 by my birthday, August 30th. But I am losing hope!

            "What do you do when you stagnate? \n\nI use a plan that involves just dumbbells for weightlifting. With these exercises I can only continue to go up and wait for so long either due to my body having difficulty continually moving up in weight, or due to the maximum amount that my dumbbells go up to being 50 lb. I'm working on one of the few dumbbell only workout routines I could find online and I feel like it's been going well. however, now I'm a couple months into it and I'm having trouble moving up in weight. I just started adding one to each rep (instead of 8-10, now 9-11) and planned on just continuing to do that. Does that work or am I still gonna stagnate? Should I just switch routines?

I\u2019ve been dieting and lost about 25 lbs of fat, but I want to start bulking. Is the beginner 531 robust enough to bulk on or should I look at a different variation? I\u2019ve spent years on and off trying to lose those 25 pounds so I think I\u2019m in my head about bulking because I don\u2019t want to just put back weight I\u2019ve lost after finally finding a program I can stick to.

            "Has anyone ever tried overhead pressing with a cambered barbell? Not an EZ bar, but one with a deep camber in the center.  I've seen these used for seal rows to get more range of motion and to not hit the bench with the barbell and I got to thinking they'd be a good way to get more out of the OHP.  Regular OHP with arms out in front sucks for everything but front delts.  Behind the Neck Press is great for everything, but it fucks your rotator cuff up.  Ergo, a cambered bar could allow you to hit those side delts, triceps and traps better than regular OHP and safer than behind the neck OHP because your head goes inside the camber at the bottom, which allows you to perform the exercise with your arms right in line with your torso, all the while allowing you to use more weight than just doing it with dumbbells. Granted you're not going to get to your collarbone with the cambered bar before your head hits, but you can certainly get to your chin.\n\nIf you don't know what I'm talking about, google \"rogue cambered seal row barbell\"",

Accessories are relatively easier to find substitutes so I\u2019ll cover the main exercises:\n\nDeadlift: I do a relatively standard deadlift, but with a specialized strap for missing limbs. I use the Aldridge Arm (which you can find here: https://www.gogrit.us/aldridge-arm-by-equip/). Kind of pricey, but so far it\u2019s done well for me.\n\nSquat: I\u2019ve found the back squat to be pretty tough to work with when trying to hold it up with only one arm. However, I find that the front squat doesn\u2019t really have the same problem, although it took some getting used to.\n\nBench press: I mostly just replace this with the chest press or pec deck. You may miss out on the benefits of a real compound exercise, like hitting triceps in the case of the pec deck, so I try to add other exercises appropriately.\n\nOverhead Press: I do a cable shoulder press. I can do this normally with my right arm, but for my left I use the attachment that you would usually wrap around your ankle, but on my arm. It\u2019s not the most stable, but it\u2019s the best I\u2019ve found so far.\n\nAll of this probably isn\u2019t perfect, but with some getting used to it has worked well enough for me.

The difference seems about the same as the difference in tdee from losing weight, so I'd guess that you probably ate about the same for the whole 16 months (though I've got limited data haha). If you want to maintain the same rate you would have to continue the same deficit. But that is probably not advisable any more 950 is a massive deficit. Especially as a lifter, you probably want to maintain a lot of your muscle mass, the larger the deficit the more muscles you will lose when you reach a target weight.\n\n275 by august 30th is a deficit of 1500 calories per day. This is a very large deficit and I would probably recommend against it. Don't try and rush, you are making amazing progress.

So however much of a deficit you were at 408, you're at a smaller deficit eating the same calories at 308.\n\nIf you're still losing weight, just slower, you can keep eating the same way and accept that the next 100 lbs will be slower than the first 100.

You don't mention your height, but at least 1lb a week. (Careful with the activity level you put into calculators, because if you're only lifting, you're not burning as much as you might think! Lifting 4-5x a week isn't considered \"moderate exercise\")\n\nSo a couple of ideas.... 1, you're mis-tracking something. Have you changed up what you've been eating lately? Maybe you swapped something out that you think is (for example sake) 200 calories but is actually 500 calories. So you're weighing it right, but tracking it incorrectly. Maybe spend some time to make sure you're picking the correct calories for what you're eating.\n\nor 2, maybe it's time for a little break. Increase your calories a little bit (by like 250-300), eat there for a week. If you feel yourself increasing in energy and being more active, you might be able to increase it a bit more. You dont' want to be getting into a surplus, but you'll gain a bit of weight just from having more food in your bowels. But give yourself 2-3 weeks of eating at what should actually be your maintenance. This should hopefully perk you up and increase your NEAT movements which have likely dropped in the time you've been in a deficit. These are your big calorie burners really. So once you've re-energized, you can drop down to 2300 calories or so and you should get back to losing weight at a more reasonable pace again.",

If you are doing 10+k steps daily and workout 5x a week and add cardio 5x a week you have moderate/high activity.\nTo monitor your progress you should botanise scale. You should observe your body for look changes and your lifts must progress in weight.\nAll of those calculators are imprecise so if you would not see any changes in your body or your strength you should add calories and vice versa.",
            "There's a lot but hopefully I can sort through it in a way that makes sense to you. Your BMR is what your caloric intake would need to be to maintain your weight if you never moved, like in a coma. It just means basal metabolic rate and has zero daily activity counted in. This makes sense why a TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) calculator would have more calories than a BMR calculator because TDEE calculates your needs based on BMR + daily activity. Both TDEE calculators and BMR calculators can be pretty inaccurate and are better used as a starting point for the information below.\n\nIf you were at 1700 calories and you lost 1.5 kg in 5 weeks it's estimated that your maintenence calories to recomp would be somewhere around 2000. This is not set in stone and is just a rough estimate. To better find your maintenence calories track your calories and weight for a couple weeks. For example, if you are eating 2000 calories in a day and do this everyday for two weeks, but your weight has consistently gone down you're not eating enough to be at maintenence. If your weight goes up during those same two weeks then you're eating too much.\n\nI would also recommend not doing recomposition and instead doing a dedicated fat loss or muscle gain phase. Recomposition sounds super good on paper but it requires just as much effort to not really see great results or at least not see them fast. It's true that it can somewhat work and it does work better the less trained you are, doing dedicated muscle gain or fat loss phases would also work and probably faster. To gain muscle and lose fat \"optimally\" is to not do them at the same time. If you want the best fat loss results then you do a fat loss phase and if you want the best muscle gain results you do a muscle gain phase. This is because fat loss requires a deficit and for the best muscle gain you need a surplus. These counteract each other making recomp really slow fat loss and muscle gain. As for which you do it's mostly personal preference. You're not overweight or underweight so it more comes down to what you see in the mirror. If you want more muscle then do a muscle gain phase. If you want less fat then do a fat loss phase.\n\nGoing to the gym can boost your metabolism by having more lean mass and increasing daily activity, I wouldn't count on it to make a major shift in your TDEE.",
            "your bmr is the number of calories you burn while comatose. Even if all you do is sleep and work in the chair you will burn way more calories than your bmr.

So this number (1950 you say) is your starting point, since you do significant exercise per week you'll need to add that. You can look it up and use calculators and whatever, but it's just as easy to just estimate, since it sounds like you do like 10 hours ish a week add like maybe 300 calories.\n\nThe main thing you have to understand is that everything is super inaccurate.

You want to LOCK your lats, yes, tighten up, breathe and brace correctly, that sort of thing, but it's more that you just want the lats tensed up and tight, not that you want your shoulders BACK.  Pulling them back tends to cause you to arch your back, which is arguably worse than a slight forward curve in your back, for deadlifting.\n\nSome pros, Mitch Hooper being one, advocate actually pushing the shoulders forward so you get slightly longer arms, and therefore shorter range of motion.  But even without thinking THAT queue, you just want your arms stuck straight down, and to not really care too much about the shoulders. A little rounding in the upper back is 100% fine.  \n\nIf you want a queue for your lats, think about \"bending the bar around your legs.\"  I've also heard \"pretend someone is trying to tickle your armpits.\"  That will sort of \"torque\" your arms with a slight twisting motion and stiffen up the lats.\n\nIf an influencer is talking about pulling shoulders back for deadlift, they're probably also the type that never even MENTION proper breathing and bracing, which is 100% more important than just about any queue for deadlifting.

The gist is that the occasional episode of overeating -- even to a substantial degree -- might add a bit of fat... but likely much less than you're burning for energy by spending most of your time in a noticeable and stable deficit. Here's a [T-nation article on the same topic](https://t-nation.com/t/oh-go-ahead-and-pig-out/283958) that looks like the author just aped the Examine article (at least they cited it, I guess?) but wrote with a bit more ethos.\n\nOne problem with trying to do calorie math about \"X days in deficit, 1-2 days in massive surplus\" is that it ignores the existence of rate-limiting factors in human biology (your body, despite your best efforts, cannot build ~~Rome~~ Vitellius in a day) that make it quite hard to accumulate as much fat as the raw numbers would suggest from infrequent binge-eating.\n\nBasically, you're probably fine and shouldn't worry too much about cheat meals, especially given the scenario you describe (how many burgers or pieces of chicken are you even eating to make up a whole day of fasting?)",

I'll never understand how once of the smallest muscles in the entire body got on of the \"big 4\" core lifts, especially when it really only sufficiently hits one of the three heads. \n\nMost dudes here want strength so they will probably disagree with me, but again, if you're just looking for delt size and you look at the EMG studies, cable raises, dumbell raises, and face pulls are superior to the OHP and it's not close.  BUT, the seated behind the neck press is right up there, neck and neck with raises. \n\nProblem is, again, most people think it jacks your shoulders up, and I'd be lying to you if I said I never tweaked anything doing it (although it was my trap, and I'll bet I would have tweaked it with regular OHP too).  Still, I've always been a fan, but figured shifting the bar path to be more in line with my torso instead of behind or in front might give me the best of both worlds.\n\nI've been skewered on here in the past for suggesting the BTNP but since Myth says it's fine below if you do it right, maybe people won't dismiss it now.",

            "I am probably not the most qualified person to give advice. I did have an elbow surgery a couple years ago and had to figure out how to train without full use of my arm. For lower body, I think it is easy to find good exercises. Smith machine exercises like squat, good morning, lunges, and Bulgarian split squats, for example, can be done with limited use of one arm. Leg press, leg extension, and leg curls are also possible. Planet fitness wouldn't have one, but an SSB is great because you can easily grip it with one arm.\n\nFor upper body I am less confident to give advice because I don't know what is comfortable to do with your arm. You can find ways to do most exercises one armed, but I am not sure how you could modify them to work for your partial arm. Maybe it isn't helpful, but I would encourage you to get creative and try things. When my elbow was injured, I would just go to the gym and try things to see what I could make work. I found lots of good options over time.",

            "[The wiki hath the answers you seek](https://thefitness.wiki/)\n\nAs for workout routines, start out with the [Basic Beginner Routine](https://thefitness.wiki/). Spend 2-3 months here, learning the lifts. This program isn't really tailored for strength/hypertrophy/whatever, its goal is entirely to get you comfortable with the main compound lifts that are going to be the core of any reliable training plan. (Personally, I'd swap out the Chin-Ups for Pull-downs so you can control the weight, but if you can pull off 5x Chin-ups/Pull-ups, do it.)\n\nAfter that, the wiki has [plenty of good routines to choose from](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/strength-training-muscle-building/). GZCLP is a pretty popular next step once you outgrow the Basic Beginner routine. It combines one compound lift with low-rep, high-weight, one compound lift with low-weight, high-rep, and then a section of accessory lifts for high rep.\n\nI promise you, you aren't gonna accidentally hulk out into a human wall. That takes a ton of effort, and you'll see it coming a mile away. What you can do in the meantime is keep eating good food with plenty of protein, put in good work at the gym, and start packing on pounds. As long as you're working hard in the gym, those pounds are gonna be mostly muscle (but a little fat will come with it, it's absolutely inevitable). After a few months/however man pounds of that, you can switch to a cut. Eat less food, still high protein, still lift hard, but start shedding the pounds. If you're lifting hard, you'll lose mostly fat (but still a little muscle along the way).\n\nBulk and Cut and Bulk and Cut and Bulk and Cut, it can take many cycles to really *see* the change happening, but trust the process and you'll get there. Once you've got a level of bulk and definition that you're happy with, you can eat at maintenance so you neither gain nor lose weight. Maintenance is a lot easier than bulking or cutting, but lifting is still necessary to keep the physique you've worked for.",
            ">Yes but that's for fat loss. But if I'm gaining muscle as well, I'll never know exactly\n\nWhy not? If you want to gain weight, it's the same. If you want to maintain, you still need to weigh in and adjust calories.\n\nYou can gain about 0.25lbs of muscle a week but could easily lose 1.5lbs of fat in that time. If you want to Recomp, you need to lose 0.25lb fat per week to stay the same weight, while building 0.25lb muscle, so you need to weigh in and eat more or less to keep your weight stable.\n\nAlso, recomp is very unreliable. I would encourage you to bulk then cut back to your starting weight. You'll build muscle much faster.",

You may not lose as much muscle as if you had done nothing, but you will lose muscle if you continue that for weeks. You're not gonna just start building muscle just because you are doing lots of reps. It still needs to be a hard workout, pushing to failure or within a few reps, which is at odds with recovery.

            "100% wrong, yes. Like most \"normal\" fitness advice. Taught by people who've never challenged themselves with heavy loads. You're right that not many people talk about it. Also: not many people ever deadlift more than, I dunno, their fucking bodyweight? \n\nLike, curls? Dumbbell press? Sure, go ahead and breathe. It's meaningless. \n\nAnything that involves your whole body and heavy weight? You HAVE to brace, and brace well. For each lift it's a little different, but don't breathe when under Load.  Losing your brace in the middle of a rep is how the angle of your spine CHANGES while under load, and that's not only weaker, but dangerous. \n\n If you're doing deadlift for reps for example, and you brace better while standing (like me), then brace, get into position, lift, and if you can still hold your breathe, do another rep. Once you need to breathe, breathe and REBRACE while standing, and keep going. If you brace well in the hole, then get into position, breathe and brace, lift, and if you want to exhale as you drop the bar, sure, go ahead. But if this is a powerlifting meet or strongman comp, you might be  penalized if you drop the bar, you have to control it--so you'd have to stay braced because you're still under load.\n\nAt my last comp, as an example, I got 17 reps on the axle deadlift. Bounce/touch n go not allowed. I held my breath for the first four reps, rebraced at the top, did four more, rebraced, and then was forced to do it for every rep after that. But I maintained that \"full coke can\" the entire lift. \n\nFor a squat, NEVER breathe out on the way down or on the way up. Only when standing securely. Someone who says they always breathe out when going up in a squat someone who's never had heavy weight on their back.  If you can hold your breath for every rep in the set, do it. If you can't, time your breaths at the top.\n\nThe only time there's a kinda grey area is heavy moving or loading events like in strongman. Carrying an 800 lb yoke on your back, or picking up a 270lb sandbag and running with it, etc. The general rule is, hold your breath if you CAN, if you can't, you have to train the ability to take little short breaths in and out while also maintaining the brace. Difficult but it can be learned. \n\nEveryone's a bit different. If you see some big fucker breathe out while moving a big weight? Maybe he's got an unbelievably strong core, sure. Or, he's lucky and hasn't hurt himself yet.\n\nBut even beyond the safety factor, you're also leaving performance on the table because your core becomes an energy leak.\n\nHere's another example from Alex Bromley...

            "Ok, thanks.. At the moment I'm 65kg/145lbs, I have been deadlifting 2x34g dumbells this week, with straps for the first time. Before that I was only doing about 2 20kg dumbells. IDoing that for the first time, i really got the feeling of working the full body, although did the breating in out, wont do that any more.\n\nMaybe I'd want to do more than that eventually, maybe double it, but I'm not interested in competing in bbing or pling.",
            "I think concurrent training may be the way to go then.\n\nI don't have major arthritis or joint pain yet but I do want to get infront of it. if that makes sense?  Some days I Feel it in my shoulder and wrist (carpel tunnel) and I guess I'm fearing old man time.",

            "I think part of the problem is I'm not gaining enough weight. I bulked up to about 22-25% bodyfat and have been here for the past few months without my weight fluctuating too much. Maybe I should go on a cut and then start another bulk after? \n\nI think my arms look very average whenever I look in the mirror, and most probably can't even tell I lift.",
            "I've obviously not got that muscle, but when pumped, which they prob are, similar",
            "For sure. Correct breathing/bracing wouldn't make a really noticeable difference at your current loads.  But as Lane Norton says: act like the light weights are heavy, and the heavy weights will feel light.\n\nJust something to think about.  There's technique, and even art, to proper lifting, and it's worth pursuing.  If you do the math, you're roughly deadlifting bodyweight already, that's not too shabby--it might soon start to make a difference.\n\nProper breathing/bracing also applies (VERY much so) to doing RDLs properly, doing bent-over rows properly, and doing any sort of overhead press movement.",
            "Cutting and bulking is probably the way to go. Depending on how much fat you store on your arms, they could get smaller when you cut, but they'll get more defined. I'd say it's definition more than size that makes people think you lift.\n\nAnd then you can bulk, and your arms will grow."

Looking at the 1rms my deadlift is close to intermediate while my other three compounds are still fairly novice. I could swap the deadlift T2 (which I previously did deficit deadlifts) with front squats, so I do extra squat accessories rather than deadlifts, since I seem to be much more comfortable with DLs than my other barbell movements.

I was feeling great, lean & strong overall. Today 6/12/2024 I am weighing in around 190LBS, not as lean with about the same strength, but overall my body feels tighter, creaky & just constantly sore. My diet has not changed much but I am now eating less at 2000 calories after tracking yesterday. The only factor that has changed is how many times I weighlift a week. Last year I did PPL for 5-6 days a week, and nowadays I am doing Full Body 3x a week due to limited time with work & school. I want to loose about 5-7 LBS of body fat, but I'm not why I am not dropping weight due to my 2000 calorie diet. How do I lose that extra body fat & feel great like I used to without feeling creaky, tight and joints always cracking feeling sore?",

I need micronutrients, limited saturated fat and sugar \n\nEvery morning I usually mix together 50ml of olive oil, 500ml of milk and 100g of maltodextrin which is a little over 1000kcal total and the most that my digestion can handle comfortably. I also eat potato chips and fast food around 2-3 times a week to get some extra calories on to make up for the days where I don't get enough. \n\nIs there a healthier way to do it?

For the future i'm gonna run in the same location at the same time to standardise the process a bit.\n\nNow my question: As I continue my training (a 5k twice a week), how quickly should my times improve?

Back and Chest (2100 kg)\n\n2. Calves + Hamstring/Thighs (2400 kg)\n\n3. Biceps/Triceps (1700 kg)\n\n4. Glute + Shoulders/Traps (1300 kg)\n\n  \nSince starting the split, my arms have grown quite a bit in both mass and strength, but my legs are plateauing.

            "Hi everybody, I am a 19M, weighing at 151 pounds at 6'3. I want to bulk up this summer to about 155-160 pounds (lean bulk), but am having trouble with the macro portions of it. I am currently on a 3 day full-body workout split, and I sometimes like to intersperse runs in between, on my recovery days. \n\n  \nBased on multiple TDEE calculators, my maintenance is around 2400-2500 calories. I often hit my protein goal (0.8/lb of BW), of about 125g but most of the time I'm eating a little under or exactly at my maintenance. Am I building any muscle at this point? Obviously my scale isn't changing but I *think* I'm seeing changes in my body (leaner, more definition). Could anyone help me so that I can follow the right steps to build around 5 pounds of pure muscle? \n\n  \nThank you so much!",
            "Within a span of approximately six months I lost around 50-60lbs while focusing mainly on calories and not on macros. This helped me thin down but made me look more skinny fat. I started lifting consistently these last four months and made some pretty good (newbie) gains, still holding onto some fat. However, I\u2019m pretty sure I gave myself tennis elbow doing stupid repetitive forearm exercises in excess. I want to take 2-3 weeks off focusing on getting everything back to normal and I\u2019m wondering if I should take this time to start a cut to get rid of this fat.\n \nI guess my main concern is losing my gains while both stopping lifting and eating less/doing more cardio. Would I be good if I just met my protein macros? What would y\u2019all recommend?",

After doing some searching it seems like people don't recommend BBB while cutting because they think it's too much volume. I was thinking of running the program as I did when bulking but changing the 5x10 work on the main lifts to 3x10 in order to reduce volume.

So they're studying what happens when participants keep doing the same exercise, but change protein intake. This will include both people who train hard, and who barely train at all. It seems some studies did, and some studies did not, control for overall calorific intake while adding/removing protien. \n\nWith all that said, the overall average was a ~0.5kg LBM increase (probably because most studies are studying adding protien, not taking it away). \n\nbut in the aggregate, circumstances where folks eat <0.3 g of protien per kilo of bodyweight, per day, they saw gains of 0.38kg LBM. \n\nand in the aggregate, circumstances where folks ate >0.5g of protien per kilo of bodyweight, per day, they saw gains of 0.8kg LBM.\n\nIt's not a perfect study, but it shows what you probably already knew: If you eat less protein, you'll have less lean body mass: While training hard, while not training so hard, etc. these studies were mostly 2-8 week interventions - but I can't tell what the average length was. \n\n**TLDR**\n\nSome studies show, eating 0.3g protein per kg bw vs eating 0.5g protein per kg bw made a difference of ~0.5kg of lean body mass gained over 4-8 week interventions. That's a very rough summary of the findings -- but the takeaway is that protein intake is very significant indeed, and given the right (or wrong) circumstances, underrating protein could see you gaining less than half as much lean body mass as you would have otherwise.
