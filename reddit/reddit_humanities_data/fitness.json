            "6'1\" 18 y/o male: So I hit 200 pounds after about 2 months of bulking (from 180 pounds), and have been hitting the gym consistently, pushing myself to failure on every set after the first. I feel that I've gotten a bit bigger in the right places (and the wrong ones), so I'm thinking of starting the cut now but to be frank, even after reading the wiki, I have no idea what to do; bulking seemed easier to me as I had to eat a lot though I missed my protein goal a couple of days. I was eating about 2700-3100 calories a day (so in a 200-600 surplus, I believe). But for cutting, I hear that you have to absolutely hit your protein goal to maintain muscle mass while eating in a deficit. I can't take whey protein or anything like that, so if anyone has a good (halal) diet plan to follow, I'd be more than grateful. (If I missed one included in the wiki, don't grill me). Another question I had was what weight should I look to cut to? Is there a specific weight for a guy my height and weight to reach to cut? I'd appreciate your guys help.",
