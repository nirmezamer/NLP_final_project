            "Yes, go to your local big-box store and buy replacement door casing / door molding. The often have kits specifically designed for doors. You'll probably still need a saw (manual miter saw is fine), hammer, nails, paint, and caulk to finish the edge of the casing where it meets the wall. \n\nIf you're handy and have tools, this is easy. If not youl'll need a friend or a carepenter. \n\nGood luck"
