Every night when I get home from work, no matter how tired I am, she\u2019s ready to go. Even when I've had a long, grueling day and all I want to do is crash on the couch, she\u2019s there with that look in her eyes. \n\nAt first, it was amazing. I mean, what guy wouldn\u2019t love a girlfriend who's always in the mood, right? But now, it's too much. I can't keep up. I need a break before I collapse from exhaustion. What should I do?\"\n\nHis grandpa frowns a bit and grumpily responds, \u201cJust marry her already. That will put an end to that nonsense!\u201d",

'Most people would ask for a million dollars or something, but you'll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live!''That's right. Whether it's a gallon of milk or a Rolls Royce, the exact money is always there,' says the man.The waitress asks, 'What's with the ostrich?'The man sighs, pauses and answers, 'My second wish was for a tall chick with long legs who agrees with everything I say.'",
