At the end of our conversation he told me to wait and that he had something to talk to me about. In the conversation he told me that multiple people have come to him to complain about my relationship with one of my coworkers (I\u2019m a male and she\u2019s a female) and that our relationship could jeopardize further career advancements. \n\nWe\u2019re really close. We carpool together, we hang out together after work, and we chat in between sales calls, and we take our breaks together. All that being said, she\u2019s got a boyfriend and she\u2019s also helped me land quite a few dates. She\u2019s definitely become one of my closest friends but that\u2019s as far as it goes. Aside from us talking and spending time together, we don\u2019t do anything inappropriate. All we do in the office is talk. \n\nWe work in sales and everyone\u2019s basically after each others sales so close friendships are unusual here.

            "I was accused of having an affair with a male coworker. He's married and I was single at the time. Technically I was his supervisor but in my opinion we were more on the same level as colleagues than him being a subordinate as we were both in management positions. We worked very well together on many major projects. We were an exceptional team that did an exceptional job.\n\nIt never in a million years occurred to me that anyone would think we were anything more than great colleagues and great friends, but apparently the rumor mill ran rampant with this illustrious affair we were having, which we were not. If we had been of the same sex no one would have ever thought there was an issue.\n\nHowever, one of our colleagues became the new boss and pulled me into his office to reprimand me for being unprofessional and inappropriate with a subordinate. I was shocked to say the least and of course explained that wasn't the case. I was then forbidden to continue being friends with my colleague. He never spoke to my colleague about it.\n\nI resigned a few months later because I found another job at a really great company. I had already been looking prior to this accusation because I felt like I'd maxed out on advancement where I was. At my exit interview with HR I let them know what I was accused of and that it made it much easier for me to accept another position when offered. Wouldn't you know it they had several complaints about him already and this information was the straw that broke the camels back.\n\nThe board dismissed him from his position a few days later and I was asked to be the new director. I thanked them profusely for the opportunity but decided to move ahead with my other career opportunity. However I suggested to them that my colleague/friend would be an excellent candidate. They immediately agreed and said he was their next choice. So my friend is now the director and doing an exceptional job!\n\nThe other asshole is currently unemployed and going through a bitter divorce bc he CHEATED on his wife.

Some times it just better to ignore the childish office l politics & just move on.",

            "Honestly I think your boss has a point, he\u2019s just not making it clear what that point is.\n\nIf you and your friend are creating a cliquey atmosphere that makes others uncomfortable, he can\u2019t discipline you for it - your friendships aren\u2019t his business  - but putting a whisper in your ear that you might want to adjust it isn\u2019t unfair. The answer isn\u2019t to stop being friends, it\u2019s to make it clear you\u2019re open to widening the circle to others. Invite others to sit with you during lunch, chat with others during breaks as well\u2026\n\nI think your being of the opposite sex is immaterial. If one of you gets one too many sales leads than you can handle, are you passing it off to the other person instead of sharing it with the team? Or would your coworkers think you might be?\n\nI\u2019ve made lots of close friends of different genders at work and it\u2019s great but you have to be mindful of not looking like you\u2019re shutting others out.",
            "People are so petty. Especially jealous people. You do you. Don\u2019t listen to that unless it\u2019s in writing. If they try to write you up for being friends then you should both go elsewhere.",

She's always rude to the people that come in to the point of almost FIGHTING them, she blames her mistakes on me and our other coworker (it never works), she doesn't even give hints she just tells them the answer straight up, she leaves her trash everywhere (I once found her donut with a bite taken out of it in one of the Game Master rooms the following day just left on the computer, along with several half drunken water bottles.) She also pushes her work onto me and our other coworker, we'll call her Anna, to leave the building entirely to go shop or eat and comes back an hour later or even longer. One time she almost screwed me AND Anna over by replacing her name on the schedule with mine for a day I told her I wasn't going to cover for her, had Anna not shown that to me the day before, no one would've come in and Anna would've been alone that day.\n\nToday, when I came in to work with Anna, we saw that Penny had placed herself down for EVERY AVAILABLE SHIFT IN JULY, claiming she \"called dibs\" on it. Only two of us can work at the same time during the weekend, as this isn't a company escape room thing, which means Anna and I would only have maybe 1-2 days working at best. I've talked to my boss about it, and he said we can just put ourselves down for the days we're available and then we'll work it out for the days where it has 3 names on it, and rearrange things.\n\nI really love this job, but Penny is insufferable to be around, and Anna and I feel crazy just being around her. When Anna and I work we're basically a dream team (we even got $60 in tips from some groups that really liked us as their game master!) But when we're working with Penny, it's basically a nightmare. I'm just not entirely sure what to do about her \"calling dibs\" like this, I mean is that even a thing???",
