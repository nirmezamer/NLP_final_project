He initially said it was to \"push me to my limits, see my reaction/see if I responded well.\" He also mentioned that I was avoiding eye contact, but when I did look him in the eyes, he couldn't hold my gaze for more than two seconds...\n\nI'm 27 years old and this would be my first \"real\" job.",

            "This is very unusual. But it was already a red flag when they told you you did not seem to have confidence. Unless this was an acting job, or modeling job, sharing what they thought of your confidence level was not their concern. They were evaluating you personally.",

        "content": "For context, I (23F) work at an escape room place, so hours aren't the most consistent thing in the world, but I love this job a lot, I'd love it even more if not for this one co-worker I have, we'll called her Penny.\n\nPenny is, to say the least, terrible at this job. She's always rude to the people that come in to the point of almost FIGHTING them, she blames her mistakes on me and our other coworker (it never works), she doesn't even give hints she just tells them the answer straight up, she leaves her trash everywhere (I once found her donut with a bite taken out of it in one of the Game Master rooms the following day just left on the computer, along with several half drunken water bottles.) She also pushes her work onto me and our other coworker, we'll call her Anna, to leave the building entirely to go shop or eat and comes back an hour later or even longer. One time she almost screwed me AND Anna over by replacing her name on the schedule with mine for a day I told her I wasn't going to cover for her, had Anna not shown that to me the day before, no one would've come in and Anna would've been alone that day.\n\nToday, when I came in to work with Anna, we saw that Penny had placed herself down for EVERY AVAILABLE SHIFT IN JULY, claiming she \"called dibs\" on it. Only two of us can work at the same time during the weekend, as this isn't a company escape room thing, which means Anna and I would only have maybe 1-2 days working at best. I've talked to my boss about it, and he said we can just put ourselves down for the days we're available and then we'll work it out for the days where it has 3 names on it, and rearrange things.\n\nI really love this job, but Penny is insufferable to be around, and Anna and I feel crazy just being around her. When Anna and I work we're basically a dream team (we even got $60 in tips from some groups that really liked us as their game master!) But when we're working with Penny, it's basically a nightmare. I'm just not entirely sure what to do about her \"calling dibs\" like this, I mean is that even a thing???",

Everyone should provide their availability and manager split the shifts fairly between everyone. Any changes once the schedules gone out need to go through him - no more just changing the name. And report everytime shes causing an issue.",
            "Let Penny work a couple shifts alone.  That way she can't hide or try to fluff off the work onto others.  The fallout from angry customers will be enough to move the manager to do something.",
            "Complain to your boss about all of her bad habits and rudeness. If youve done that and boss doesnt care, suggest to your boss that you rotate each weeks schedule with a different employee having first shot at the schedule.  The order for the first week to choose is employee A, B then C; week two is B, C, then A; week 3 is C, A, then B.  Then restart with A.   Everyone gets a chance as the first, second, and third to choose.",

            "That's what I was thinking about doing too, the way we put up our schedules is basically just writing down what days we wanna work on the big whiteboard calendar in the main room, and she got to it before me and Anna could and just wrote herself down for literally every shift available. At this point I just wish she could either quit or mess up so badly she gets fired on the spot but my boss doesn't wanna lose someone so close to our haunted house season.",
            "Oh, that's another thing she does!! Some days she'll just straight up not even come in to work despite being scheduled for it. The first day I came back from vacation she didn't even show up because she was \"too far away with her boyfriend\". It's cool though, because there IS actually a day where both me and Anna can't come in to begin with, so she's just gonna have to be by herself ;)",
            "The. Its time for both of you to go talk to them together. Either they fix it or you both walk.",
            "Op start looking for a new job.  To tell you truthfully your manger is a crap manager.  They shouldnt be let you all fight over and decide the shifts.  They should be asking when you are not available and then scheduling you all accordingly to how many hours they promised or hired you for.  They should also take into account people that perform badly and scheduled them less.  But instead they are dumping the responsibility of managing on to you all.  Leave and leave now.  Because its not going anywhere I get better even with the terrible coworker gone."

Exactly what I am looking for and room for development. Perfect.\n\nI was then told that 80% of the workforce are all part of the Plymouth Brethren.  The top Directors are all family, and male.  Everyone else in that 80% are all related to each other in some way.\n\nI was told that they were all really nice people, very honest, caring and very generous and the business is very successful.\n\nI hadn't heard of this religion or group before, and so I was given a leaflet about who they are, so that I understand what the culture would be like.  I was advised not to google them. So, of course, I did - and the word 'cult' came up ALOT.  I also went on their official website, to balance the viewpoints I had read, and still had the same outcome (although, their website describes their activities in a 'nicer' way, if that makes sense!)\n\nI was told in my chat that I wouldn't be 'allowed' to sit with any 'community' members at lunchtime.  I would be classed as a 'non-community' employee.  As a general rule they don't watch TV, listen to music, go to the cinema or theatre - all of which I love doing (especially cinema and theatre). So what can I talk to my potential fellow co-workers about at the 'water cooler'?\n\nTheir views on women in the workplace, and women's places in society, were what concerned me the most.  I suppose I would probably class their views as 'outdated' when comparing it to the modern generalised view that society generally adopts.\n\nUltimately I have decided to not take the role.  I just think that I would feel awkward there, and not 'fit in', as well as on a moral stance.  After all, you spend more time at work than at home and so it has to be the right environment doesn't it.\n\nBut, I'm just wondering if anyone has worked for a company like this, and to understand their experience?",
