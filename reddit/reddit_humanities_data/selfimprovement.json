            "I have changed my personality massively due to one change. I used to be full of self hatred which caused a huge amount of other issues (body hate, thinking people can treat me however they want, taking my anger out on others, etc). The thing I did was being my own best friend. It wasnt for a lack of friends. I changed how my thoughts work (kinda). I still have some negative thoughts but now they are in one ear out the other. \n\nBeing your own best friend means treating yourself like you would (or even better) than you would a best friend. The first step was negative self talk. No more Im fat or Im so stupid. None. Then start working on your thoughts. If you have a negative thought about yourself stop and think what would I say to a friend who said this to me?. Usually you would be kind and caring and try to talk them through it. Do that for yourself. It sounds silly but stand in front of the mirror and talk to yourself. Tell yourself what you want to hear. Be nice to yourself. Go on walks, to dinner, whatever!",

I still have days where I struggle a lot but I'm making more than double what I was and have learned mild social skills to pass. A lot of shit up listen and be self reflective without reacting outwards.",
            "Meeeee, after my ex and I broke up I lowkey went a little crazy because I was really upset about EVERYTHING in my life. Started going to the gym 3-5x a week consistently, fixed a bunch of things I didn't like about myself, got a new hair style that I feel suits me very well, lost a lot of fat because I changed my diet completely, finally landed a job in my career path, and now it's been about 2 years since that and I kept consistent with the gym, still at that job, and I am and feel FAR more attractive than I used to be, so much more confident. When I go out I get a disgusting amount of compliments and my ego is lowkey inflating lmao. I'm gay for what its worth so guys are not shy to be very forward about their attraction. \n\nAnd then in the last few months I decided I wanted to do another little 180 in my life and get further, so I've been upping my gym frequency, practicing and applying for new jobs so that I can make more money and move to Manhattan, and I made a new circle of gay friends since I never had any gay friends before and I've been going out with them multiple times a week. Got a few guys that I'm somewhat seeing too. So yeah everything is going very well, it's really difficult to get a new job right now and that's the biggest struggle for me currently, but it's VERY much possible to change your life. It just takes time and consistency and consistent action. If you just keep going at it, it will happen.",
