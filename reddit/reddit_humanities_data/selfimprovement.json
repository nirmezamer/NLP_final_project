Surround yourself with supportive people who uplift you, and don\u2019t hesitate to seek professional help if you need it.

            "Hey! It's understandable that in this stage of your life things seem hard and unbearable. Try to forgive yourself for what happened and start with zero. \n\nThat''s the prerequisite for improvement. If you keep carrying the guilt and shame with you, it will keep dragging you down. \n\nWhen I was in a similar situation I surrendered and faced the fears I was running away from. I promised myself to use the anger and disappointment as fuel to become the person I'd love to fall in love with.\n\nI suggest you take 3 situations in your life, that really matter to you. Materialize them by writing down what exactly it is. For example for me it was always meaningful relationships, health and career. \n\nI wrote down my vision how I want to end up there with a couple of milestones within a year. This year I wanted to increase my weight again from 61 to 66kg. I wrote down how much kcal intake I need everyday. I created a diverse mealplan and finally started to work on it everyday. \n\nEssentially I broke down the goal in tiny, manageable pieces so that I didn\u02cbt have an excuse for not executing. \n\nWhen you make those tiny microwins everyday, you start to feel alive again. We need progress. Visible progress. At the end of the day confidence is not a finish line. It\u02cbs a state and it has to be maintained. \n\nWish you good luck with you project, champ!\n\nK",

Its a symptom of something larger; a subconscious pattern that is reoccurring within you. \n\nTake and make the time to invest in yourself so you value yourself. Actively invest in yourself and gain self awareness. Don't let others determine your value and do not compare yourself to others!\n\nAlso therapy may help.",
            "The same actions and environment will beget the same emotions and beliefs. To start to break out you have to change something concrete in your life, anything really. Really examine your life, zoom out to see the big stuff, and name specifically what you don\u2019t like. See what you can change. And hate to say it, but the feelings will change when action and environment change. It took me a long time, but I finally have figured out that you just have to ignore the feelings. Also, it sounds like you might be under  perceived or real pressure from someone else to achieve a certain something in life. Remind yourself that 99.9% of us will be six feet under and forgotten in only about 50 years, so let go of the pressure to not \u201cfail\u201d in life.

            "You have to retrain your brain. You\u2019re not your thoughts. You\u2019re not your emotions. You\u2019re not your nervous system. You\u2019re not the stories you tell yourself. The past is in the past. Any self-defeating feelings you experience in the present is conditioning from the past. You can carry your emotions, thoughts, and memories in the present, AND still choose to be better \u2014 nobody tells you that shit, but you can. It\u2019s not that you ignore them, it\u2019s that you choose to not let them define you.\n\nYou have to start small. Just 2-minutes of self-compassion a day can start you off. Check out Kristin Neff\u2019s work. She has some great guided meditations on her website that are free. Take the self-compassion test now, and then re-take it in a couple of weeks after consistent practice. Promise yourself. Out of all the shit you have going on in your life & how shitty you feel, promise yourself to try 2-minutes of self-compassion a day. Do that every day. You may have to be relentless. Just do it. \n\nThen, once you have some self-compassion onboard, you can begin looking at what you believe about yourself \u2014 self-love, self-esteem, resentment, needs, values, beliefs, etc.. What are the narratives and stories you tell yourself \u2014 what stories do you tell other people? Do you love yourself? How do you respect yourself? Are you in integrity with your gifts? All the shit that conflicts with these questions are unconscious programs that run on autopilot to keep your mind contained to what you know \u2014 your mind does not want to change because that\u2019s scary. Fear will arise. Just know, all of that is content from the past.  Create space to these narratives \u2014 mindfulness, doing something creative, physical activity, socialize, go after a small goal \u2014 combine all of these into 1 day, then repeat every day. String enough of these days together & you\u2019re in a totally new headspace. You\u2019ll have to revisit the new beliefs in yourself continuously until they\u2019re embedded into your subconscious \u2014 so be ready for high reps.\n\nThen, work on your soft skills and technical skills. You have to develop these to be competitive in the workplace. Don\u2019t overdo it. Don\u2019t fake it until you make it. Just slowly develop both fronts. From there- focus on the areas of life that bring you deep joy and happiness. Money doesn\u2019t matter for that trailhead, just drift in that direction and continue making progress because you enjoy the act of it, not because you have goals or want to get somewhere.\n\nYou can do this. Anybody can. All it takes is willingness and consistency. Good luck.",

It's going to be hard, but I can tell you are going to not only make it but come out stronger than you ever have before from this period. \n\nA loser wouldn't post this if they weren't truly looking to make a permanent, long-lasting change. You need some direction to truly love yourself, becoming your most vocal advocate and best friend. \n\nDon't let anyone or anything not make you feel good enough. You need to define who you are and never bend or allow others to change that because you have those values set in a solid foundation. \n\nI believe in you op. You got this!",

I would literally drown out the negative thoughts by listening to green noise and practicing meditation. Over time the bad thoughts became a mere whisper and are pretty much nonexistent unless I let myself go THERE. Start by writing down something you're grateful for even if it's just one thing everyday. Doesn't have to be anything major.. Might just be grateful you got out of bed today. Slowly challenge yourself to think of 2 things.... Then 4 things.. Build up to 4 things daily. Add to this task of positive thinking by listing 2 things you're looking forward to; or 2 things you like about yourself.... Set a small goal for the week such as making a phone call you've been putting off or completing a task you've been procrastinating on. Write a thank you note of appreciation to someone you're grateful for. I promise it will get better.. Then we both can be POSITIVE losers. Lmfao. Jk..... Kinda. \ud83d\ude05"

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI (28M) wanted to share something deeply personal that I've been grappling with for a long time. I've never had a relationship, and being single has become my identity.\n\nEvery time the \"opportunity for a relationship\" has arisen, I\u2019ve ended up sabotaging it, overwhelmed by the excitement and relief of potentially being freed from the curse of being single. Reflecting on it now, I realize that this drive was fueled by a subconscious identity shaped by societal expectations and the pressure from my family. Like every New Year's Eve, my family would tell me, \"Next year will be your year. Next year you'll have someone to kiss at midnight.\" These well-intentioned comments have had a lasting impact, making me view women not just as individuals but as potential solutions to fill the emptiness I felt inside.\n\nThis mindset made every interaction with women daunting because, in the back of my mind, there was always this hope that the person I was talking to might be the one to fill that void. It distorted my perception of what a relationship should be and put immense pressure on every conversation. After years of \"trying,\" I gave up on trying to find love.\n\nA year ago, I had a reality check that made me realize how deep this issue ran. I met someone who showed genuine interest in me, and for the first time, I felt truly seen and appreciated. This confused the fuck out of me initially since I had such a low image of myself that I thought there was no way this person could be interested in me. This person validated my feelings and showed her interest by actions, like texting me first and asking me to hang out. This was truly the happiest period of my life, and the closest I've ever been to a relationship. But as things progressed, my underlying insecurities and desperate need for validation overwhelmed me, and I ended up pushing them away. This felt like a cruel joke played on me by the universe to tell me that I'm capable of finding love, but not as the person who I am right now.\n\nThis painful experience was a wake-up call, making me confront the unhealthy patterns and deep-seated fears that had been driving my actions. The impact of this reality check was profound. It made me doubt everything about myself, revealing that my self-perception was not only unhealthy but had bled into my entire personality. My insecurities made me feel so small that I created a prison in my own mind, full of self-imposed rules that made no sense. This realization triggered a domino effect of further realizations, making things feel even worse than before. It was as if the foundation I had built my identity on was crumbling, forcing me to confront painful truths about myself.\n\nI've come to understand that this approach is unhealthy and has prevented me from forming genuine connections. I'm working on changing this perspective, focusing on seeing people as they are, without attaching my self-worth to the possibility of a relationship. But this feels impossible since what I'm trying to do is change 28-year-old negative thought patterns. I'm trying to build a healthier self-identity that isn't reliant on others, but on my own intrinsic value and actions.\n\nHas anyone else experienced something similar? How did you work through these feelings and start forming healthier relationships? I\u2019d love to hear your stories and advice.\n\nThanks for reading. ",

            "Yeah, I've experienced something similar. When push came to shove, I lost every bit of confidence I had in myself and as a result that showed and I sabotaged what could've have been something special. At the same time, the issues that I had which was largely just poor self esteem would've showed if we did end up being in a relationship and I would've hurt her even more. So I decided to not pursue it and right now I'm going through the motions and trying to rebuild my confidence and self esteem in myself. My advice would be just that, learn to love and accept who you are. Improve yourself in a way you see fit and that also improves your self image. Maybe everything else falls into place, maybe not. But at the end of the day, you have only yourself and time passes regardless so use that to make small improvements every day, put all that effort that you would on someone else in you and one fine day when she does come along, you can be happy that you deserve to be with her and she you. Don't time pressure yourself to find someone because that'll drag you down even more.",

I hope you find someone who will ride those waves with you. It\u2019s rewarding when you have happy healthy moments after periods of struggle and get to reap the rewards of your hard work together.",

I was able to quit smoking, drop what i thought was a weed addiction cold turkey, and gained a couple pounds of muscle in the gym practically overnight. But i realised i wasn't doing those things for myself, but for her. It's not that i didn't want to change FOR her, i just think she deserves someone who is strong enough to do it for themselves.",

What also doesn't help is that I'm a massive people pleaser to the point that i think that most things that i \"enjoy\" are just things i started doing to impress others. I don't know what i should do to make myself happy. I don't even know what person i want to be. I even feel like my kind and helpful nature are just projections of my desire to be loved and accepted by others. I feel like my entire selfworth has been based on my usefulness for others. I've acknowledged my deep desire to be validated by external sources, but i see that desire return in so many thought patterns. Like when i want to text someone it's not that I'm curious about how this person is doing, it's that i feel lonely and want to talk to people to feel better. And i know that when I'm feeling this way that I'll inevitably talk about the struggles I've been dealing with, and i don't want to burden these people again who already have spent so much time to assist me. So then I don't text them. Which also makes me feel guilty.",

My partner did this to me and decided he was too hard to love when in my mind, loving him was the easiest thing I\u2019d ever done.

            "Honestly when you really love someone, they aren\u2019t a burden no matter whether they come with emotional baggage or not! \n\nDon\u2019t forget to ask yourself how you feel about the person you look to be in a relationship with too, when the opportunity arises. It isn\u2019t a nice feeling as a woman to feel like you\u2019re just the person who decided they would be able to work with the emotional baggage. It feels amazing to know that your partner chose you because of how they feel about you \u263a\ufe0f just some food for thought for your next relationship. Don\u2019t be afraid to be vulnerable. I hope you find your best friend. \u263a\ufe0f",
            "I guess I'm kind of making the decision for them by deciding to not pursue anything because i expect them to reject me because of my flaws. I guess that just comes from experience from when i was younger. I've shared my insecurities in the past, and I've been rejected, ghosted and publicly ridiculed by the people I've shared these things with. That's why i gave up at some point. And i feel like the same thing happened again last year to some extent."
