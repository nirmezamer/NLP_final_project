        "content": "Hello all!  We have added 3 new flairs, for Failed Expectations, Surprisingly Met Expectations, and Exceeded Expectations.\n\nThere have been some users confused in the past, because they didn\u2019t realize that you are allowed to post expectations/realities that were not failures.  Additionally, it can be hard to tell in some posts if the OP was happy with their result or unhappy with it. Now you can select a flare if you would like to denote which category your expectation versus reality falls into.\n\nThanks to u/xitg1 who came up with this suggestion.",
