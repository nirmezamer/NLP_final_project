            "I've got two pairs of Sony 7506 headphones I use for recording and mixing. I really like the way they sound, I think the honest sound is helpful for mixing, but I feel like they might be lacking on bass? They never give a booming sound. When I turn on my bigger studio monitors, the bass sounds completely different than what I was hearing with the 7506s.\n\nWhat should I trust more? I know the 7506s are the 'truest' headphones, but am I the only one that feels like the bass response is lacking? Should I trust my 7506s, my studio monitors, or should I mix somewhere in-between the two?\n\n  \nThanks!",
            "i bought a pair of LG tone FP5 less than a year ago and i am having some quite annoying issues.\n\nAs of now my right earbud is working pretty bad, when i connect the device to my phone/pc only the left bud works, the right one is completely disconnected and doesnt even do the \"blip\" sound when you put it in your ear, as if it's completely turned off. at random if i put it back in and out it reconnects, works for 10 seconds then disconnect again. Sometimes it even goes mad and it's suddenly the left one not working instead of the right? (but still, mainly the right one is not working)\n\ni downloaded the app, lg tone free, and it says the earbud is literally disconnected.\n\nsometimes when it \"works\" if i put it back into the custody it should turn off and music should only exit from the left earbud but for some reason it stays on and you can hear music coming out of its charger box, as if it was still in my ear.\n\ni tried polishing the electrodes and i tried to do factory reset multiple times but i don't know why it keeps having this problem. anyone has a fix to try?\n\nconsidering i had these less than a year and considering how much they cost i can't reccommend them as a product to buy\n\nedit: i should also mention that it keeps saying the battery is very low but even staying inside it's box all day it doesn't charge. there was this one time where if put inside the box it showed \"right bud battery at 45%\" and the moment i removed it it dropped to 15%, starting to scream \"battery is very low, please charge now\"",

            "Need Help Finding/Designing a Headband Reinforcement for AKG K371BT Headphones\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI'm hoping someone in the headphone community can help me with a DIY repair project. I have a pair of AKG K371BT headphones that I love, but they have a known design flaw where the headband can easily crack or break at the joint (see attached image with measurements).\n\nI'm looking for ideas on how to reinforce this weak point to prevent further damage. I've considered using a metal strip or U-clamp, but I'm having trouble finding one with the right dimensions (0.5 cm thickness, 1.5 cm width, 3 cm length).\n\nHas anyone else encountered this issue and found a solution? Any suggestions for materials, designs, or where I might find a suitable clamp would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

            "Hey guys, I have purchased a Moondrop Chu 2 from a shopee vendor around 2 months ago and yesterday I noticed that the left ear was a bit quieter than the right one and then I tried to fix it from windows left right audio balance settings and used them to play games, but after a few hours i noticed it had gotten even worse to the point i had to make the left ear 2x louder in settings to match the right one, and if I use it with my phone it is very noticeable since I dont know how to make just one side louder than the other and frankly I dont want to have to do that for all my devices, I've checked the filter and it wasnt clogged at all. What should i do?\n\n\nThanks in advance",

            "Version 2 of my semi-modular desktop and under-desk mount for the popular Fiio K7 and the Fiio BTA30 pro.  \n  \nJust so you know, this is still a work in progress. Most of these parts need to be refined or will continue to be refined, but they function as intended.  \n  \nYou can download the files [here](https://www.printables.com/model/919666-fiio-k7-mount-stand-v2-semi-modular-desktop-and-un) to print them out for those interested!  \n  \nThis package provides a semi-modular system for both under-desk and desktop use.  \n  \nThis package contains:  \n- Fiio K7 enclosure, with an additional storage section  \n- Desktop stand  \n-under desk mount (with a slide-n-lock system)  \n- storage drawers (2 versions for different methods of insertion)  \n- headphone/ headband rest  \n- BTA30 / BTA30 pro mount/ bracket  \n  \nThe enclosure (V2) can be used in isolation or with various attachments.  \n  \nThe front and rear are left exposed, with a side grill for access and heat dissipation.  \n  \nThe circular design feature enables headphones to clamp and rest on the enclosure. It is measured to work with most headphones (Hifiman Sundara, for example). Of course, this is optional.  \n  \nI have designed this to enable others to remix, customise, or design their attachments.  \n  \nFeedback, specifically from those who have used/ tested the design, would be much appreciated!",

I'm still using Resolve's EQ profile to this day, it woeks so well I never really bothered tweaking anything else unlike most other headphones in my collection. \n\nThere's something that feels so complete or simply \"right\" about this package that makes it my go to when I just want to have fun listening to music on my DAP around the flat. \n\nIt's got good treble extension without ever coming across as being sibilant. Good extension in the sub bass while being surprisingly punchy for a planar. The technical performance is just right, enough so that I don't feel like I'm missing anything in the mix (and then some!). The overall frequency response is balanced across the board such that no particular range is overly emphasized or muted. With Resolve's EQ, it has this ever so mild V-shape quality to it, with just a bit of mid to sub bass bump and a touch of treble sparkle that I feel benefits most genres, particularly stuff that uses percussion heavily, like metal. \n\nIt may not have the same imaging precision / separation ability of my HD800, or the soap-bubble popping timbre of the HD6XX/HD600, but I find myself enjoying this pair time and time again without fail when all I want to do is listen to music.
