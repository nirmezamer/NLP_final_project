            "Just got a pair of wireless Back Bay Firstclass 70 ear buds because I've been wanting to go wireless. I've tried a number of times in the past but, but ever time I do I cannot get them to sound like my wires Zero Audio Carbo Tenore headphones, I just love the way the make my music sound.\n\nIs there any way I can make my new headphones sound like my old ones? I downloaded an EQ app but I'm not sure how to get an accurate sound. Any help is appreciated!",

A week later, I receive them, nothing has been fixed, it still has the same issue, the left side is still not working. I asked what was wrong with them/what they fixed when they said they were shipping them back to me, never got an email back. So I\u2019ve just emailed them asking them like \u201cwhat the heck yanno?\u201d But I\u2019m curious if my amp could maybe be an issue with the left side not working? I am not sure though",

Apple dongle...no, thanks, it is a pain on android, and also with  UAPP it is very poor volume on my kph30i through pixel 7.",

Recently ended up with a sennheiser HD660s2, trying to A-B the stack and the nano, I dont seem to notice a difference in the noise floor/audio quality, is there still a benefit running it off the stack?",
