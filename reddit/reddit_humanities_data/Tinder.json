It used to be the case where I would meet someone every four weeks, but nowadays I do not get any likes or engaging matches. \n\nAny tips would be awesome, I'm losing a lot of self confidence and I've dramatically changed my bio not long ago.",

            "Big music gig in my city this week and had quite a few tourist matches here for it and tagging on a holiday looking for someone local to show them round. \n\nHad a video call Saturday night with T, 24. Fit American girl here for the gig. Agreed Sunday to go to the beach. Picked her up at 12 with a picnic and went to the beach which was super nice. She was confident and had a banging body, dark hair and great smile. Looked awesome in a bikini. We had fun at the beach and then came back and went to a few pubs. Back to mine for really good sex, she left that night at like 2am. \n\nWent again Monday evening with J, 26, polish. Also here for the event. Took her to a few spots in town for aperol, wine and small plates. Blonde with a nice body though not as fit as T. Went back to her hotel for sex, she was a bit of a freak and I stayed over, ordered room service breakfast. \n\nShame there aren\u2019t more of these events!!",
            "So everytime I hook up with someone, they always text me \u201cHey can you send me $40 for (whatever)? It\u2019s an emergency\u201d the next day. It\u2019s three in the row for me now. Is this normal for these days?",
            "What is the most polite thing to do when someone sends you an opening line that while not offensive is so awkward and weird its an immediate no?",
            "how are we answering \u201cwhy are you still single?\u201d these days?",
            "Jesus tinder has gone to 3 super likes a week I remember 5 every 12 hours",
            "Hey folks,, recently matched a very cute lady. The only thing written in her bio was \"looking for a bull\". My opening msg was \"The summer really brings out your glow. Was the sun trying too hard to match your radiance?\". Nothing explicit. She unmatched without reply. what should be ideal opening in such cases? Let me know.",
            "That's been Tinder since the first time I ever used it nearly three years ago. Easily half of my matches were scammers of one flavor or another.\n\nFIX MY CAR GAS MICHAEL",

            "\"Because I haven't met you yet\"",

Really nothing interesting.\n\nAnd my patience was running thin because I was sitting in my car ready to head to the restaurant."
