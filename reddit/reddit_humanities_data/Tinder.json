If I super liked someone over a week ago and sent them a message, and they are now appearing in my swipes again, that means they did not swipe one way or the other on me, correct? Because if they swiped left, they would not appear for me again? And would the message I sent be gone if I liked them again?",

            "me, as living in Bielefeld, Germany was for a 1-day holiday trip  in Hengelo/Netherlands and Enschede/NL, so 150km away. Still in the maximum possible search radius of 161km.\n\nI used the Tinder app on my smartphone, having \"roaming\" Internet access.\n\nBut I got same profile suggestions as in Bielefelds, so not 161km radius with Hengelo or Enschede as center point. I was able to detect this by the distances \"from home\" if a place of living next to Bielefeld was mentioned.\n\nSo how does the location detection work, with Tinder?\n\nDoes Tinder tell the profile owner where the profile is located, by some means?",
