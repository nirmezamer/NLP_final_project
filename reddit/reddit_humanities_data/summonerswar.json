        "content": "Welcome to the WAT, summoner! Post questions regarding team composition, content progression, game mechanics, or anything else in this thread. If you are able to help your fellow summoners, please take some time to contribute to the community and answer some questions yourself as well!\n\nA lot of helpful guides and resources can be found in the [subreddit mega wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerswar/wiki/index).\n\nPlease also make sure to check out [our **FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerswar/wiki/faq).\n\n---\n\n### If you ask a question please give ALL relevant information!\n\n- **Your monster box:** Upload a screenshot to [Reddit directly](https://reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/10516331142932) or an image hosting site like [imgur](https://imgur.com/) or use [swarfarm](https://swarfarm.com/). Sort your box by \"Grade\" and try to include all 4\\*s and LD nat 3\\*s.\n- **Your current progression:** Where you currently are in the game, what your teams are, what content you need help with and what you have tried so far.\n- **For ToA**, which enemies are on the floor you're stuck on.\n- **For PvP**, indicate what rank you are trying to achieve, i.e. currently F3 want to get C1 Arena. For RTA also share your rank percentage.\n\nThe less people have to ask you to clarify or look up to help you, the more likely you will get a (fast) response.\n\n---\n\n### Beginner friendly/farmable PvE teams\n\n- **GB10:** Vero (L), (2A) Kro, Shannon, Belladeon, Darion or Vero (L), Fran, Loren, (2A) Kro, Shannon/Lapis\n- **GB12:** Vero (L), (2A) Kro, Shannon, Belladeon, Darion or Vero (L), Fran, Loren, 2A Kro, Shannon/Lapis/Akhamamir/Sigmarus\n- **DB12:** Verde (L), Vero, Loren, 2A Spectra, Fran/2A Raoq\n- **PB12:** Verde (L), (2A) Belladeon, 2A Raoq, 2A Kro, 2A Kahli/Riley/Eirgar (L -> R -> Boss)\n- **SB12:** Fran, Loren, 2A Kro, 2A Raoq, Ling Ling\n- **NB12:** Fran + 4 multihit DDs: Pick from Icaru/Raoq/Kro, Kung Fu Girls, Loren, twins (Shaina, Sabrina, Talia), Abigail, Scarlett (unawakened)\n- **SRB12:** Verde (L), Shaina, Sieq, Astar, 2A Raoq\n- **ToA(H):** Fran (L), Vero (also possible L), 2A Spectra, Mav, + Loren/Shannon/Mellia/Tyron\n- **R5 solo teams:** [Check this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerswar/comments/yvar55/solo_r5_teams_fast_safe_teams_and_safeish_yolo/)\n- R5 stat minimum: You need 25k HP and 1.5k DEF for FL units and 20k HP and 0.8-1k DEF for BL units. Healers and your cleanser should have 100% RES after lead.\n- **Rift unit options:** Xiao Lin, Theomars, Fran, Colleen, and 2A Kro can be used in most of your rift teams. FL Mav/Bernard is good for Water rift and Lapis is good for Fire and Dark rifts. Twins are great in all rifts.\n\n**You still need appropriate rune quality and turn order!** Do not expect to beat a dungeon just by having these units.\n\n---\n\n### Common speed teams\n\n- **R5 solo teams:** [Check this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerswar/comments/yvar55/solo_r5_teams_fast_safe_teams_and_safeish_yolo/). If you pick a BJ5 version, also make sure to read [this BJ5 guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerswar/comments/fijvmo/the_last_bjr5_guide_you_will_ever_need/)\n- **GB12:** Teshar (L), Luna, Prilea, Shamann, Konamiya\n- **DB12:** Shaina (L), Julie, Kyle, Liam, Konamiya\n- **NB12:** Abigail (L), 2A Icaru, 2A Raoq, Astar, 2A Shamann\n- **PB12:** Eirgar (L), 2A Raoq, 2A Icaru, 2A Kro, Fuco\n- **SB12:** 2A Sath, Mellia, Mellia, 2A Tatu, dot unit/Lushen\n- **SRB12:** Verde (L), Shaina, Sieq, Astar, 2A Raoq\n\n---\n\n### PvE accuracy requirements\n\n|Accuracy|Area(s)|\n|:-:|:-:|\n|0%|Rifts|\n|15%|R5, Predator|\n|25%|SB10, PB10|\n|35%|GB12, NB12, SRB10, Dimensional Hole|\n|45%|ToA(H)|\n|55%|GB10, NB10, ToA Hell|\n|65%|DB12, DB10|\n\n---\n\n### General tips and answers to Frequently Asked Questions:\n\n- **NEVER feed non-farmable monsters!** (you can feed dupes for skill ups)\n- **Save your devilmons!** In general you do not want to give devilmon to 4\\* units, Sigmarus and Jeanne are the best early game candidates. Veromos does not need devilmon.\n- **Best summon stone targets:** Tyron, Lushen, Shaina, Sabrina, Talia. For PvP Khmun, Skogul, Galleon.\n- Check the **events** for free energy, mana, and other beneficial stuff. To find the current event pages use the button below the energy/mana counter in-game.\n- **Lapis** can farm Faimon Hell on the free 6\\* level 15 vampire/revenge runes provided by the challenges. She should be your first 5\\* and probably 6\\* as well.\n- **Shield sets** can reduce the HP/DEF requirements on other units and multiple shield sets will stack to form one larger total shield. Each set contributes a shield equal to 15% of the base HP of the monster they are equipped on.\n- **White artifacts** from B2 are cheap to upgrade and can give you a massive stat boost early.\n- **Hall of Heroes (HoH)** should be attempted as high as you can climb. Reps like Rica or Verad can help a lot. Mid/late game players can get 5 extra copies of the HoH monster using almighty scroll pieces after each floor at the small cost of 2000 guild points for each extra monster.\n- Most nat 5\\*s are PvP exclusive and should be set aside in storage till you make some progress on PvE. Some exceptions are CC units like Rica for ToA, cleansers like Anavel for starter R5, and Perna for rifts.\n- Dimensional hole energy should be spent as soon as possible, always try to stay under the energy cap (recharge rate: 1 per 2h). 2A Kro first, then Spectra or Raoq.\n- Need advice on RTA? [Check this post first](https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerswar/comments/tvz48a/guide_hi_dat_what_team_should_i_use_for_rta/)\n- Looking for ToA Hell guidance? Take a look at [this FAQ post](https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerswar/comments/z3grz2/toa_hell_faqs/).\n- [Mock Battle Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerswar/comments/14famx7/summoners_war_mock_battle_134_updated/)\n\n### Tools you should know about\n\n- **Swarfarm** provides a [bestiary](https://swarfarm.com/bestiary/) for monster stats and [data logs](https://swarfarm.com/bestiary/dungeons/).\n- **[SWGT](https://swgt.io)** provides various tools, statistics and analytics for players and guilds. Siege/Guild Battle, Labyrinth, Leaderboards, Defenses/Counters, Artifact Monster Finder, Speed Tick Calculators, Gem/Grind Optimizers and more!\n- **[SWOP](https://tool.swop.one/)** is a rune optimizer and speed tuning tool.\n- **[sw-tools.net](https://sw-tools.net)** provides a speed tuning tool and other calculators.\n\n---\n\nIf you see someone using monster icons, you can learn how to use them yourself: https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerswar/wiki/icons .\n\nTo set your user flair please visit the Reddit website (do not use the mobile app) and edit it there ([example picture](https://imgur.com/a/GUcMbf8)).",
