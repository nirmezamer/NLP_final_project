I don't get ANY Jimin creative direction at all. He barely got to dance, and dance is his LIFE.",

Hopefully this makes the experience better.\u00a0",

        "content": "There's been a lot of talk lately about how often certain groups are posted about in this sub. I've grown tired of the back and forth, so I decided to go through and collect some data.\n\nThe following are the 10 most talked about groups over the last 22 days (as far as reddit would allow me to go back).\n\nThe post content is broken down into three categories\n\nPositive - Overall tone of post is positive toward the group in question. This includes defense posts against negativity  \nNeutral - No opinion is stated about the group, but the post is about them OR there is an even mix of critical and positive commentary in the post  \nNegative - Overall tone is negative\n\nTo be eligible, the post must be about a group, a member of a group, or the fandom. No more than 2 different groups can be mentioned in the post to be considered. If the post mentions 3 or more groups, I have not included it as I consider that to be a general post about kpop at that point. Comment section is not considered at all.\n\nBTS: 25 posts  \nPositive: 15  \nNeutral: 5  \nNegative: 5\n\nBlackpink: 24 posts  \nPositive: 11  \nNeutral: 7  \nNegative: 6\n\nTwice: 12 posts  \nPositive: 5  \nNeutral: 3  \nNegative: 4\n\nNew Jeans: 12 posts  \nPositive: 8  \nNeutral: 1  \nNegative: 3\n\nLe Sserafim: 11 posts  \nPositive: 8  \nNeutral: 3  \nNegative: 0\n\nAespa: 8 posts  \nPositive: 4  \nNeutral: 2  \nNegative: 2\n\nBabyMonster: 6 posts  \nPositive: 0  \nNeutral: 1  \nNegative: 5\n\nStray Kids: 5 posts  \nPositive: 3  \nNeutral: 0  \nNegative: 2\n\nTXT: 5 Posts  \nPositive: 2  \nNeutral: 2  \nNegative: 1\n\nIllit: 5 Posts  \nPositive: 2  \nNeutral: 1  \nNegative: 2\n\nSome context: Keep in mind that this is just for the last 22 days. Groups having comebacks or notable events will skew numbers. Some notable events were The MHJ/HYBE drama (LSF, Illit, New Jeans), and Jin returning from the military (BTS). The comebacks from Nayeon (Twice) and Aespa made up the majority of their posts in their categories as well.\n\nIf I had collected data from 2 months ago, this list would likely look vastly different.",

            " that's cool, thanks for doing this! it's a shame that doing the same with the comments would be too hard; because a post on itself being positive or not doesn't reflect much on the overall sub since a positive post can have 1k negative comments on it (with hundreds of upvotes) and vice-versa",
            "Thank you for compiling this data op! I\u2019m curious what it would look like for other months considering how many posts are reactive. For example this month bts has Jimin and rm solo releases, Jim being discharged from the military and being dragged into the hybe vs mhj drama which could be why we\u2019ve seen so many bts posts this months (more than what feels like usual I suppose). Compared to last month where we had drama surrounding coachella and the met gala, the continuing hybe vs mhj saga, illit\u2019s debut etc. and July which is going to be packed with releases I wonder how the data would change! It\u2019s fascinating to see considering how many groups people say are picked on to see what the post breakdown actually looks like!",
            "Some more fun data:\n\n57 groups/soloists in total had at least 1 post about them\n\nHYBE was the most talked about company with 9 posts about them, not counting individual posts about sublabels. If sublabels were included, the total would be 16 posts. The next highest label outside of HYBE was SM with 4 posts.",

            "Doesn\u2019t this just confirm there\u2019s in fact been comparatively more positive posts for BTS on this sub than negative/neutral posts, compared to other groups? \n\nSeveral people have talked about it but the numbers laid out like this only seem to confirm it don\u2019t they?",
