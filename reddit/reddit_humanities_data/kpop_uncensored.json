Only now I'm realizing that that's an option lol, previously I only did it if they were harassing me or something like that but the way reddit works, it makes sense, like in Twitter you only have to unfollow someone to stop seeing their posts but on reddit blocking is the only way really if they are active in a sub you frequent. Hopefully this makes the experience better.",
            "it shouldnt be that serious but i can only laugh seeing kiss of life being defended for the same type of choreo that had le sserafim lambasted with thousands of likes accusing them of biting off of tyla and calling them trend chasers. not even that big of a fan of them but people literally called that this would happen as soon as another gg did the same thing",

        "content": "There's been a lot of talk lately about how often certain groups are posted about in this sub. I've grown tired of the back and forth, so I decided to go through and collect some data.\n\nThe following are the 10 most talked about groups over the last 22 days (as far as reddit would allow me to go back).\n\nThe post content is broken down into three categories\n\nPositive - Overall tone of post is positive toward the group in question. This includes defense posts against negativity  \nNeutral - No opinion is stated about the group, but the post is about them OR there is an even mix of critical and positive commentary in the post  \nNegative - Overall tone is negative\n\nTo be eligible, the post must be about a group, a member of a group, or the fandom. No more than 2 different groups can be mentioned in the post to be considered. If the post mentions 3 or more groups, I have not included it as I consider that to be a general post about kpop at that point. Comment section is not considered at all.\n\nBTS: 25 posts  \nPositive: 15  \nNeutral: 5  \nNegative: 5\n\nBlackpink: 24 posts  \nPositive: 11  \nNeutral: 7  \nNegative: 6\n\nTwice: 12 posts  \nPositive: 5  \nNeutral: 3  \nNegative: 4\n\nNew Jeans: 12 posts  \nPositive: 8  \nNeutral: 1  \nNegative: 3\n\nLe Sserafim: 11 posts  \nPositive: 8  \nNeutral: 3  \nNegative: 0\n\nAespa: 8 posts  \nPositive: 4  \nNeutral: 2  \nNegative: 2\n\nBabyMonster: 6 posts  \nPositive: 0  \nNeutral: 1  \nNegative: 5\n\nStray Kids: 5 posts  \nPositive: 3  \nNeutral: 0  \nNegative: 2\n\nTXT: 5 Posts  \nPositive: 2  \nNeutral: 2  \nNegative: 1\n\nIllit: 5 Posts  \nPositive: 2  \nNeutral: 1  \nNegative: 2\n\nSome context: Keep in mind that this is just for the last 22 days. Groups having comebacks or notable events will skew numbers. Some notable events were The MHJ/HYBE drama (LSF, Illit, New Jeans), and Jin returning from the military (BTS). The comebacks from Nayeon (Twice) and Aespa made up the majority of their posts in their categories as well.\n\nIf I had collected data from 2 months ago, this list would likely look vastly different.",

            " that's cool, thanks for doing this! it's a shame that doing the same with the comments would be too hard; because a post on itself being positive or not doesn't reflect much on the overall sub since a positive post can have 1k negative comments on it (with hundreds of upvotes) and vice-versa",
            "We need breakdowns of what is negative or neutral.\n\nI downvote the repeated Blackpink threads recently because they're very repetitive, not because of anything related to Blackpink.",
            "I feel like the reception of a positive post is the biggest indicator though.\n\nAnd that definitely skews certain ways depending on the group.",
            "Thank you for compiling this data op! Im curious what it would look like for other months considering how many posts are reactive. For example this month bts has Jimin and rm solo releases, Jim being discharged from the military and being dragged into the hybe vs mhj drama which could be why weve seen so many bts posts this months (more than what feels like usual I suppose). Compared to last month where we had drama surrounding coachella and the met gala, the continuing hybe vs mhj saga, illits debut etc. and July which is going to be packed with releases I wonder how the data would change! Its fascinating to see considering how many groups people say are picked on to see what the post breakdown actually looks like!",
            "Do the positive posts include anti-negative posts (posts defending Le Sserafim from negative comments, for example) or are those considered neutral?",
            "Reddit never beating the anti-babymonster allegations i see\nThank u op, I love seeing the numbers. As expected, the more popular the group, the more they are talked about on this sub, both negatively and positively.",
            "Too small a sample size but interesting post. Thanks.",
            "Drawing any conclusions from data like this is extremely questionable at best given that post count in such a short time could easily be swayed by a single fan/anti and more importantly, the lack of links to posts (though this is somewhat understandable because its a pain in the ass) to assess given that it is a subjective evaluation being used to discuss bias. \n\nAs a quick and easy change, Id suggest removing any entries that are sitting at 0 upvotes - a positive thread, filled with positive comments and 95% upvoted is pretty much the opposite of a positive thread sitting at 0 (negative) upvotes and mostly comments disagreeing. It would likely knock off a sizable chunk of threads, but less data is infinitely preferable to dirty data.",
            "Doesnt this just confirm theres in fact been comparatively more positive posts for BTS on this sub than negative/neutral posts, compared to other groups? \n\nSeveral people have talked about it but the numbers laid out like this only seem to confirm it dont they?",
            "there's no way there was more positive post about newjeans than negative, also not a single negative about le sserafim?? One reason I kinda stop coming here was the overwhelming negativity towards newjeans and le sserafim. So it's kinda weird to see. But i guess what you mentioned about only being last 22 days might have to do with it."
