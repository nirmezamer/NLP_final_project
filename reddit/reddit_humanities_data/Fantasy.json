We have a new topic addressing intersectionality on June 20, and I've had a couple of people reach out to me to add to the prize pool!

            "There's a wholesome answer that every series has its audience.\n\nBut you should skip Swrd of Truth. Terry Goodkind doesn't deserve to steal anyone else's time",
            "Name of the wind. \nThe book is fantastic, and the second is great but nearly 20 years later there's no realistic hope of the third book. So the series is dead.",
            "Ready Player 2",
            "The Demon Cycle series by Peter V Brett. \n\nFantastic initial concept, with some great action at times, completely mired by a lot of incredibly troubling content and themes. \n\nThere isn't a single major female character that isn't sexually abused in one way or another. They're nearly all entirely defined by their sexual needs and desires and motivated by their rapes and abuse.\n\nThere's a really problematic Arabic inspired society. It is very caricaturish and features a lot of rape, particularly of little boys. \n\nEven outside of these issues, the series gets consistently worse as it goes on. \n\nIt sets up like it's going to be action packed, but becomes more chqracter driven. Which wouldn't be so bad if the characters were well written and defined. There's constant, baffling directions some of the characters take like the main character Arlen deciding to speak in a heavily accented dialect from book 3 onwards. \n\nThe flashbacks of books 2, 3 and 4 all tell the same story from different perspectives, with very little to no added interesting moments or details. \n\nThe final book and sequence felt like the author didn't really know how to end the series. It was like a poorly thought out video game sequence, with different levels and every new chapter had a new baddy to defeat with a new technique.",
            "Be wary of r/fantasy recs as well. People here tend to recommend a lot of more niche fantasy and character driven prose heavy reads, which are definitely very good but at the end of the day you should make the decision yourself based on whether a book seems interesting to you.\n\nThat being said please avoid Fourth Wing it is just pure garbage. It\u2019s not even entertaining garbage, or even guilty pleasure garbage. It\u2019s just bad in every aspect from beginning to end",
            "I usually have positive things to say about the Mage Errant series, but you'd probably hate the MC, even though he gets better after the first book - social anxiety, and also childhood trauma. Strong willpower though, and he overcomes a lot with the help of true friends, but it's particularly bad in the first book (also for reasons I can't reveal due to spoilers).   \nIt's a shame, but if you hate existing in such a character's headspace, it would ruin it for you.\n\nAs for me, I hate all the tropes that have to do with unnecessary lewdness and insertion of sex into the narrative and dynamics. I'm not against romance, but everything that has to do with an author's fetishes grosses me out immediately - you can usually tell because the energy and quality shifts into what you'd expect from porn (and that's basically what's happening: the author was just horny).",
            "i think it\u2019s funny that nobody is giving actual anti-recommendations based off what you said, they\u2019re just saying series they didn\u2019t like lol. i\u2019m not sure exactly what you mean by self doubting but rand from WoT is very angsty especially from like book 3-12. kell from shades of magic can be a bit on the angsty side as well.\n\nas far as tropes i don\u2019t like, i\u2019m not a big fan of the like super badass soldier guy who kills everyone. sometimes it can be cool, but other times it just becomes unrealistic and starts to be funny at best and annoying at worst for me personally. logen nine-fingers is an example i thought was done pretty well but guts from berserk (an otherwise well written character imo) just annoys me.",
            "In your case I would skip Farseer Trilogy by Robin Hobb,",
            "I agree about The Poppy War \n\nI might get some down votes for this but if you read one or two Discworld books and the humor doesn't get you, then you should skip the entire thing. If it doesn't make you laugh, it's a slog.\n\nI've read all the big series and I honestly suggest people skip The Wheel of Time. It's just too long. There are huge stretches where essentially nothing happens. Such a shame because the world building is great. It would have been a magnificent 6 book series"
