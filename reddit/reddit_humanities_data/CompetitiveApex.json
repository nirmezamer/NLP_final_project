        "content": "**Apex Legends World Rankings - Year 4 Split 2 Week 4**\n\nCHECK OUT OUR WEBSITE TO SEE INDIVIDUAL BALLOTS:\u00a0[KPPoll.com](https://www.kppoll.com/)\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThis is the KP Poll! These Power Rankings are a collaborative effort between the Subreddit, Discord, and the greater community. Rankings are determined by a selective panel consisting of members of both communities, as well as notable talent and creators from the scene.\n\n**How it Works**\n\nThis ranking is based on the AP Top 25 rankings common for collegiate sports in the US. Every panelist is given a ballot to submit their personal ranking of the top 25 teams. Similar to Apex, the higher a team is placed on a ballot the more points they earn. A #1 spot on the ballot gets that team 25 points, with each subsequent place receiving one less point all the way down. The points totals are then tallied up across all ballots to get our consensus Top 25. Teams that received votes, but not enough to break into the threshold will be included as honorable mentions.\n\nIt is by design that there are not strict guidelines panelists on how to rank teams. However, emphasis is put on the global nature of this ranking. Every panelist is asked to consider what these teams would look like in a LAN environment right now, and what are their chances of getting there. This is because at LAN there are only so many spots for the larger regions. Not every strong team can qualify, meaning some teams in larger regions may be absent from this list in favor of teams from the smaller regions that are on pace to qualify for LAN.\n\n**World Top 25 Ranking**\n\n[Y4S2W4 Power Rankings](https://preview.redd.it/zaflkeaujb9d1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=786445de3102c6d64ef1c4eb789c866feab91524)\n\n**Others receiving votes:**\u00a0GHS Professional (76), Weibo Gaming (66), Pioneers (63), SaWeiQi esport (55), Not Moist (52), XNY (48), GoNext Esports (47), Cloud9 (42), NORTHEPTION (31), F/A Kids (31), Aurora Gaming (29), Riddle (22), Blacklist International (21), Danish (17), Flat (12), Las Vegas Inferno (12), Oblivion (6), Disguised (5), cybercats (4), Weave (4), CCE UCX (3), Atlas (3), FLUFFY AIMERS (3), EXO Clan (3), VortexWolf (3), Enter Force.36 (2), HAO (2), Dragons Esports (2), Kinotrope Gaming (2), EVOS PREDATOR (1), and Reignite (1).\n\n**Thank you to our Liquipedia editors, Reddit Moderators, and community panelists this week:**\n\nThis week's voters: Arioly, AyAyRon, Bereft, BerryManly, BurkeTheNerd, Cutty, Davidisinthere, Epoch, Exohexoh, gandalf45435, GhettoDanny, Hokuboku, JevvyMedia, jurornumbereight, KalaColor, Karbasher, Krusade, MachuMichu, PalkiaOW, Raileyx, Sh00k, Tobric, TONYPIKACHU, Vivarus, warriorc4jc, Zorkmead\n\n**Special thanks to:**\n\nHugo from ApexLegendsStatus, Tom from Esportsgg",

            "In your ranking they dropped one spot. I think most of those teams in that middle 15 did kinda meh and they balanced eachother out in a sense",
            "for me ssg is at the very top of the (A) tier of teams, in a finals lobby i would expect them to reach MP but not to win over the teams i put above them",
            "No, I don't think I will",
            "you would think, though, that people who were overranking them would drop them more"

I want to watch my favorite team play more and even though one match can last 25 minutes and there are only 6 matches one weekend, the team I'm rooting for might die early 3 out of 6 matches. If you root for a team in group C and let's just say they average 10-15 minutes play time, you have watched your favorite team for 40-55 minutes and now you have to wait a whole week or two before you can watch them again.   \n  \nLAN there are no pov's if I'm not mistaken, so maybe I get to watch my team for like total of 5-10 minutes and only during fights? I'm no expert but to me that seems very little, I get that there are multiple regions and teams, maybe a few tournaments nobody takes seriously outside of it but yeah I just wish I could watch my team compete more than they currently do.\n\nFrom June 1st to July 5th  \nMatches group A: 5   \nMatches group C: 4  \nMatches group B: 5  \n\n\nI just would like a discussion, am I silly for wanting more?\n\n",

            "Nothing wrong with the amount of matches in a split but there's so much downtime between LANs and the next splits",
            "Honestly the scene just needs more tournaments to fill the ALGS gaps. I agree that you really only get to watch a team in a handful of match days per year, if you don't include scrims.\n\nI personally want to also see Pro League teams going up against more non-PL teams as well. The EWC qualifier was great at setting that up, and we saw some PL teams underperform when not in a comfortable, pre-planned lobby.",
            "There needs to be more LAN's if anything, its hard because you require so many teams to run a LAN, but maybe there could be regional lans as well? 20 teams? not sure how you would format.",
            "The pro league prize money is nearly not worth it to play extra games. If you win the league it's 20k and there's an org cut as well. They scrim all week, vod review, train. I don't think that's enough compensation. But yeah if the esport is bigger in terms of money I'm sure there'd be more games. The break between championship and the next split is so long typically which is annoying.",
            "What we need is more lower tiered competitions. There used to be mid week tournaments before but they've been replaced pretty much by scrims which are not as much fun.\n\nIt all comes down to money in the end.",
            "No. \n\nAdding more match days unfairly benefits signed players > unsigned players because some players even on teams in LAN contention have full time jobs + ALGS does not make money. Prod costs money and Respawn wouldn\u2019t half ass match days with bad observation and broadcasting because it\u2019s not good for advertising ALGS nor the game.",
            "Sounds like a you problem",
            "Each split has 10 sets (9 days + regionals), 6 games each set including regional finals which has a minimum of 6 games, that's at least 60 games over the span of two months, there are more than enough games, the only teams who would benefit from even more games are the mediocre teams on the edge who could make LAN if they theoretically had more games to play and did well, I'm not one for awarding mediocrity in competitive play",
            "Nah, 6 matches is boring. I'm always down for more.",
            "Good idea, but logistics makes it hard. They could do what Japan does with their Apex Festival. Also, they could hold a LAN in each region, except for SA. But again, total costs would probably not be worth it for EA/respawn."
