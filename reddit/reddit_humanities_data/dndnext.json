            "Hey. I'm a new dm and I'm a bit confused about what Challenge Rating of monsters I should be giving my players. I have a group of 5 at lv6,so could someone advise me on what I should be looking at for a challenging encounter?So far I've just used the campaign book,but I feel they are outleveling the encounters in the book.",
            "How do artificer tools and their proficiencies work exactly? I'm about to introduce my artificer into one of my \\[5e\\] campaigns, and, since I know artificers tend to be harder characters to play, I've been reading up on the traits, and some are proving to be confusing. Any help would be appreciated.\n\n1. When making a check or ability roll that involves tools, when would you not have tool that you're proficient in? I'm thinking about \\*Right Tool for the Job\\*, or having to choose a specific artisan tool set for \\*Tool Proficiency\\* (and in my character build, \\*Artisan's Intuition\\* as well). Since you already have Thieves' Tools and Tinkerer's Tools (and Alchemist's Tools), why would there be a need for any others? Don't those cover every need? If I don't have proficency in Weaver's Tools, for example, can't I just use Tinkerer's Tools instead, and it'd do the same thing?\n2. I am a Mark of Making Human. Do those bonuses stack with the artificer ones? For example, could I use the Artificer's \\*Tool Proficiency\\* (+3), and the Mark of Making's \\*Artisan's Intuition\\* (+d4) to give myself a (+3 +d4) to an alchemy roll?\n\nThank you for your explanations.",

            "First read the rules for building encounters in the DMG or Basic Rules, then use an encounter builder like [kobold fight club](https://koboldplus.club/#/encounter-builder) to help you browse options and do the math. Keep in mind that CR is helpful to establishing a benchmark but it should just be the starting point in encounter design, there are lot of factors that it or any other simple to use tool can't account for. There can be a lot of variance between individual PC builds, party composition, and player competence, so once you get a sense of what the rules say is a \"deadly\" fight actually means for how much it challenges your players you're going to be grading them on a curve. The system is also designed with the idea that the PCs are going to be getting into multiple fights in a full adventuring day (the daily XP threshold gives a rough sense of what \"full\" means) with a couple of short rests in between fights, so if you're running fewer fights between long rests then the party is going to be able to hit above their weight class and certain classes are going to be performing better than others.",
            "The CR system is not a perfect science. Ideally, a 4 person party of level x should find a monster of challenge rating x a \"challenging\" encounter. This doesn't take into account any kind of magical items the party may have that they can use to their advantage.\n\nIn practice I've found this is almost never the case especially when you consider action economy. One monster of a challenge rating a few numbers higher against a party of 4 will see the party of 4 win 9 times out of 10 purely because it's 4 turns against 1 turn.  \n\nYou have an extra player which skews things even more in their favour. Bump up the enemy's health, throw in an extra low CR minion or two.\n\nHowever, some monsters like Shadows or Intellect Devourers punch well above their weight for their challenge rating and a single one could wipe your party if the dice gods deem it so. In time, as you get more experience, you'll just naturally learn what will work and what won't.\n\nYou can use Kobold Fight Club or DND Beyond's Encounter Builder to get a decent indication into an encounter's difficulty. Although I've found that even \"Deadly\" encounters can often be steamrolled by the PCs.",
            "Any one of a number of online calculators can help with the official Challenge Rating math crunching.  Kobold Fight Club\u2019s license has  been picked up by Kobold Plus who has added some new options. https://koboldplus.club/#/encounter-builder )\n\nbut remember that despite \u201cusing math\", the CR system is way more of an art than a science. \n* read the descriptions of what each level of difficulty means, dont just go by the name. (ie \u201c **Deadly**. A deadly encounter could be lethal for one or more player characters. Survival often requires good tactics and quick thinking, and the party risks defeat.\u201d)\n* while the CR math attempts to account for the number of beings on each side, the further away from 3-5 on each side you get, the less accurate the maths are, at \u201cexponential\u201d rate. Read up on \u201cthe action economy\u201d \u2013 particularly now that expansions like Tasha\u2019s are making it so that every PC almost universally gets an Action AND a Bonus Action each and every turn, and can often also count on getting a Reaction nearly every round. Most monsters dont have meaningful Bonus Actions or any Reactions other than possible Opportunity attacks.\n\t* **Dont do party vs solo monster** \u2013 while Legendary Actions can help, \u201cthe boss\u201d should always have friends with them. Or you will need to severely hack the standard 5e monster design constraints and statblocks. (tell your party you are doing this so that the increase in challenge comes from the increase in challenge and not from you as DM secretly changing the rules without telling the other players the rules have been changed, because that is just a dick move, not a challenge.)\n* The system is based on the presumption that PCs will be facing 6 to 8 encounters between long rests, with 1 or 2 short rests in between. Unless you are doing a dungeon crawl, that is not how most sessions for most tables actually play out \u2013 at most tables, the \u201clong rest\u201d classes are able to \u201cgo NOVA\u201d every combat, not having to worry about conserving resources, so if you are only going to have a couple of encounters between long rests, you will want them to be in the Hard or Deadly range, if you want combat to be \u201ca challenge\u201d \u2013 but keep in mind sometimes you might just want a change of pace at the table and get some chucking of dice or letting your players feel like curbstomping badasses and so the combat doesnt NEED to be \"challenging\" to be \u201crelevant\u201d.\n* Some of the monsters\u2019 official CR ratings are WAY off (Shadows, I am looking at you), so even if the math part were totally accurate, garbage in garbage out.\n\t*  as a sub point \u2013 creatures that can change the action economy are always a gamble \u2013 if the monster can remove a PC from the action economy (paralyze, banishment,  \u201crun away\u201d fear effects) or bring in more creatures (summon 3 crocodiles, dominate/confuse a player into attacking their party)  - the combats where these types of effects go off effectively will be VERY much harder than  in combats where they don\u2019t\n* not all parties are the same \u2013 a party of a Forge Cleric, Paladin and Barbarian will have very different \u201ceasy successes\u201d and \u201cdifficult challenges\u201d than a party of a Sorcerer, Rogue and Wizard.\n* Magic items the party has will almost certainly boost the party\u2019s capability to handle tougher encounters.(a monster's CR is based in large part on its AC and \"to hit\" - if your players have +1 weapons, they are effectively lowering the monster's AC and if your players have +1 armor, they are effectively lowering the monsters' \"to hit\". If your players are mostly kitted with +1 weapons and +1 armor, you probably should consider monsters one lower than their listed CR. Not to mention all the impact that utility magic items can bring!)\n\nApproaching the problem by tossing out the bad default CR system and replacing it with Trekiros - Game Changer\u2019s complex mathing that is probably more representative from both the player and monster side https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8FNVkFuhXI\n\nand a point based alternative in development from Mike Mearls, the original designer who has taken a mea culpa for the faults of the original 5e CR system. https://www.enworld.org/threads/fixing-challenge-rating.702118/ \n \nalthough a quick in your head approach from Sly Flourish works just as well most of the time if you roughly account for the caveats above: https: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05VWofhNMHI",

You have proficiencies in particular types of tool--Mason's Tool Proficiency doesn't mean you'll have proficiency in Thieves Tools, and vice versa.

An extra 11 from another weapon attack if the bonus action triggers.\n\n\n**At lv 10, now 20 strength, 3 rage damage, 3d6 frenzy, with brutal strike and retaliation added**: 4d6 + 16 (weapon attacks w/ rage) + 3d6 (frenzy) + 4 (GWM) + 1d10 (brutal strike) + 2d6 + 8 + 3d6 (off turn retaliation attack w/ rage and frenzy bonus) =  75.5 avg if all attacks hit.\n\n Add another more damage with bonus action attack.\n\nThat's every turn with no resource but a rage usage, No need for allies to boost you up with bless or anything, No need to ever turn great weapon Master off because you're facing the boss and their armor class is too high. Just consistent damage, with no accuracy penalties, **All while knocking people prone, pushing them around 10-30 feet at at a time, leaving into multiple enemies, we're doing automatic damage even if you miss. You have advantage on two out of three of your attacks each turn because you forego advantage once to do brutal strike. \n\n\nI have not factored in pole arm master to get the guaranteed bonus action attack or feats like charger to get an additional 1d8 damage each turn either. This also is not factoring in magical weapons, which will easily add another 6 to 9 damage per turn. ",

            "I\u2019ve been saying the same thing since seeing the release\u2014I never thought I\u2019d actually *want* to play a berserker. They also get so many more rage uses.\n\nYou\u2019re just mentioning the offense, but they\u2019re also nuts defensive too, especially with the improved dex save advantage, 0HP revive bringing you back to 2x your barb level in health,  and all the utility from brutal strikes. Do a bajillion damage and take a bajillion damage, sounds amazing\u2026honestly might even be better than fighters",
            "Yeah that's true. One of the worst subclasses to one of the best.",
            "I\u2019m glad they did change it, berserker was THE barbarian fantasy class, I\u2019m glad it\u2019s mechanics reflect that now",
            "Wow, I didn't notice Frenzy added per-turn.\n\nThat's actually pretty weird in an edition that _removed_ it from Sneak Attack. huh.",
            "Do we have confirmation that GWM will be a feat in 5.5? I didn't think the list of 70ish were available yet.",
            "If I remember correctly, Frenzy only adds damage when you are recklessly attacking. Which you can only do during your turn, unless they changed that as well.",
            ">Now it adds a number of d6s equal to your rage damage modifier to your attack once per turn (not round). At level 3 that is 2d6, At level 9 that's 3d6, and at level 16 that's 4d6. \n\nRogue: What am I, chopped liver?",
            "\u201cIf all attacks hit\u201d is like assessing spells if creatures never passed their saving throws. Factor in hit averages and you\u2019ll see that whopping 75.5 damage go down a lot.",
            "Good I framing hope so!  When they only thing you do is damage, and you're paying for it with melee range, you had better be able to deal more *of* it than anyone else.   That's always been the fantasy of Barbarian but gameplay has not really delivered on it so far in 5e."
