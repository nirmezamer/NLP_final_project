It's not a bad cantrip, you just shouldn't take it, because wasting one of your limited cantrip slots on an effect that can be easily replicated nonmagically is bad. You have too little cantrips to justify it. Maybe at higher levels or on characters with a lot of cantrips it's good but never at 1st level.\n\nEDIT: Ok I admit, you can't have a free hand with a torch. I still think other cantrips are way better, but Light does have some use.",

            "Casting Hex/Hunter's Mark is a scam unless you get it as a pure martial character. I always see them getting hyped up but every time I've cast them in a real game, it felt like I could have just cast another concentration spell that does something actually useful.",

            "If you are ever planning on taking a feat during your character's career, always take it as early as possible.\n\nYour character just has less features in general at early levels, so the feat is a higher percentage increase in the number of features when taken early. Going for an ASI is a negligible difference while actually playing the game, and it can be saved for later when you already have a million other features. When asked the question ASI or feat at level 4, I will always suggest a feat.",
            "Heavy armor master feat is better than a +2 to con for most frontline martial classes. \n\nIf you can use heavy armor and dont need to boost your concentration saves, then HAM is going to be way better than increasing con. Most attacks from monsters deal nonmagical b/p/s damage. So if you get hit more times in a fight than your level divided by 3 (e.g. a level 9 fighter being hit 3 times) then HAM will save more HP than you wouldve gained from that con boost. Plus, you save the healing resources you wouldve spent to heal those HP. Plus you get a +1 to Strength! Its my new favorite feat",

            "> \"Once you use this feat, you cant use it again until you complete a Short Rest, a Long Rest, or roll for Initiative.\"\n\nThis is such an excessively long way to avoid saying \"Once per encounter.\" It's so silly lmao.",
            "While I do get it it does suck that Invocations still can only be changed on level up. It depends on what they look like in general but it is good that they don't have the \"use warlock spell slot to use this\" ruling in place anymore, with exceptions (Eldritch Smite was name dropped so that might be one of them) to blunt the blow a bit.\n\nWhat I don't like however is repeatable Invocations. The idea of having two of the same Agonizing Blast apply to two different cantrips is really shitty. Sure you get more Invocations in general but again, *how* many more is the question. What was wrong with applying one to all? Just seems really resource draining as is. Again that depends on what the Invocations end up looking like. Who knows maybe Agonizing Blast can only apply to *one* roll of Eldritch Blast and that's how it was balanced.",
