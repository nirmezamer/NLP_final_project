Which elections are you watching the most closely?\n\nWith the debate scheduled for tonight this seemed like a good time to have a political topic for our weekly chat thread.\n\nThis is a focused chat on a Phoenix-related topic that comes up fairly often but maybe hasn\u2019t had a single place to discuss. The idea for these came up while putting together the questions for a demographic survey of subreddit users.\n\nWe want this to be a discussion for locals/regulars, **so comments from people who do not have a regular post history in this subreddit may be screened out.** You can disagree with people on topics but personal attacks will not be tolerated. Report them to the Moderators and we will deal with it.\n\nIf you have ideas for other discussion topics, message the mods.",

            "We need to keep as many County Supervisors and the current Recorder, Stephen Richter in office. They fought so hard against the election fraud nonsense. I've seen signs for conservative candidates running for Recorder that say \"secure the election\". The election WAS secure you idiot!",
            "I predict that the elections will run exactly as they have in previous years- regardless of the results, they will be accurate and well run.",
            "It will be same as last time. It won\u2019t be determined until the mail-in ballots are all counted. That\u2019ll turn the tide in Biden\u2019s favor and Republicans will say it\u2019s rigged because they lost and it took more than one day to count all the mail-ins.",
            "Let\u2019s hope all politicians and people are fined for everyday their signs are up after Election Day. \n\nImagine the brain rot to think having someone\u2019s name in your yard or blocking intersections will do anything.",
            "Kari will lose and act like a child again.",
            "I just want Kari Lake to lose again so she will finally move to Florida.",
            "Listen man, I just want Rachel Mitchell to lose.",
            "You know something will go at least slightly haywire. We live in a large spread out metro area. Plus most likely will be a heavy turn out.\nThen if doesn't go as some want it to they have already set the state for rigged and stolen.",
            "It seems that despite ousting the Democrat Recorder, the Republicans failed to get a crook in office, so the election will probably go normally, accounting for the armed intimidators who will no doubt show up in some places and cries of cheating that will occur in any area where Republicans don't win.",
            "100% there will be election deniers.\n\nPossibly dumbass rednecks at the polls with guns? Or is voter intimidation no longer a thing?"

            "Yup, my corgi does this.",
            "Yeah he's old and I think he likes the warmth on his arthritic bones.",

            "Yep! My 11 year old Great Dane spends the entire day in our backyard in the sand pit sun bathing. He\u2019ll come inside for 5-10 minutes, drink some water and lay on his futon and then go right back out. Baffles me because it\u2019s so freakin hot but he\u2019s on his last legs so who am I to question if he\u2019s happy out there."
