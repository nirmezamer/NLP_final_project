            "APS email promo/offer for free thermostat. I just tried to take advantage of this offer for a free thermostat, a $150 value for the model I like. Just wanted to share for anyone who is considering the offer: 1) it's through APS marketplace which does not use the same login credentials as APS dot com but you don't have to register to get the thermostat, Marketplace will use your address to confirm you are an APS customer, 2) you have to agree to be part of the Cool Rewards program to actually get the full rebate, 3) if you join Cool Rewards and get the thermostat the terms and conditions say you can cancel Cool Rewards by sending an email requesting the cancellation. I did not go through with the transaction. \n\nDoes anyone have experience with this offer they can share? Is being a Cool Rewards member worth it? For anyone who cancelled Cool Rewards, was it as easy as sending an email request? Thank you in advance and stay cool!",

You get the annual reward, and they're great about notification before an event. I usually get a text, email, and a little pop-up on my thermostat. Super easy to opt out of an event. I try not to overdo and stay true to the program, but if I'm not or just doing something where I don't want to deal with the extra heat, I just opt out.\u00a0"
