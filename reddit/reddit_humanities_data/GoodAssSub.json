We got a snippet of Love Me the Most (The only snippet that had Ye vocals). \n\n- The other choices were City Underground (only Ty) and Aperol Spritz (Ty and mystery artist). \n\n- Ye is most likely having a show in Korea in August. \n\n- Ty and Ye are both in Paris. \n\n- Ty has a show Saturday in a club again and theres a chance that Ye might show up.\n\n-  Aus (The guy doing all the creative stuff for the shows) visited multiple stadium in Japan, Korea and Taiwan. \n\n- Aus and Ty linked up with Westside Gunn. \n\n- We Love You is an unheard Vultures track. \n\n- Ye and Ty performed Carnival in Tokyo during a Wrestling event called Wangmania. \n\n- Saint Leon invited a basketball player (Wemby) to a \"Vultures party\" this weekend. might be a reference to the club event Ty has planned where Ye might go or a private listening party like ones months ago. \n\n- Not Inclusive was brought back to Vultures 2. The version of this song we \"heard\" recently was AI.\n\n- Star Time is also brought back but with a different name. \n\n- Ty did an interview with Billboard and said the Vultures 1 rollout was \"fucking perfect\".\n\n- He also states that the album could drop any day but the interview is from May 16th. \n\n- As of May 16th, Vultures was still a trilogy. \n\nhave a good day everyone!!
