The offer was $70k and I accepted without negotiating. Obviously a bad move I should've at least asked for 75k\n\n\n\nSalary range for the position was listed 62,000 - 158,000 + eligible stock + bonus\n\n  \nI just got my first paycheck after being one the team for 2 weeks and I am just sitting here wishing it was more obviously. While I did technically get a 25% base salary raise and was expecting one around \\~15%, I feel like an idiot for not even asking. We have all seen the Developers starting salaries on here well over 6 figs. \n\n  \nHiring manager said there was over 1000 applicants for the position. I was internal and also had a clearance needed that I should've used for bargaining power. This is a huge company that is fringe top 5 in tech not technically FAANG but very large not really known for the crazy salaries though. ",

Both companies are government contractors (tech), company two is a small start up with about 10 people.\n\nOffer 1 (software engineering): 145k, no sign on. Better benefits, will sponsor a full scope polygraph (currently only have a CI). 10 minute drive.\n\nOffer 2 (software engineering-esque): 150k, 5k sign on bonus. Benefits are okay. 30-40 minute drive.\n\nI am 100% ready to walk away from offer 2 and keep offer 1. I countered offer 2 asking for $170k-$180k due to better benefits and the poly sponsor from company 1, but I am now wondering if I countered too high. Just trying to get some thoughts.\n\nI currently have 4 years of experience and it\u2019s in the MD area.\n\nThank you!",

            "Thank you for such a detailed response, I appreciate it!",
            "This is the answer. In big tech the value of the benefits is given so you have the picture of Total Compensation.",
            "My thoughts:\n\n-$5k sign-on bonus seems pretty small, and in the grand scheme of things, relatively insignificant\n-$5k higher salary isn't enough in my opinion for the increased commute time\n-Better benefits make a huge difference in your overall compensation. Maybe see if you can find out what the dollar equivalent of each company's benefits packages are and see if that makes offer 1 actually a higher overall compensation package than offer 2.\n-My job offer experience has been that the company will ask what your compensation requirements are upfront, and they tell you whether or not it's within the range of the requisition. Typically, a counter of maybe $5k above the original amount you give them has a pretty good chance of being accepted. But if your counter is rather large (which yours is), it pretty quickly turns them off, regardless of benefits differences between it and another offer.\n-With offer 2 being a small startup, you can likely expect yearly raises to be larger than at a big defense contractor. However, the chances of being laid off are also higher, so there is a significant risk difference between the two.\n-Also, if you're asking for the higher salary largely based on the differences in benefits and the poly screening, consider that this suggests you'd have to pay more out of your pocket for health-care related things and the poly you want, which could put you in the same place, net.\n\nI would personally lean towards offer 1, especially considering the commute difference. But I also have a family, and if you don't, you might be more willing to take the risk.\n\nWith only 4 years of experience so far, you have plenty of time to grow into higher salary grades, especially if you're a high performer. It may be slower with offer 1, but the opportunity is certainly there. Example: I have about 7.5 years of experience (2 companies so far, full time at both, plus internship at the first company) and a master's degree. I started at $67k in 2017, moved to another company in 2018 making $82k, and now make over $114k because of my performance over the years. $47k jump over about 7 years ain't too shabby, and I'm sure you could get something around that in the same amount of time."
