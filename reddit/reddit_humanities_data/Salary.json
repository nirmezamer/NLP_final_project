Both companies are government contractors (tech), company two is a small start up with about 10 people.\n\nOffer 1 (software engineering): 145k, no sign on. Better benefits, will sponsor a full scope polygraph (currently only have a CI). 10 minute drive.\n\nOffer 2 (software engineering-esque): 150k, 5k sign on bonus. Benefits are okay. 30-40 minute drive.\n\nI am 100% ready to walk away from offer 2 and keep offer 1. I countered offer 2 asking for $170k-$180k due to better benefits and the poly sponsor from company 1, but I am now wondering if I countered too high. Just trying to get some thoughts.\n\nI currently have 4 years of experience and it\u2019s in the MD area.\n\nThank you!",

            "Personally I\u2019d take 1. That drive. Fuck that",
            "My thoughts:\n\n-$5k sign-on bonus seems pretty small, and in the grand scheme of things, relatively insignificant\n-$5k higher salary isn't enough in my opinion for the increased commute time\n-Better benefits make a huge difference in your overall compensation. Maybe see if you can find out what the dollar equivalent of each company's benefits packages are and see if that makes offer 1 actually a higher overall compensation package than offer 2.\n-My job offer experience has been that the company will ask what your compensation requirements are upfront, and they tell you whether or not it's within the range of the requisition. Typically, a counter of maybe $5k above the original amount you give them has a pretty good chance of being accepted. But if your counter is rather large (which yours is), it pretty quickly turns them off, regardless of benefits differences between it and another offer.\n-With offer 2 being a small startup, you can likely expect yearly raises to be larger than at a big defense contractor. However, the chances of being laid off are also higher, so there is a significant risk difference between the two.\n-Also, if you're asking for the higher salary largely based on the differences in benefits and the poly screening, consider that this suggests you'd have to pay more out of your pocket for health-care related things and the poly you want, which could put you in the same place, net.\n\nI would personally lean towards offer 1, especially considering the commute difference. But I also have a family, and if you don't, you might be more willing to take the risk.\n\nWith only 4 years of experience so far, you have plenty of time to grow into higher salary grades, especially if you're a high performer. It may be slower with offer 1, but the opportunity is certainly there. Example: I have about 7.5 years of experience (2 companies so far, full time at both, plus internship at the first company) and a master's degree. I started at $67k in 2017, moved to another company in 2018 making $82k, and now make over $114k because of my performance over the years. $47k jump over about 7 years ain't too shabby, and I'm sure you could get something around that in the same amount of time.",
            "As someone who has consistently driven 35-70 minutes for work, so option 1. If option 2 accepts the counter, consider it but remember that your day commuting only is as good as traffic. \n\nMy drive home from work now is 1hr+. There was an accident today and made it almost 3 hours.",
            "Seems like a good counter if your leaning towards option 1 anyway",
            "Negotiate with first offer too",
            "10 minute drive all freaking day.",
            "Pretty easy to do the math here.  Assuming it\u2019s 40 hours a week that means job 1  pays $72.5 an hour.  The drive adds about 1.67 hours a week so pay comes out to be $66.92 of you factor that in.\n\nJob 2 comes out to be $62.93/hour.  That also doesn\u2019t account for whatever the health benefits are, the extra gas, or the extra wear and tear on your car.  It\u2019s a no brainer in favor of  job 1 at the current offer.  \n\nThe second job would be $73.42/hour if you got the $175k.  Again you would need to figure out how much the health benefits could potentially save and how much the gas would be with the MPG your car gets.  You also have to factor in if that extra money is worth the extra 4.2 hours of commute a week",
