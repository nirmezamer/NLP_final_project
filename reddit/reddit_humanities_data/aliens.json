Feel free to subscribe if you want these updates direct to your inbox every week. I also have a pretty useful[Disclosure Timeline](https://www.disclosurediaries.com/timeline/)that elaborates on how we got to where we are today in the discourse.\n\nI started putting these resources together for my own friends/fam who may not be as well versed in the space (yet), but need a verifiable repository of information to start getting their feet wet. Especially as this topic becomes more mainstream, I think it's going to be super important to get a broader audience up to speed as quickly as possible (*without overwhelming them with BS/personal theories*). That's why my site focusses on the 100% verifiable and credible side of things.\n\nI hope you find this update useful, and I really do my best to keep it to the relevant facts/updates only.
