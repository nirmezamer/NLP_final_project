        "content": "Hey friends,\n\nthis year will mark my 5 year anniversary of music production and I somehow lost all joy in music production. I've been constantly producing and doing stuff just to keep the grind up but lately it just burned me out. This year was somewhat stressful alltogether. Lots of travelling and school. Now I need to find a new job as well so I don't really find time. I am somewhat afraid I burnt out my last bit of enjoyment. YouTube is full of \"How to make it in the music industry\" content which puts even more pressure on me. I also feel like I am not really progressing at all as well. I am stuck with the same problems for a while now.\n\nHas anyone burnt out from production before?\nHow did you deal with it? Has it returned?",

            "Hell, I took 19 years off. don't stress about it. music should be about creation and fun. when it becomes too much just step away, the project files will still be there.",
            "Yes, it\u2019s a constant ebb and flow. \n\nThe best advice I have for you is to remove all output pressure or expectation you\u2019ve placed on music and the creative process. You don\u2019t need to finish songs, make money or gain social recognition. You literally just want to focus on having fun making music. It\u2019s called play for a reason. :)",
            "Yeah - it'll come back in 6-12 months",
            "I believe what you are experiencing is pretty common among musicians/producers. We need some time off periodically.\n\nIt goes in and out like a wave. I think it's normal. It will come back, dont force it.",
            "Definitely! Haven\u2019t touched music in 2 weeks now. Not thinking about coming back anytime soon (1 month?) but i had this before and when i come back\u2026 i come back hard (in my mind)",
            "I\u2019ve quit music production for good ten times or so since the late 90s. The longest break was 2 years. At that point I really was convinced that I will never see a DAW again. Well\u2026 the creative itch just came back and I loved it again.",
            "Absolutely. Don't force it, you will get there in time. It tends to mean something else is occupying that creative space for now. I felt like I couldn't write for a long time, then suddenly, I was happy in my home space, life was stable, and I started writing again.\n\nA little cheat which may help is doing some remixes of old tracks, see if you pick up a spark from that - but again, don't rush yourself, you are enough as you are.",
            "I have a connection with making my music that's linked to happiness. Was jamming every day on my DAWless setup, up until my wife asked for a divorce. Not turned the gear on since April 2022.",
            "I had it most of my adult life but yeah it\u2019s lost the magic for me for about a year",
            "I don't lose the joy of creation, but I sometimes lose the volition to create. Like right now I'm in the middle of taking care of my farm/homestead as it's full blown summer and it is a full time job. I've also took on a business venture involving some of my farm, so I am usually very busy in the spring/summer months. \n\nI still make an effort to create, it's just that I get exhausted with other chores and work that it zaps my creativity. During this down time, I try to get into maybe a plug in or technique I'm unfamiliar with. A lot of times this spring boards me into creativity."

        "content": "I saw PL at EForest last week and I\u2019m pretty sure the last 30 mins had more sound coming from the speakers than I\u2019ve ever heard. No joke, I was 15ft away from the main stack and my vision was blurring every time the bass hit a truly brain melting amount of sound. \n\nAnyways, my question is, how does he pack in that much sound? While my ears were ringing a little bit after, it wasn\u2019t nearly as bad as a noisy mix over bad speakers that wouldn\u2019t come close to blurring my vision. It honestly sounded like the most amount of sound packed under the limiter than I\u2019ve ever experienced live. How does he do that? Are there any special techniques anyone knows about or just the standard stuff?",

            "Dude please wear earplugs while you still have a reason to lol",
            "It might've been just because you were standing 15ft away.  That's really close to a concert stack.",
            "Hope you had on earplugs friendo thats hella close to a festival speakers",
            "If you stand 15 feet from concert stack speakers, any decent mix will slap",
            "82 instances of Ozone 9 Maximizer followed by 32 instances of Pro-L on the \u201cEDM PUNCHY\u201d setting.",
            "Probably mostly the standard stuff with a lot of time and experience, and using lower frequencies than are common combined with having a system that can adequately reproduce those sounds\n\nListen to the same thing on your own speakers. If it doesn't do that to ya then the answer is probably more the speaker designers, and sound engineers who run them. Some of those festival rigs are truly amazing and it's a big team effort not just the producer",
            "Oof. My dude, you were really close to the speakers. There's not much more to it than that",
            "Pretty sure illgates has a great video on transfer curves/wave shaping where he touches on it.\n\nIf you want the loudest sounds out of a speaker, you have to maximize the waveforms so they\u2019re getting the most out of the speaker.",
            "Sometimes the sub frequency determines the force of the bass ie 35-40hz packs more of a punch than 60-65hz for instance",
            "Venues regularly crank the volume as the night goes on to compensate for the hearing damage that occurs throughout the night.   Also, most headliners demand being louder than the previous acts."
