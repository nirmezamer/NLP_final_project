            "Whats the general consensus on chibsons? Find a nice looking one online and thought of buying it. If I do buy it I am in no way treating like a legit gibson or would try to resell it. I just want a cheap afforable guitar with humbuckers. Folks online seem to talk highly of them and the other half seem to disagree",
            "Is it better to try to learn a n easy song before you start on chords to get a feel for guitar or should you just jump strait into chords and scales",
            "I have no experience in playing guitar.  \nThe main genre I wanna play is Jpop/Jrock, any recommendations on electric guitar brands, amps, and other equipment for a sound that fits the genre? In terms of budget, probably somewhere $2000-3000 of the price of all equipment all in all. I want equipment that will last a long time.",
            "Would switching from standard tuning 10-46 strings to much heavier strings that would accustom B tuning like 11-56 would be a bit too extreme or do I worry for no reason? And would it be difficult to setup a guitar after such drastic change (no luthiers where I live so I have to do all of it myself)?",
            "7 string guitar v 7 string baritone guitar what actually is the difference as I'm genuinely unaware from what I can see?",
            "Why are guitar speaker cabinets so expensive?  The cheapest ones are about $400, and it's just a wooden box with a speaker.",
            "How do I fix fret buzzing on my Yamaha FG800J. I really want to start playing more and I want to get better but the buzzing is getting on my nerves and I'm thinking about getting a set-up. Are they worth it, or should I try and figure it out by myself, and if I get it set up should I do it through a local store or Guitar Center?",

        "content": "Welcome back to Weekly One Take, the weekly improv thread with a focus on **constructive** feedback.\n\nThank you to everyone who posted takes or gave feedback last week! Great to see all the fantastic submissions and comments.\n\n**The Concept**\n\nThere are two ways you can participate in this thread, and they are not mutually exclusive!\n\n1. **Record a take** of yourself improvising over the backing track provided. The idea is not to achieve perfection - record a real, live, raw and unedited solo. It can be a video or just a recording. Upload your take to YouTube or Soundcloud and share it in the comments. *Tip: keep your take short and sweet. If you record a 10 minute take, think about chopping it down and submitting just the first few minutes.*\n2. **Give feedback** on someone else's take. We're looking for supportive, constructive comments - putting yourself out there for everyone to listen to is scary, and everyone is at a different stage in their guitar journey. Critiques are welcomed, but don't just criticise - offer suggestions on how to improve, and highlight the things you did like too.\n\n**This week\u2019s track:**\n\n[5/4 Fusion ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITNqCSWneKI)\\- thanks u/Due_Following_3069 for the suggestion.\n\nIf you have any feedback on the concept as a whole, please let me know in the comments/DM me.\n\n*Check out previous weeks* [*here*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/wiki/index/#wiki_weekly_one_takes)",

            "Sounds pretty good to me! This was a ridiculously difficult (at least in my opinion) track for a one take.",
            "This was really nice! You captured the chord changes really well I thought!",
            "Nice I think this is my fav so far.",
            "Very nice! I went with a cleaner tone at first too and then added some distortion in post because I felt it helped fatten my sound but this is nice and melodic. Also what PRS model is that?",
            "Love that smooth jazz style thing going on, I think it worked great!",
            "I am a complete theory dunce and don't know how to follow chords properly, but fwiw: E mixolydian seems to work pretty well here, especially if you shift to C# harmonic minor on the last chord.",
            "Thanks for the tips- I think the combination of the odd time and key changes is too much for me to handle in a one take-I'll need to practice more of these for sure.",
            "Thanks! It is pretty challenging, but I think it mainly comes from not being that familiar with 5/4 (4/4 usually what we play).  Scales wise I just chucked whatever E scales I have at it and tried to follow the bass and drums the best I could!",
            "ohh okay, ill pay attention to the bass + drums more for sure, thank u for the tip :) \n\nthe suhr is amazing, would definitely recommend anything from them. the guitar isn't too heavy, the neck feels like butter, and the action is super low. looks wise, wasnt what i was going for but it felt way too good to play to not get it (happened to be the cheapest 1 i could find in the store i was at). had to damn near sell my soul to get it though haha"

I've historically shied away from Gretsch due to the price, but after seeing their Electromatic line and selling a couple of the ones I don't play anymore, this was a no-brainer.  My current project is \"industrial adjacent\", and I love the anachronism of having a huge old school jazz guitar and playing heavy electronic music with it.",

There was a volume pedal involved too, if my memory is correct.\n\n\u201chis main guitar rig on classic Who albums like Who's Next and Quadrophenia was a 1959 Gretsch 6120 plugged into a 1959 Fender Bandmaster amp. Townshend revealed the details behind this rig to me in a Guitar Player magazine interview in 1993.\u201d",
