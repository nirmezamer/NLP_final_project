What the hell is happening last year things weren't as bad. It seems that everyday things are getting more and more expensive. And I'm not seeing the benefits for any of these. Everything is getting more expensive and I see wages stagnate. Am I crazy or is the whole of Canada going under. I mean, both me and my wife work full time jobs and we are left with little money to put aside, some months we don't put anything aside. We drive a compact, no lavish excursions or vacation trips, what the hell are we working just to pay bills and put food on the table???? Am I crazy?\n\nL.E. I didn't frame the question correctly, I noticed prices going up, but yesterday it got to the point of being shocking.",

        "content": "Hi all and thank you for taking the time to read my post.\n\nI'm currently in Toronto for work in our Toronto branch and I've had a great time do far.\n\nWork has gone really well over here and the team I've been working with is really great too. I guess my time here had gone better than I realised as I've been asked if I would like a secondment opportunity here for up to 12 months to begin with from upper management, with the blessing of the team I would be working with too. The first major hurdle on my part will be finances and what options I have.\nI've been doing some digging and am well aware that Toronto is an expensive city and that to maintain the quality of life I have in my home country it might require a fair amount of additional compensation.\n\nThe company is open to a discussion about the increase I would require for the duration, so I need to get a realistic handle on what to expect.\n\nSo anyway, onto my questions...What should my budget be for the following please:\n\n1 bed apartment in a reasonable suburb?\n\nMonthly food allowance? (I'm a big guy and eat a decent amount, but rarely get takeouts and mostly home cook food.)\n\nMonthly bills?\n\nTransport?\n\nGeneral recreation?\n\nAdditionally, I'm pretty familiar with your fine country, but are there any gotchas a potential expat would face which I should be aware of please?\n\nFinally, I'd like to apologise in advance if this comes across as tone deaf. I've been reading that the job market is poor and housing is expensive for everyone right now and I'd be adding to that issue, so I realise that might make this post leave a bad taste in some people's mouths, but if it's any consolation the role they're talking to me about has been vacant for quite some time because it's a particularly niche skill set and unfortunately has not been successfully filled by anyone inside the Canadian branch or outside in the wider market, which is part of the reason why they approached me despite my foreigner status, so at least I wouldn't be taking someone's potential job.\n\nThank you in advance to anyone taking the time to respond.",
