That said, it sounds like you did the right thing in getting as much info as possible and informing the police and store management. I\u2019m not quite sure what you would hope to achieve by going to the media and taking legal action. Against who would that be? The person that violated you is the individual the police need to find, not the store that had nothing to do with that individual. I\u2019d follow up with the detective assigned and see if progress has been made, especially given that you provided a licence plate.",
