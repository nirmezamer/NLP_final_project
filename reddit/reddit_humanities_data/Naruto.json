            "please GOD let us see Sarada do SOMETHING. can\u2019t believe we\u2019re waiting months at a time to see everyone except for Boruto fail to do anything important",
            "Naruto had to learn rasengan as fundamentals on top of train with Killer Bee in order to master biju bomb\n\nand now Himawari with baby Kurama no less able to master bijuu bomb out of the gate lol",
            "Poor Sarada and Himawari; get a couple panels of being cool and competent only to having to be bailed out by Boruto once again. Why ever have the focus leave Boruto if he\u2019s going to be the only one who actually accomplishes anything?",
            "I swear almost everytime Konahamaru does something cool, he gets owned. It's like he's not allowed to actually shine. \n\nThat being said that new guard type rasegan was a pleasant surprise.",
            "Ikemoto's drawing is so bland, speed lines used for background not artistic. They should find a better mangaka. or Masashi should take over his drawing.",
            "Naruto could only heal others besides himself after receiving the power from the sage of 6 paths so why can himi just all of a sudden heal completely punctured torso.",
            "Himawari getting random power that more than Naruto is beyond me. Lol",
            "Himwari randomly able to control her hair, use biju bomb, and heal people. She has no cloak but can put up a fight somehow.",
            "This chapter is a patriarchal W",
            "This is so ass bro."

            "Speaking of katsuyu it\u2019s crazy that little katsuyu survived inside Naruto\u2019s 6 tails cloak and being trapped by the chibaku tensei inside kurama\u00a0",
            "Katsuyu is the only one we haven\u2019t seen fail",
            "Katsuyu is truly amazing. We haven't seen her in full shape too. Even Tsunade has not summon her in full always a part.",
            "Katsuyu is the strongest summon in the verse and has never failed. Can defend an entire army with her. And she heals. \ud83c\udf76\u270c\ud83c\udffd",
            "Katsuyu, is this even a question?",
            "Sand shield. Passive, portable, no summon required, and susanoo hurts a lot, doesn't it?",
            "Susanoo for the looks, Katsuyu for the invincibility",
            "Katsuyu bc cute lil friendly slug pet",

            "He said they were evil when only like 3 of them were actually bad guys fr.\n\nThe police force should\u2019ve been made of various clans instead of just 1 especially your strongest one, that was just stupid.",
            "You are right. I\u2019m sure he held no bias or prejudice against the Uchiha at all",
            "I think in more modern boruto era with more developed science they will find some issues with his theory, but I think it was not simply made up,since Hashirama and Madara never could simply debunk it. Though either way,he was being excessive with some of his bigoted comments",
            "He can\u2019t be racist, he had that one Uchiha friend! /s",
            "Doctor Mengele is an expert in Jewish biology, too.",
            "Thats exactly what a racist would have said",
            "Blud was racist blud took them out of power and moved them to the back of the village to be spied on because he was scared crapless of Madara",
            "Having one strategy to subdue violence is stupid. Having one race as a police force is racist.",
            "Tobirama studied the Sharingan. So He Had a better understanding of IT and its Nature. His Research revealed, that the Sharingan grows stronger with negative Emotions and darkness. So His Problem was Not directly the uchiha, but the more Like the Sharingan, since IT leads those with the kekkei genkai into a path of darkness. The requirements for Mangekyou and Ems are Proof for that",
            "He put them in the police to hit two birds with one stone first like you said there abilities are good at catching criminals and second is to dehumanize them since those who crack down on crime are tend to be disliked. Orochimaru explain this, the Uchihas were started to get hated by normal people and this is exactly what tobirama wanted."

Bro deserved more and it's a shame that he died the way he did.",
