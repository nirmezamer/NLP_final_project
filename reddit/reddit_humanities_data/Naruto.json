            "please GOD let us see Sarada do SOMETHING. can\u2019t believe we\u2019re waiting months at a time to see everyone except for Boruto fail to do anything important",
            "Poor Sarada and Himawari; get a couple panels of being cool and competent only to having to be bailed out by Boruto once again. Why ever have the focus leave Boruto if he\u2019s going to be the only one who actually accomplishes anything?",
            "I swear almost everytime Konahamaru does something cool, he gets owned. It's like he's not allowed to actually shine. \n\nThat being said that new guard type rasegan was a pleasant surprise.",
            "A brief history of Sarada's journey getting her ass saved in the entire series:\n\n1.Ch11 - Sarada lets her guard down and gets snuck by a fodder mujina bandit to which Boruto has to bail her out. No sharingan active\n\n2.Chapter 58 \u2013 Sarada lets her guard down and gets tricked by a shadow clone from Kawaki and needs to get bailed out by Boruto. No sharingan active\n\n3.Chapter 79 - Like 5 people tell Sarada that Kawaki is crazy, so Sarada decides to go face to face against Kawaki without her sharingan on which causes her to get caught of guard and Boruto has to save her ass.\n\n4.TBVCh1 - Code pulls up on her - Boruto has to bail her out (i'll let it go because it introduces Boruto back but did the first showing of Sarada after the TS have to be her needing to be saved???).\n\n5. TBVCH2 \u2013 Let\u2019s her guard down and gets caught off guard by a fodder claw grime \u2013 needs to be saved by some fodder shinobi.\n\n6. TBV Ch11 - Boruto has to save her ass against Hidari.\n\nTruly peak writing - Kishi has certainly improved his pen for female characters. \n\nSeriously though, her overall introduction over the TS has been terrible.\n\nLike every time Sarada appears in battle, instead of fleshing her out by herself, he's gotta press the summon Boruto button every single time. I can't believe this is the same man that wrote the Uchiha in the original series. \n\nBtw, I'm not even expecting her to win against Hidari but I expect her to do something and actually showcase her growth from the 3 year TS (exclusing the MS). This battle should have been what Mitsuki vs Boruto was - Boruto was clearly outclassing Mitsuki, but Mitsuki was able to showcase what he had learned over the TS so that we as the readers can gauge where he is at.\n\nThe fact that Sarada was snuck kinda helps with how I originally felt about Sarada this issue. That being said, Sarada knows how the claws work - she's seen Hidari, code and the claw grimes travel between claws, yet she positions herself next to one??? Like where is her brain??? Where is her spatial awareness??? The truth is they need Sarada to be an idiot so that Boruto can play the knight in shinning armour as per usual. I also love the way that most of the fandom are defending Sarada getting snuck but clown on Kawaki when he got snuck by Mitsuki like wtf???\n\nAt this point I just hope Boruto take Sarada away from the village and sends her ass to Orochimaru for training. Give her an upgraded version of Sasuke's timeskip training with Orochimaru's up to date knowledge. Might as well slap on a curse mark too cause this girl clearly did nothing but whine at Shikamaru about Boruto's innocence for 3 years.",
            "Himawari getting random power that more than Naruto is beyond me. Lol",
            "Ikemoto's drawing is so bland, speed lines used for background not artistic. They should find a better mangaka. or Masashi should take over his drawing.",
            "Naruto had to learn rasengan as fundamentals on top of train with Killer Bee in order to master biju bomb\n\nand now Himawari with baby Kurama no less able to master bijuu bomb out of the gate lol",
            "Himawari\u2018s power-up still feels shoehorned in for me. \n\nYes, she isn\u2019t dominating Jura but the whole speech about her surpassing previous Jinchuuriki, transcending the jinchuuriki, effortlessly healing Inojin (who was likely dead at this point), wielding Kurama\u2018s powers more or less from the get go and more is nonsense to me. \n\nPeople trying to compare her growth to Minato\u2018s (WA KCM) is even more nonsense. Hima apparently trained for 3 years, yet we got one training sequence of her and Ino-Shika-Cho plus some ominous statement, and people try to tell me her growth is natural?\n\nI like Hima as a character. It\u2019s her power trajectory that reeks of plot-induced power-up to keep up with Boruto (Another can of worms). \n\nKawaki getting clowned on yet again makes me dislike this scene even more.",
            "Himwari randomly able to control her hair, use biju bomb, and heal people. She has no cloak but can put up a fight somehow."

            "Minato does NOT have control over whether Yin or Yang will be sealed inside his child during the separation process. Do you really think someone as serious as Minato would do that for shits and giggles?",
            "Yin/Yang in this series has nothing to do with good and evil, it has to do with spirit/physical energy. Kurama in general was evil it\u2019s not like he has an evil side and a good side. He just has yin-yang chakra and Minato separated them. \n\nNaruto has the Yang Kurama which is why when he fights the Zetsus they turn into trees they\u2019re reacting to the Yang chakra. Or why he can sense hostility/negative power.\n\nThis was explained way back in part 1: Yang is related to physical abilties like Choji\u2019s body expansion jutsu, Yin is related to spirit/mental stuff like Ino\u2019s mind transfer jutsu or Shikimaru\u2019s shadow possession.\n\n\nhttps://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Yang_Release",
            "It was implied that the ying half of the 9 tails was the good half and yang half was the one filled with hatred\u2026so the question is why Minato left the bad half with his kid",
            "Because Minato thought Naruto couldnt handle all the Ninetails.",
            "Not sure exactly what you mean but if you are asking generally why Minato sealed half of the 9 tails into Naruto instead of all of it, it's because Minato was taking precaution since Kurama had a vast amount of Chakra and he didn't think Naruto would've been able to control it in full. \n\nSo Minato sealed half of Kurama's chakra within him and gave the other half to Naruto. Considering that Naruto was an infant, it would've been somewhat deadly to give that much chakra to a infant (assumingly).",
            "Because he couldn't control which half would go into whom\n\nAnd Naruto wouldn't survive the entire 9 Tails being sealed into him. I honestly think he could have as he survived one half like It was nothing",
            "Isn\u2019t the whole concept of ying and yang that there\u2019s not really a \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d one? It\u2019s a philosophical principle that implies that the greatest good still contains darkness and the deepest darkness has a flash of light. Neither is outright good, neither is outright bad, they\u2019re a multilayered balance.",
            "It was an easy way to give naruto another powerup late in the series.",
            "Watch the anime lol",
            "He had to divide ninetails somehow and maybe his choice is based on the arsenal he saw the masked man using so he used whatever half he thought would be more useful and a good counter? Because all jutsu is categorized as either yin or yang."

Obviously people hate the power scaling, the Black Zetsu killing Madara \"ass pull,\" tagging-in Kaguya as the final boss, the Neji death that many feel lacked impact / no build-up / he could've normally defended that attack.  The size of the United Shinobi Forces didn't mesh with the quantity of ninja in the world at any other point in the story.  The fact that Pac Lee barely got any screen time during the war is unforgiveable.",

            "Edo tenseis that wouldve had more meaning\n\n- Fugaku Uchiha and an interaction with Sasuke and edo Itachi. This would have given more clarity to the tensions between the village and the uchiha. Also allow Sasuke to finally be accepted by his father.\n\n- also, other uchiha shouldve been revived to give more lore to the uchiha clan. Show the power of uchihas who are not prodigies (itachi, shisui) or anomalies (Madara, sasuke). Just fully strong basic uchihas\n\n- Sasuke should have had a fight that showed his full new abilities with the ems. That kabuto fight was mainly carried by itachi. We never saw Sasuke fully show off his new style with his new eyes.\n\n- the focus on certain support characters like omoi and samurai vs hanzo was a complete waste of time. \n\n- make it seem like a actual war. It shouldve been more gloomy. A lot of death. I mean a lot of death. Show characters running out of chakra and trying to retreat. Show the Villages fighting amongst each other as well. Gaaras speech should not be enough to quell tensions. \n\n- the hashirama flashback needed better pacing. I believe in show dont tell. Show the battles with the senju and uchiha. Show their strengths and weaknesses so we could really know how bad the warring states really were.\n\n- we needed a flashback of Madara and his family. We shouldve seen more izuna so we can understand Madaras pain better\n\n- madara individual ms abilities were never shown",
