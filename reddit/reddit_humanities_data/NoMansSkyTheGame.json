            "I recently started playing this game again after a few years, and directly encountered a new game breaking bug. The world fails to load properly causing the character to fall through it making some areas unaccessible. I had previously deleted the game so reinstalled it new this monday and I am playing on PS4. Has anyone encountered this bug, and how do I fix it?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6r1c7tbbrz7d1.jpeg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=540f4832bf821c8cb288b04b410744e5dfcab271",

            "\\[Question\\] What's the best or intended way of going about getting ship parts? I'm wanting to build a custom starship but it's slow goings at the moment. I know I can scrap ships for parts, but is there a merchant who sells the components? Also, I know I can buy ships at space stations, but that gets pricey fast; and I know I can occasionally find wrecked ships and fix them up to get them to the space station, but I rarely find ships this way. So any tips on finding more ships or merchants to find would be greatly appreciated.",
