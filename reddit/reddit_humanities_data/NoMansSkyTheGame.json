            "[Question] Have they changed the way dreadnoughts spawn? I've been trying to follow guides that suggest if you jump out of a system that had a dreadnought battle and then jump back in, you'll get the battle again. That doesn't seem to be the case. If it's changed, does anyone know what their timing/frequency is now?",
            "\\[Request\\] I'm looking for a head-only Squid ship. As far as I know it's only possible to make one via save edit and I'm on PS5 so can't do it, but in theory I can get one traded to me. Preferably orange or green but honestly any colour would do.",
            "\\[question\\] hi guys i need to know if its possible to recover my save game i had on microsoft xbox pass on pc and use it on the steam no man's sky?",
            "[Question] Short range teleporter on freighter no power. The teleporter in the corridor connected to the bridge is powered fine. From this corridor i built stairs up 3 levels, then put a room at the end, and put a short range teleporter in it. Whether in the center or corner of that room, the teleporter is unpowered. Does power not travel through stairs? What should I do?",
            "[Question] i wanted to report a base on Xbox but the game says I need to take a screenshot of it. Ok that's cool but the button to take screenshot is the Xbox central circle button, and pressing it brings up the Xbox menu. Which means I can't take the screenshot since the button is mapped to something else. Is there a way I can change the controls for report screenshot, or another way to report bases and make them disappear?",
            "what you need is a save in a different (previous) system before warping to continuously get the spawn. All I know for getting one is having 2 hours of collective gameplay and \\~5 warps, not sure if that's out of date though.",
            "I make base and teleporter in a nearby system to the dreadnought. I make save in that base. Then warp to pirate system. Always spawns a dreadnought, assuming my 3 hours and warp jump requirements are already fulfilled. Reload that save if I need to. I got S class after 4 tries (I'm lucky haha)",
            "You have to use 2 different save editors, the one for Xbox is named NomNom and the other if I recall is named just NMSSaveEditor or something like that made by GoatFungus. I don't recall the exact way you do it but there are guides to doing it on youtube.",
            "The game has NPCs, the one on the left is a hauler class ship and the one on the right is an explorer class. You will see both of those types of ships in space stations and be able to purchase them.",
            "wow thanks cos i havent played in a while but i was pretty maxed out i hade like full tabs of the microchip set worth 15m and my ships were crazy  ok ill follow a youtube guide thanks again"

            "No a species is extinct when the last known example dies without leaving a genetic successor. I know it's a stupid nitpick but extinct means extinct. A species can be 'pretty much extinct' but not technically until the last known example is dead."

            "I actually find sentinel ships the most realistic starships. The way the cockpit is enclosed and armored, with a realistic screen to show the outside makes more sense than a glass cockpit in space where a tiny piece of debris could crack it and their compact bodies and shape would make it easy to fit the exterior with an array of thrusters for maneuverability. Although, this is just my opinion. A hauler type ship does make a lot more sense for long-distance space travel if its equipped with a living space inside the main body.",
            "Spaceship? They can look like ANYTING. You could make a spaceship that looked like a dog turd riding a unicorn if you wanted.\n\nIn atmosphere is different, but ANY ship in the game could qualify as a legit SPACE ship.",
            "Easy: none of them are realistic",
            "really, a spaceship is just an enclosed hull with thrusters. Can look like anything too. What gives spaceships that airplane look is the need for reentry and atmospheric flight, though some of the freighters in this game look more atmosphere worthy that that C class abomination of a shuttle that looks like a crane cab put on 2 thrusters",
