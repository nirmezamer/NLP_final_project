            "The fact that this guy has more hp than fatalis and its still in the HR days",
            "Isnt the fight meant for multiplayer (correct me if im wrong)",
            "Yeah the hp scaling is multiplayer only ",
            "Yeah it has 50k hp.",
            "yah dude. F\\*ck this guy, i even tried to kill him while keeping the stupid pukei pukei alive, bc im also stupid like that., even his follow up quest to upgrade the sword is a pain,, i had mr gear and it's still torture,",
            "A cheater entered my SOS, max para weapon. Still took us like 30 minutes. Not even garanteed quest reward.",
            "Honestly Witcher would be compatible with Monster Hunter if they made the fight better. Witchers also have tons of tools like traps, throwing daggers etc, so Leshen being immune to most of our hunting strategies is kinda bs. Why do flash bombs work, but traps don't ?",
            "You know what's funny. I'm a fucking great sword user but I force myself to killed this groot with sns and manage to keep pukei alive just to get the only Attack Jewel Lv1 at that moment. I never beat it solo with gs until I got Fatalist armor sets and my performance still sucks. This collab is the worst thing in my opinion.",
            "Easily the worst fight in world. Developers didn't think much when creating this fight",
            "Aahh yes, that effing guy. I never even bothered doing solo."
