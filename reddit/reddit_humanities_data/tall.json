If I were to guess I'd say maybe 180cm (which is hardly tall) might be a boundary where some guys who are 178 or 179cm say 180cm instead. I have never heard of a woman here mentioning a height minimum.",
            "I dont really get the whole 6ft thing, dont let r/short see this but 6ft really isnt that tall. It is 183cm which is still under 190 by a lot so I dont really get it. Its probably just because tall peoples hight starts with 6 so when someone is 60 I guess theyre considered tall in the US",
            "Honestly, I don't think the rest of the world is as weird about height as Americans.",
            "well the ideal here was supposed to be 180cm but ever since the whole 6' thing has taken over, here in India women have also started using this measurement instead of cm\n\nso yea 6' here as well",
            "The US has had a lot more ethnic variety which changes the height average, making 6+ feet guys somewhat rare, I believe 14% of all men. In Europe about 40% of men are around 5'11 so 6' is basically average for now but european ethnic variety is increasing as well so we'll see how that changes. I'm in the balkans where 6'2.5/190 cm is considered tall. Most guys round up towards 180 or 185 if they are close",
