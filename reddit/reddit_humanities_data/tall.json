It\u2019s incredibly annoying when someone posts a picture of themselves or asks a question related to their height, but doesn\u2019t include their height.

These types of comments towards short people will continue to happen if these users are not banned or if there is no punishment for those types of comments being made. Simply removing comments is not enough to deter people from making those types of comments. Many other tall users have pointed out the toxicity coming from other tall users.",

They\u2019ll start a shoe thread and then PM those who answer asking to \u201cworship\u201d our feet (I\u2019m a dude). It\u2019s lame & creepy.

            "So these are just the ones that irk me - I understand that not everyone will share the same, but the following I think contribute nothing or just exist to cause issue.\n\nCelebrity|Politician height/comparisons - I mean just a picture of \"Tall famous person\" doesn't really mean anything to me, and I mean before it was cracked down on, it was just The Rock 5 times a day because the WWE made a height for him.  I don't care about the fact that some celebrities are tall, it just doesn't bring anything here.\n\n\"Are you taller than your mom/dad/brother/etc\" - Everyone is unique, this question comes around often, and there's literally *nothing* it provides.\n\nEvery creepy-ass dating post from a short person who is \"Totally not in any way\" just trying to find some \"trick\" to dating a tall woman/man/see feet.\n\nPolls - each time I've answered a poll it is followed by a creepy DM from an account with no posts.  The polls themselves were mindless anyway, but I think it's possibly more nefarious.  Could be coincidence, but I've just stopped answering polls.\n\nEvery single post about \"I was this tall this morning (no shoes) and this tall this evening (shoes maybe) and the 0.5 inch difference is my whole personality now.\" are insufferable.  It's over-posted for a shitpost anyway, but it is the *most* annoying, menial stuff I've ever read. \n\nThere has been an uptick in some pretty weird shit here lately but it gets dealt with it seems, but still on that - Incel memes about some height just being the absolute only thing in the world/anyone talking about wasting height/anyone coming to put all tall men or women (or both) in a box of some sexual conquest.",
            "As a man who has been over 40, I know it coudl be a bit grumpy here. So I make it points and really hope the Mod / admin could read my words here: \n\n* True story: My workmate is 7ft1-2 and sometimes he found people were like tracking him behind. He can't hide himself from being standout ,but he doesn't like to be photographed secretly and later found himself somewhere from any social media. He told me he has seen his pic once here (long time ago) and today's phone making him anxious. \n* At the same time I do feel creepy here - there are lots of Fetish / worshipers here. Perhaps the pandemic has turned on our weird switch inside then people started to do creepy things? Could we just set a limit here? \n* Some people like to promote themselves from selfies . Honestly I don't know what is that for. Are they asking for their problem with height,  just looking for a short date, fashion advise, or warning other tall people there are cautions in somewhere?  \n* Once the topic is interesting , the copiers comes, like leg rooms, door frames posts keep repeating from time to time. Could we just put them into a single topic? \n* Rants, ventilation, real-life true advices. I am not very tall but I do want to ventilate myself about the \"small stuff\" in our real life, and looking for real-life useful advices .  \n* About lesser-tall people - I am not sure whether there are any haters, or just looking for a date with tall guys/gals. I believe keep polite and gentle as the first rule , and not here to stir up an event as the second. Maybe if that continues we could ban those users from entering?",
