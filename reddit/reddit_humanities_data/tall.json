            "I'm not noticing any of that whole fixation and embellishment thing where I'm from in Europe. I think this might be much more of a thing in the US.

            "I don\u2019t really get the whole 6ft thing, don\u2019t let r/short see this but 6ft really isn\u2019t that tall. It is 183cm which is still under 190 by a lot so I don\u2019t really get it. It\u2019s probably just because tall peoples hight starts with 6 so when someone is 6\u20190 I guess they\u2019re considered tall in the US",

            "The US has had a lot more ethnic variety which changes the height average, making 6+ feet guys somewhat rare, I believe 14% of all men. In Europe about 40% of men are around 5'11 so 6' is basically average for now but european ethnic variety is increasing as well so we'll see how that changes. I'm in the balkans where 6'2.5/190 cm is considered tall. Most guys round up towards 180 or 185 if they are close",
