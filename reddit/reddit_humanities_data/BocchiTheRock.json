As long as you write a proper application you have a good chance.\n\nAlso, moderating is honestly pretty easy imo. You'll get the hang of it fairly quick. And don't worry about making mistakes here and there, you won't get removed from the team the second you make one, otherwise I would've been out like 10 times already. \ud83e\udd7a",
