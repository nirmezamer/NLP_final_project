            "Mine had it once, since then I've only given him urinary dry food and normal or urinary wet food. There are many brands that are not very cheap but better to spend two more bucks than to make him feel bad. Unfortunately, in males it is quite common. Hope he feel better now and in the future. \ud83d\ude0c",

        "content": "Hey void-lovers!\n\nMost cat subs have a very delicate balance between \"happy posts about my cat\" and \"sad posts about my cat\", specifically when it comes to pet death. A lot of them don't allow it at all. It's really tough to strike the balance of letting people who are devastated mourn the loss of their furry friend while still making the subreddit usable for people who aren't interested in that kind of content.\n\nWe allow mourning posts here, but you have to flair your post with \"Mourning\" so people who don't want to see them have the ability to filter them out. It's an imperfect solution, but it's all we have available to us with subreddit tools. Please make sure to flair all posts about pet loss with that flair so we can make a great sub for everyone.\n\nIn case you're someone who's interested in filtering out that content, [this link should work for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackcats/search?q=-flair%3AMourning&sort=top&restrict_sr=on&t=day). I know, it's not the cleanest way to browse the subreddit, and I'm not sure how it works on mobile. If we had a better solution, I'd provide it, but we have to work within what reddit offers us :(\n\nThanks for your understanding. If you've read this far, I encourage everyone to post some void laser eyes in the comments.",
