            "It is unlikely that he is a legal service animal but he looks like such a good boy that pets and ear scratches would be a perk of sharing a row with him. And he looks a little scared, so extra points for comforting one of God\u2019s Creatures, whether Great or Small.",
            "Even if it is a 100% legitimate service animal, it\u2019s usually a very big no-no to have their SD come up to anybody on a flight, a restaurant, or any place else they\u2019re required to be in their best behavior. \n\nNow sure, sometimes you\u2019re walking through the store and someone surprises you and immediately goes to pet the dog and you roll with it instead of dressing them down in public for disregarding the best that says \u201cIGNORE ME IM WORKING\u201d and \u201cSERVICE DOG, DO NOT PET\u201d but I digress.\n\nBut also chances are it probably isn\u2019t legit or the dog is improperly trained and/or the owner is not properly trained or stupid.",
            "Given the number of animals who are killed by neglect or depressurization or left in the sun on the tarmac when they travel in the cargo hold of the airplane, if I absolutely HAD to fly with my dog somewhere, he would be in the cabin with me. \nBut I would never make him fly just for fun. It\u2019s way too stressful.",
            "id be stoked to have that as a travelling neighbor haha",
            "I have a severe allergy to dogs that when combined with my asthma leads me to having severe asthma attacks. The aftereffects of which can last days and leave me unable to walk further than a few meters before needing to sit down to take a break and breathe. You can imagine how inconvenient that would be in an airport.\n\nThis is clearly not a service animal and sitting beside it would be a nightmare scenario for me. Is it too much to ask that dog owners be a little considerate and stop pretending that their pet is a service animal?\n\nEdit: I would like to add that I really love dogs, it's just that my body and brain can't seem to agree on how they feel about them.",
            "That is ridiculous.",
            "Look, I have 3 dogs but it\u2019s getting ridiculous on planes now. Hire a dog sitter like the rest of us. Now people are bringing cats. How about those of us with allergies? All of this service dog/emotional support animal stuff is a crock. 95% are fake but everyone is to scared of backlash to say anything.",
            "I\u2019m sorry - it doesn\u2019t matter how cute he is that is entirely unacceptable. My mom is terrified of dogs and she would lose her shit if some dog popped up on her lap mid flight. There are rules for a reason",
            "My neighbor on my last flight had two itty bitty chihuahuas in a pet carrier he brought on our flight. They were perfectly well behaved and only came out when their owner made sure I was ok with it.\n\nYour neighbor sucks."

        "content": "I was scheduled to fly to Heathrow at 8a from JFK this morning on Virgin (booked through Delta). After sitting on the plane at the gate for about 30 minutes for a \u201croutine\u201d engineering inspection, the captain announced the flight was cancelled. A new part needed to be shipped from the UK. This was a full flight. \n\nVirgin handed out papers saying we\u2019d be rebooked within the next 3 hours for another flight. I needed to be in London to catch a connecting flight to Scotland on another airline tomorrow morning. The uncertainty in Virgin\u2019s piece of paper was too much for me.\n\nI hopped on the phone immediately with Delta. The first agent I talked was super nice, but couldn\u2019t get me anything until the 12-15 hours later. I would definitely miss my connecting flight. At first, I thought this is my fate, and I decided to wait for Virgin\u2019s rebooking. \n\nBut, I saw there was a direct tonight from JFK to Edinburgh tonight, so I figured I\u2019d roll the dice and ask to get on it even though, in Delta\u2019s view, London was my final destination. \n\nI called back Delta, and I explained the situation to the agent (without mentioning Scotland). She looked through all the flights to LHR, and she could not find anything to get me to London to make my next flight. Then, I asked, \u201cLondon is not my final destination, and I\u2019m really trying to get to Edinburgh by tomorrow afternoon. Is there any possibility that I can be rebooked on that direct flight tonight to Edinburgh?\u201d\n\nShe told me to hold, and she would look. She came back, and said, \u201cSir, you reservation has been updated, and you are now on the flight to Scotland tonight. Would you like an aisle or window seat?\u201d\n\nI was stoked and beyond thankful, but it was followed with a little hitch. Virgin hadn\u2019t released my booking back to Delta, so while had a reservation, I couldn\u2019t get a boarding pass. I saw Edinburgh in my itinerary for the day in the Delta app, but I couldn\u2019t check-in. The super friendly agent patched me through to Delta\u2019s \u201cinternational ticketing\u201d to resolve the situation. \n\nI was having this entire conversation at Gate A5. While I was on hold with \u201cinternational ticketing\u201d, I had time to go retrieve my checked bag from domestic arrivals in T4 and walk to the Sky Priority check in counter. \n\nI met Stella at the Delta check-in counter. Explained to her the situation, and she took over. She said I\u2019m going to do my best to get this settled for you. She got on the phone, while I was still on hold with \u201cinternational ticketing\u201d and got it done. She got me a boarding pass and she sent me on my way. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to post this until I was wheels up, but I\u2019m on my way to Scotland now over the Atlantic on schedule thanks to a really awesome Delta phone rep and Stella at the Sky Priority check-in at JFK.

I did hear the attendant say that someone who had stuck a carry on under their seat might want to use the bin space.\n\nAnyway, it was nice to see the rules enforced. ",
