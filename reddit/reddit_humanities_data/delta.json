She called me up by name, said they were offering $400 to start, but it would go up. Second guy approached but was hesitant. Offer just went up to $700, and the hesitant guy took it. Still needed one more, and the bid got up to $1000 just before boarding. So I\u2019m getting $1000 to sit in the airport and work until 5pm, instead of sitting on the plane and in the hotel to work until 5pm. Thanks Delta!",

Finally after an hour past departure time they got their 8 and the amount had gone up to $2000! Delta paid out 16k for this one flight.

        "content": "Hi all. Looking for advice and somewhat venting. I was on a flight today with my one year old and was told that because I bought him a seat, I could not breast feed him during taxi, take off, and landing (which by the way are the times the CDC recommends you nurse). When I pushed back that I had nursed two kids on 40+ Delta and affiliate flights, I was told that it was FAA policy that I could not breast feed and that I would have to buckle him into his car seat. She was very rude and I was afraid I was about to get kicked off our flight and ruin our family vacation if I continued to push back, so I buckled him in and everyone on the flight had to endure his scream crying. I was so embarrassed for a multitude of reasons. She was so rude and so loud talking to me that I had total strangers approach me at baggage claim apologizing to me for how I was treated.\n\nI tried to find specific FAA guidelines and can't. I reached out to Delta to see what their policy and was told that they fully support the right for a woman to breastfeed her child- which is polar opposite of what I was told inflight.\n\nIs there an FAA rule, if so can someone please provide a link?\n\nI originally  posted this in  r/breastfeeding but  was  told  this  may  be  a  more  helpful  location.",

            "Only thing I can think of is because he's not a lap child, she's going with all the pax have to be seated/ buckled. Which technically is correct since he's not marked as a lap child.",
            "Not breastfeeding specifically but I have been told similar with a hysterical toddler during turbulence - I was told I couldn\u2019t hold her while the seat belt sign was on because she had her own ticket/seat, but if she\u2019d been a lap child I could have.  FA was a total asshole about it, said it was federal law.  I assumed he just meant how federal law mandates complying with signs and crew orders.",
            "Those are considered \u201ccritical phases of flight\u201d she probably wasn\u2019t wrong, just a crappy rule.",
            "Wow i\u2019ve always breastfed during those times and I have never had that issue. I would have buckled my child in and as soon as we took off i would have gotten him back out. 2 and under can sit in laps so that\u2019s really odd she made such a big fuss.",
            "I get the impression the FA\u2019s issue wasn\u2019t your breastfeeding so much as it was that the child had their own seat.",
            "Why would you buy your one year old a seat? Since you bought a seat for your toddler, the FAs were simply enforcing the policy that every passenger with a seat assignment needs to be seated. Sorry they were rude to you, but it sounds like they were just trying to cover their behinds.",
            "That\u2019s the time (taxi, take off and landing) you are most likely to have a problem and need to evacuate. The time it takes to get out is very limited. FAA requires plane to be evacuated in 90 seconds.",

            "We do it all the time. Did it with the first child and now with the second. Delta had a costly lawsuit regarding breastfeeding/pumping with an employee. They almost had a costly one with us(wife works at Delta). Their policy is, there is NO policy. The mother can do whatever she wants in regard to taking care of their child."

If everyone\u2019s body size is somewhat equal and average size, then we can proceed to the next unwritten rule- middle seat gets the armrest. I am a more petite female, and some men (and women) cannot help but to have their shoulder width naturally extend over top the arm rest. I rarely end up in a middle seat, because I pay to pick a seat or for priority boarding to get my preferred aisle seat. But if I\u2019m in a situation where I am far smaller and they naturally cannot be comfortable without the armrest, then I give that person the armrest. Their only other option is to uncomfortably hold their arms crossed in front of themselves for hours. Where it would not be nearly as uncomfortable for me to simply put my arms elsewhere.",
