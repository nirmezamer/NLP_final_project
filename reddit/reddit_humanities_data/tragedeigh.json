        "content": "So, I\u2019m 15, and my aunt is 33. She\u2019s currently pregnant, and she recently held a baby shower to reveal that the baby is a girl. I\u2019ve been helping her come up with names, but she\u2019s said that she doesn\u2019t think any of the names that I gave her. For instance:\n\nMe: \u201cI think Caoimhe, Nora, Quinn, Arineh, or Adrine may work. All of those names tie into our Armenian-Irish heritage and they sound nice.\u201d (Caoimhe would be angilicized to Keeva, so no, it wouldn\u2019t be hard to pronounce if the name is pronounced with how it spells. Keeva would be the kids name if she picked that. Had to address this.)\n\nMy aunt: \u201cNo. I don\u2019t like any of those names. I want a name for a granny, not a baby. How about.. Glutenia? It\u2019s a grandma name. I don\u2019t want my kid to grow up being called something ridiculous, so Glutenia is good.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201c.. absolutely not. Did you just pull that out of nowhere?\u201d\n\nShe insists that it\u2019s a common name, but it is not. I need help to prove a point. PLEASE. IS IT A TRAGEDEIGH OR NOT? Pretty sure it is but still. I need to prove my point.. \n\nEdit: Yes, I know, Caoimhe is hard to pronounce. It was the least favorite on the list. It\u2019s an actual Irish name that\u2019s been used in my family for years. I only suggested that name to her once. I suggested the other names to her multiple times because they were easier and whatnot, but she hated all of them. I do not want to keep repeating myself. I added it to the list because she likes unique names, so I tried to suggest a unique name with cultural significance. Nothing. Also, all of the names I suggested are, in fact, not tragedeighs, because they all are cultural names that actually exist in the world. Sure, you may not like some of them, but that doesn\u2019t immediately mean they are tragedeighs. \n\n(Also no I\u2019m not mad about anything except for the Glutenia part lol. I\u2019ve been attempting to respond to all comments that ask about the names I suggested as politely as possible, I\u2019m not mad if you have any questions. Someone suggested that I\u2019m mad but I am not. Feel free to ask any questions if you want, just don\u2019t be disrespectful of any cultural names and don\u2019t suggest that I am angry for some reason. :) I am sorry if I come off as angry or anything in my replies, I just want to educate people. I\u2019m autistic so I don\u2019t really understand my tone, but I\u2019ll try to be as polite as I can.) ",
