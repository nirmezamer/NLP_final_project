        "content": "TW WARNING: mention of blood loss.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, I was taking care of my one month old daughter and anticipating a wonderful night out with my 4.5 year old, when my period post-partum returned (I thought). I got a shower and noticed that my flow was faster than normal, and I had some cramping/clotting. \n\nI called my husband (Ryan) to tell him to pick up some extra pads, as I had soaked through two adult diapers in a matter of minutes. \n\nThinking it would slow down and not be a big deal, I tried to carry on. It only got worse in the following minutes - I called Ryan to come home, my family to come get the baby, and my favourite nurse for advice.\n\nAs mothers do, I took care of my daughter to ensure she was in safe place while waiting for help to come. Unfortunately, my house did look like a crime scene with an unmanageable amount of blood lost. \n\nI was taken by ambulance to the local hospital for what we now know was a post-partum hemorrhage, four weeks (33 days) after delivering my daughter. \n\nI had surgery in the wee hours of Friday morning and am home resting. \n\nI\u2019m so grateful for the medical teams from paramedics to nurses to doctors who took something that could have been fatal, and in a 6-minute surgery (while I had a great snooze) sent me back home to my kids. \n\nI am sharing because it didn\u2019t occur to me that I could hemorrhage 4 weeks after birth - I thought we were in the clear. I went from feeling perfectly fine to perfectly not-fine within minutes. \n\nI few things to look out for (I\u2019m sorry for the graphic details):\n- a consistent loss of blood that fills up a pad or diaper in under an hour (for me, it was like a faucet had been turned on).\n- Clots (I had a few clots at home that would have been comparable to a tennis ball), but anything bigger than a golf ball is reason to be concerned \n- Your own gut instinct. Or in this case, a friend who tells you to go to the hospital. \n-  can happen up to 12 weeks pp\n\nAs women, we are very quick to downplay our bodies and what they are doing. Our bodies are INSANE and the amount of things that go right in them day-to-day is matched with how many things can go wrong. \n\nI\u2019m so grateful and want to ensure other women know the signs as they possibly endure this as well.

            "Traveled just us more. We got married at the end of 2019 and weren\u2019t sure how soon we would get pregnant, so we weren\u2019t trying but not preventing. The plan was that if we weren\u2019t pregnant by August 2020, we would take a road trip through several states and sight see, explore, etc. Well, we got pregnant March 2020 and found out the same week that Covid lockdown was announced\u2026so there went any traveling for the year \ud83d\ude02",
            "If your budget allows, I\u2019d recommend one last big vacation before you start trying. My wife and I meticulously planned the birth of our little one, and luckily everything aligned and she got pregnant the first or second try. We prepped the whole year before she got pregnant and planned a big vacation to the Outer Banks with our three dogs. It was a fantastic time. We had such an amazing week, went on many adventures and ate so many great meals. We even got to experience our first almost hurricane (the TS was only 5mph before hurricane threshold!). \n\nAnd to top it all off, the morning of check out, we had an extra pregnancy test I had spilled ice cream on. I didn\u2019t want to pack it so I told her to take it just in case (she had taken one two days prior and it was negative). But this pregnancy test came back positive! And our little one was born one month ago! \n\nI\u2019d also recommend getting good cookware and getting used to using it. This will allow you both to make bulk meals in one go, which saves a ton of time. \n\nHonestly, other than the first trimester, the pregnancy wasn\u2019t particularly restrictive and we did a lot of normal activities (well I guess except for during the placenta previa diagnosis but that cleared). Also having a baby is way less restrictive than we thought too. We are hiking and going to the zoo rather frequently.",
            "Get in the habit of a reasonable, consistent workout routine. One that you could maintain throughout pregnancy. I hadn\u2019t worked out in a hot minute when I got pregnant, then the first trimester fatigue hit me like a ton of bricks! \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll work out more when the 2nd trimester energy comes!\u201d I told myself. \n\nSpoiler alert: The motivation never came. \n\nI wish I had a set routine before getting pregnant. I still go on walks and whatnot, but an easy weights regiment would\u2019ve been good!",
            "Contrary to a lot of these, you can still travel and have fun and date etc after you give birth! Our lives became so much better in every way.\n\nIn the US, but my honest answer would be to leave a state that is anti-abortion. Because if every fiber of your being is hoping your baby gets carried to term, your prenatal care is likely to be poor and you\u2019ll be left to literally die in an emergency. Good OBs have left and also left shortages in places where they have to break state or federal law (and their own medical code of ethics), with the questionable ones staying (some good ones remain, but there\u2019s that shortage).\n\nFor our second, we moved, and despite not planning to start trying for a while, we already have meetings set up with midwives. We\u2019ll be doing \u201cpreconception counseling\u201d and developing a relationship we can feel secure in WELL ahead of time, this time.\n\nThe other things is to line up a marriage therapist. Have a few sessions to get comfortable, so that when you have spats and trouble understanding each other in a sleep deprived haze where your well meaning partner succumbs to internalized sexist mores or bad role modeling from parents/society or even just innate biological challenges (ie partner can do his sport; you have 6 months of recovery; equal parenting while exclusively nursing; lack of leave; one parent has a mental health challenge and can\u2019t be equal; one handles lack of sleep better\u2026), you can work productively through them rather than winding up as one of the many posts of miserable women who hate motherhood because their husbands aren\u2019t partners or fathers. Letting resentment build while killing yourself isn\u2019t okay.\n\nWrist prehab is also great. Any nagging \u201cmight be injured\u201d kind of things are going to be exacerbated, and it\u2019s hard to do PT effectively while gaining weight, moving your center of balance, and changing hormonally.\n\nOh, and make sure your teeth are in good shape and your dentist won\u2019t refuse to work on a pregnant woman!",
            "Started a good exercise routine that I didn't have to leave the house for. First trimester was hard, and everything went out the window. My husband and I used to go on long walks several times a week and it kept us in good shape, but when I got pregnant, leaving the house became very difficult. \n\nSecond trimester was better, but I still didn't want to leave the house. Finding new inside exercises was more difficult while pregnant than already having a routine. \n\nI wish I got the house ready for baby before I fell pregnant. Everyone told me not to do anything before pregnancy because \"you never know if you're actually going to fall pregnant\". Well, I fell pregnant the first month, and I had a really tough pregnancy so far. I've been too tired for most of the time and my poor husband has had to do it all - which a lot of it has been building a lot more storage furniture and moving heavy things around. I wish I could have done it before I fell pregnant so I could be helpful! \n\nOne thing I was happy that I did, was research ALLLLL the things that work for morning sickness. Most of it won't work for you, but some will, and it's great to know all the odd, random things to try when/if it hits! (You might be lucky and not get morning sickness though, unfortunately I had HG, so it was pretty bad till 27 weeks)",
