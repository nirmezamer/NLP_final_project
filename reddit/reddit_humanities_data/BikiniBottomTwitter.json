            "I remember doing a one-day robotics thing at the public library when I was in high school. Not a full-on class, not a long-term project, just a thing where a bunch of kids went in for a single day and worked on something and then showed everyone else what they did. One of my friends just so happened to be there too, so when the instructor said we'd be working in pairs we fistbumped. Douchebag immediately caught it and said \"nope, I'm gonna split you guys up and assign groups.\" Like, if it was a long-term class I could understand it. You want students to focus on the project and not goof off with their friends (although based on me and my friend's personalities, we would've hyperfocused on the task anyway). And you don't want kids without friends to feel left out. But this was just a one-day fun little thing at the fucking library. We were literally the only two people there that knew each other. We weren't getting graded, we weren't going to take this project anywhere else, it was just supposed to be a fun learning experience. There was no good reason to split us up. And yes, I am still salty at that asshole instructor.",
