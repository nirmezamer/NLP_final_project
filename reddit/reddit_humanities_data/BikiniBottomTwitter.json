            "Story time about dark youtube ads. It's going to be a journey so brace yourself.\n\nI had an industrial job that basically meant I baby sat monitors. Now, when stuff went bad I had to jump into action (typically pushing one button) but if a problem went on it could cause VERY large problems to the equipment and potentially local environment.\n\nI was told I could do whatever as long as I stayed awake and responded properly. Many people opted for youtube so I did as well. I binged youtube videos all day while periodically pushing the avert disaster buttons.\n\nAround this time youtube started airing this very very grim gun control ad. Very dark. It was long too , several minutes. Basically two kids are playing hide and seek. Kid goes into parents closet finds unsecured gun. He's playing with it when sister flings open door screaming I found you. Kid turns cared and points gun at his sister.\n\nA countdown started. It said something along the lines of \"you have 10 seconds to stop this\". Very slowly we went 10-9-8 as countdowns work. However, a morbid curiosity took hold. Do they really have the balls to see this through? 7-6-5. Surely, this is doing to stop itself. 4-3-2. Well here we go.\n\nLow and behold the screen just went black and you heard a gunshot and a scream. Still quite visceral but yeah they weren't going to show a kid getting their head blown off or whatever. There was then some statistic about gun deaths caused by improperly secured fire arms and the such.\n\nYears later I still remember that. I feel if you have a serious topic you kinda gotta take a more serious approach to make sure the message sticks. Especially in this digital age. \n\nThe end. Take a break. Go pee. You made it to Friday sailor.",
