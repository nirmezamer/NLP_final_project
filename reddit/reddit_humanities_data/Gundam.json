If you are going to post outside this thread then please keep it in line with the spoiler policy, so flag it appropriately, keep the spoilers out of the title, and none of that [insert character name here] x [emoji] nonsense either. Please don't be that cunt that spoils the movie for the rest of us that haven't seen it yet. Failure to comply will result in getting smacked with the ban hammer.\n\nPrevious megathread: https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/s/JG0nJ87Eb8",

            "SEED Freedom is the pinnacle of Gundam animation.\n\nIt's easy to see why so many people rewatched it in theaters over and over. There is so much intricate detail littered throughout scene after scene after scene, that you always see something new.\n\nThey didn't *need* to show Blue Cosmos grunts wrecking Murasame's way in the background, they didn't need to show Agnes using the spike on the bottom of the beam halberd to mercilessly finish off a Dagger, they didn't need to show DRAGOON's wrecking Zaku's from Strike Freedom's cockpit for less than half a second.\n\nIt's brilliant, because it incentivizes multiple rewatches, which paid off big time in theaters, and we the audience benefit from the insane amount of attention to detail that sets a new bar for Gundam animation quality.",
            "I finally realized what I was comparing this movie to mentally when I was thinking of it having a \"90's action movie vibe\". It's basically the same kind of movie as Starship Troopers or Independence Day: they may not have the deepest or best written plots, but damn are they so fun to watch in the most bombastic way that you can rewatch them multiple times while quotable quotes and moments get stuck in your head.",
            "https://preview.redd.it/iysvhzncu66d1.jpeg?width=671&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e53a9c7d6e9abc5b9877bc0931277f8683efbad8\n\nOh yeah, I\u2019m thinking CINEMA",
            "Utterly fucking stupid dumb shit fan wankery. Peak Seed/10. Would freedom again. Loved it.",
            "The first 1/3 was stupidly soap operatic that even I, a CE apologist, had to cringe. But gad damn I was in tears when Kira and Lacus were affirming their love to each other even when separated, like shit, they were so nonchalantly perfect in Destiny, it's nice to see their walls break down. Especially Kira.\n\nStory beat was simple, but man, this is truly a love letter to CE fans with all the callbacks. The last 1/3 of the movie was a blast, I wish I didn't partially spoil myself months ago.",
            "Fun fact: Seed Freedom now grosses over 12 million HKD in Hong Kong alone, 1/20 the amount it made in Japan. Hong Kong has 1/17 of Japan\u2019s population so Seed is almost as popular in HK as in Japan.",
            "i hope it comes to streaming and/or DVD/digital in the US soon",
            "I actually burst out laughing when they paused the whole movie for Lunamaria to line up a shot and everyone clapped after she hit the missile. Fukuda has definitely studied the fan feedback to Destiny.",
            "When I was a kid, I used to imagine all sorts of superhero/gundam scenarios with the Archangel.  I\u2019m sad that it\u2019s gone, it was a badass ship.",
            "I wished they spent more time in Kira and Lacus' time with ZAFT and the PLANTs. At the very least I wanted to see Kira interact with Yzak."

            "Honestly i think it would have been easier to design a gelgoog with a hidden gundam inside than a zgok with a hidden gundam inside. You would need to make the Zgok hella big to fit the gundam thanks to the zgok\u2019s weird shape, but a gelgoog just makes more sense. The v fin could have even folded like the zeta\u2019s and become the gelgoog\u2019s comander antena",
            "C.E.= Critically Exaggerated",
            "you know what I think that was probably the original plan with how weird the proportion these gelgoog as have (longer torso) but then they were looking for some shock elements for the movie so they changed it to zgok.",

            "OPs post is one of the most brutal imo . Reason being the context not the actual method of death. This women is a civilian a non-combatant. Her only goal was to save her child. Her death was not even registered by the pilot. They likely won't have had any idea it happened and probably died shortly after that. Never knowing of the mother he took from a son.  The woman was lucky to have one soul that even understood the nature of her death and morned her passing for it.  Forgotten. Disregarded. Lost to the gears of war. Truly brutal.",
            "There's a scene in 0079 where a Zaku chasing Amuro gets caught in earths gravity and you watch their face/mobile suit disintegrate. That one kinda hit me despite being rather routine since the pilot never really accepts his death and dies screaming while Char tries to get him to keep chasing Amuro.",
