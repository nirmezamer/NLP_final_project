If you are going to post outside this thread then please keep it in line with the spoiler policy, so flag it appropriately, keep the spoilers out of the title, and none of that [insert character name here] x [emoji] nonsense either. Please don't be that cunt that spoils the movie for the rest of us that haven't seen it yet. Failure to comply will result in getting smacked with the ban hammer.\n\nPrevious megathread: https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/s/JG0nJ87Eb8",

            "I finally realized what I was comparing this movie to mentally when I was thinking of it having a \"90's action movie vibe\". It's basically the same kind of movie as Starship Troopers or Independence Day: they may not have the deepest or best written plots, but damn are they so fun to watch in the most bombastic way that you can rewatch them multiple times while quotable quotes and moments get stuck in your head.",
            "Utterly fucking stupid dumb shit fan wankery. Peak Seed/10. Would freedom again. Loved it.",
            "The first 1/3 was stupidly soap operatic that even I, a CE apologist, had to cringe. But gad damn I was in tears when Kira and Lacus were affirming their love to each other even when separated, like shit, they were so nonchalantly perfect in Destiny, it's nice to see their walls break down. Especially Kira.\n\nStory beat was simple, but man, this is truly a love letter to CE fans with all the callbacks. The last 1/3 of the movie was a blast, I wish I didn't partially spoil myself months ago.",
            "Fun fact: Seed Freedom now grosses over 12 million HKD in Hong Kong alone, 1/20 the amount it made in Japan. Hong Kong has 1/17 of Japan\u2019s population so Seed is almost as popular in HK as in Japan.",
            "The movie needed 3 hours.. In what we got it felt like we had very little time for all the new and returning characters (which in total is like 20 characters), little time for showcasing the new mechs and technology, and not enough time for the story. The first half of the movie was well paced, but by the final half it felt like a frantic rush to get things out the way so things can wrap up.\n\nI liked the movie but damn it there just wasn't enough time and it suffered for it very anticlimactically.",
            "When I was a kid, I used to imagine all sorts of superhero/gundam scenarios with the Archangel.  I\u2019m sad that it\u2019s gone, it was a badass ship.",
            "I wished they spent more time in Kira and Lacus' time with ZAFT and the PLANTs. At the very least I wanted to see Kira interact with Yzak.",
            "I actually burst out laughing when they paused the whole movie for Lunamaria to line up a shot and everyone clapped after she hit the missile. Fukuda has definitely studied the fan feedback to Destiny.",
            "i hope it comes to streaming and/or DVD/digital in the US soon",
            "I am happy Athrun and Cagalli got the bare minimum. A gag and a six second scene take it or leave it. Fukuda doing his wife proud."

            "The mecha genre is definitely making a resurgence. The issue is that there just aren\u2019t many companies that have popular mecha games that Bandai could go to and know they\u2019d do good. \n\nThe only one at the moment that could guarantee something successful is from soft but they are currently busy with the next AC.",

            "I can only assume it was a last minute addition to the designs to make them more distinct from Strike Freedom and Infinite Justice and thus more marketable.",
            "Okawara has always been pretty bad at doing transformable suits. He can do okay ones like with the Saviour and both Wing Gundams but anything more complicated than that and it\u2019s asking too much. It\u2019s long been rumoured that the Aegis, which has an extremely complex transformation, was actually designed by someone else along with the rest of the Heliopolis 5 (I can\u2019t remember his name atm). It\u2019s possible the same thing could\u2019ve happened with the Savior too and he was just hired for clean up on the lineart. We know that Fukuda requested transformable suits from the start (he said as much when discussing the animation process when the movie was still in production) meaning that the poor transformations on the Rising and Immortal likely weren\u2019t late additions but Okawara being unable to design a solid transformable suit AND keep all the bells and whistles intact, so the shield and beam rifle just awkwardly lock onto the bottom of the transformed suit",
            "In terms of the actual transformation mechanism, there's no real difference between the Savior and the Rising & Immortal, since all of them just plank and have stuff cover them up. In fact, Rising Freedom and Immortal Justice cover up the heads of their respective MS better. If you look at just the base transformation for the Rising and Immortal without their handheld weapons, they don't actually look half-bad.\n\nWhere the transformations on the Rising and Immortal fall short though is the shield and rifle, since it's clear both weren't designed with a transformation mechanism in mind, and thus the way they're attached to their respective MA modes looks tacked on and unwieldy. The Savior meanwhile has a shield designed for the transformation in the first place, and thus it gives the MA mode a much better appearance, not to mention the rifle being stored in a better place than directly underneath. There's also the shoulders, which the Savior's back cannons cover up in MA mode, and thus better hiding the arms from view, whereas the Rising and Immortal just go full exposure in the same way as the Wing/Airmaster/Raider Gundams.",
            "Downright my favourite MS from SEED.",
            "The Rising Freedom and the Immortal Justice actually follow the Savior's transformation, itself just a variation of the Wing Gundam's planking method. The problem is that the gimmick felt unnecessary for both suits.",
            "My head canon is that they used the money to help upkeep and upgrade those older MS they kept hidden and used the development of the new Mobile Suits as a cover for the expenses.",
            "The Saviour had a neat transformation and the MA mode looks great.\n\nWhy were the transformations in FREEDOM so lazy? The Rising Freedom literally just covers the head and then is planking.",
            "I wonder how a Savior Knight Gundam would look if Kazami from Build Divers Re:Rise were to make one ?",
            "they shouldve gotten kawamori to do the transformable ms",
            "If not the savior, they could've also pulled from gundam eclipse. Anything other than what we got in the movie imo."
