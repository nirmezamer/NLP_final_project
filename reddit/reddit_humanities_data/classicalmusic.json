        "content": "Good morning everyone, happy Tuesday, and welcome to another selection for our sub's (semi) weekly listening club. Sorry about the long delay between entries, I had been off the grid / going through personal issues. But glad to say I\u2019m back and this week, each week, we'll listen to a piece recommended by the community, discuss it, learn about it, and hopefully introduce us to music we wouldn't hear otherwise :)\n\nLast time, we listened to [Rachmaninoff\u2019s Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/1d2k6f7/potw_98_rachmaninoff_rhapsody_on_a_theme_of/). You can go back to listen, read up, and discuss the work if you want to. \n\nOur next Piece of the Week is **Tan Dun\u2019s Water Concerto (1998)**\n\n\u2026\n\nSome listening notes from [Jari Kallio](https://jarijuhanikallio.wordpress.com/2020/11/13/tremendous-evening-of-tan-dun-and-ravel-by-colin-currie-the-helsinki-philharmonic-and-esa-pekka-salonen/)\n\n\n> Tan Dun\u2019s\u00a0Concerto for Water Percussion and Orchestra\u00a0(1998) is truly one-of-a-kind piece. Dedicated to the memory of\u00a0T\u014dru Takemitsu\u00a0(1930-1996), the concerto features a percussion soloist performing on an intriguing variety of water instruments, joined by two orchestral percussionists and a fairy standard symphonic ensemble.\u00a0\n\n> While this highly unusual setup creates some fascinating visual drama, the concerto is not a showpiece per se. What really makes the piece striking, is the fact that even with all those water bowls, water drums, waterphones and water gongs aboard, the concerto is conceived in a completely organic manner, yielding to an astounding experience.\u00a0\n\n> The concerto is based on a more-or-less traditional three-movement structure, with a\u00a0largo molto rubato\u00a0prelude added. The soloist enters the hall during the prelude, playing an improvised intrada\u00a0on a waterphone.\u00a0\n\n> The two orchestral percussionists, antiphonally stationed on the opposite corners of the front stage, answer the soloist\u2019s call, as he walks down the aisle. With the misty hue of the three waterphones ringing in the air, the orchestra enters, with six irregularity accented sforzato grunts from the brass, in counterpoint to sustained string lines.\u00a0\n\n> With the soloist onstage, the prelude ends with a deep tutti chord, bridging into the first movement proper. The percussionists dip their hands in large water bowls, creating rhythms figures and splashes, amazingly integrated with the orchestral part.\u00a0\n\n> Using water cups drums and gongs partly submerged into the water bowls, the soloist and his two companions draw intriguing sonorities from their watery main instruments.\u00a0\nTan Dun\u2019s outstandingly crafted orchestral fabric combines standard and extended playing techniques into various dream-like sonorities, sometimes blending seamlessly with the solo part, and is other passages, providing thrilling contrasts.\u00a0\n\n> An improvised cadenza closes the first movement, with the soloist echoing motivic fragments from the previous passages by dipping his fingers into the water bowl. A mesmerizing section, both aurally and visually, the cadenza casts a luminous spell over the listener.\u00a0\n\n> The second movement opens with water gongs, joined by a gorgeous solo cello line. Following the slow introduction, the music gains rhythmic momentum, with the whole orchestra joining in section by section. The soloist proceeds with water agogo bells, beating out some extraordinary rhythmic motives before switching to more mellow-sounding water drums.\u00a0\nFollowing a wondrously busy passage for the full orchestra, the second cadenza ensues. A semi-improvised passage for water drums and water tubes, the cadenza provides a meditative interlude before the full orchestra returns, brining the movement to its conclusion.\u00a0\n\n> During the transition to the third movement, while playing a water shaker, the soloist moves behind the orchestra and picks up a prepared vibraphone. A wonderful dialogue with the soloist, the two percussionists and the orchestra ensues, setting the movement well into motion.\u00a0\n\n> In the course of an orchestral interlude, the soloist returns to the stage front. Water drums, agogo bells and water gongs resume, leading the percussion textures back to the beginning, ending up with the hue of the waterphones.\u00a0\n\n> A powerhouse coda for full orchestra follows, closing with a wash, as the soloist raises a water stainer. Once emptied, the orchestra provides one final tutti chord, thus bringing the\u00a0Water Concerto\u00a0to its magnificent close.\u00a0\n\n\n\n**Ways to Listen**\n\n* Yi Chen, Percussionist: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp3Q4EDaogs)\n\n* Didier M\u00e9trailler with Yuram Ruiz and the Orchestre du Conservatoire Cantonal du Valais: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUDmL97m8_E)\n\n* Colin Currie with Esa-Pekka Salonen and the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Zvp3Q1HIIE)\n\n* Christopher Lamb with Kurt Masur and the New York Philharmonic: [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/5rWNvPTVgxABhVVszkbczY?si=S48lg7efT16bgfQ_6KguDw)\n\n\n**Discussion Prompts**\n\n* What are your favorite parts or moments in this work?

            "I heard this piece double billed with Nu Shu, the Secret Songs of Women. I found Tan Dun's work to be well orchestrated and rich in concept, but very flat on delivery. It seems to supplement with other media in a way that clings for dear life to the audience's interest. Nu Shu was a better work to me, the Water Concerto was full of so many stretches of \"oh that's cool, ahem... yes, quite.... there it is again..\" just slappy dappy woop doops that are cool as fodder for material but by themself and in repetition they are almost awkward.",

            "He proposes a lot of ideas that aim to bridge the culture of western music with Chinese philosophy, so the comments from the domestic Chinese musicians, who have the very cultural background, probably mean something. That\u2019s what I was saying",

        "content": "It seems generally agreed that Tchaikovsky's 6th is one of the great symphonic works, and all the others are well worth the time listening to them.  In an effort to get with the program, as it were, some time ago I listened to them all.  But I remained unmoved.  Although they all had beautiful, soaring, passages, to me the movements didn't \"hang together\" in a unified form, but sounded (to me) more like moments of glorious beauty strung together with humdrum nothings.  I love Tchaikovsky's ballets and concertos - I think his violin concerto is a superb romantic work, and one of the greats - but his symphonies (again, to me) seem to lack that underlying structural strength which makes a symphony work.  I don't quite know how to put it, but although they are called \"symphonies\", they seem to lack form.\n\nWhen I said something like this before, I was kindly reminded that Tchaikovsky's symphonies aren't in the Germanic mould, but are more sensual, emotional, and have to be listened to in that spirit.  \n\nI tried, but I still couldn't get them.\n\nThere are many composers whose works I dislike, and who I wouldn't go to any trouble to develop an appreciation, but Tchaikovsky isn't one of them.  I'd be happy to love his symphonies more, if I could learn how to listen to them.\n\nMany thanks for reading!",

            "My problem with Tchaikovsky symphonies has been that he seems to give it all in the first movement and the rest is kinda meh.",
            "I totally get what you mean, OP, although I do enjoy Tchaikovsky\u2019s symphonies for what they are. I can also think of other symphonies that I would critique in the same way, that I often cast doubt upon their validity as \u201csymphonies\u201d (as opposed to being blatant exhortations of the composer\u2019s ego). \n\nHow do you feel about Sibelius\u2019s First or Second Symphonies? The former is particularly often associated with Tchaikovsky. In any case, Sibelius (especially his later works) is my topmost paragon in terms of symphonic development and form.",
            "I am a fan of Tchaikovsky symphony movements. One example that I think is a structural complaint is with the 4th symphony--1st movement. The main theme feels like it takes forever to play on its own and developing an already gigantic theme draws everything way out, and then the contrasting slow theme just meanders along and conductors tend to take it soooo slowly, and then the section is played twice in the movement.\n\nFrom a different comment--I prefer Bruckner to Mahler as well. As brilliant and masterful as they are, Mahler's symphonies, to oversimplify, are just too nuts, and people go overboard with attributing heavy emotional and philosophical meaning to each little motif and texture.",
            "Im curious, what do you think of Liszt in this context? I've always felt that his attempts were more of a failure than Tchaikovskys but he gets called out far less and is seen as the bridge between Beethoven and Wagner.",
            "I\u2019ve got to agree with you. He is very much at the top of my favorites list, and I find his symphonies underwhelming.",
            "Well, I'd be quite happy to enjoy Tchaikovsky's symphonies as simply a different approach to the symphony, if I could get over my Germanic obsession with form!",
            "How do you feel about the Brahms A minor string quartet when played with more zeal than precision? I think the beginning of the final movement is very intense.\n\nOf course, sometimes no amount of listening makes you love something even when it has a reputation for being oh so sublime. So far that has mostly been my experience with the late Schubert piano sonatas (D major is the only one I really like) and his double cello quintet. And something similar which also does little for me is Beethoven's Archduke trio, it reminds me very much of the Schubert."
