Examples of such topics are:\n\n- Asking for thoughts on an adaptation of a character for a movie or show that has been out for more than one year\n- Asking people's thoughts on a recent movie or other adaptation\n- Arguing that \"Batman has always killed\" \n- \"Who would win\" topics, which might be better suited to r/whowouldwin\n- Asking people's favorite episodes of a show\n- Asking people's favorite or least favorite villains, sidekicks, or other types of characters\n- Character comparison posts\n- \"Erase one' posts\n\nThe above list is not complete, and contains just a few common examples. The list will be expanded over time, but ultimately topics moved to weekly discussion threads are subject to moderator discretion.\n\n**For a list of recommendations of comics, films, animated films, television and games, please see [our extensive wiki entry](/r/batman/wiki/recommendations/)**\n\nPlease remember the rules, especially the rule to be civil and treat others with respect. Remember there is a person on the other end of your screen. Attack arguments, not people, and do so without using labels.",

            "I recently reread Tynion\u2019s Batman run and thought it was pretty good. I think it gets too much flack. Yeah, it was way too event-heavy and the plotting wasn\u2019t superb, but I think the new characters fit into the stories well and the character moments in general are very good."
