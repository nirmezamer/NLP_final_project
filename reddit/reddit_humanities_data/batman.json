        "content": "**Welcome to the r/Batman Monthly Discussion Thread!**\n\nIn an effort to improve the quality of content in r/batman, we are going to be limiting some commonly posted topics to these weekly discussion threads. Examples of such topics are:\n\n- Asking for thoughts on an adaptation of a character for a movie or show that has been out for more than one year\n- Asking people's thoughts on a recent movie or other adaptation\n- Arguing that \"Batman has always killed\" \n- \"Who would win\" topics, which might be better suited to r/whowouldwin\n- Asking people's favorite episodes of a show\n- Asking people's favorite or least favorite villains, sidekicks, or other types of characters\n- Character comparison posts\n- \"Erase one' posts\n\nThe above list is not complete, and contains just a few common examples. The list will be expanded over time, but ultimately topics moved to weekly discussion threads are subject to moderator discretion.\n\n**For a list of recommendations of comics, films, animated films, television and games, please see [our extensive wiki entry](/r/batman/wiki/recommendations/)**\n\nPlease remember the rules, especially the rule to be civil and treat others with respect. Remember there is a person on the other end of your screen. Attack arguments, not people, and do so without using labels.",

            "I recently reread Tynion\u2019s Batman run and thought it was pretty good. I think it gets too much flack. Yeah, it was way too event-heavy and the plotting wasn\u2019t superb, but I think the new characters fit into the stories well and the character moments in general are very good.",
            "3 months asking, and still not a single nerd has been able to explain why forgiving male rapists mass murderers like Dr. Doom and Namor is so much easier than accepting Harley Quinn having a team up with Batman.\n\nFunny how an opinion shared by nearly everyone cannot be explained by no one. It goes to show the depths of the misogyby within comic book fandoms."

            "I don't hate it, but the combat just felt slightly off for me. I can't pinpoint the reason, but the dodge button doesn't seem to be as reliable as it was in previous games, leading me getting hit much more often. \n\nI ended up getting frustrated by the \"off\" feel the game had in combat and I stopped playing it.",
            "it was my favorite because of the Christmas setting, the Christopher Drake music \n\nand of course the Deathstroke fight.",

            "Must be confusing it with Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate.",
            "It\u2019s fun but it\u2019s definitely lesser than the Rocksteady ones. A lot of it feels like covers rather than something new.",
            "Because Rocksteady didn't make it... I never had a problem with it personally.",
            "Because it's actually good and I guess because of the glitchy PC port",

            "From a quick google This is just from injustice 2 #8 (one of the few times the injustice universe does Damian justice). Whilst the exact nature of the test eludes me he was essentially dropped off at the opposite end of the city and told to make his own way back to the bat cave as quickly as possible without any help. Of course the real test was to see what he would do when he inevitably came across people to help on the way there. Would he ignore them for the test or would he do the right thing and stop to help?",

            "I forgot this was from Injustice. I liked it so much that I remembered it as main continuity.",
            "In the comic panel it also says Bruce didn't come back for days, apparently Nightwing was following in Bruce's footsteps, which is honestly really cute.",
