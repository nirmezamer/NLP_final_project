            "Got unmatched overnight because I went to bed early? \n\nLast night I (22M) matched with someone (23F) around 10pm. We had two texts and then I went to bed because I had to wake up early this morning. I finished off by asking her something and this morning when I got up (like 6am), I saw she answered and asked me something else (notification showed it was around 11pm). As I was excited to open the chat and reply, the match disappeared?! Did I just get unmatched overnight because I didn\u2019t reply fast enough? I\u2019m by no means a morning person but it\u2019s just that I had a train to catch this morning. It was my first match in ages and I can\u2019t believe I messed it up simply by going to bed \u2018too early\u2019. Am I in the wrong here? How much time do you usually allow others to text back before you unmatch them?",

            "Should I post my occupation in my profile?\n\nI\u2019m a fighter pilot in the Air Force. But I know we can get a bad reputation in the dating world. I thought about posting \u201cpilot\u201d so I don\u2019t come off as \u201cbragging\u201d but that could also give off the impression of a lifestyle I don\u2019t live. \n\nI\u2019m not one of the reputation guys. I\u2019m here to find my wife. So, what should I post as my occupation?",
            "I met a woman last week at a cafe. We ended up talking for four hours (we lost track of time and stayed 45 minutes after closing), and we saw a movie together a couple days later. She said she wanted another date, and I want to show her that I am taking her seriously. I thought about getting her flowers, but, and maybe this is overthinking it, I don't want to awkwardly have a flower lying around during a date. Does anyone have any good ideas, suggestions, or tips for something else I could do? It doesn't have to be a physical item. Thank you in advance.",

            "\nI 25F matched with a 34M\u2026 We have plans to meet next weekend and have had great conversation so far on the app. His profile states that he is looking for a long-term relationship. Within the last 24 hours, I learned that I will have to relocate in two months for work. Should I\u2026 A)message him and tell him this, then ask if he still wants to get together or B)proceed with the date as planned since it is only a first date/our first time meeting? \nThank you!",

            "I sent out a rose to a standout. I responded to one of her prompts with hope of initiating conversation. She matched with me (to my surprise), but didn't respond to what I said. I tried to initiate a conversation again after we matched, and there was still no response. Has this happened to anyone? If so, what did you do?",
            "Sometimes I get matches, but most of the time they never seem to go anywhere.  The conversation fizzles out quickly, usually because the match is not very talkative, and my attempts to either engage in further conversation or set up an in-person meeting rarely ever go anywhere.  Why is this?  Why would someone go to all the trouble of matching with me, only to not respond when I try to talk to them?  Is this normal neurotypical behavior on their part, or am I just really boring?\n\nEDIT:  Also, yes, I know of the post on the FAQ, it doesn't help.  It's not normal, or at least shouldn't be, for this to be happening \\*consistently\\*."

            "Ah, finally a way to clean up the graveyard of dead matches effectively.\n\nQuality over quantity, this will be a wake-up call that it's a dating app meant to be used to connect to hopefully your next partner, not to collect matches like pokemon.",
            "Question to anyone with this update on their account: Does hitting the limit only stop you from sending likes, or does it also stop you from accepting incoming likes and making new matches?",
            "So after responding to a different post about a guy's match rate dropping, could this be a side effect of the limits?\n\nI would think it would push both men and women to be more selective, and there's definitely more fellas on the apps than the ladies.\n\nSo would the match rates for men drop off more than the match rates for women? Would they stay the same? Or would both rates drop equally?",
            "I usually unmatch someone within 72 hours anyway depending if it\u2019s a weekend holiday etc.  so this shouldn\u2019t change much for me",
            "Ehhhh women are just going to stop using the app altogether.",
            "What's the point of the update, you can just hide matches to avoid the limit. So people are less likely to get responses now.",
            "I think this is great. Sure, it may cause a reduction in Matches, but those were hollow Matches to begin with. Now a Match will become more meaningful, which is a good thing.\n\nOf course, the ideal solution would be to make it free to see all Likes. That\u2019s what\u2019s causing the hollow Matches problem in the first place. But this is a good second-best option.",
            "I believe this feature would get removed after a few months when hinge realises that the issue with dating burnout these days isn\u2019t because people are getting too many matches but because people have unrealistic standards which limiting the amount of people they can communicate with won\u2019t change. Even if women get more selective and chose specific men it won\u2019t get those men to commit or want to go on dates with them and the average joes who keep the app going and tend to get a date here and there off their consistency would leave the app entirely as they now get no matches. The idea of quality over quantity is massively overblown because that\u2019s not what\u2019s making dating difficult it\u2019s the unrealistic standards of people that\u2019s making dating difficult and that\u2019s something that hinge can\u2019t change no matter what new features they roll out.",

        "content": "I(37m) matched with someone(33f) on hinge two weeks ago. \n\nWhen we started talking we hit it off pretty quick. We shared playlists, horror movies that we liked, blah blah blah. You can imagine. \n\nI asked if I could get her number and plan a time to meet and she said \u201chere\u2019s my number. How does next Friday(today) sound? I said \u201cthat\u2019s a bit far out but hang on I\u2019ll text\u201d\n\nSo we texted. She explained she works early shifts, around 4am and ends up napping when she gets home and doesn\u2019t want to meet during the week because of it. She also said she had plans with friends that coming weekend so her next avail was the following week. I explained I usually don\u2019t like to wait that long because it builds up a ton of convo and anticipation and then it\u2019s a drain if you meet and don\u2019t click. But then I agreed anyway. \n\nSo for two weeks we talked nonstop. Like she didn\u2019t skip a heartbeat on a reply. We shared music and our thoughts on life with each other. At one point I suggested we pretend we were going on a roadtrip and make each other a playlist of our favorite songs. That was cute. \n\nLast week she thought I was ignoring her because one of my iPhone voice clips that I sent never got delivered. Said she was depressed all day and was sad thinking I ghosted her. So she seemed very into me.\n\nConvo ended up getting a bit hot and we agreed that if we met and hit it off, then maybe we get a room together because of where the convo was going. I mean realistically how much can you talk about in two weeks with someone you are vibing with. \n\nWell last night we get into a weird fight. Keep in mind up to this point we never had a disagreement. She said something like \u201comg I feel so bad for making you think that, I could jump off a bridge\u201d and I said \u201chaha don\u2019t joke about that! But if you do, wait until after we get that room on Friday \ud83e\udd23\u201d\n\nShe did not find it funny? Like she was very mad and we went silent for the day because I didn\u2019t know what to say. We had been having a lot of hot convo prior and it was just a joke. After hours of not texting she unmatched me on hinge.\n\nAfter I noticed, I texted her and asked why she did that. She said \u201cwhat\u2019re you doing on hinge buddy? Already looking for my replacement??? It shows. I did it to get your attention and it worked\u201d I told her that was weird and that I didn\u2019t like mind games. Told her I was joking. Then she love bombed me and was saying stuff all night like \u201cI\u2019m so attached to you I\u2019m sorry for overreacting\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t be able to control myself around you tomorrow\u201d \u201ccan I confess something, no, I want to say it in person, but I think you\u2019ll like it\u201d \u201cI want to be your baby girl\u201d like I think she was going to try and tell me she loves me in person\u2026 the confessing bit felt that way.  \n\nWe moved past the drama and said goodnight. \n\nToday she was getting ready to come meet me and she was sending one word replies. Said she was feeling low. Then out of nowhere she was like \u201cI just want you to know I still have my period and it\u2019s really bad\u201d so I said \u201cohhh bummer. I guess no fooling around today? Let\u2019s just meet and see what happens\u201d\n\nThen she texted me raging \u201cI KNEW THATS ALL YOU WANTED\u201d and I was like \u201c whoa what? I just said it was no big deal and we can just meet and see what happens\u201d and she started saying how I didn\u2019t genuinely want to meet her. That I just wanted to hookup. \n\nSo I said \u201cI think you\u2019re thinking too much. We are supposed to meet in an hour. Why are you picking a fight right now??\u201d\n\nThen she said \u201cf*** you, I don\u2019t want to meet anymore\u201d\n\nSo I was like \u201clisten, that\u2019s rude and I think you\u2019re misunderstanding me but talking to me like that is not cool. If you aren\u2019t going to meet me today then I think we should part ways.\u201d \n\nShe replied with \u201cgood luck\u201d\n\nSo I waited until I was about to leave to meet her and I said \u201clisten we\u2019ve been talking nonstop for two weeks straight. I\u2019m about to leave. Are we going to meet or not\u201d\n\nNo reply. \n\nSo I texted again and said \u201cif you\u2019re going to act like this then I\u2019m going to block you and move on\u201d \n\nNo reply. \n\nI replied with \u201c\u2026\u201d and it went through as undelivered because she blocked me instead. \n\nIdk what that was about. But there were red flags I should\u2019ve listened to. She didn\u2019t want to talk on the phone. She wouldn\u2019t send me a voice clip if I asked. She picked fights and then blamed me. \n\nIdk what that was but I just wasted two weeks of my life to be ghosted by a psycho. ",

            "So many red flags coming from both sides here. The issue isn\u2019t really that you had to wait two weeks to meet up, it\u2019s that you allowed yourself to get swept up in someone that you\u2019ve never met. You need to learn boundaries and emotional regulation. I\u2019m sure all the spicy sexting was fun but it\u2019s very clear to me that she was insecure and worried it\u2019s the only reason you were interested- why wouldn\u2019t you offer her some reassurance? Instead you accuse her of thinking too much?",
            "I mean, this was definitely your fault. It comes off as if you were leading with sexual motive, based on her appearance. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not the first man to find her attractive.\n\nYou were pushing boundaries that didn\u2019t need that much pushing, before ever meeting. In other words, you overdid it.\n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t crack jokes about having sex prior to meeting a woman I genuinely want to date, only after.\n\nAll of that being said, women who go from one extreme to another like this are never any good. They usually have their own internal issues and insecurities that need working through.\n\nIn the future, chill out a bit. If you think a woman is a bit out of your league, never let it show.",
