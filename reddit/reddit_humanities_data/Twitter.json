            "Add me to the list of permbanned accounts this morning. The suspicious me can\u2019t help but think it might be a way to tamp down information flow for tomorrow\u2019s debate.",
            "Add me as another account that was suspended on 06/25. What the heck is going on?",
            "Got suspended last June for telling my friend I was going to blow up his house in our Minecraft server. This was my second suspension. I managed to get unsuspended last. The ame day I was unsuspended, I had also submitted 3 other appeals that were all denied. \n\nOn the fourth one though, in addition to my regular spiel about why X is stupid for suspending me over that, I threatened to report them to the National Data Protection Authority in Poland for being in violation of the EU\u2019s GDPR by continuously failing to either provide me with an archive of my data, which is something I am legally entitled to as an EU citizen. I had requested an archive of my data multiple times over the past year to no avail, so I demanded to be unsuspended or emailed an archive of my data, and lo\u2019 and behold, I was unsuspended within 20 minutes. \n\nAccounts still pretty funky though. I can use it normally without issue, but every time I sign in I\u2019m met with a \u201cYour account is suspended\u201d notice.",
            "My account .@MoregainJP got randomly perma-banned last week with the following explanation:\n\n\"After careful review, we determined your account broke the X Rules. Your account is permanently in read-only mode, which means you can\u2019t post, Repost, or Like content. You won\u2019t be able to create new accounts. If you think we got this wrong, you can submit an appeal.\"\n\nI was never given any warnings, and read through the rules/TOS and didn't break any of the rules. My only thought is that one of the apps that I authorized access to my Twitter/X account was doing something shady, but it's hard to tell because there isn't any evidence given for the ban.\n\nHow can I get my account reinstated? All of my appeals just get auto-rejected within a few hours. I have $2000 that I can't access because the oauth integration is failing due to my account being suspended/banned.",
            "Just got my account permanently suspended for quite literally no reason\u2014I wasn't even notified of it and I didn't post anything bad, but when I tried to appeal it they immediately replied saying it was permanent and not coming back. I guess they just thought I was a bot? Shooting at the wrong guys, I guess. I'm thinking this is actually a good thing, though I might just make a new account solely to have one on hand but never actually use.",
            "I've been just stalking this thread for a little less than a week now, and the complaints about out of nowhere suspensions, along with automated emails 2 seconds after sending an appeal just keep piling on and on. I have not seen a single person genuinely get their account back from this sort of thing, and I'm in the exact same boat. Is there someone we can tag on Twitter maybe to bring the issue to attention, put it in front of eyes that could genuinely do something about this? Or is it just hopeless",

Go to drafts, post it again, nothing again.  Log out and back in, close and reopen the app, and still fucking nothing.\n\nThis is seriously pissing me off, and nothing works to solve this.

The world would be a vastly safer place if that were the case.  He\u2019s also a ghost for the British Crown \u2014 one of the best the Crown has ever had. \n\nAs an aside, Twitter\u2019s Optimus Prime profile is allegedly the social media interface for Elon Musk\u2019s Neuralink chip.  I wish that chip came with some sensitivity.  Alas it does not.  It comes loaded with entitlement tho.\n\nElon Musk is prepared to Sam Altman his way out of Twitter turning into a raging dumpster fire under Linda Yaccarino.  I\u2019ve seen enough to know that the bumbling geek routine is just one of the many facades Elon Musk dons when he needs to get his way.\n\nIt\u2019s been ~18 months since Elon Musk officially acquired Twitter.  He still has not released the Epstein List."
