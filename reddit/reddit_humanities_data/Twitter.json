They \\*Will Be Removed\\* and Locked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you're looking for more guidance on How To Get Your Suspended Account Back, [read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitter/wiki/suspended).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't forget to read our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitter/wiki/faq), and if you have information to add to it or something that needs updating, please feel free to make those changes!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile r/Twitter aims to be a community to help other Twitter users solve problems with the service, this also isn't the ideal place to ask support questions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSupport questions are preferably asked in this \"Open Discussion\" thread. If you've posted a thread asking for help and no one has responded, you may have better luck asking your question here instead.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you do have a functional (meaning: not locked or suspended) Twitter account, it can't hurt to let @ TwitterSupport know of your problem directly on Twitter dot com.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you are looking to promote your Twitter account to others, ask for followers, or any type of self-promotion, you can do so in this thread only.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe volunteer moderators who guide the direction of this subreddit rely upon the feedback of the community in order to make it a more perfect place on Reddit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFeel free to give that feedback in this thread, or if you'd prefer to give your feedback in private, \\[send a private message to the subreddit [modmail](https://new.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/Twitter).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf for some unholy reason you need to see  past open discussion threads, they are available [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitter/wiki/opendiscussions)",

            "Add me to the list of permbanned accounts this morning. The suspicious me can\u2019t help but think it might be a way to tamp down information flow for tomorrow\u2019s debate.",
            "Add me as another account that was suspended on 06/25. What the heck is going on?",
            "Just got my account permanently suspended for quite literally no reason\u2014I wasn't even notified of it and I didn't post anything bad, but when I tried to appeal it they immediately replied saying it was permanent and not coming back. I guess they just thought I was a bot? Shooting at the wrong guys, I guess. I'm thinking this is actually a good thing, though I might just make a new account solely to have one on hand but never actually use.",
            "I've been just stalking this thread for a little less than a week now, and the complaints about out of nowhere suspensions, along with automated emails 2 seconds after sending an appeal just keep piling on and on. I have not seen a single person genuinely get their account back from this sort of thing, and I'm in the exact same boat. Is there someone we can tag on Twitter maybe to bring the issue to attention, put it in front of eyes that could genuinely do something about this? Or is it just hopeless",
            "36 days, not a single response to any of my appeals.",
            "Elon musk really fucked this app and I wanna cry",
            "I've submitted 2 appeals for a random suspension I got and I haven't gotten any emails for two weeks now, is this normal?",
            "It's been 11 days and my account still isn't unsuspended. I've sent multiple ban appeals, but still no response. I've never made any posts, nor have I replied with anything offensive. I tried using a VPN, but that didn't work either. Is there any other way to get my account unsuspended?",

I made a brand new account in attempt to get away from that nasty crap and literally 3rd post down on my FYP was an OF chick promoting sexual content. I\u2019m probably going to end up having to delete the app at this rate since there like literally no way to avoid it.",

And what I mean by that is that every time I tweet or reply and add a gif, the app says \u201cpost not sent\u201d and asks me to go to drafts, retry, or pick ok.  Retry, nothing.  Go to drafts, post it again, nothing again.  Log out and back in, close and reopen the app, and still fucking nothing.\n\nThis is seriously pissing me off, and nothing works to solve this.  Once again, Musk is an idiot whose idiotic ideas fuck up the entire site.\n",

            "Yup. This is happening to me too. First i thought it was my laptop and internert connection and then it didn't woork on my phone on 5G so it was 100% a twitter issue. But, some people were still sharing gifs so it might not be all users",

The world would be a vastly safer place if that were the case.  He\u2019s also a ghost for the British Crown \u2014 one of the best the Crown has ever had. \n\nAs an aside, Twitter\u2019s Optimus Prime profile is allegedly the social media interface for Elon Musk\u2019s Neuralink chip.  I wish that chip came with some sensitivity.  Alas it does not.  It comes loaded with entitlement tho.\n\nElon Musk is prepared to Sam Altman his way out of Twitter turning into a raging dumpster fire under Linda Yaccarino.  I\u2019ve seen enough to know that the bumbling geek routine is just one of the many facades Elon Musk dons when he needs to get his way.\n\nIt\u2019s been ~18 months since Elon Musk officially acquired Twitter.  He still has not released the Epstein List.",
