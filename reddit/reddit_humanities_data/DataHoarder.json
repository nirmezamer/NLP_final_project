I imagine its best to use VPN, I'd have to create torrent, and upload somewhere. I get the workflow but if someone cab point to specifics that would be great.",

            "I would avoid seeding any copyrighted material, because:\na. It is rare that you cannot easily find torrents of 99,99% of all commercial (copyrighted) material. It would probably not add much value, since the material is already easily available, at least on niche torrent sites. (If your hoard consists of very rare material, for example movies, books or music from non-English-speaking, smaller countries, the situation is of course different)\nb. There is a risk that you end up in legal trouble. That risk gets larger due to the fact that you would need to seed material 24/7 for a very long time for it to make any difference. Yes, theoretically anyone that would download your data should start seeding it themselves, but in practice most downloaders avoid this.",

[NAS + Bittorrent client + VPN](https://drfrankenstein.co.uk/qbittorrent-with-gluetun-vpn-in-docker-on-a-synology-nas/),then you can create the torrents files from the client and use [a public tracker](http://www.torrenttrackerlist.com/torrent-tracker-list/) to share it",

        "content": "Hi all,\n\nI have been using LTO-4 for a few years in my home lab and it has worked great (and saved my butt a few times with hardware failures etc).\n\nHowever I have to manage a server that holds around 24TB currently (and growing by roughly a TB+ per month) of aviation videos. This server automatically backs up to Backblaze but I\u2019m uneasy about it being enough.\n\nI do at this point use my LTO-4 drive to back up very critical videos but in order to back up the entire server I\u2019d need some 30 tapes with another 2 needed every month (and while the drive still states 99% health on everything, it is quite old). \n\nLTO-5 on the other hand I would only need 16 and one new tape a month. I considered LTO 6 but it is quite a price jump and I\u2019m not sure if it is worth it?\n\nI have seen an LTO-5 tape drive (although it\u2019s out of a Quantum enclosure) for \u00a350.00 with a 90 day warranty. For tapes themselves I can either buy new for \u00a318.00 each or a box of 20 used for \u00a359.00 (although I\u2019m told used tapes are a bad idea).\n\nMy 2 questions are can autoloader Fiber attached tape drives be used with a SAS interface outside their enclosure (in a PC). And, is this a good deal or a terrible idea as a second backup for my data? The alternative is I\u2019m going to have to spend \u00a31000+ on several new hard drives to back this all up. But it gets difficult because to add more storage I have to add several more hard drives vs the convenience of just buying another tape.\n\nWhat\u2019s your opinions?\n\nThank you",
