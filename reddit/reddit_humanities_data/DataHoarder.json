        "content": "Hi r/DataHoarder crowd! We love your sub and would like to rev up another giveaway with the permission of the mod team.\n\n\nThe prize is: one 16TB IronWolf Pro Hard Disk Drive\n\n**How to enter:**\n\n**Just reply to this post once with a top-level comment response on the following topic:**\n\n**What kind of loyalty program matters to you for a company? Is drive capacity, price point, excellent customer service, etc. the highest priority for you? Please include the phrases RunWithIronWolf and Seagate in your comment.**\n\nSelection process/rules\n\nOne entry per person. Using alt accounts will result in a ban. New accounts created after this post went live are not eligible. Entries are open until June 27, 2024 at 23:59 UTC. We will use a random raffler utility to filter out top level comments (that is, top-level replies to this post, and not to another comment, and not on any cross-posts). The tool will remove duplicate usernames, sort the list, and grab the randomly chosen username, at which point the winner will be contacted within a day or so of the giveaway ending. Winners will have 48 hrs to get us their physical address and contact details for shipping (no PO boxes). Any person who does not reply in time loses their spot and everyone moves up a tier. For example: the 1st place person does not respond, so the 2nd place person gets contacted. Seagate will use the information strictly for shipping purposes only and will ship the drive directly. We reserve the right to edit this post including this process and these rules without notice. This is reddit, after all.\n\nGeographic restrictions:\n\nOur policy is for our forums and Reddit giveaways to be global where local shipping and/or giveaway restrictions/current world events don\u2019t prevent us, however we are basing the below list of eligible counties from previous giveaways, as some counties have unique restrictions (e.g. the obvious shipping restrictions to Russia and Belarus currently)\n\nUS\n\nCanada (will require a basic skills-based question if winner is chosen by law)\n\nBrazil\n\nSouth America\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\nFrance\n\nIberia\n\nAustralia\n\nNew Zealand\n\nKorea\n\nIndia\n\nMalaysia\n\nSingapore\n\nChina",

            "A lot of posts are saying that price is king, but that's how we get lousy service and things like the WD SMR fiasco.  Price per TB is definitely a factor, but even more important, to me, is transparency about specs, features, and performance.  The more technically detailed the datasheet the better.  That and good customer service are FAR more likely to bring me back more than saving $10.  I'm a big believer (from experience) in the \"buy cheap, buy twice\" motto and avoid \"budget\" brands for the \"quality/service\" brands.  RunWithIronWolf Seagate",
            "The first thing I look is price point, however that's just the first filter, excellent quality and customer support are very important and I'd argue that I define a base of quality and support first then decide looking at the price after. **RunWithIronWolf and Seagate**",
            "Price and reliability. Have never had a bad Seagate drive until recently when one of my 3x 12TB IronWolf NAS drives threw a ton of SMART errors after 4 weeks. RunWithIronWolf",
            "**What kind of loyalty program matters to you for a company?**\n\nNone.  The idea is, Seagate makes hard drives that don't suck, and I buy hard drives that don't suck for my servers.  Loyalty doesn't factor into it.  Making and selling products (in this case, hard drives) that work well and last does.\n\nStorage capacity per drive and price point aren't actually a loyalty program, they're two of a number of factors that go into deciding what to buy and who to buy it from.  For whatever it might be worth I look for a stable price point per drive of a certain capacity when I spec out hardware and stock up on replacements because it makes budgeting easier.\n\nI guess the \"RunWithIronWolf\" thing is supposed to make for a good hashtag, which Reddit doesn't use.  But, okay, there you go.",
            "Is \"RunWithIronWolf\" a marketing phrase?  I'm sure at least one of my drives is Seagate.  It was on sale.  Because pricepoint is importantest.",
            "Price point and reliability are tied at the top for me.\nI would love to give Seagate a chance to RunWithIronWolf as my current drives are not wolves  just red.",
            "RunWithlronWolf \n\nSeagate\n\n\nPrice. It's always price. Shit quality but low price? I'll treat them like they are disposable. High quality high price? Worth it. As long as a price point is good value, that is what is important",
            "Price point, which funny enough means that, at least being here in Canada, every mechanical drive in my server is Seagate of varying types.  WD just never had economical options in Canada.\n\nRunWithIronWolf",
            "0Hi Seagate Surfer these are always fun.\n\n  \nfor me it's\n\n  \n1) Price per terabyte *per watt*, because eletricity is expensive here.\n\n2) mechanical reliability, but most drives are pretty reliable these days\n\n3) support/RMA experience when there is a failure.\n\n#**RunWithIronWolf**\u00a0\n\n#Seagate",
            "Just because drive failures over time follow a bathtub curve, it doesn\u2019t mean that customer service should take the same approach. We\u2019ve all experienced companies working hard to get new customers, ignoring them once they\u2019ve made a purchase, and then bending over backwards to get them back when they finally get fed up enough to leave. The most blatant example being an ISP/TV/Phone provider that offers a sweetheart deal, immediately raises the rate as soon as the deal ends, then drops the price back down after you go through the hassle of cancelling.\n\nDon\u2019t do that. You don\u2019t have to flatten the curve, but it should at least be more of a vanity sink than a bathtub. Do more for your established customers and give them a reason to stay. For example, it\u2019s frustrating when a company\u2019s communication slows down or disappears once you\u2019ve purchased their product. Loyalty programs can be great, as long as they\u2019re transparent. Most seem to be just another way to obtain customer data. Solid warranties and tech-support are also important.\n\nPrice point is most important to me. It doesn\u2019t have to be the cheapest, but I consider all the factors when choosing the best value.  I will also add the phrases \u201cRunWithIronWolf\u201d and \u201cSeagate,\u201d because you asked so politely. You\u2019re welcome."

There was one band I _loved_ from the 00's, a tiny metal band called Erg Noor where it was just a Ukranian guy that released a half dozen albums on a webpage, no advertising or anything, just some bedroom recorded music for fun, and as far as I can tell those albums are completely lost to time outside a few songs on youtube.

            "One thing to learn from Reddit and Discord is that people are more likely to engage if they can be anonymous. I am much more likely to be authentic with people when I know it won't show up during a job interview. I'm much less active and engaged on Facebook or LinkedIn and assume any info I get there is sanitized to the point of ambiguity.",
            "I have a love/hate relationship with reddit.\n\nI love that it has so many active subs, but I really despise the management of it.",
            "Another thing that not even nearly enough people talk about is \"Fandom\", formerly Wikia.\n\nInstead of hosting their own instance of MediaWiki or similar, far too many people make their \"own\" wiki about their interest on fandom.com. And a huge chunk of pre-established big fan wikis of the past (previously running on MediaWiki or some similar engine) migrated there, too.\n\nThe obvious problem, just like with Reddit or Discord, is that it's centralized, and that Fandom outright owns the website and all of your Wikias.\n\nIt gets to dictate what the page layout will be like, and Fandom's pages are *ATROCIOUS* nowadays. There's a metric ton of unrelated banners for whatever brain goo hype-content-of-the-day, autoplaying videos about those unrelated topics and more shit like that. The page layout/design is a horrible ADHD mess. And you can't even browse image galleries normally anymore because someone at Fandom decided that the website should behave like an app. Every direct link to an image page is forcefully redirected to the main article page, so instead of clicking previews to open in a new tab, you're forced to view images in a pop-up thing on the original page. Also, a while ago they forcibly converted all pre-existing JPGs into WEBPs, which is *maybe* not necessarily a \"worse\" format on its own, but lossy->lossy conversion, especially of stuff that was already rare and probably in low resolution, is a crime.\n\nIt gets to dictate the content, too. The GTA wiki had an issue with transcripts of missions and dialogues from San Andreas because (naturally) they had the dreaded \"N-word\" which is somehow 100x worse than \"fuck\". Today Fandom doesn't like this, tomorrow it doesn't like anything that mentions celebrities / well-known people in any form, and your wikia about some movie series is suddenly gone.\n\nIf you and the hoster of your website start to disagree about some things, you can always pack up all your files and migrate to a different hoster. But you can't pack up a Fandom-hosted wikia, or a Reddit-hosted subreddit, with all of their accumulated content.",
            "Honestly as an anime fan, it's sad to see what has happened to MyAnimeList which was the go to site for anime experience. Now, r/anime's weekly engagements is far more than what you get there. I now check r/anime's episode discussions instead of MAL because it's simply just richer.\n\nAlso, of all the platforms, I personally hate discord, because it's just a black box and the rest of the internet can't know what is going on there unless you join.",
            "I hate to admit this is true even for myself.  I used to frequent so many forums throughout the years...  Hardocp, mmochamp, so many game and hardware forums, etc..  Now, just reddit. \n\nI absolutely despise Discord though, lol.  Such a God-awful layout.",
            "Reddit was one of the great repos, now every time I search for questions on google, a decent portion of the comments are either deleted or overwritten.",
            "At this point, I blame Discord as much as I do the people shifting to it.\n\nThey know they've become the host of a huge amount of important communities and information archives, yet they actively ban people for using archival tools to save and back up content and info.\n\nI get there's probably a lot of messy privacy concerns, but Discord needs to *officially* support some sort of export chat log tool."

            "Be warned with tapes - if the drive goes bad, you're in for some expensive repairs. They're enough of a niche market that repair companies usually charge 4 figures as a minimum.\n\nThere's only really two players in the field - IBM and Tandberg. I have drives from both, but mostly IBM (10 IBM, 2 Tandberg). I have 3 of their LTO-6s - one standalone and two for my TL2000 autoloader. One of the latter is faulty. The other two are fully functional. Because of how finicky tape drives can be, and the fact that you need basically the same generation drive to read its tapes, I make sure I always have two drives capable of reading any given tape.\n\nThe magnets don't wear out (they're electromagnets). What tend to wear out are the other mechanical parts - the internals of a tape drive are roughly watch-making (many, many tiny parts all moving in sequence). I've found there's a weakness in the IBM 3580 leader pin grabber (the arm that pulls the leader pin out of the tape cartridge) - two of my drives have this piece broken. I'm looking to 3D-print some replacements. There are other failure modes though - I have an LTO-4 that loads a tape but then gives a generic failure message that it doesn't recognise the tape, and an LTO-3 that won't load tapes, period. I'm keeping those for spares. I also have an LTO-7 that displays an infuriating SCSI error that I can't seem to find any information on - the drive starts writing fine, but then crashes.\n\nI have a Tandberg LTO-3 and an LTO-5. The latter just flat out doesn't work (diagnostics return failure). The former works fine. However, I haven't used the former drive for long enough to know how it'll behave.\n\nSo I have:\n\n10x IBM 3580s - 5 are functional, 5 are faulty.\n\n2x Tandbergs - 1 is functional, 1 is faulty.\n\nGiving me a nice 50% problem rate with both manufacturers! Even so, I prefer the IBM drives as their diagnostic tool, ITDT, is very comprehensive and runs on any platform.\n\nNote that tape drives will use a SAS interface so you will need a SAS HBA. And you will also need disks fast enough to drive them - often you want a RAID behind them because the tape will stop moving if the data isn't flowing, and that increases wear on it, so you need something able to throw data at the tape continuously without stopping to seek.\n\nTake this as fair warning that tapes are a difficult field to get into! My setup is starting to come together with Bacula as my backup software - it'll push data to tape as fast as the mechanism will allow (160MB/s for LTO-6). I have lots of different generations of tape I've collected over the years, about 200TB total. The different sizes actually make for convenient backups because I can choose to write entire tapes at once, which they're best at.",
