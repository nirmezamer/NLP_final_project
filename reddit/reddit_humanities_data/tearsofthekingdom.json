            "Definitely the Lurelin Village quests. Once things are in full swing it is such a helpful spot in so many ways!",
            "The Hateno Mayor election quest. \n\nEven though it's literally just a go around and talk to people quest, I enjoyed the nice change of pace. It was really nice to have a low stakes quest that takes you all over the village and gets you involved with all the people. Also when I first played it, I legit thought that we would have to actually pick one in the end and have that affect the village.",
            "Top 5 would be:\n\n1.Potential Princess sightings\n\n2. The seventh heroine \n\n3. The Stable Trotters \n\n4. All the Monster Crew questlines \n\n5. Kolton questline",
            "The monster brigade quest with Hoz, only because I was farming for Boko things in a camp, and his \u201cbattalion\u201d randomly showed up, and in the great words of Patrick Star, I went, \"WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE?!\"",

            "I don\u2019t think a quest exactly, but I was so into following the underground path from lookout landing all the way through to the castle. Was really thrilling to me. \n\n\nRunners up would be Hateno mayor election. Funny and, like someone else said, low-stakes. And the newspaper quest. Both Penn and the frog suit are pretty cool."

To date, I\u2019ve been entirely experimental when it came to cooking: just trying different ingredients together. Obviously that took time and was tedious occasionally, but it\u2019s gotta be done. \n\nTonight, I was clicking on ingredients like always, but suddenly it was like I had new eyes. I saw the \u201cselect for recipe\u201d option, and clicked it for the first time ever. And lo and behold, all the recipes pop up showing what I\u2019m missing per recipe, or what I can make right now. Clicking on one, I\u2019m dumbfounded as it auto-adds everything needed and I can cook it\u2026\n\nI laughed and told my husband, I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s taking me this long!
