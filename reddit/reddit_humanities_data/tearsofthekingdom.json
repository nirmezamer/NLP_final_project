Slower than normal speed movement, which cost batteries. 40 damage attacks, slower swing speed than great swords, can't be augmented with attack up, AND have a fuse durability of 15, when for normal weapons just fusing something gives it 25 durability. Can't even flurry rush now. Why exactly would I want what's basically a roadblock in combat, what with its meh idle attack, and absolute useless ride stance?

            "Have you tried attaching Zonai devices to her arms though? I put a cannon and shock emitters, set her loose on mobs and stay far away until they are weaker for me to attack. Saves my weapons and health.\n\nShes not meant to be piloted coz shes slow but I ride her to traverse gloom and break up Zonai deposits.",
            "Mineru is my Miner-U. I use her to break ore deposits and keep an inventory slot free that wpuld have housed a rock sledge. Also I fuse the gloom weapons to her so she actually deals some damage. Plus, you can use her to ride over gloom or shallow lava",
            "Shes more for utility. You have to get creative to get the full value of most things in this game. If thats not for you then thats completely fine.",
            "I agree, she's basically useless. I don't even use her when I'm fighting a large group of monsters, she just gets in everyone's way. She's slow and bulky. Honestly all of the Sage's can be a pain in the ass, but they have their uses. Mineru has no specific use, except maybe for smashing up sediment, but even then, Yunobo is much better for that job",
            "honestly, mineru's a big of wasted potention with me. A lot of the things that you can attach are useless, and the other half just turn her arms into hammers. \n\nWhen I first got her, I really wished I could attach whells an stuff to her feet so I can get around really fast, but alas that was not meant to be.",
            "Shes amazing for fighting phantom ganon. And walking over gloom.  And through mud or deep water. And makes big bokos go flying.",
