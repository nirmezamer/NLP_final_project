If you're a **third-party recruiter**, see the extra rules below.\n* **One** top-level comment per employer. If you have multiple job openings, that's great, but please consolidate their descriptions or mention them in replies to your own top-level comment.\n* **Don't** use URL shorteners. [reddiquette][] forbids them because they're opaque to the spam filter.\n* Templates are awesome. Please **use** the following template. As the \"formatting help\" says, use \\*\\*two stars\\*\\* to **bold text**. Use empty lines to separate sections.\n* **Proofread** your comment after posting it, and edit any formatting mistakes.\n\n---\n\n\\*\\*Company:\\*\\* [Company name; also, use the \"formatting help\" to make it a link to your company's website, or a specific careers page if you have one.]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\\*\\*Type:\\*\\* [Full time, part time, internship, contract, etc.]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\\*\\*Compensation:\\*\\* [This section is **optional**, and you can omit it without explaining why. However, including it will help your job posting stand out as there is [extreme demand][] from candidates looking for this info. If you choose to provide this section, it must contain (a range of) **actual numbers** - don't waste anyone's time by saying \"Compensation: Competitive.\"]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\\*\\*Location:\\*\\* [Where's your office - or if you're hiring at multiple offices, list them. If your workplace language isn't English, please specify it.]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\\*\\*Remote:\\*\\* [Do you offer the option of working remotely? If so, do you require employees to live in certain areas or time zones?]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\\*\\*Visa Sponsorship:\\*\\* [Does your company sponsor visas?]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\\*\\*Description:\\*\\* [What does your company do, and what are you hiring C++ devs for? How much experience are you looking for, and what seniority levels are you hiring for? The more details you provide, the better.]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\\*\\*Technologies:\\*\\* [Required: what version of the C++ Standard do you mainly use? Optional: do you use Linux/Mac/Windows, are there languages you use in addition to C++, are there technologies like OpenGL or libraries like Boost that you need/want/like experience with, etc.]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\\*\\*Contact:\\*\\* [How do you want to be contacted? Email, reddit PM, telepathy, gravitational waves?]\n\n---\n\nExtra Rules For Third-Party Recruiters\n--------------------------------------\nSend modmail to request pre-approval on a case-by-case basis. We'll want to hear what info you can provide (in this case you can withhold client company names, and compensation info is still recommended but optional). We hope that you can connect candidates with jobs that would otherwise be unavailable, and we expect you to treat candidates well.\n\nPrevious Post\n-------------\n\n* [C++ Jobs - Q1 2024](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/18w2e6a/c_jobs_q1_2024/)\n\n[reddiquette]: https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439\n[extreme demand]: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/sz0cd5/c_jobs_threads_should_include_salarycompensation/",

This includes:\n\n* a tool you've written\n* a game you've been working on\n* your first non-trivial C++ program\n\nThe rules of this thread are very straight forward:\n\n* The project must involve C++ in some way.\n* It must be something you (alone or with others) have done.\n* Please share a link, if applicable.\n* Please post images, if applicable.\n\nIf you're working on a C++ library, you can also share new releases or major updates in a dedicated post as before. The line we're drawing is between \"written in C++\" and \"useful for C++ programmers specifically\". If you're writing a C++ library or tool for C++ developers, that's something C++ programmers can use and is on-topic for a main submission. It's different if you're just using C++ to implement a generic program that isn't specifically about C++: you're free to share it here, but it wouldn't quite fit as a standalone post.\n\nLast month's thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/1cilqq4/c_show_and_tell_may_2024/",

            "I wanted to make 2d physics games and harness the power of a library called box2d. I jumped from pygame a python framework for making game to using cocos2dx(uses c++) because I discovered box2d was written in c++. At that time i didn't know any c++ so I started following the tutorials of cocos2dx, and boy was it hell especially the code snippets. The only motivation was that atleast all the examples in the the tutorials were working when I tried them. It took me close to a year to understand the cocos2dx API, at that time as well I started reproducing some of the examples in the tutorials on my own, looking through github projects of games of interest just to get alot familiar with the framework and c++ also started getting easier to understand because I was practically learning it by working on a project. Eventually i learnt how to use box2d and do incredible projects just like in the link above. \n\nTL;DR. As others keep saying, pick a project of interest that you could show off to your peers and get working and learning. Dont forget to also use resources like learncpp to gain best practices. I forgot to say it somewhere but I jumped onto learncpp only to polish my earlier bad practices and learn what I didn't know.",
