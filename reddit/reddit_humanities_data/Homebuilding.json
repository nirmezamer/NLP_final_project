Usually, it\u2019s brick facade that wraps the first floor, then a massive roof line, then the second floor kinda pops out of the roof. What\u2019s the deal with that?",

            "Because snow",
            "You need a good pitch on the roof to handle the weight of snow.  Which, on a modern build footprint ends up meaning fairly high peaks.  Easier then to tuck the second floor into that roof space and throw in some dormers than to raise the  eaves.",
            "Beautiful architectural elements are expensive.",
            "Often it's snow.. \nYou want that stuff coming down.\nI have relatives in the Midwest and a lot of those harms are very charming. My home is here in the southwest and we have a lot of tile Spanish roofs.",
            "Like others have said, snow is a big thing, but also that quite a few houses have basements because of tornados. Most people don't feel like they need a 2nd floor when they've got a full basement to work with too",
            "Various formal reasons in terms of actual shedding water, snow, heating and cooling or whatever. BUT the crux of the question to me is \"why isn't it better?\".  \nIn my opinion (having grown up there and seen the industry now for 15+ years). Its 100% due to the way single family homes are built. Blame DR Horton, Pulte, Lennar, KB Homes, etc. These are the people that have virtually zero incentive to improve anything that they do. The industry is slow moving and as a business model, they are doing everything they possibly can to cheap out and skimp every corner. Ask anyone who has bought a built home by these people --- they are awful. Furthermore, design wise, when working with places like this, you want the most broad appeal to not ostracize anyone. Any element you put onto a home could steer away a potential buyer. Its why everything is as boring vanilla-middle-of-the-road as you can get. This strategy is also why high rises in cities are middle of the road, and sometimes every-other-floor employs different aesthetics slightly to attract a wider group of buyers.\n\nYou will find great homes done custom by architects and custom builders, however the amount <1% probably (guessing no idea in reality) is so small that they dont enter the public mind and public really doesn't get much exposure to them (unless you read design blogs and whatnot). Even if you do have exposure tho, they cost more for quality (much of the quality hidden such as insulation, waterproofing, etc), so its tough to obtain. Even if you want a modest great home with a flat roof or something else --- its hard to find GCs with experience in it, which ultimately leads to a price premium regardless.\n\nHence the wheel keeps going round and people are forced to keep buying shitty homes.",
            ">then a massive roof line, then the second floor kinda pops out of the roof. What\u2019s the deal with that?\n\nSo you see a lot of Cape style homes with dormers in other words? Probably because its cheaper to build that way than a full second story and a lot of modular homes are built this way too now.\n\nEverything comes down to $$$. Nice, architectural, and trendy tend to blow up budgets.",
            "Snow and wind.\n\nWind is counterintuitive. The high slope reduces lift.\n\nIn the coastal areas they use brackets and tie it all down to the foundation. But once you add in the snow loading the path of least resistance is pretty clear.",
            "Around here all new builds are black and white McMillenials (modern farmhouse).",
            "Building the second floor under the roof is less expensive than building full two story exterior walls and facing them with brick, stucco, stone, or even siding. That\u2019s what my builder clients always say."

There\u2019s no way everyone in the house is going to be wanting to jam out to the same thing at the same time. Everyone just uses headphones nowadays. I don\u2019t blast music unless I\u2019m working out anyways.\n\nI\u2019m wondering if we decide to sell in years to come if it will continue to be looked at as outdated and undesirable. \n\nAm I missing something?

            "AV designer here. These days houses still get audio distribution, but mostly with small aperture speakers that match the small size and shape of the downlights in any particular room. Nobody likes giant 10\u201d speakers pockmarking their ceiling in every room, but it\u2019s a whole lot cheaper to just install newer style flangeless ceiling speakers than patching and painting the holes in your ceiling and deleting that built in feature. Go buy 5 Sonos amps and a couple Alexa dots or whatever and enjoy what happens when you say \u201cHey Alexa, play Skynyrd in the Master Bathroom\u201d whenever you\u2019re getting ready.",
            "IMO, desirable. Many won\u2019t care. Most will view it as a cool upgrade that they won\u2019t pay much if any more for.",

Could be good while cleaning the house.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0And of course, partying.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0I wouldn\u2019t view it as a negative unless it was a hazard in some way.\u00a0",
            "Are you sure it's not zoned? Wired audio was excellent then, very likely it's better than what a new system would look like.",
            "sonos is imploding. old wired system is nice",
            "Even if it\u2019s all wired to one receiver you can pull it and zone it with Sonos/Sonance amps. Everything would be wireless and you can play different music to different areas or jam all of them when you want. Christmas and Halloween party\u2019s it\u2019s nice to have background music",
            "I use whole-home audio all the time with my HomePods. It's super nice to be able to do all sorts of chores without the music ever going away, without needing to put on headphones. It would be even better if it tracked where I was and only played where I was at the time, but I guess that feature is for another day, when the technology to make it happen, eventually gets productized.\n\nAlso, parties - nothing helps set the mood throughout the entire place more than good ambient music.",
            "I think you are referring to wired whole home audio? I prefer wireless and there are so many options now. We declined wired audio on our new build and used Sonos indoor and outside instead.",
            "I think a wired audio system is kind of outdated, it was a big deal 20 years ago and no one's going to pay a premium for it these days but no one's going to think the house is worse for having it either.  We have whole house audio but it's wireless and controlled by room via an app.  We use it frequently but the only time the whole house is playing the same music is when there's a party or at Christmas.   I'll put on the same music in two or three rooms if I'm going on between them doing some project."
