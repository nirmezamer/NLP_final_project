It is a bit more professional than the typical /r/beermoney site. You work for \"requesters\" and they can approve or reject your submitted tasks, also known as HITs. You can earn a lot more money on this site than other typical /r/beermoney sites, but you need to pay attention to which jobs you accept. Not all HITs pay well. They do require some sensitive information from you for tax purposes. Not everyone gets approved to work here, and some people will be approved months or years after being rejected. \u2014 [Payment Proof.](https://i.imgur.com/i5auojO.png)\n \n^(*This site is international, but most of the tasks are only available for the USA. International users can only redeem Amazon.com balance.)\n\n>\u21aa Age minimum: 18\n\n>\u21aa Offers: A large number of tasks including Surveys, Transcription, Translation, Website Testing, Data Entry and much more.\n\n>\u21aa Payout: [Minimum $0.01] Payments go directly to your bank account.\n \n>*^(Note: All earnings are in USD, regardless of your country.)*\n\n>\u21aa Referral Incentive: None\n\n>**TIPS:**\n\n>\u2022 Only do HITs that pay at least 10\u00a2/minute. This gives you a rate of $6/hour. Mturk crowd forum and /r/hitsworthturkingfor are good places to check for higher paying HITs.\n\n>\u2022 It is better to return a HIT than to submit to if you are unsure whether the requester will approve it. Returning a HIT will not negatively affect you, but a rejection will.\n\n>\u2022 [Scripts are allowed and encouraged.](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts?q=mturk) Checked /r/mturk for more tips and suggestions.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##**[UserTesting](https://www.usertesting.com/)** [International*]\n\nUserTesting is a usability testing site. You get paid to record your screen and speak aloud while performing a number of specified tasks. These tasks are generally related to testing a website or an app, but some tests may have you complete a survey, play a game, test new software, etc. At the start you may receive $3 sample tests, but after a while you will see $10 unmoderated tests. Moderated tests start at $30 per test, and usually require you to have a webcam. Payment arrives via PayPal exactly 7 days after your test is completed. \u2014 [Payment Proof.](https://i.imgur.com/vxbUx1z.png)\n\n^(*The site is International, but most earning opportunities are for US, UK, CA and AU.)\n\n>\u21aa Age minimum: 18\n\n>\u21aa Offers: Usability testing\n\n>\u21aa Payout: [Minimum: None] PayPal\n\n>\u21aa Referral Incentive: None.\n\n>**TIPS:**\n\n>\u2022 Completing the unpaid surveys at the top may qualify you for additional tests.\n\n>\u2022 Make sure to follow instructions carefully, keep talking, and be professional. Keeping a high quality rating is essential if you want to receive plenty of tests.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#Cash Back From Shopping Online\n\nThese sites give cash back on your online purchases. Online purchases require you to click their affiliate link prior to shopping. Ebates US has in-store offers as well. In-store purchases require you to link a debit/credit card and to active the offer prior to shopping. Most of these sites are International, but your shopping opportunities may be limited, and you will only get paid in the associated currency. \u2014 [Ebates Payment Proof.](https://i.imgur.com/1f91wdT.png)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>**TIPS:**\n\n>\u2022 Make sure to click on the \"Shop Now\" or \u201cGet Cashback\u201d button before adding items to your cart. Otherwise, your shopping trip may not count.\n\n>\u2022 You can only use one shopping portal per shopping trip. Attempting to use more than one may cause problems crediting your account.\n\n>\u2022 Disable any ad blockers while shopping.\n\n>\u2022 For US Users: Sometimes you can earn more cash back on Ebates or TopCashBack than the other for a particular store. Check both sites if you want to get the most cash back for each purchase.\n\n>\u2022 **For TopCashBack UK Users:** New users are automatically enrolled into the Plus membership. Downgrade to the Classic membership to avoid being charged \u00a35/year.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n||[Rakuten (Ebates) US](https://www.rakuten.com/r/MIKARO23?eeid=28187)|[TopCashBack US](https://www.topcashback.com/ref/bluesnowflake)||[Rakuten (Ebates) Canada](https://www.rakuten.ca/referrer?referrerid=aWz4X4HoEuQ%3D)|[Ebates KR](https://www.ebates.com/kr/)|[Rebates JP](https://www.rebates.jp)|[TopCashBack UK](https://www.topcashback.co.uk/ref/bluesnowflake)|[TopCashBack IN](https://www.topcashback.in)|[TopCashBack \u4e2d\u6587](https://www.topcashback.cn)|\n:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n|**Age**|18|18?||18|18|18|18|?|?|\n|**Payout Minimum**|$5.01|$0.01||$5.01 CAD|KRW 5,001|?|\u00a30.01|\u20b90.01|$0.01|\n|**Payout Types**|Check, PayPal|VISA, PayPal, ACH, Gift Cards||Check, PayPal|Bank, PayPal, Naver Pay|?|Master Card, PayPal, BACS, Gift Cards, British Airways|Amazon Pay, NEFT, Paytm|PayPal, Amazon, UnionPay|\n|**New User Bonus**|$10|$10||$5 CAD|KRW 5,000|?|?|\u20b9100|?|\n|**Referral Incentive**|$25|$10||$10 CAD|KRW 5,000|?|\u00a35.00|\u20b9200|$10|\n\n^(Some information is missing due to translation difficulties and signup problems.

Keeps doing debt swaps (cash to BAP). Do not post.\n\n\u2716 **[Neobux]( http://www.neobux.com)** \u2014 It isn\u2019t *really* a scam, but they operate as a pyramid scheme. There\u2019s money to be made online, but it\u2019s definitely not there.\n\n\u2716 **[MarketGlory]( http://www.marketglory.com)** \u2014 It does pay out, but the pay is absolutely ridiculous. The only way to make a decent amount of money is to have a lot of referrals, and referral whoring on this subreddit WILL result in a permanent ban.\n\n\u2716 **[MindSumo](https://www.mindsumo.com/)** \u2014 Not actually a /r/beermoney site. It\u2019s only spam in this sub.\n\n\u2716 **[G2A](https://www.g2a.com/)** \u2014 Scam/sells stolen keys.\n\n\u2716 **[Quickthoughts](https://www.quickthoughtsapp.com/)** \u2014 Many reports of people being banned when trying to withdraw as of 10/2018. Do your due diligence before possibly wasting your time on this app.\n\n\u2716 **Sites with $100+ minimum** \u2014 These sites usually offer higher than normal payments for simple tasks, with a high minimum to cash out. They are *always* scams.\n\n\u2716 **Generic news sites** that pay you ridiculous amounts to read an article (two euros??) \u2014 Common sense should take care of this, but in case it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s always a scam. The site is usually hosted somewhere in Eastern Europe, and you will never get paid.\n\n\u2716 **Free bitcoin sites/\"faucets/cloud mining\" (THIS INCLUDES QOINPRO)** \u2014 This is not referring to those video-viewing/task sites (although they\u2019re still paying fragments of a penny). I\u2019m talking about sites that give you 0.000001BTC to fill a captcha (freebitco.in, dailybitcoins). Admittedly many beermoney sites pay low, but don\u2019t even bother with these.\n\nAlso: *Bitcoin mining is NO LONGER PROFITABLE.* If you're really so keen on getting bitcoins, doing so through an exchange is your best option.\n\n[Here are a few more scam sites and sketchy sites.](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/wiki/faq/sites/scams)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n---\n\n---\n \n&nbsp;\n\n^(Please note that presence on this post does not imply that /r/beermoney or its moderators endorse the site or their views, actions, or policies.

Im sunsetting my beermoney career, which has done great things for me, but others are still making lots of money with this. Ive just turned my attention to futures day trading, my youtube channel and the MightyOxTrading merch store.. these things are now a better source of income than beermoney  \n&nbsp;  \nThere are two general things I want to chat about though that dont have to do with earnings.   \n&nbsp;   \nThe first is Mturk. I get a lot of questions about Mturk each month. And I dont mind helping and answering questions so dont think im complaining. BUT.. I have written an Mturk 101 that might answer a lot of questions you might have. Its linked on the right hand side of this subreddit.   \n&nbsp;   \nThe second thing is people from countries other than the US contacting me. Again I certainly dont mind, but I really have no idea what works in other countries. Its just not something I have the time to keep up on. And I hate that there arent many options for people outside of the US/UK/CA. Its heartbreaking when someone says just $25 a month would make a big difference and I dont know where to refer them to. SO if you arent from the US.. I honestly dont know how to help you but wish I could  \n&nbsp;  \nSo thats my May.

And I dont have much advice for even outside the USA.  \n  \n&nbsp;  \n  \n**How Much Time do you spend with this?**   \nIts Hard to quantify. I am in front of a computer ALOT but its not always focused on making money. I have games I play and have scripts that watch for HITs ON Mturk so if something pops thats good I switch over. Plus Im often doing multiple things at once. That said.. there are people who make more then me with less time. Im actually very inefficient.   \n\n&nbsp;  \n**Why dont you get a real job?**   \nHealth issues.. and I can nap at 1PM.. and I dont have a boss looking over my shoulder... and I can work naked (I dont.. or do I....)   \n \n\n&nbsp;  \n**You must have a ton of referrals to make that much!**  \nAll the totals above represent only personal earnings. I seperate out ref earnings. \n \n&nbsp;  \n**OMG! You must cheat somehow to make so much!**  \nI do nothing outside the TOS of any of the programs. I consider this income to be a blessing and wouldnt do anything to jeopardize that. Plus cheating just kills programs and defrauds the companies that are allowing me to make this income.   \n&nbsp;  \n  \n**Do you have to pay taxes on all of this**  \nYes on most of it. There are some exceptions but the majority of this income is taxable. Most of these companies dont issue 1099s but that doesnt mean you dont have to pay taxes. Please consult a tax professional if you have questions on how to handle taxes on \"beermoney\" income",
