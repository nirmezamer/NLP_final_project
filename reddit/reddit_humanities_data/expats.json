It appears like the federal government could become paralyzed if things in this manifesto are actually executed. \n\nFellow US citizens abroad, are you concerned about a disruption to passport renewal services? Mine expires in 2026 but I feel like I should jump the gun and renew now... just in case",

            "you can renew now or in 2025, get the big version for the visa pages.",
            "I think that it is nothing wrong with renewing a passport before the expiration date. If you suddenly need to have s long term tourist visa, work visa, student visa or anything else, or is better to have a new passport which will not expire before the visa does.",

            "While project 2025 is nuts, I dont think that every branch of government will cease to function overnight. If you will sleep better having it renewed then perhaps its worth it.",
            "I am living in the UK. I am registered to vote in November, I actually just received my new voter card. My passport doesn't expire until 2029. If The Convicted Felon is somehow elected to second term, I will most likely get my British citizenship. I am planning to return to the USA next year, but if he wins there won't be anything to go back to. Please vote Democrat straight down the ballot!",
            "Yes, I am concerned and you are also correct to be worried. If I were you, I'd recommend getting on the renewal process asap, as they may fire immigration staff and just gum up the process.",

It\u2019s true in the UK and also in wider Europe. \n\nOn the one hand, they complain they don\u2019t have enough money, everything is expensive, wages are too low, tax is too high, public services are too bad. \n\nAnd then on the other hand, they hate people who make more than them. The level of jealousy and envy is something I never experienced elsewhere. Anyone who makes more than anyone is automatically greedy, out of touch, exploitative of society. And I\u2019m not even talking about millionaires, they think anyone who makes 100k must be so rich. \n\nAnd then they\u2019d talk about how they would never give up their work life balance for more pay, money isn\u2019t the only thing in life, it\u2019s important to spend time with your children. Workaholism is an American disease. \n\nThen complain about how raising children is expensive, everything costs too much and there isn\u2019t enough government support. \n\nBut don\u2019t tax me more, tax the next guy more, and when the next guy says taxes are too high here, I\u2019m gonna leave. \u201cSayonara, you don\u2019t contribute to society anyway.\u201d\n\n\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n",

Which I can't seem to land (I'm in the space industry) due to my nationality.\n\nSorry for this rant. I'm just extremely upset that it's something I have no control over and that it's very hard to change my current situation.

I went with my partner and was on a youth working visa and arrived in 2019 (6 months before COVID hit). Apart from COVID my partner and I absolutely thrived in London, we loved living in a big city, we travelled almost every weekend we made the most of it and were doing things on a daily basis. We both have professional jobs and were able to make career advances in our both of jobs. We ended up coming back to after 3 years due to our visa being up and not sure if we wanted to go down the sponsorship route. \nWe have now been back for 2 years, built a house and started a business but after all this time we still find ourselves wondering what it would be like to be back, wishing we could move back and finding it very hard to settle back into our hometown. We are not finding that we\u2019re enjoying the things we thought we would and live in a constant state of unknown about whether we\u2019ve made the right decision. We have a lot of family in our hometown that were close to and we\u2019re probably thinking about having kids in the next year or so.\n\nHas anyone tried to come home and moved back to where they were or somewhere different? Did anybody make the move when they had kids and moved away from their family again? I guess I know the grass is always greener and I wouldn\u2019t be moving back in my mid 20s, a lot of my friends have left so it would be quite different but really missing the lifestyle and the city and was wondering if anyone has done a similar thing. \n\nThanks!
