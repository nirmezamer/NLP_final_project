Also want to be able to be able to properly enjoy the game without spending money beyond a sub, if I can easily buy a sub with IG currency that's a bonus.",

I'd love to play something where the combat is a lot slower and grindier in raids/dungeons/etc. where you need to ration your mana and focus on healing certain people over others instead of just spamming everyone",

I don't really know anything about Classic and Retail at this point as it's been a long time. Can someone give me a brief description of which one I should go for in this day and age. Is Classic just nostalgia bait or is it actually fun? Is Retail just a theme park similar feeling to XIV?",

Ive never gotten into MMOs before but I play videogames a lot and I know the general play style of a MMO and am willing to put a decent amount of time and effort into one. I would prefer if its free. Other than that I have no other restrictions or things Id like to exclude."

For those who don't know me, I was the original lead designer for Ultima Online, and responsible for most of the sandboxy features in the game. I was also the original director of Star Wars Galaxies, so you can blame me for dancing Wookiees and player housing (but I was off the project by the time of the NGE, so you can't blame me for that... ;) )\n\nI have been working away at a new MMO called STARS REACH, and we just announced it this morning. You can find info about the game at http://www.starsreach.com.\n\nThis is the game I have wanted to make for nearly thirty years. It is the spiritual sequel to *Ultima Online* and to *Star Wars Galaxies*. It has in it all the lessons of all these decades of online game development -- and it looks forward, not back, to reinvent what an online world can be.\n\n*Stars Reach* uses simulation to a degree never seen in an MMO before. We know the temperature, the humidity, the materials, for every cubic meter of every planet. Our water actually flows downhill and puddles. It freezes overnight or during the winter. It evaporates and turns to steam when heated up.\n\nAnd not just our water -- *everything* does this. Catch a tree on fire with a stray blaster bolt. Melt your way through a glacier to find a hidden alien laboratory embedded in the ice. Stomp too hard on a rock bridge, and watch out, it might collapse under your feet. Dam up a river to irrigate your farm. Or float in space above an asteroid, and mine crystals from its depths. And this works *everywhere*, it's not special-cased handcrafted moments.\n\nIt is also NOT DONE. The graphics need a LOT of work still, there's plenty of development left to do on gameplay in general, and loads of optimization ahead. But we feel it's important to get players involved in the dev process, and it's time. We're gearing up for testing this summer, and will be doing fairly open development from here on out.\n\nLooking forward to answering your questions!",

            "Through everything you and your team has been working on, what would you say is your single favorite feature you want implemented in Stars Reach?",
            "Hey everyone, thanks so much for all the questions. I am at the 90 minute mark, so I need to stop. But I do hang out and reply on r/MMORPG fairly regularly, so you will see me around for sure! Looking forward to sharing more about Stars Reach as time goes on.",
            "What are the best ideas you think Star Wars Galaxies had that you really want to iterate on and what are the ideas you think didn't work so well? Bonus question, are there are ideas you think didn't work well in SWG but could work today with tighter design and modern tech?",
            "Hi Ralph, big fan of your blog. Excited to see where you go with this. \n\nCan you share who your target audience is for this game? Also, are you working with any publishers or other studios in the industry?",
            "How far do the building and terrain modification systems go?  Are skyscrapers and a player-made Coruscant city possible?  How about a player-made Mines of Moria?",
            "From the videos, we get to see some blasters and ranged combat but no melee. Will there be melee combat like swords etc in the game?",
            "Hey Raph! We've seen a lot of \"if you build it they will come\" type games, like Crayta, Core, and more recently Everywhere. How does Stars Reach differ in it's approach, and how will you attract an initial audience before there's a critical mass of player content?",
            "I started my MMO journey with EQ, EQOA, and SWG. Those games were all time sinks, and the genre has shifted away from that in the decades since, respecting player time more with solo friendly features but at the expense of community. How are you designing Stars Reach to reintroduce the community to MMORPG while still respecting the shift in player sentiment?",
            "Hiya Raph!  Will some kind of creature taming or handling be a possibility.  I know the Creature Handler was one of your works in SWG.  Pets are always popular of course, but being able to interact with them and have them work alongside you adds a whole new dimension to them.\n\nReally amped about this though.  Thanks, Lantyssa."

And it's a shame knowing how much development time must be going into those. And this whole \"commander\", \"wayfinder\", hero type thing is so out of place in MMOs, I hate it.\n\nJust give us new maps/events and I'll be happy. If I want to play a hero story I'll find a single player game or read a book.",

            "Story was the best part for me.",
            "Agree. I tried to get into it a while back, but just came to the same conclusion as you. I just skip it all now, don't really care about what happens."
