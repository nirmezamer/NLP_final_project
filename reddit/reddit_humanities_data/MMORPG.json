            "I\u2019ve pretty much never played an MMO, opting for single player experiences instead.\n\nI wanna get into it, and I don\u2019t even mind crazy grinding. Just something with a pretty active player base, classic game style (ex. Fighting Bosses, Joining Groups, Talking To Players). \n\nMy big thing is that, being able to chat with people. And fight. That\u2019s about it.\n\nDND style, if that provides any sort of clarity.",
            "Are there any MMOs that aren't massive timesinks and don't have a ton of menial grinding tasks? I'm too busy to play an MMO with a big time commitment. Right now I'm playing a mobile territory clan game which is nice for the easy pick up and play aspect but the active gameplay is not satisfying since it's all idle task dispatching. Ideally I'd like an idle aspect to replace the grindy bits while still having a actual gameplay for when you can sit down and properly play.",
            "Looking for a game with a lot to discover, where information isn't widely available. Where I can make [stories like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJVRgun7M7c) simply because no one knew it would happen, as opposed to modern wow where all the fun is optomized out before I can even get to it",
            "I'm in the mood for an older, slower fantasy MMO that has a relatively active (talkative) community and isn't on the verge of shutting down. Bonus points if the UI and controls are easily modified to suit modern sensibilities.",
            "Looking for an MMO since New World went kaput, that would be the same style.",
            "Are there any mmos out there where the grind is not super boring / repetitive / etc ?\n\nWhat I mean is something for instance with procedural map generation so even if there's grind, its interesting with random or new things happening rather than going in a circle repeating the same content.\n\nOr maybe even if there's no precedural map, the game design is in a way where the grind is actually fun rather than tedious and boring.\n\nI am yet to find a MMO where grind does not fill like a tedius / excruciating chore",
            "I'm looking for a MMO where somebody who is effectively allergic to trivial difficulty, rotations, and copying builds off a website can still have reasonably fun with other players in PvE group content.",
            "Hello! Does anyone know of a game similar to Silkroad in terms of using bots? To give a brief explanation for those who haven't played it, you would create a party of 8 characters, which had to include a cleric, a warrior, and the damage dealers. You would set up the party so that each character fulfilled their role, and they would stay botting 24/7 to level up.\n\nThe game doesn't have to be an MMORPG; I'm just looking for something with that bot system where I can leave it farming and watch it \"auto-play.\" The closest I've found is Rusty's Retirement, but I'm looking for more games of that style.",
            "I\u2019ve never actually played an mmorpg although I do follow a little bit about what\u2019s going on with wow and had friends back in the day that played EverQuest (I\u2019m old). Funny enough, I just never had internet at home until I was an adult and just wrote it off as having missed the boat but they\u2019re still around so I\u2019m thinking I might give one a shot. \n\nEverQuest looks way too clunky so I\u2019m torn between wow and guild wars but I\u2019m open to any suggestions. I enjoyed the elder scroll games in the past so maybe eso would be a good pick too. \n\nWhat I do know that I want is something social and from the outside, it looks like that just isn\u2019t really the case anymore with a lot of games. I don\u2019t want silent side by side play that may as well be with a bot."

            "Basically, if you're sick of the same old Themepark MMOs with the minimum social aspects - you should keep an eye for Playable Worlds (which has been under development for 5 years it seems). \n\nRaph is one of the veterans of the genre, and he was been the creative director for Star Wars Galaxies - one of the best Sandbox MMOs that was ever made for the Western market. \n\nIt looks like the upcoming game will follow the same elements of Star Wars Galaxies: A game where players can fully enjoy even if they chose to focus on their profession (weapon smither for example) and not spending 90% of their time fighting.\n\nThe typical leveling also seem to be out of the menu. Instead (theoretically, we still don't know much about this game) you'll be able to level up different skills separately. So for example, its not about your character level, but your level in 2H Swords that will give you new abilities.   \n  \nIf they'll take Star Wars Galaxies path - you won't have a story-driven MMO like many other Themepark MMOs have. Instead, the story is what you make of it, because you'll have a lot of freedom with your character. \n\n**Here are a few quotes from their latest teases:** \n\n\"What if... you could actually invent new things in an MMO?\"\n\n\"What if... there was a way to discover secrets in an MMO -- and no easy wiki holding all the answers?\"\n\n\"What if... it rained, creating puddles that froze overnight?\"\n\n\"What if... bad weather meant traveling through the mud?\""

        "content": "I gave it a good try, got 5 classes to max level (level 20 takes like 45 mins honestly) and this game is just way more mobile than it is PC. I think my biggest problem with the game is all the classes play almost exactly the same.\n\nYou essentially get 7 skills:\n\nSkills 1-2 are basic generator for your class mechanic\n\nSkill 3-4 are stronger attacks with slightly longer CDs do more damage\n\nSkill 5 is AOE\n\nSkill 6 is self damage buff\n\nSkill 7 is ultimate\n\nThe skills pretty much function the same across all classes (Ex. Generator skills on warrior increase rage -> Spending rage on skills 3-4 = more damage, Generator skills on rogue increase poison -> spending poison mechanic on skills 3-4 = more damage.)\n\nAlso you don't have many skills, which is fine, but there's really not much thought behind why you are using them. If the skill has a CD you are most likely pressing it off CD no matter what. This turns combat into just a spammy mess where you are staring at your action bar making sure to press the buttons that light up as they come off CD.\n\nI have no input on the P2W/lore/social/exploration. The gameplay/combat is just way too mobile(simplified) to get past.\n\nI don't want to seem bias so I'll throw some positives out - the UI is extremely clean and the entire thing can be customized (target frames etc.) Built-in damage and healing charts are pretty cool too. Servers were very stable.\n\nIf anybody has any questions I'll answer what I can.",

Walk a couple steps and someone appears out of thin air in front of you\n\n- $60cad skin in shop LMAO. It don't even look good\n\nGonna keep playing for a bit and see how it goes, but it doesn't feel like a polished game so far.\n\nedit: thought of more\n\n- character customization is next to non-existent \n\n- ~~aoe skills can't be ground targeted and can only be centered around a targeted enemy~~\n\n- fatigue system for crafts/gather",

            "I went in blind, and was very disappointed. It's just another mobile game with a sub menu under a sub menu under another sub menu, with one currency/token to operate each sub menu, 4 hours was all it take for me to uninstall.  Just like any other MMORPGs mobile .",
            "It just felt so limited to me.  I know it will change a little as they open up more content but today's experience was really bad.  You just run out of stuff to do so fast.  Do a couple dungeons and you're locked out of rewards.  Do 2 battleground and you don't get rewards.  You literally get 3 minutes worth of \"vigor\" to do professions each day.",

It felt nothing like it to me in any respect, except for the obviously copied Tauren assets and overall art style. \n\nAnd the story/voice acting. Some of the worst I have ever seen/heard, bar none. \n\nThis is a hard, hard pass. And I'm someone who is usually pretty tolerant of  mobile MMO jankiness."

Your horse is almost a \"safezone\" for you, clever use of it makes you very hard to gank.\n\nGraphics, atmosphere, sound - everything so cozy and smooth. Similar feels like WoW once. But gameplaywise it reminds me more of LoL and BDO, with addition of full loot in black zones. \n\nP2W aspect here is very low in my opinion, maybe even less than in BDO. Not much reason to P2W besides premium or vanity skins here, no additional combat stats and etc, also full drop rules in high end zones won't give much desire to P2W top gear. Compare it to something like Diablo Immortal, LOL, that was true P2W garbage where a single whale can wipe out lots of F2P.",

I got my hours out of it before they ruined the game so I can't complain.....but damn I miss old albion. It really was the best game out there before they did it dirty.",
            "Weirdly, Albion is probably the most P2W game that has been \"embraced\" by the western market. You can quite literally buy in game currency, go to market buy BIS items and skill tomes and get a fully kitted out and leveled up character day 1. \n\nHowever the combat is highly skill based and full loot, and a F2P player also has access to same items through hard work/skill so people tolerate it.",

MMO players are tired of promises with nothing to back them up. We felt we needed to wait until we had real stuff to show. \n\nTo my mind, MMOs have drifted a fair amount from the original premise, and the promise they held. And we are out to change that. \n\nAt the same time\u2026 The reality is that it isn\u2019t realistic for a studio to just drop a finished game, not unless they have many millions to drop on a huge amount of marketing right then. You have to build audience organically over time, and that does require a certain amount of stuff like what we are doing.\n\nI hope that the folks who are burned out on empty promises just give us the benefit of the doubt and wait to see what we show; and that those who can still get optimistic about the future follow along a bit earlier and start sharing hopes and dreams for what the game and the genre can be.
