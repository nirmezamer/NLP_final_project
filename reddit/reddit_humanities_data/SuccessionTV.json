            "Can someone please recommend a series as captivating and addicting as Succession? (I know, I know presumably very hard to live up to)",
            "No one mentioned that Roman made a comment about Sally Ann back in Season 2 Episode 7. He was talking to Kendall about Rhea and Logan possibly having an affair. Remember Sally Ann and the summer of the horses That aside stuck in my brain and when Sally Ann was introduced at the funeral my ears lit up. OMG its Sally Ann!",
            "Does anyone think theres a link between shiv being pregnant and her falling? Unless shes not pregnant and has a surrogate",
            "Heres a trivia question: recall an episode or scene where a principal character drove? I can think of two: Shiv drove Connors Tesla to meet her political colleagues in New Mexico. Connor drove in to rescue Kendall (although I dont think we saw him behind the wheel), and of course Kendall in the UK when he was with the waiter. What am I missing?",
            "Wtf is a slalom motherfucker?",
            "I think that Kendall is up to something!",
            "It will make your dick hord.",
            "This last season was terrible.  The dialogue is choppy unnatural adlib.  If I hear the phrase  yeahno one more time Ill barf."

            "He's a handsome man yet.  I loved that elegant, casual look in the pilot where he met Ken outside the hospital.  I think I remember it as all brown, with a gorgeous suede jacket that draped beautifully.  Frank was actually a lovely character."

            "Having seen it theres no way hes not nominated and Id be shocked if he didnt win",
            "A lot of succession co-star criticizes Jeremy strong for his acting approach and now he is a tony winner and and on the way for EGOT",
            "Same. I cannot wait to see this.",
            "And Sarah tore it up as Dorian Grey, while Brian is telling me to eat fries.\n\nThe whole cast deserves the work and the acclaim. I hope they all work for years off Succession.",
            "They've all been extremely praising of his work and his talent, they were just honest about the fact that hes a very demanding scene partner. People blow the drama out of proportion. These people are well paid professionals, difficult shooting days are part of the job."
