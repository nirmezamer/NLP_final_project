            "I don't think Sonic should be \"too shy\" about it. He can like Amy without breaking character. He just doesn't want to be pinned in one place so keeps running off to adventure... you know, like Goku and Chi-Chi that this isn't totally copying (and they're married!)",

Is it not strange that the girls should be fully clothed, but the guys can just leave all that shit out in the breeze lmao?",
            "not this discussion again. yes the girls should be allowed to have the same dress code as the boys. people just think its weird because we aren't used to seeing it. just like if someone draws Sonic without gloves for example. looks off at the start but it really doesnt make any sense on why he shouldnt be able to take them off.\n\nRouge looks weird all white though. give her latex suit back.",
