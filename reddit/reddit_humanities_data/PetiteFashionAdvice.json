            "Different shoes.  Either boots or chunky sandals",
            "Different shoes. The way those boots cut ur leg kinda makes you look shorter or just makes the proportions look off.",
            "It's the top and jacket. The color of your top would maybe work better if it was pure white rather than a heather grey. If your jacket was looser or longer it would fit the silhouette too. You could also look at some chunky necklaces/accessories as well to add visual interest. I agree with the other poster about looking for tops that add more visual interest (they don't necessarily have to be \"soft\")\n\nWhat kind of look are you going for? Avante Garde? Take a look at some designers that could give you some inspiration on how to structure the unique cut of your skirt to get an idea of what kind of top pairings you could do:\n\n* Rick Owens\n* Ann Demeulemeester\n* Yohji Yamamoto\n* Issey Miyake\n* Commes des Garcons\n* Maison Margiela\n\nThere is even some good inspo [right here](https://old.reddit.com/r/malefashion/) on reddit if you're into experimental fashion.\n\nIG inspo:\n\n* [anthea](https://www.instagram.com/_nthea/)\n* [Rosenrot](https://www.instagram.com/therosenrot/)\n* [Drape Tokyo](https://www.instagram.com/drape.tokyo/)\n* [People wearing Yohji](https://www.instagram.com/peoplewearing_yohji/)",
            "I think putting the skirt higher up would make it work better :)",
            "Cute skirt! I think your choice in tops is throwing it off. From top to bottom it goes: soft/unstructured kit tops, structured/architectural skirt, structured/chunky shoes. I might try a collared poplin shirt instead or a boat neck shell or a graphic band tee (to tie in to the boots for a more casual vibe). You could also do some soft shirts with cutouts since that tends to be edgier",
            "Maybe a boot with a heel, if the ones you\u2019re wearing are flats? Either that or a chunkier boot maybe.",
            "Omg cute skirt!! Where did you get it?",
            "Shoes for sure. I think a taller boot is needed or a sky high heel.",
            "I disagree with people saying anything about boots. With the way the skirt is cut boots would cut off your legs a bit too much. If you do a black pump it would lengthen your leg and even out your outfit. If the skirt was one length a boot would make sense but I think with the asymmetry it would still make it look off."

            "I think something with a defined waist would be better and that pattern with the black pleats isn't my favorite, seems to do the opposite of what you want (if it was reversed with solid and pattern as the other color might be better) but I feel that the dress needs more shaping.",
