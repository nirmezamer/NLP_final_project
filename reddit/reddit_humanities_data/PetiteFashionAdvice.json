I\u2019m looking for everyday shoes to walk a decent amount in (about 7k steps each day). I live in a small, hilly town where we walk everywhere. So far, I\u2019ve only enjoyed wearing knee-high boots with a bit of a wedge heel, but I\u2019m now looking for either flats or just shorter shoes. I'm not a big fan of ankle boots either, as they tend to cut me off. I'm happy to invest some money in a good pair since they will be used quite often. Thank you!\n",
