            "They need fewer channels and skinny bundles to survive.  Venu could be dangerous for them because of that.  A big issue with YTTV is that many subscribers get all their scripted shows from other streamers like Hulu and Peacock which are much less expensive.  Thus YTTV is only valuable for live stuff and even then some of that is on other streamers.\n\nA $73 service can be replaced easily by several services in the $10-$20 range.",

            "> NFL fans brought the class action in 2015. They highlighted a major difference in how the NFL approaches broadcasts compared to the other four professional sports leagues: Viewers who want to watch games that aren\u2019t broadcast locally must purchase the Sunday Ticket premium offering. This means that Kansas City Chiefs fans living in Los Angeles must pay hundreds of dollars per year at allegedly inflated prices to watch their favorite team play. There\u2019s no offering that allows them to just watch Chiefs games.\n\n\nThere's no offering for MLB, NHL, or NBA that allow you to buy in and watch all of a single teams games.  You still have to contend with blackout restrictions on broadcast and the myriad of channels needed to see everything for a single team.  The court really should have looked more closely at this claim... though maybe this will be good news it the result trickles down to the other major sports.\n\n\nThat said, I get this is an old case and things have changed a lot in the last 9 years.  There's the Amazon deal for Thursday night football, the exclusive games on Peacock, other than last season... MNF on ABC was moved to ESPN.  Sunday Ticket is just for those out of market Sunday games but doesn't even touch on the entire league.   But the other sports aren't exactly doing anything friendlier since most have very little available on over the air networks for free.  Most have their content so split up, there's no point in following it anymore.",

        "content": "The coax on my OTA antenna has about 30 feet of extra length that is coiled up under the house. While my OTA channels mostly come in OK, does the extra length of the coax cause some of the occasional pixilation and should I shorten it? If I cut the cable, what are the best end connectors should be used? Thanks. Chuck",

            "The greater the length, the more signal loss you do get, but below 100 feet it doesn't usually hurt much with a solid amount of signal. Of course, if your signal is weak, or at least weak at times, less cable should help at least a little bit.\n\nRather than cut and rejoin the cable in the middle, which will actually harm signal strength about as much as your excess length, you should pull through the excess cable at your indoor end, cut off the excess, and redo the termination there. I'd still keep 3-6 feet of excess for leeway. If you have a wall plate that is affixed directly to the cable, you might be able to just reattach it after cutting and preparing the end of the cable to be inserted again. If it is a coupler style, with the regular cable end on the back side of the plate, you'll just put another end on the cable after the cut. If you just have a cable hanging out of the wall, you'll just put a fresh end on the cable after the cut. Compression fittings are the best type to use, if you're willing to spend ~$12-15 for a tool and pack of ends (they usually come as a kit like that).",
            "Yes, definitely shorten it.  I get my Oklahoma City channels, all 54 of them, by using an RCA 65+ flat antenna with 10 ft. of RG6 cable."
