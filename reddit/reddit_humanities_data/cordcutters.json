        "content": "The coax on my OTA antenna has about 30 feet of extra length that is coiled up under the house. While my OTA channels mostly come in OK, does the extra length of the coax cause some of the occasional pixilation and should I shorten it? If I cut the cable, what are the best end connectors should be used? Thanks. Chuck",

            "To install connectors correctly, you need a F connector compression tool and good RG-6 F connectors. It would be cheaper to buy a shorter length, high quality RG-6 cable with high quality F connectors. Solid Signal sells custom made, high quality RG-6 cables and at any length. I recommend quad shielding. I also recommend you get a Televes single input antenna amplifier.",
            "The greater the length, the more signal loss you do get, but below 100 feet it doesn't usually hurt much with a solid amount of signal. Of course, if your signal is weak, or at least weak at times, less cable should help at least a little bit.\n\nRather than cut and rejoin the cable in the middle, which will actually harm signal strength about as much as your excess length, you should pull through the excess cable at your indoor end, cut off the excess, and redo the termination there. I'd still keep 3-6 feet of excess for leeway. If you have a wall plate that is affixed directly to the cable, you might be able to just reattach it after cutting and preparing the end of the cable to be inserted again. If it is a coupler style, with the regular cable end on the back side of the plate, you'll just put another end on the cable after the cut. If you just have a cable hanging out of the wall, you'll just put a fresh end on the cable after the cut. Compression fittings are the best type to use, if you're willing to spend ~$12-15 for a tool and pack of ends (they usually come as a kit like that).",
            "Yes, definitely shorten it.  I get my Oklahoma City channels, all 54 of them, by using an RCA 65+ flat antenna with 10 ft. of RG6 cable."
