        "content": "The Calradian Empire has long since lost its hegemony over the barbarians and their myriad tongues, yet its legions are not yet broken.\n\nUpon a small island in the Perassic Sea, just off the coast from Ortysia, the [Banu Asera under Sultan Kofye](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1251660266609967205/1251661057068630217/image.png?ex=6670b532&is=666f63b2&hm=c3339b08ee4f9ae21de50edddc840c1b5ad184a9505fca13d1ba8fb5868f521b&) and the [Western Legions under Basileus Deos](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1251660266609967205/1251661224123301899/261550_20240615221558_1.png?ex=6670b55a&is=666f63da&hm=8daa8f495cc7b2fae1ee4b630666b3bffcab5c16162b878727f5525dd51e63e9&) did battle in the ruins of an old Imperial island fort. The goal was to seize control over this vital link - either to clear the way for a naval blockade of Ortysia or to keep the Aserai hosts at bay to buy time to reclaim lost lands. And in this both armies [came prepared to fight](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1251660266609967205/1251661513769619530/261550_20240615232502_1.png?ex=6670b59f&is=666f641f&hm=ad6a61b93dbbae0423f079fe0b10794561f4720fb6302f23cd8d2de4df1cad92&).\n\nThe battle, unfortunately for the Basileus, did not go well. The Aserai cavalry were landed early and in force, crossing the beaches as easily as they would ride across the desert dunes. [Legionaries were pinned against the surf](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1251660266609967205/1251661028077469777/261550_20240615221302_1.png?ex=6670b52b&is=666f63ab&hm=380ababf7730ff8fb32e19e525cc8b0ef2dc830c86b21037e0108fd734613ef9&) and ridden down, unable to deploy properly under such pressure. Deos managed to eke out [small victories in the fort itself,](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1251660266609967205/1251662888121143389/20240615135602_1.jpg?ex=6670b6e7&is=666f6567&hm=fc124616d02731aeceda5d6f4ca1d5c1ca811067c7312a498958be84202e7080&) but it was clear: this battle would be one of cavalry. Yet even the [numerous coursers](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1251660266609967205/1251662051906945034/highground.PNG?ex=6670b61f&is=666f649f&hm=0e3c1f9965c02a5815ba47dba346001c0258fa43260990711b84d6f08ef02fc8&) brought by the navy could do little to stop the [Aserai from achieving victory](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1251660266609967205/1251660825090068680/261550_20240615221055_1.png?ex=6670b4fb&is=666f637b&hm=caa5d6df1a5765ebba60af3d29838d81428b47c8023c1c856f819bb5f4b1c047&) - the navy of the Western Legions was hamstrung and forced to withdraw with what [surviving marines and legionaries](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1251660266609967205/1251661514411081809/261550_20240615233141_1.png?ex=6670b59f&is=666f641f&hm=b8a8075312e211bef0f339ff01a61ecc05f20bda18d7905b976637919d73c81e&) could be pulled from the shallows.\n\nOrtysia was besieged and blockaded, the Aserai host far greater than the garrison had anticipated as the Sultan used the now-clear sea lanes [to land her armies](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1251660266609967205/1251661352053899377/261550_20240615225038_1.png?ex=6670b579&is=666f63f9&hm=53aea9eedabd393f1a261e12ce52c5585bc14d5d8e131e11269b7130c0301546&) without having to march around the straits. Yet the great alacrity with which this was achieved left the Aserai in a fragile position - those troops from the Nahasa were entirely dependent on their ships to keep them supplied in a timely manner. With the Aserai ships tied down transporting such supplies, the Basileus and his admirals decided to run the supply lines and cut them. They were in no position to win an outright naval battle, but if they could reclaim the island they were just crushed on and find a way to hold it - such as fortifying it before the Aserai could redeploy - they might be able to force the Aserai to pick between starvation and a successful siege.\n\nThe Western Legions' marines landed on the island and got to work, dismantling those galleys too broken from the earlier defeat to be useful as material for construction. Soon the fort was ready, and the Aserai ships began to suffer attacks from the island. Intent on avoiding the dilemma, the Aserai embarked their warriors once more, disembarked their ship's artillery, and looked to [dislodge the Western Legions](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1251660266609967205/1251661991517360332/261550_20240615235209_1.png?ex=6670b611&is=666f6491&hm=0256aaf9b4cde3e253429ac23afa006d6b5334da5e0aa96d483e4da5350747ec&) from their new fort. [Fierce defense](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1251660266609967205/1251661990863179899/261550_20240615235013_1.png?ex=6670b611&is=666f6491&hm=4609b3e77e841ac5f962afab354d80bc74b07b9945ffcff008573b460560e2cc&) and effective use of tower mounted ballistae [stemmed the Aserai tide](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1251660266609967205/1251661993455386664/261550_20240616000453_1.png?ex=6670b611&is=666f6491&hm=1c670524dc7b5e086d4d7192a6793a43a3998a5500aefa06ab141df47ad6a45c&), holding out long enough to force the Sultan to decide to suffer losses from starvation or abandon the siege. The Aserai would lose no sons to starvation this day, as the Sultan withdrew.\n\nThough a mapmaker would call it a stalemate, the Aserai still retain control over Thractorae Castle and Oristocorys Castles, and their dream of an Aserai Perassic is still far closer to reality than any Calradian citizen would like to admit. Lessons will be learned, and no doubt there will be another battle for Ortysia's fate in the days to come.\n\n===\n\n# In Meta Terms\n\nAfter a trampling field victory of 9-2 and steadfast 2-0 siege defense, **stalemate** was achieved between the legions of the Western Empire and the many sons of the Aserai.
