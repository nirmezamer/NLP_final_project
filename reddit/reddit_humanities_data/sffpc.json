            "Finally taking the plunge on an SFF build in the Ncase M2 after seeing the optimum video on it. I have a GPU and storage to reuse, but will be upgrading from AM4 to either LGA1851 or AM5 depending on reviews/pricing later this year. Not sure if I should be getting an AIO and some case fan(s) ahead of time or if I should wait until I have a mobo picked out and some more build guides for the case go up.\n\nIs there a particular AIO that people recommend for SFF builds? I know the asetek units all perform about the same, but I'm curious if a particular brand has more flexible tubing or some other quality that's desirable for SFF builds. My default assumption was to just grab an Artic LF 280mm and be done with it.",
            "I ordered the M2 but I'm personally waiting to buy any other parts until I receive it, personally. I've only seen a couple videos on the case and there appear to be some fit issues for some cables, which if they're resolved may open up the motherboard options.",
            "Fair enough. I'll probably grab a PSU ahead of time still but hold off on anything else for now. Thanks."
