If theyre in good health, whats causing the blockage?).\n\nSo say if we can theoretically live without any problems at all, how long does it takes for our organs to just...randomly stops working one day and actually dies? Has somebody go this way?\n\nSorry cuz i know this is more like a medical question i just couldnt find the right sub for it, hoping for some cell experts in here who can solve this mystery \ud83d\ude05",

            "People have absolutely died of age related organ failure, e.g heart disease. You seem to be thinking of a heart attack or a stroke as some distinct and separate thing, but they can be caused directly by age - accumulated damage to the heart and cardiovascular system, like the parts of an engine that has worn down. So they are as much a 'natural way' of dying as coming down with a flu and being too weak to fight it off - there isn't a deliberate timer at play where your organs will decide to shut down deliberately, they'll keep doing their job until they simply fail because they cannot any-more.\n\nThere isn't really some inbuilt hard limit on how long we can live, but it becomes more and more likely for things to start breaking down as we age and accumulate mutations and errors in cell lines, as parts wear out or stop being replaced at the same rate etc. At a certain point living a long time simply becomes a matter of chance.",
            "My grandma died in her sleep-no heart attack or stroke, no terminal illness. A few days before she told my aunt she kept seeing a handsome gentleman from my grandfather\u2019s hometown\u2026she was ready to be reunited.",
            "No one says someone died of natural causes when they have a heart attack or stroke. Dying from old age/natural causes is just your organs stopping.",
            "Dying of a heart attack or flu *is* dying a natural death. Due to telemere-shortening, we become more susceptible to these sorts of things over time.",
            "My great grandma was alright and she sat down to eat her dinner and part way through her dinner she just died.",
            "I grandma who was 86 or something one day she was ready to go out for dinner with her mates she was waiting at home till it was time to go she just in her fav chair and apparently snoozed away and never woke up so it is possible and she\u2019s healthy as for someone her age",
            "Getting eaten by a cave bear or saber-toothed tiger. There is a reason why most people don't like snakes and that's because predators were writing early humans off the global census since the beginning of time. If not disease, usually humans checked out of hotel earth when an eagle was our Uber ride.",
            "My grandmother died at 94. One day she was shucking corn and the next, she was dead. Went to bed and never woke up. That\u2019s about as natural as it gets.",
            "the organs just randomly not working on day is still not just death, it's death by organ failure. you can't get a death more natural than getting so old your organs are too tired to keep going",
            "So there is technically no such thing as \u201cdying of old age\u201d. Something is always the cause. It\u2019s just that as you get older more things are likely to go wrong and probably quicker."

            "There are animals who can eat stuff that's poisonous and unhealthy for us or has no nutritional value.

            "Us as humans have evolved into omnivores over time meaning we can digest a wide range of plant and animal products.",
            "One of the reasons is that, over time, humans actively sought out a wide range of foods that were sustaining and enjoyable to eat, and then proceeded to grow and produce them in large quantities (too large in some cases). Other animals never had that luxury, they could only eat things that were available to them. For example, chocolate can be toxic to the point of lethal if eaten by a dog because it contains theobromine and caffeine, which can cause tachycardia and hypertension, and since dogs lack the ability to metabolize them, they can die, if the dose is sufficient.",

            "I dissect a lot of mouse eyes under a microscope. Two of the best things for me are meditating and cutting out caffeine. I almost never do caffeine the day of dissection now. Even 5 minutes of meditation or just sitting with some calming music helps calm my nervous system down a lot. I find I get pretty manic jumping around and doing different tasks.\n\nI'd definitely try cutting out caffeine for a day/week/month and meditating for 5 or 10 minutes before you need to do something that requires precision to see if that works",
