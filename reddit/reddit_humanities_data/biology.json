            "Purine/Pyrimidine bases are chemically stable and possess planar, aromatic structures. This planarity allows them to stack efficiently within the double-helix structure of DNA, which contributes significantly to the molecule's overall stability. The specific arrangement of atoms in pyrimidines and purines promotes the precise hydrogen bonding between complementary bases, which is obviously useful when you are encoding information molecularly.\n\nFrom a prebiotic chemistry perspective, studies suggest that purines and pyrimidines could form readily under early Earth conditions. Experiments simulating these conditions have shown that these nucleobases can be synthesized from simple molecules like hydrogen cyanide and ammonia. The chemical pathways leading to their formation involve relatively straightforward reactions, making them more likely to accumulate in the prebiotic environment.\n\nBiologically, the specific hydrogen-bonding patterns allow for reliable molecular recognition for the accurate replication of genetic material. The hydrogen bonding between purines and pyrimidines also contributes to a stable double-helix structure, which can tolerate minor changes without catastrophic consequences. Also, these bases absorb some ultraviolet light, offering protection against the UV radiation on early Earth.\n\nOver time, the chemical properties of purines and pyrimidines likely led to their selection and enrichment in the primordial soup. Their stability, ability to form hydrogen bonds, and participation in critical biological processes would have made them favorable for early life forms. Also, these bases are multifunctional, not only as building blocks of DNA and RNA but also in cellular metabolism (e.g., ATP, GTP et cetera), which may have contributed to their evolutionary selection.",
            "Outstanding reply!",
            "I have heard that there are alternative molecules to purines and pyrimidines. But the explanation above is just about right. Hydrogen bonding, flat structure, easy to form under prebiotic conditions. Hydrogen bonding is essential for molecule reproduction. They have to have been chosen for ATP and RNA etc. before the DNA double helix appeared."

        "content": "A female mosquito depends on human host as it needs the blood for reproductive purposes, but it's not considered a parasite for humans. This seems to fall under the explanation that a mosquito doesn't directly depend on the human for nutritional needs. \n\nBut then on the other hand, a cuckoo lays its eggs on the nest of a crow, making them lay its eggs. This phenomenon is considered to be Parasitism - Brood Parasitism. But in this case, the cuckoo is not depending on the crow for nutritional needs.\n\nIf looked upon from a survival aspect, they're both on the same page because as a species their survival is dependent on the 'host' (human and crow). But neither the survival of an individual mosquito nor of a cuckoo is directly depending on this interaction.\n\nThen how come Brood Parasitism fall under Parasitism while the interaction between female mosquitoes and humans doesn't?",

            "Quoted:\n\n>\"The female mosquito is not considered as a parasite because\u00a0it needs blood for reproduction and not for nutrition. Human blood is required for the nourishment of their offspring. A parasite is an organism that depends on other host organisms for its survival\"",
            "mosquito is considered a \u201cmicropredator\u201d, a category which sometimes falls under parasitism. A parasitism itself is broad term with many definitions, apart from the obvious parasites like fleas or tapeworms there\u2019s parasitic plants, facultative parasites, parasitoids or, as you have mentioned, brood parasitism. Cuckoos are considered parasites, because they \u201csteal\u201d resources from other organism (i. e. another bird). Mosquitos are considered micropredators, because they do not kill their host/prey. Both of these interactions can be described as parasitism, because they meet the definition of parasitism, i.e. taking advantage of another species and causing it harm in the process.",
            "I think a better question is why are you not counting mosquitoes as a parasite. Remember parasitism is the relationship between the two, specifically it is where one benefits and one is harmed. If the host wasn\u2019t harmed it would be commensalism, and if both benefit that is mutualism.\n\n\u00a0Cost can be a lot of things. It can also be behavioral like brood parasitism. But blood is a cost. Time and energy spent raising another species is cost. And the parasite gains from it",
            "That way an individual cuckoo is not depending on the crow for its survival rather the upbringing of its progeny and hatching of its eggs, how does that fall under Parasitism?",
            "I agree. However, the book I have to strictly adhere to (a textbook from NCERT) directly denies mosquitoes as a parasite while acknowledging Brood Parasitism in the same paragraph. I guess I'll have to just follow that.",
            "Exactly, I'd actually ask that question but the book I have to strictly adhere to directly denies mosquitoes as parasites while counting cuckoos as one in the same paragraph. That's why I framed the question that way. \n\nI agree with your point there and that's my initial thought process.",
            "It does, and when the chick hatches before the other chicks, he will try to get rid of their eggs or the poor chick to get as much food as possible.\n\nAnd because it is a large bird compared to those who feed it, it will consume more food than the parents can provide.\n\nA very obnoxious bird",
            "Wow lol I saw you said it is NCERT. I wonder who approved the book. Though living in the US and seeing how political government approved educational material are here makes me side eye it a bit",
            "But with respect to the cuckoo parent who left the egg there, that parent isn't depending on the crow for their survival. Similar to how the mother mosquito is not dependent on human blood for nutrition and survival.",
