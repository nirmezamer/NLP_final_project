        "content": "The new AutoModerator rules for participation in the subreddit have proven very successful.  We have been making spot checks of the posts and comments that are being removed automatically and as expected, >90% of them are rule-breaking, low-effort, spam or scam posts that would not have contributed to the high quality content that we strive to maintain in the subreddit.  \n\nAs of today, 26 February, we have dramatically adjusted the thresholds for posting and commenting in the subreddit.  This will allow more posts and comments from younger accounts with lower karma.  The TL;DR of how the requirements work:\n\n## To **comment** on the subreddit:\n\n* **You must meet a minimum account age** - new accounts will not be permitted to comment\n* **You must meet a minimum comment karma elsewhere on Reddit** - This rule is intended to weed out people who are \"New to Reddit\" and do not understand that this is not Facebook, Twitter ^(It Will Never Be X), Instagram, or TikTok.  \n* **You must maintain positive comment karma in r/YouTubers** - if your comments are being downvoted, your commenting privileges disappear and will not be reinstated.  \n\n## To **post** on the subreddit:\n\n* **You must meet the above requirements plus:**\n* **The minimum account age is higher**\n* **You must have a minimum comment karma** ***in r/YouTubers*** - This means that you must **participate in the subreddit** before you can make a post.  This rule is intended to get users familiar with the type of content we expect here, the specific rules on particular types of posts, how the subreddit works, and will hopefully prevent low-quality posts.\n* **You must meet a minimum post karma elsewhere on Reddit** - Your first post should not (can not) be in r/YouTubers.  Like the comment rule above, this rule is intended to ensure that people are familiar with how Reddit works.\n\nIf you have multiple posts or comments that are highly downvoted or are removed for breaking r/YouTubers rules, your post or comment privileges will be automatically revoked and you may be banned from r/YouTubers entirely.  Use of \"Free Karma\" subreddits or obvious attempts to gain empty karma for the purpose of participating here will result in an immediate ban, and your account will be reported to Reddit for breaking Reddit's sitewide \"karma manipulation\" rule.\n\nAs always, the specific karma and age thresholds will not be published and may be changed at any time to shape the quality of posts and comments that are being made in the subreddit.  We appreciate your patience as we navigate the stupid changes Reddit is making to the website while they chase their IPO instead of making the site better.",

The company claims it's YouTube's fault, but they also don't reconcile the claim on their end very quickly. It's exhasting going through 10 claims both through YouTube and through Storyblocks, and frankly I'm sick of it and don't want to have to worry about YouTube hating my (legal) music. Would you recommend I use YouTube's music or will I have the same issue?\n\nI would have assumed by this point that music licensing companies like Audioblocks would have their game together and be working alongside YouTube, not still throwing the blame on them for any issues . . ."

And I am running out of space on my hardrive so in the process of moving those over to an external hard drive. But honestly I don\u2019t why I keep them. Well especially the video editing files. I hardly doubt I am going to ever go back and use the video edited file and there is a good chance I am not copying over the right DA Vinice Resolve file any way (The info packet? What/where is the Da Vinci file I should be coping over? I can only find the Cache folder and info doc but my experience with Premier pro there must be another file somewhere else).\n\nSo I was curious should I keep the files, delete them straight away, keep them for 6 months then delete them?\n\nWhat do you do?\n\nThanks",

Zpaq uses one of the newest compression algorithms currently available, as well as diffs similar to git. So, not only is it compressing everything, but it's only adding on the differences. So, you basically also get built-in version tracking at the same time as an added benefit. And since the compression uses the pre-existing dictionary of the archive contents, it means the compression ratio actually improves over time, as well, since as more data is collected, more redundancies can be eliminated.",

Recording the \"voiced videos\" is perfectly fine in winter but an extremely daunting task in summer.\n\nI live near Delhi in India and the summer temperatures have been consistently around the 40-45 celcius mark (104-113 F). I record with the fans and air conditioning turned off to minimise background noise. But even after freezing the room just before recording, the temperature quickly returns to normal within minutes and I am quite literally drenched in sweat with a puddle at my feet by the time I end the recording. (gross, sorry, but true)\n\nI have been wanting to include facecam in my videos but this makes it impossible. I have tried to record with everything running but editing out the background noise in audition or audacity messes up the audio. I have thought of using Nvidia brodcast but I don't have an RTX gpu.\n\nHow do you guys record videos? Is there any tool I should be using to remove bg noise without affecting the audio?
