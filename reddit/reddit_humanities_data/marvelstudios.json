We're currently looking for a handful of community members to join our moderator team! To help improve the state of the subreddit, we are looking for users that are willing and determined to crack down on the reddit-wide trends of spoilers, low effort posts, reposts, and leaked content.\n\nWe need all potential candidates to be regularly active and good-natured users in order to best assist the community and the current mod team.\n\n--\n\n-------\n\n--\n\n**Normal moderating duties include:**\n\n- checking the mod queue (where the reports are)\n\n- responding to mod mail\n\n- removing rule breaking comments/banning users (including untagged spoilers and leaks)\n\n- helping with pinned discussions/threads\n\n- possibly helping with graphic design/snoo/css stuff\n\n--\n\nThe job is not the most glamorous, and you will need to have a bit of thick skin as users will undoubtedly call you a Disney shill and other insults from time to time. However-- if you enjoy the subreddit and want to help keep it running, this is a good way to do it.\n\n--\n\n**To be clear, this is a volunteer position and is NOT affiliated with the actual companies of Marvel Studios and/or Disney entertainment.**\n\n--\n\nSubmissions will be open for at least a few weeks, or until we accumulate a decent-sized application pool.\n\nUse the links below if you need help with the timezone questions:\n\n - [Find out your timezone here](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/map/)\n\n - [Convert your local time to UTC here](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20210413T200000)\n\n--\n\nIf you have any questions about the form or about moderating the sub, just ask below!\n\nThanks a bunch!",

We ask each of our mod members to contribute roughly 300 actions per month-- which could sound like a lot, but it could be 10 a day, or like 20 a day every other day... you get it. And the actions are like, remove a comment, remove a post, approve a post, etc. It's totally stuff you can do if/while you find yourself doomscrolling reddit daily\n\n\nNo one will ask you to mod every day, but the goal is to have everyone contributing consistently, so everyone individually can spend a little less time on it\n\n\nObviously a little more attention is needed during release periods",
