        "content": "People have been telling me that their posts I've been removing actually shouldn't be removed because they are \"personalized\" and meet the \"off my chest\" criterion.  I'm going to explain this is greater detail with plenty of examples so what type of posts are allowed is more clear for everyone to understand.\n\nPersonalized in this case means that what you're posting has to be directly related to you (this would include a close person, such as a family member).  And it can't be something that's impacting a large number of people unless it has a specific application to you.\n\n**Examples of valid \"personal\" posts:**\n\n\"I just found out I owe a bunch of money on my taxes!\"\n\n\"My parents just found out they owe a bunch in back taxes and might go under!  I wish I could help them!\"\n\n\n**Examples of \"impersonal\" posts:**\n\n\"Taxation is theft!\"\n\n\"Don't you hate it when you have to pay taxes?\"\n\n\n**What is meant by being an \"off my chest\" style post?**\n\nAn off my chest style post is you getting something off your chest that's personal in nature (so, both related to you or someone you know quite personally and has a direct impact on you or them that isn't generalized) AND that is a story, situation, hope for the future, or some other type of direct situation.\n\n**Note:  Opinions, hot takes, asking generalized questions not tied to a valid post, political commentary, talking about things that have nothing to do with you SPECIFICALLY, generalizations, etc. do NOT count as off my chest style posts.**\n\n\n**Example of valid off my chest style posting:**\n\n\"I stubbed my toe and cried today.  I feel so humiliated.\"\n\n\"My friend is transitioning and it feels like they're becoming a different person, but I want to support them.  It just feels like I'm losing them.\"\n\n\"I lost my job due to [insert cancel culture thing here].\"\n\n\"My parents hit my kids and I don't want them to ever see or touch them again!\"\n\n\n**Examples of invalid off my chest style posts:**\n\n\"Stubbing toes is the worst thing ever.  Does anyone else agree?\"\n\n\"Transitioning fundamentally alters a person to the point where they aren't even themselves anymore.\"\n\n\"Cancel culture is bullshit!\"\n\n\"Children should not be hit!\"\n\n\"As an (insert group here), I feel that (insert opinion here).\"\n\n\"I like X TV show.\"\n\n\"Does anyone know how to fix a broken headlight?\" (we've gotten these before, lol)\n\n\"Not ALL men/women...\"\n\n\"[Insert any commentary on any hot-button topic here.]\"\n\n**Note:  You can give your opinion on a personalized situation, but your whole post can't just be the opinion, and it has to be something that's meaningfully specific.  But you cannot stand on a soapbox and preach it.**\n\n\nIn some cases, a post may be removed that can be reworded to \"fit\", but the majority of the time there isn't a way to reword a post to \"fit\".\n\nI am quite aware that this kills a large portion of what the sub used to allow, but after seeing the types of post that are now front-paging that simply weren't allowed to before due to all the flaming and getting the same hot takes over and over again, I honestly can't help but feel like this was a net positive.\n\nAlso, my removal of your post for not following the rules has nothing to do with whether or not I personally agree or disagree with the post.  I've removed something from every major category recently.  I'm also pretty good about explaining how posts don't fit the criteria if asked on any given specific.  This absolutely sucks for me.  I've removed over 500 posts in the last 4 days.  I hate this, but the benefit to the subreddit is substantial, so I'm going to keep this going as much as I can.\n\nAlso, if a post is up that violates these rules, 99/100 times it's because I'm sleeping.  I may also make a mistake or another mod might approve a post that was removed by the automod and not my manual flagging.",

It all sounds perfect, right? So why does it feel like something's missing? Well look no further because we have the solution for you...\n\n**Reddit Moderation!**\n\nWhat could more perfectly complement your fulfilling lifestyle than playing internet cop on Reddit? See a post you disagree with? You can delete it! User making valid points and hurting your feelings in modmail? Mute them! Having a bad day? Just ban a random, unsuspecting individual!\n\n`**Disclaimer for Mod Code of Conduct purposes: you can't actually do any of this`\n\nOn to more serious matters,\n\nWe are in need of more moderators to help maintain the subreddit. No experience is needed. All we ask is that you have the time, patience and a good sense of humor. Our team will be available to train you and answer any questions you have. Communication is a *must* and really, why wouldn't you want to talk to us? You'll be placed on a probationary period to start and we fully understand that mistakes will be made and activity may fluctuate. Please note that being selected as a mod does not guarantee you will be a permanent addition. Not everyone is a good fit and that's okay.\n\nSo what does moderating actually entail?\n\n* Clearing the queue will be your #1 task. The queue is where you'll see any content that has been reported or our automod has flagged for review. All you have to do is go through it, read the content and decide whether to remove it, approve it and sometimes report or ban a user. The queue fills up *fast* and needs a lot of attention. Seriously, some of you need to lay off the spam reports.\n* Modmail is your next task. It's mostly users asking why their post is missing (automod ate it 99% of the time) and asking that you fix it. We also recieve ban appeals here. If you're lucky, you'll get a death threat every now and then. Hooray! If any modmails are uncomfortable, too personal or upsetting to you, you can delegate it to another mod.\n* Sometimes a post will come up that's especially spicy or attracting a lot of attention. When this happens, one of our mods likes to comb through the comments for violations or sit on it to monitor incoming comments for violations. If it gets too much to handle, or someone isn't available, you can lock it.\n* Communicating with the team is one of the most important tasks in your role as a moderator. As a team, we discuss moderation actions, rule changes, sub events and the direction of the subreddit. That all sounds very boring but rest assured, there's a lot more casual talk than anything else so feel free to chime in on Beaver's dislike of garlic bread (encouraged), Tim sharing new sanrio drops or my Call of Duty K/D ratio.\n* Lastly, let's talk about the meta. Sometimes things need doing on the sub, like this recruitment post I was supposed to make months ago. While the day to day is important, we also need to keep the sub up to date with new features and tools and update it to fit the growing userbase.\n\nIf you managed to get through all that, congrats! You made it to the actual app, which is also long and annoying. Here's a tip for applying: there is a short quiz portion to the app. We don't care if you get everything right, we just want to see your line of reasoning and understanding of the rules and subreddit culture.\n\n[APPLY HERE](https://forms.gle/RwSTF7VQbPE4Djta9)\n\nThese apps are open indefinitely, and we will be doing staggered recruitment, so feel free to take your time.",

I've never felt so betrayed or stupid.\n\nI've been nothing but loyal to my husband. We've been together for 14 years and married for 11 of those 14. We're both in our early 40s. We spent our whole lives together. I never would've seen this coming in a million years. He's been a great man and husband all this time. We have two children together as well which makes this whole situation even worse.\n\nI started feeling sick but went to my gyno once I noticed sores. I was in shock and didn't even believe my doctor at first when she had told me that I had syphilis. When I got home and told my husband about it he denied everything at first and even accused *me* of cheating. The absolute fucking nerve. He realized quickly that that narrative wasn't going to fly but is still denying cheating himself. There is no other way that I could've magically contracted a std when he's been the only person in my entire life that I've ever been intimate with.\n\nI don't know how to get him to man up and just admit what he had done. I don't need him to to know where I got it, but I would like him to respect me enough to be honest. I haven't talked to anyone in my circle about this because it's humiliating in my eyes. It's one thing to be cheated on but another to contract a std from said cheating partner.\n\nI just had to let this out somewhere. I feel so alone and disgusting. I feel sick knowing that my husband had contracted something and gave it to me. I don't know when he got it due to the nature of the std or who he got it from but for the time being I've kicked him out of our bedroom and into the guest room. He's been home as little as possible and doesn't answer my texts or calls. He doesn't look me in the eye and barely speaks to me. I've never felt so stupid.\n\nEdit: Thank you for all of your comments. It brings me immense comfort. I'm going to add a few things so people stop asking the same question and to answer a few.\n\nI am aware that syphilis can lie dorman for years. I mentioned this as \"due to the nature of this std\" in my post.\n\nMy husband had prior partners to me, but we both got tested before becoming intimate. I saved my virginity for marriage when he did not. I was okay with this fact as long as he got tested beforehand and to make him feel less alone I also got tested. We were both clean.\n\nI will absolutely be divorcing my husband. I could have died. I have two children who could've lost their mother because their father is an ignorant prick who only thought with his genitals. He lied to me, cheated on me, betrayed me, ruined our family and is still lying to me now. That is unforgivable. I plan on doing as much damage to him during the divorce as possible. I don't know the details of him cheating but I'll find out soon enough. When everything is said and done I hope that God forgives me for the trouble I hope to put him through during court.",

        "content": "Hi all, this is my first post so go easy on me. I (26f) and have been married for a year to my husband \"Rob\" (28m). When we first met four years ago, I had just been seeing this guy \"Jim\" where we did kind of kinky stuff (mainly texting messed up stuff to each other). It took me awhile to realize the poor effect that had on my mental health, so eventually I gathered enough guts and left Jim. Jim was a good guy, a really good guy. I never felt unsafe around him, I just had to leave. I never deleted the text messages between us. Not for any good reason, I just never though to. \n\nI got married last year to Rob. It was lovely, we were (and are) in love. Long story short, I found nudes on my husbands Robs computer which he says are leftover from an old ex (however they are timestamped from much later), so I think he was cyber cheating or whatever. Needless to say I was furious. I called him crying, threatening to leave. He talked his way out of it eventually, though, and I'm ashamed to say I really just tried to get over it. I think he wanted to get even with me, on some sick level, and decided to go through all my old text messages (looking for dirt?). He comes across my texts with Jim. Now Rob flies into a craze, saying that I've been hiding some sexual fantasies from him for years. I try and tell him how that stuff wasn't good for me, hence why I ended things with Jim. \n\nHe really doesn't let up. I end up falling asleep in the guest room a few days later, we had both calmed down a lot (or so I thought). I still hadn't deleted all the Jim messages (again not for any good reason, I just forgot to). But I wake up from my nap in the guest room to Rob trying to have sex with me. I guess it was trying and succeeding. It wasn't consensual, and I tried to get him to stop but he's stronger than me. Eventually I think he snapped out of it and realized what he was doing. His explanation was that he \"knew\" I had some deep burning desire for really kinky stuff, and decided he'd \"satisfy my desire\". This happened months ago and I still feel so sick. I haven't told him how much it hurt me, and I haven't let on that I still even think about it, but I do. \n\nI know this was a horrid thing for him to do, but I'm finding it so hard to do anything. Worse people have done worse things to me, so I'm able to cope for the most part. I can't talk to friends because they'll react explosively (I would too in their situation). And I'll be honest I don't have the guts to talk to Rob after all this time. \n\nDay to day I feel safe. I'm not trying to leave- even if I wanted to I don't think I'd have the nerve. I just needed to get this out to someone somewhere. ",
