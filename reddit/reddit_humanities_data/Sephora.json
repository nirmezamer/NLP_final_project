        "content": "Hello everyone!\n\nWe have been receiving a LOT *(and I mean a lot)* of split opinions when it comes to pet pictures being posted on the sub. Myself and the other mods receive tons of modmail and DM's a day regarding users dislike for pet pictures being used in posts. Then, on the other hand we see that a lot of people truly enjoy the pet pictures. This issue is very split down the middle, while we thought outright banning the pictures would work, we have heard you and see that this is not the case.\n\nSo, we are introducing **\"Caturday\"** as our new rule 13 (coined by the lovely u/Champagnesupernova9). Pets of all kinds are welcome to be included in posts every Saturday, all day. As a team, we feel this is a fair compromise to those who wish to continue seeing these kinds of posts and comments & for those who aren't fond of them. A new flair will be created so posts like this can be found easily and filtered. So from now on, please only post your pets on Saturdays (aka Caturday), any posts including pets posted on any other day will be removed and we will remind you to repost your pet on the designated day.\n\nThank you all for your unwavering support & cooperation!",

            "I don't mind the occasional pictures of Sephora pet 'members' but I can see how others might object to them. This policy is similar to what the Sephora Community does on their website- there is a dedicated thread where people can talk about or post pictures of their pets.\n\nI hope that no one takes offense at this new rule.",

And when I went through my stuff I found about half of my Korean products had xylitol. Tony Moly was a big offender.",

            "I think this rule is fair for both sides. Thank you!",

            "Mini review:\n\nPackaging: Interesting attention to detail with the smiley faces. I appreciate the keycap even though I have no use for it. The inside of the box is also decorated, which is a pleasant touch.\n\nProduct: such a unique colour and the perfect amount of shimmer. The rainbow shimmers inside dance beautifully in the sunlight. As someone who does not have very pigmented lips, this does show up on my lips with a black hue (duh)...but I love it. It adds dimension and gives the appearance of fuller lips imo.\n\nOverall: 9/10. Great product which I will get good use out of with a lot of other lipsticks/liners. Very reminiscent of the Body Shop Lip and Cheek Velvet Stick in Black Velvet. I have to take one point off as I don't like the smell of the fenty gloss bombs...yes I know I am the minority.\n\nAdditionally: sorry for no lip swatches - i promise I will update with a picture as soon as my lips are not crusty and chapped. Also, quick shoutout to my delivery guy who was still out delivering at 9pm on a long- weekend Friday \ud83e\udef6",

            "Wait, how has *nobody* mentioned the Chanel Baume Essentiel??? It is by far my favourite highlighter stick and blows everything else out of the water, IMO - unscented; subtle but still beautifully glowy; extremely refined in texture; *and* it sticks around better than most other highlighters. For me, Vaseline just isn't glowy; the Westman Atelier stick is a close second but has a slight metallic tinge; the Merit one smells absolutely awful; the Milk one just lacks refinement (as in, there's a slight chunkiness to it); and the Glossier highlighter feels very tacky to the touch. \n\nThe Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood Flawless Filter is also incredible, IMO, but gives a much more subtle glow compared to what's going on with the model in this picture - it feels more to me like a glowy foundation than anything else (but is also one of my favourite highlighting products).",
