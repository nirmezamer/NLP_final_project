Please be descriptive, post any relevant photos of the item you're selling or looking for, and list the price or budget.\n\nPro-tip: there are many \"buy nothing\" and neighborhood-specific groups on Facebook and Nextdoor that can be used to give away or find free items near you. You may find more luck on those social networks than here on Reddit and are more likely to deal with *actual* local users.\n\n**^(BE AUTHENTIC AND SAFE:)** ^(Falsely leading on another Redditor is grounds for being permanently banned from this subreddit. Please remember not to post personal information about yourself or others and exercise caution when privately messaging with anyone you do not personally know or trust. Consider a neutral, public location if you plan on meeting to exchange an item in person.)\n\n**^(HIGH RISK OF EVENT TICKET SCAMS:)** ^(Users seeking to sell or purchase tickets of local events are seeing a significantly-increased risk of being scammed. If you receive a private message from a user who hasn't interacted in this subreddit before, you are very likely speaking with a scammer.)\n\n**^(NO PROHIBITED TRANSACTIONS:)** ^(The posting of) ^(prohibited goods or services) ^(is strictly against Reddit's TOS and are subject to removal by our moderators and/or Reddit's admins.
