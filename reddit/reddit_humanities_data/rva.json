Please be descriptive, post any relevant photos of the item you're selling or looking for, and list the price or budget.\n\nPro-tip: there are many \"buy nothing\" and neighborhood-specific groups on Facebook and Nextdoor that can be used to give away or find free items near you. You may find more luck on those social networks than here on Reddit and are more likely to deal with *actual* local users.\n\n**^(BE AUTHENTIC AND SAFE:)** ^(Falsely leading on another Redditor is grounds for being permanently banned from this subreddit. Please remember not to post personal information about yourself or others and exercise caution when privately messaging with anyone you do not personally know or trust.

            "Hey everyone,\n\nWith Fourth of July week coming up, I would like to offer my pet boarding service to anyone who needs a safe and friendly pet sitter during their travels. I recently started pet sitting to help make additional income while I'm going back to school. I am able to pet sit cats and small dogs currently. I do have a Rover account, which I will link below, for anyone that wants the benefit of added security. I can also offer discounts to anyone who wants to book a private service. Very clean and organized household. Please reach out to me if you have any questions!\n\nHave a great weekend everyone!\n\nRover Link: [https://www.rover.com/sit/donovm27719](https://www.rover.com/sit/donovm27719)\n\n$20 Promo Code: DONOVM27719",
