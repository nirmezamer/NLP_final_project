I scale every single position by buying lots of 300$ each, i never put more than 35% of my portfolio on a open position unless I\u2019m extremely confident on the play and need to average down on a bad entry. Not more than 2 trades a day. If you have any more questions please ask! ",

It\u2019s quite frustrating, but it\u2019s totally my fault as I get carried away with the thoughts of having a perfectly green month or crossing arbitrary \u201ccool\u201d marks like $10k in a month.\n\nI continued doing my go-to options scalps on large and mid cap stocks this month. Also, I tried scalping penny stocks (mostly in the range of $0.10 - $0.30) after hours with good success.\n\nMy realized gains for the month is actually more, but I have around $500 unrealized loss for my 1,000 $SOFI shares. My cost basis was $7.10 initially, then I sold and closed covered calls twice for +$0.20 total. Currently, I have covered calls open for August 2 (the earnings report week) $7.50 strike at $0.20, essentially bringing my cost-basis down to $6.70 now. I will continue to hold.\n\nJuly is probably gonna be my last month this year where I can trade a significant amount of time during my preferred hours (from market open till around 11 am ET and then for a brief period around 2 pm ET), because my masters program will be at the full-pace starting from July 29. Anyway, it\u2019s been already a very good year for me, so my focus will be on just hanging onto these gains.\n\nHappy weekend, everyone! \ud83e\udd42",
