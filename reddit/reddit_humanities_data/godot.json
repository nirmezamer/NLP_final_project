            "Hi, I recently tried to make a post on the main thread but it got pulled because of the automod, something about not having enough Karma. As this is a relatively new account, I thought I should ask about what to do here. Thanks in advance.",
            "Hey all, new godot user here, but a veteran programmer. Been learning how to do godot, and it;s the small things that keep tripping me up... for example I have a spritesheet I turned into an animation which works great with sprite2d, but how do I make that work in the UI? there seems to be no UI element that can play back the animation which is annoying for when I want to use some of the animations in a complicated UI. Is there an easy way to do this I am missing?",
            "Hello, I am Tarek and I am currently busy learning Godot and at the same time write Tutorials. For me this is the best way to practise and get a better understanding of the platform. I am looking forward to spent some time in this subreddit and get to know a few people.",
            "Hi there, I'm creating a 2D RPG in Godot and im here to learn more and help out, cheers",
            "Hi, I'm thinking about making a survival game, where enemies would come in waves of dozens (maybe even hundreds). Of course, I'd like to optimize this, for obvious reasons. Maybe more experienced people might have some advice.\n\nShould I just synchronize all nodes, or treat it like an RTS, which would just transmit commands and not sync all units? What are pros and cons of both approaches? Is there any approach better than both of those?",
            "Hi all! I just released a casual game on IOS using godot 4. I developed it as i was learning the engine. I successfully integrated In app purchases and Admob for my game. There were complex problems but nothing unfixable. I loved using godot. If you have any questions especially about mobile development in godot, i am happy to help out!",
            "Mainly on the 3d artist side of things and still stuck in the \"I got some ideas\" phase, but by golly I'll break past it someday!\n\n*Just gotta learn the coding half of things too..*"

From my point of view all of the goals are good, but if something secondary like merch store is going to delay more important things like engine development or asset store then I am not sure if  I am still for it.",

If someone wants to leave it blank, it's logic they don't feel comfortable answering it.  \nI would say same for location, but I guess at that point the poll might start to lose its meaning, it needs some questions to be required.",

        "content": "Hi all, I was previously maintaining both Godot Box2D and Godot Rapier Physics library.\n\nThe Godot Box2D one has more issues open than the [Godot Rapier Physics](https://github.com/appsinacup/godot-rapier-physics) one, because of the way the API is written for Rapier it was easier to write an addon (it was closer to the Godot Physics API), and I wasn't able to write the Godot Box2D one to be bugfree or good enough (the Character Controller part is very hard to get right).\n\nI will be maintaining still the Rapier addon, as it's better to focus my efforts just on one of the two. The reasons for this are:\n\n* Serialization thanks to rust language\n* Cross platform determinism\n* 2d and 3d\n* API that is much closer to godot one than box2d one.\n* Better safety (this one is copied after Godot Physics, and that one has a lot of raw pointers, as does this implementation)\n\nThe old repo is still available, just it's marked as Archived on Github. The asset on asset store cannot be removed, so I wrote for now in the name that it's no longer maintained.\n\nThanks everyone and hope to provide also more news about the state of the Godot Rapier Physics addon in future.",

I'm using Godot native physics for a 2d topdown mech action game and I'm relying on rigidbodies, mass, forces and impulses to simulate the thrusters and the movement. So far it's been working fine.
