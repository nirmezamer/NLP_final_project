            "Hi! I've been active here for a week now or so, but still very new to game development, starting from zero. I'm learning Godot in C# for now.\n\nThe thing that still causes me the most headache is communication between nodes... what is the best way to get a reference to a different node, how to modify or pass variables between nodes, casts etc.\n\nI'm trying to learn at least one new thing every day and that's enough for now. I hope I can share progress on my game here eventually, even if it won't be for a while!",
            "Hello! I am brand new to the world of game development, I've only recently embarked on understanding the ins and outs of this hobby, but I feel a deep satisfaction from every bit I learn. I've been working with Godot for about 3 weeks and have just finished the first goal I set for myself of creating a scene with a player, an environment with collision, and a functioning camera. \n\nI've also decided to start learning:\n\n* How to code in C#/Learn GDScript\n* Learn how to use Blender for 3D modeling and Importing to Godot\n* Refreshing my 2D Drawing skills for concept art creation\n\nIt should go without saying that I am feeling pretty overwhelmed, but honestly, I am also having so much fun! I've realized this hobby involves a lot of reading here, on Github, and watching a lot of youtube videos. I want to get good enough to do game jams and my ultimate goal is to make a fun game. \n\nI want to make a 3D life sim game with a day/night cycle in the vein of Persona 5/Animal Crossing. Can I achieve this in Godot?\n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated, have a great weekend !",
            "Hello all! Current CS Student halfway to their associates and always had a dream of making video games one day. I just completed this tutorial on YoutTube for my first experience with the Godot game engine ([LEVEL UP Your Game Design Toolkit (Godot for Beginners) (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zL__a0Ei6Vs) ) and it was a bit frustrating but overall a fun learning experience. I'm not too experienced of a coder and I'm pretty lame with coding/game development in general but I am already gaining a passion for this. So hopefully next month I'll be showing off what I do know and asking questions here about stuff I'm striving to learn. Good luck to you all!",
            "Hello Everyone! \n\nI had made a post or two before but hadn't introduced myself before. I am NakedSalmon, and I have been now learning Godot for the last 1 year, I am working towards developing my game: A space tower defence story! I come from a non-programming background so it's been a journey. \n\nI do it in my free time! Good progress lately though!",
            "Hello all! I'm just a humble web developer by day but in my spare time over the last few months I've been rekindling my creative side working on games with Godot, and it's been quite a rewarding journey so far although I still have plenty to learn too.\n\nWhile I've had fun tinkering around with a few different areas including VR, I've made the most progress recently on a little project trying to make it easy to build multiplayer games with phone/browser controls via Websockets. In fact, I'm getting pretty close to releasing my first game with it! It's admittedly small but I'm still proud of how far it's come along, but also appreciative since none of it would have been possible without the amazing work people have put into Godot.",

            "Greetings. I\u2019ve recently started using Godot for both work and hobby projects and I\u2019m absolutely loving how convenient and intuitive working in Godot has been so far.\n\nThe work project is a bit like a floor planning software which utilises shaders to calculate and display a type of heatmap. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the best way to do it, but I\u2019ve been storing the data (resources) separate and updating the 2D/3D scenes when the data changes via signals.\n\nMy first game project I'm working on is a top-down shooter that takes inspiration from the old Wizard of WOR game on the C64.",
