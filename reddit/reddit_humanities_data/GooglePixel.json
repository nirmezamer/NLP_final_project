That being said:\n\nIs there a correlation between owning a pixel & YouTube ad content?\n\nI've had a Pixel Fold since August last year & I've never had an ad when I watch YT. I don't have premium. I'm not watching it thru the browser w/ an ad block extension. This is the official YT app.\n\nHas anyone else noticed this on their Pixel?"

            "Pixel 7 Pro/Pixel Watch 1 user here, a friend of mine recently switched from Android to iPhone and no longer has a need to keep his Pixel Watch 2. In a desire to get it out of his hands as quickly as possible, he's offered me the upgrade for $50. Would this be worth it? I know it's not a huge upgrade but it's also not a huge price so I figured I'd check in here. Thanks!",
            "What is the first thing i should do after getting new Pixel 8?",
            "I'm currently thinking of swapping my realme 8 for a Google pixel 8a, but I read on the subreddit and online that the 8 series has some pretty bad problems and wanted to know if they fixed them.\n\nI read that it has some pretty bad connectivity and calling issues, that the touchscreen is unresponsive, that the battery drains quickly, that after a while black spots appear on the screen and other stuff.\nDid they solve any of it or are these issues still present?",
            "I distinctly remember that I was going to buy the 8 Pro by trading in my good condition 6 Pro 128gb which was quoted for $400 and I added them to cart. Wasn't going to place the order until today afternoon and just noticed that the trade in estimate is now $300. I thought it was an error so added them again in cart but still $300. Has this been happening to anyone else? I'm not sure whether to place the order or wait. Can anybody suggest what should I do?",
            "I plan on switching to Google Fi and they have good offers for a Pixel if I switch, and I'm wondering if I should take advantage of it, or just switch my current phone (S24 Ultra) to Google Fi and hold off until the Pixel 9 Pro comes out? I'm honestly just tempted by the deal more than anything else."

I really had high hopes for this one and I still think it's overall a good one but probably not the one I end up with long term).\n\nI'm currently trying out Windscribe and I've not had the issue so far but it's too early to conclude it's fundamentally more reliable. So far I do think I'm most likely to stick with this one long term, I like the features it has even in the free version, and the custom paid plan which I think will work great for me for $3/month.",

However, I've been increasingly getting embedded into the google ecosystem since getting into Android since I bought my HTC Hero. I use all of googles services pretty much daily weather that's the calendar, keep, drive, or Gmail. \n\nFor smart home I'm wedded to Google Home, even with its issues I like it and it does what I need. I will say recently there seem to have been a lot of improvements wit how responsive Google Home is! My phone is a Pixel 8 Pro, I have a Pixel Watch 2 and love it. Just this week picked up the Pixel Tablet with the dock as I like the idea of it. Enjoying it a lot so far, very happy with the purchase. I'm considering getting the Pixel Buds Pro and essentially going full tilt on the google ecosystem! \n\nSo I'm just kinda curious to see how embedded other people are. I'd say even with missteps and shuttering programs I like, recent example being Google Podcasts. I still on the whole like being in the Google ecosystem and am happy here. ",

            "Pretty much everything Google since Gmail became a thing and in terms of hardware: Pixel phones ever since the Nexus One, Chromecasts, Nest Doorbell, Nest Homes + Minis, ChromeOS devices, Pixel buds. And I guess a Fitbit counts now too.\nBut after really trying with 2 generations of Google WiFi mesh routers I jumped ship to TP Link. Vastly better. That's the only product I have diverged from the Google ecosystem with.",
            "I'm all in. Yes, I have that. All of it lol\n\nBut I did have some interest in iPhone, and I wanted to see the other side last year. Was I being unfair to Apple and doing a disservice to myself by not giving its ecosystem a chance? \n\nLast fall I jumped into Apple with a 15 Pro, Series 7 watch, Airpods Pro 2, Tablet Mini 6th Gen, and MacBook Air M1. What I found: it wasn't the totally seamless experience I heard about and expected. It was not the bug-free utopia I imagined. Everything took extra steps over what I'm used to. I don't feel like typing out all the little things I missed on Android but long story short, I did not enjoy my experience so all my Apple stuff is gone after 6 months. I'm now even more fully convinced of how much I appreciate Android and Pixel in particular, combined with yes even the dreaded Windows - if anything after 30 years I'm welded to Windows for better or worse. \n\nBut I suggest no one take my experience as their own. Get an iPhone and jump into Apple. Maybe you'll love it and not turn back. Or maybe like me you'll find the grass is definitely not greener. Tech is just a tool and no one should be loyal to any tech company.\n\nEdit: the one thing I miss most from Apple is the Airpods Pro 2. They sound so much better than Pixel Buds Pro so I'm really hoping we get a Buds Pro 2 with improved sound this year. And if I'm dreaming go back to the wing design so they actually stay in. (The Airpods fell out even more...but the sound made up for it)\nAs far as the watch, I'm neutral on the Pixel Watch 2. It's fine and nothing I miss about the Apple watch in particular.\n\nEdit 2: I would be overjoyed with a Pixel Tablet 8\" as I absolutely loved the size of the 6th Gen Mini. 11\" is a bit too large for my preference",
            "Welded is bit too strong since I could any day now just hop into my nextcloud installation and do all calendar and contacts from  there. I currently use Google services quite a lot while driving grapheneos on my pixel.\n\nAll apps in phone are installed either from f-droid, Google play or directly using obtainium. \n\nI have chosen the easiest path so far with zero inconveniences due to my lazyness and focus on other parts in life. I could live without Google but chosen not to. Maybe one day, maybe.",
            "I was 100%. Then, no pixelbook, no tablet(yeah I know, but for the money, it's trash), etc.",
            "I use a ton of Google software (Gmail, Drive, YouTube, Keep, Calendar) but not so much hardware. I've been a Pixel user since 2018 but otherwise I don't own any Google hardware.",
            "Pixel fold, pixel watch 2, pixel buds pro, Chromecast with Google TV 4k, my OLED is a Google TV, 2 google home minis, 1 Google home max, 1 small nest hub, Google one, yt premium, Fitbit premium.\n\nAnd of course the software - photos, gmail, search, keep, maps, chrome, drive, and Gemini.\n\nI'll be buying the new iPhone when it comes and start over.",
            "I wouldn't quite say *welded* but I'm definitely growing in how many Google products I use.\nHardware:\nGoogle Home Mini\nGoogle Nest WiFi Pro system \nPixel 8 Pro \nPixel Watch 1\nDaydream headset (bought it not realizing that it's not supported on new phones, maybe I'll buy an old Pixel 2 sometime)\n\nSoftware:\nGmail, Google Drive, and Google Photos are my main apps - I don't use any other software to do their job. I don't have any premium subscription because I put most of my files on a hard drive and back up only what I feel is most important.\nPeople say Chrome browser is not safe but I like how all my information is synced and ready when I need it, no matter which app I'm using.\n\nAnd bugs? I may have encountered a minor glitch once or twice but nothing close to making me complain. I've had a really good experience and will probably continue. \n\nExcept for Google's record for dropping projects and software support suddenly \ud83d\ude15 it seems like they do that a LOT",
            "I'm pretty invested tbh. Got my Pixel Phone, Chromebook, Chromecast, Nest Audio, Mini & Hub, Google Buds, Google Stand and I'll be getting a Pixel Watch next. I'm also using all of their software offerings primarily. And I can confidently say I'm pretty satisfied with the overall experience. I just like how everything is interconnected decently and the overall design language of Google's UI and products. Plus it's a lot less expensive than Apple's ecosystem for example, which allows me to experiment with new hardware more easily.",
            "Google Workspace, Drive, Photos, Calendar, Gmail, Tasks, Fit, Lens, YT music, Google Pay, I may be missing some. I moved away from Pixel hardware for the known problems and am now happy with my Samsung phone and earbuds, but I'm not moving away from the googlesphere unless they make very major changes",
            "In terms of accessibility as a deaf dude, google is light years better than apple so I won't be switching. However if apple is on par or above on service for accessibility I will be switching in a heartbeat."
