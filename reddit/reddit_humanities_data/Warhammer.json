            "Why is the warhammer site so damn awful? \n\nIt's worse in every way when trying to search for and look at models...",
            "What is [this hole on a plasma cannon?](https://imgur.com/a/n98aDG3) Is this something I should drill out alongside the main hole?",
            "Howdy Reddit, I have a question about paints. I've seen many tutorials on YouTube by now and they seem to recommend things like Citadel, AK, Vallejo etc. I've been doing scale military models for years and absolutely LOVE Ammo by Mig. How does it do on miniatures? My daughter and I are about to dive head first into Warhammer, and I've never used citadel paints...",
            "Not sure if this would be the place to ask. My spouse is getting into war hammer and also collecting the novels - I wanted to get some of the books as a gift for him for Father\u2019s Day. This universe is MASSIVE! I do not know where or what to look for. He has \u201cFalse Gods\u201d \u201cHorus Rising\u201d and \u201cgalaxy in flames\u201d",
            "Hi all! I hope it doesn\u2019t bothered anyone if I\u2019m asking about some lore things.\nMy husband finally decide, which army he wants to play. He picks Slaves to Darkness and some Demonguys (I really can\u2019t remember their names).\nHe also really like the Skaven, but mentioned that they would never team up with demons. \nI know there are rules, but since this is a fantasy game, is there any (lore-friendly) possibility that somehow a few skaven would turn theirselfs and team up with a slaves of darkness army? \nThanks a lot for your help!",
            "When to dry brush, and when to not?\n\nI\u2019m just getting started with mini painting (like literally just got my first starter set and paints and brushes!) \n\nAs I\u2019ve been researching and learning I\u2019ve seen a lot of talk about various methods and techniques. Washing, shadowing, highlighting, dry brushing\u2026.\n\nI\u2019ve already primed my first couple minis to paint. \n\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of people talking about \u201cdry brushing\u201d\u2026should I do that *every time*? Is that how to start? Or do you paint your base colors? Then do dry brushing to get more textured details before doing shadows and highlights?\n\nThanks for the advice!",
            "I have a question regarding some of my models I have purchased some tactical squad space marines, primaris hell blasters, a Terminator squad, and a venerable dreadnought. I was originally planning on painting and making an ultramarine but after learning some more I switched my focus to space wolves and I'm wondering which of these models I can use in a space wolf army. Any help is appreciated",
            "Playing my first time in a crusade game.  \nFound out that a lot of lists are running heavy Anti tank.\n\nTo specifically beat Tau with a lot of Fusion would running a World Eaters Daemon Prince (Brazen Helm) with Zerkers, MoE and Jakhals work decently with the first turn 20\" Daemon Prince move or is he running into a melta turn 1 death?",
            "Does Sigmar have a box vs box mode like 40k has with Combat Patrol? I dont want to start a full army or anything for sigmar, but I've really fallen in love with the Seraphon and would pick up a box of them for that"

        "content": "Hey friends\n\nThought I would share a small video I made about painting Warcraft inspired Orruk skin (reddish brown skin).\n\nHope you find it useful :)\n\nStep 1: Over a red base, paint on the volumes of the skin using a pale orange. For the red you can use a color like Vallejo Gory Red (which also comes in spray cans). And for the pale orange, you can use something like Games Workshop\u2019s Ratskin Flesh. Don\u2019t worry about smooth blends.\n\nStep 2: Glaze the same red color from the previous steps into the transition areas between the red and the orange. Focusing the glazing towards the lower parts of each muscle. This will create a smoother transition from the shadows to the highlights.\n\nStep 3: Go back to the same pale orange, but this time thinned down to a glaze. Use this correct any excessive glazing and further smoothen the transition from the shadows to the highlights.\n\nStep 4: Time for the first highlight. Create a mix of the same pale orange color and a pale yellow color. For the pale yellow you can use Vallejo Ice Yellow or Games Workshop\u2019s Dorn Yellow. Apply the mix towards the top of each muscle.\n\nStep 5: Apply even smaller with a mix that contains even more pale yellow.\n\nStep 6: Finally, apply very small highlights using only the pale yellow.",
