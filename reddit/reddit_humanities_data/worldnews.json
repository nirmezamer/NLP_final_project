            "Russia's air strike damages Ukrainian power facilities, injures two\n\n>KYIV, June 22 (Reuters) - Russia launched a new barrage of missiles and drones in an overnight attack on Ukraine on Saturday, damaging energy facilities in the southeast and west of the country and injuring at least two energy workers, Ukrainian officials said.\n\n>Ukraine's air defence shot down 12 of 16 missiles and all 13 drones launched by Russia in the second large strike this week, the air force said. The air alerts in Ukrainian regions lasted for several hours in the middle of the night.\n\n>National grid operator Ukrenergo said equipment at its facilities in Zaporizhzhia region in the southeast and Lviv region in the west were damaged by the strikes.\n\n>Two energy workers in the Zaporizhzhia region were wounded and taken to the hospital, it said.\n\n>Ivan Fedorov, Zaporizhzhia's governor, said the fire broke out at an energy infrastructure facility in the region and further damage assessment was underway as repair brigades and emergency workers dealt with the attack.\n\n>\"We can say for sure: the enemy will not stop. Ukraine needs air defence systems,\" Fedorov said on the Telegram messaging app.\n\n>Moscow has said its air strikes against the Ukrainian energy infrastructure were in retaliation for Ukrainian drone attacks on the Russian territory.\n\n>Lviv regional Governor Maksym Kozytskyi said 67 firefighters and 12 special vehicles were involved in putting out the fire in his region on Ukraine's Polish border. He said there were no casualties in the Lviv region.\n\n>Since March, Russian forces have intensified their bombardments of the Ukrainian power system, knocking out about half of the country's available generating capacity and causing a severe energy crunch.\n\n>Despite warm summer weather, Ukrainian cities face scheduled energy cutoffs and the country's electricity imports from its European neighbours are at record levels.\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-downs-12-missiles-all-drones-launched-by-russia-new-attack-2024-06-22/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-downs-12-missiles-all-drones-launched-by-russia-new-attack-2024-06-22/)",

Belgium, which currently holds the EU presidency, said member states had agreed on a negotiating framework. Volodymyr Zelenskiy called the start of the accession talks a \u201chistoric step\u201d. \u201cMillions of Ukrainians, and indeed generations of our people, are realising their European dream,\u201d the Ukrainian president posted on X. \n\n>A Russian guided bomb killed two people and wounded three in a residential area of an eastern Ukrainian town, Donetsk regional prosecutors said. Five five-storey buildings and six homes were damaged by the bomb on Friday in Selydove, about 14km (nine miles) from the frontline, they said on Telegram. \n\n>The Ukrainian military said its drones struck four oil refineries, radar stations and other military objects in Russia\u00a0in an attack in the early hours of Friday.\u00a0\u201cUnmanned aerial vehicles attacked the Afipsky, Ilsky, Krasnodar and Astrakhan oil refineries,\u201d it said on Telegram. Russian emergency officials, writing on Telegram, confirmed three municipalities of Krasnodar came under \u201cmassive attack\u201d. The Russian journalist-run Astra social media channel reported that Yeysk, home to a military airfield, was hit by drones that sparked fires. Nasa satellite fire monitoring indicated fires or hotspots at the airbase. The Krasnodar region sits across the Kerch strait from Crimea. \n\n>Ukrainian drone attacks put two electricity substations out of action in Enerhodar, the town serving the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant,\u00a0and cut power to most of its residents, Russian-installed officials said on Friday. An official at the Russian-occupied plant said it was unaffected. \n\n>Ukraine said it was dispatching reinforcements to Chasiv Yar, an embattled strategic hilltop town in the Donetsk region and a vital flashpoint whose capture could accelerate Russian advances deeper in the industrial territory. \n\n>The US will send the latest Patriot missiles \u201crolling off the production line\u201d to Ukraine instead of other countries that ordered them, the White House said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to reprioritise the deliveries of these exports,\u201d said John Kirby, the national security council spokesperson. It also applied to Nasams, another type of air defence missile. \u201cDeliveries of these missiles to other countries that are currently in the queue will have to be delayed,\u201d Kirby said, adding that deliveries to Taiwan and Israel would not be affected. \n\n>The Pentagon has given Ukraine approval to use US-supplied missiles to strike targets inside Russia across more than just the frontlines near north-eastern Ukraine\u2019s Kharkiv region\u00a0if acting in self-defence. \u201cIt makes sense for them to be able to do that,\u201d said Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary. \n\n>Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced measures to protect Ukraine\u2019s energy system,\u00a0including protection for power plants under Russian fire and the development of alternative and renewable energy sources. Drone and missile strikes have knocked out half of generating capacity since March, according to official figures. Attacks overnight into Thursday hit four regions and cut power to more than 218,000 consumers, the energy ministry said. \n\n>Three men have been arrested in Frankfurt, Germany, on suspicion of trying to collect information on a person from Ukraine\u00a0for a foreign intelligence agency, federal prosecutors said. They were identified as Robert A, a Ukrainian; Vardges I, an Armenian; and Arman S, a Russian. \n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/22/ukraine-war-briefing-zelenskiy-hails-historic-step-as-eu-set-to-open-ukraine-accession-talks](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/22/ukraine-war-briefing-zelenskiy-hails-historic-step-as-eu-set-to-open-ukraine-accession-talks)",
