            "After fall of Bakhmut and Avdiivka, I was worried that meat grinder model would work everywhere. It is heartening to see the fight back in Kharkiv. Although initially there were embarrassing reports about failure of Ukraine to mine the front effectively, Ukraine seems to have gained upper hand in Kharkiv. Is there any article about the turn around?",

            "To be clear, everyone in this story is Russian and the idea was to test who would shamelessly celebrate a fake poet publishing poems that was just German Nazi poetry translated to Russian.",
            "Reportedly a Bradley making short work of them. Video is a few months old though.",
            "My uninformed speculation: this is what part of the path to Ukrainian victory looks like. Russia runs low on armour, so instead of using 3 BMPs they squeeze 15 troops onto a single lightly armoured one. A single autocannon and a few mortars can cause a dozen casualties, instead of a handful. In the BMP world the russians would also be able to return pretty heavy fire, but nowadays Ukrainians are safer. Russia attacks like a rabid dog, yoloing thousands of troops on MT-LB or BRDM clown cars, stripping units from all over the front to try and look strong. Ukraine kills and maims faster than Russia recruits until a gap opens somewhere and Kharkiv v2.0 happens.",
