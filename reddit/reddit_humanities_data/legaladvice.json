Boils down to basically very bad. She can\u2019t drive without her glasses and has had to rely on uber and myself to take her anywhere for over 2 months. The optometrist said \u201cno more than 2 weeks\u201d but it\u2019s obviously passed that. They say the lenses keep breaking at their lab but isn\u2019t there some expectation that our contract in my paying them mean they should be delivering something?\n\nWe finally caved and bought cheap contacts online just so she could see anything but we\u2019re still out $300 and our insurance won\u2019t cover a new pair for another year. \n\nHow can I help her see again? Ultimately I\u2019d rather have the glasses over the money just due to the time constraints. ",

            "Call your insurance provider and let them know the issue.",
            "NAL, but I worked in an optical shop and lab. The likely answer is that the frame your wife picked out is not compatible with her prescription/and or the type of lens she bought. This can cause breakage issues and not all prescriptions were meant to be put in any frame. There are actually frames that have a restriction on what prescription can be put in it. Without more information on the size of the frame and the type of lens purchased(plastic, polycarbonate or high index) it\u2019s hard for me to advise on that, but it can totally be a case of the sales associate (even in an optometrist office) not knowing the nuances of that. Even though glasses are \u201ccustom\u201d they can be returned and exchanged. I would recommend going back to the optometrist office and asking them if the frame/lens selection is not compatible with each other and if there is a more senior associate who can recommend the correct combination that will work with your wife\u2019s prescription and lens selection.",
            "Ask for a refund. I work in an optical and that is simply unacceptable. We definitely have lenses that break/chip/Crack depending on the material used but even for specialty lenses, it only takes 4 weeks.",
            "Go ahead and call insurance to advise of the issue-they might be able to get a refund. If you have the actual prescription (legally they have to give it to you) you can order glasses for much much cheaper online. Sites like zeelool or glasses shop have a ton of selection and lenses. I'm personally -7.75 and -5.75 with astigmatism, and they make great glasses that I pay about $80 for. \n\nAlso, for contact lenses, mine run about $100 each for a 3 month supply. I go to 1800contacts and get the acuvue oasis lenses. That site WILL need your doc to confirm the prescription, versus the glasses sites.",

            ">they have been warned [...] I've even seen them with the baby at the [picket] fence trying to get her to pet them\n\nThat sounds like an edge case for attractive nuisance doctrine.  You know the baby will try to pet your dogs, which now creates a duty for you to prevent them from doing so.\n\nIf you could prove that the baby was on their side of the fence and unsupervised, then you might prevail in the event that your dogs bite the child, if not for that doctrine.  Supervision is probably an issue.\n\nIf I were your insurer I'd be recommending backing that picket fence with small-aperture wire.",
            "Read up on the attractive nuisance rules in your state.   More than likely this is your issue to solve unless you can prove willful intent for them to get the baby bitten that a jury will believe.         Fix the fence and stick up some no trespassing signs.",

            "NAL. My understanding is that if it happens on your property, it is your responsibility regardless and that liability only increases if you are aware of their tendency to bite. There needs to be some fine wiring or other additional fencing so that the child can not reach the dog without being on your property, and then if they're still trying to get their child to pet your dog, I would call the police about the trespass. Security camera footage wouldn't hurt, either. They are putting you in a situation where you're essentially forced to overreact. Some people suck.",

Now maybe with the housekeeper  being employed it was different. Insurance companies figure it is cheaper for them just to pay out than pay lawyers and just raise rates. Speaking of which my homeowner just went up $400 a year.",
            "Thanks for the advice, they are all good points.   \nI hate to put wire up cause it would look like crap and could injure my dogs. What if I could get video of them letting the kid reaching thru? I have a portable door cam and a still game cam. So far my dogs haven't done anything even with the kid reaching, but it worries me that the Dad was goading the kid to reach thru the fence. I get along with his Mom but I just don't trust the kids 'dad'. Amazon delivered a package to their house by mistake (saw their porch in Amazons delivery pic), walked over and knocked on the door and saw him looking right at me on the stairs in the house but wouldn't answer. When Mom got home I showed her the pic and asked her to ask him, she came back out and said he knew nothing about it. I lied and said I'd have to call the cops and make a report to get a refund. 5mins later she my was at my door with my case of V-8 juice.   \n  Just thinking if I planted the seed of me having a record of him letting the kid reach he might not be tempted to test my insurance. Or I'm just being paranoid, like I say neither work and she looks to be 15, used to catch her climbing in his window when I'd let the dogs out at night."

Child interviews, drug testing over false allegations, DCS case opened, reunification for my daughter and her father. All of it.\n\n\nWe just got our judgement in the mail a couple weeks back and we both have joint legal decision making but he was not awarded any overnights and only 2 afternoons a week for about 3 hours each and 6 hours on Saturdays. \n\nHe had the possibility of overnights in the future if he did at least one therapy session a month with her for 3 months and then filed again with the court and progress had been made. \n\n\nAll of this made him extremely angry, I guess. He stopped answering texts and picking her up. Yesterday after I sent a text asking if he was going to pick her up 15 minutes after the time he was supposed to he sent my daughter and myself a group text saying that he is cutting contact with us, he is no longer doing visitation and the relationship is over unless my daughter goes to the court and says she lied about him ever abusing her and that she is abusing him and he can\u2019t have that in his life. If we want to contact him we need to reach him through email only from now on. \n\nI am assuming our numbers are blocked. He has done that before. My daughter is only 13. \n\n\nMy question is how long do I wait to file for sole legal decision making? We just finished court so it seems awfully premature to go back but, he also said he wants nothing to do with her anymore and told both of us not to contact him so I can\u2019t really co parent with someone that is doing this.

Right now he could reasonably tell the judge that he had an ill-considered but temporary burst of frustration and that yes, your honor, he definitely does want to take advantage of his parenting time going forward , and he would likely get another chance. It would just cost you $$ and time. \n\nI would probably give it at least a few weeks with you reaching out on schedule through whatever documentable channels you have (email, parenting app, whatever) to confirm whether he is planning on utilizing his time.  If he continues to say no (or tells you to chuck off again) you can take it back to court.  Even if he does, you\u2019d probably look better to the court if you continue to make your kid available on the predetermined schedule (I.e, don\u2019t plan conflicting activities).",

They left the scene without repairing it and a representative from the city called me and said it is an illegal connection and that I'll need to drill a new well at my own cost.  Here are the relevant details as I understand them:\n\n* I am on a shared artesian well with at least 5 other homes in my neighborhood, maybe more (nobody really seems to know).  The well head is on a different neighbor's property.\n* The well was drilled in 1977 and my home was built in 1981.  All this predates the city's water records.\n* The water pipe supplying my house crosses a city maintained road inside a city owned culvert.  The city is planning to replace this culvert in the near future.\n* My closing/title documents reference plat records in old city record books, but I have not located any specific details about how my home was connected to this well 40+ years ago.\n* A neighbor on the same shared well has a copy of a well access agreement from 1977 that names 5 lots with access to the water.  My lot is not named on this document, but my home had not been built yet.\n\nThe city representative I spoke to said they are reviewing the situation, but that possible outcomes are:\n\n1. They'll cut and cap the water pipe supplying my home when they renovate the culvert, leaving my home without water.\n2. They'll require the remaining homes on the shared well to file new permits or, more likely, require that all owner's drill individual wells also because community wells are no longer allowed.\n\nAny advice about how I can protect myself?  I'm sure I'm at the point that I need to involved a real estate attorney, but what should I be considering?

How did they think the water was getting to your house?\n\nYour water is running from a well to a city-owned culvert, which I'm assuming means water goes through city owned pipes to reach your house. Since there are no records of your pipe connected to the city owned pipe, I can definitely understand the argument that your connection was unauthorized. \n\nWhy can't you just pay to be authorized to be hooked up to city water? If they are rerouting the water, then I doubt they have an obligation to provide water to a non-recorded connection. I think you have a good argument that the city needs to provide you water immediately and then give you notice that they are going to cut off your water at some date in the future.",
