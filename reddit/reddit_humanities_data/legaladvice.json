When I saw him I realized something was wrong and we went to the hospital because of swelling, the hospital reported the camp to CYF. We were kicked out in retaliation and they are refusing to provide documentation of the incident or a reason for why he was kicked out of camp. Also refusing to pay us back our money for the summer.

In his initial email, he straight up said \"see you in court\".  Also with this, he factored in the tax increase into my rent and increased my rent by about a thousand dollars.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with the bills and the numbers adds up, the landlord also owns like 200+ other properties.\n\nWhat can I do now?\n\nExtra details:\n\nThrough my 8 years with the landlord, not once did he give me a bill for the property taxes or cam or even mentioned it.\n\nAlso losing side on a trial pays the winning side attorney fees.\n\nIf it helps or doesn't help, the invoices also doesn't have a set due date\n\nThis is signed with my LLC with a personal guarantee.",

        "content": "Hello I live in Cincinnati, Ohio. I own a home in a mixed use area. Primarily residential with a few stores and restaurants. My neighboring building has multiple small restaurants in it. The building sits about 170 feet away with a public parking lot dividing my property from the other building. About 6 months ago a new business moved into the building in question. They are a local BBQ business, and the owner purchased two giant industrial sized smokers to cook in and had them placed in the parking lot directly facing my home. He apparently prepares food for all his restaurants through his new location and smokers. The problem is that this creates massive amounts of firewood smoke, for as much as 12-14 hours a day. Currently my house is constantly sealed or the smell of smoke will seep into everything. When it was open the smell is overwhelming and the room becomes noticeablely hazy. And I can't be outside to enjoy my own property without getting a migraine and my eyes swelling. I have tried talking to the owner but he refused to acknowledge that there was an issue. So I was curious if there was anything I can do to find a remedy to this situation. It's something I've never had to deal with before so I'm not sure if I even have a valid complaint. I did live in Oregon for many years, and I know when wood burns it releases alot of particles in the smoke. Over a short time it is inconsequential, but sustained smoke exposure will cause problems for both life and property and it does concern me. Thanks ",

AFTER we moved in, the property manager let us know the owner decided to sell the building. Flash forward to today, the landlord called and told us the building sold and that the new owners want us out before the end of July. He said they were offering us a deal that we wouldn't have to pay rent for the month of July if we moved out before this deadline. Then I asked if this was our only option, and he said yes, which confused me because it's not really a \"deal\" if it's the only thing we can do. Then, I asked \"wasn't our lease legally binding\" and he said that no, apparently the lease becomes void when the property is sold to someone new.  The lease that we signed does NOT mention this. \n\nIs this true? Can they just do that? And if they can, what should we do? We obviously wouldn't have much of a choice, but most (if not all) places aren't even available until August, and all of our current (very limited) options are either too far away, or too expensive. \n\nMy current plan is to call the property manager tomorrow and ask if we can extend our deadline to august 1st, at least, as that is when most properties become available. I may also ask what will happen if we don't leave, just so I can get some clarification on the situation. I'm suspicious they may be trying to use underhanded language to make us think we have to leave when we really don't?\n\nPlease suggest any questions I should ask, or what I can do in this situation!
