            "This makes the most sense. Its the best chess app in my opinion but has no player base so I just play with AI or friends. Hoping for a huge influx! \n\nThe animated chess pieces are great with kids but best for me is just normal mode in the garden setting. Its really nice.",
            "I don't know how to play Chess and don't have time to learn. So obviously I bought it. ",
            "It's because today is the third anniversary of this game. They're also releasing a new Mixed Reality update on July 20th - which is the International Chess Day.",

            "Worked for me. Thanks a lot",
            "Not usually a chess fan, but I bought it earlier today. I found myself playing a lot of these 90% of games. Really great tactic!",
            "Yeah theyre not promoting this offer though. Only in their dc.\n\nWhat they need is an Integration with chesscom or lichess",
            "If you'd like to play Chess in VR against real people, I can also recommend VRChat. Even if this weird (but wonderful) place isn't usually your cup of tea, they have a pretty big community of well-mannered chess players. These chess instances are usually pretty strictly moderated and trolls are being dealt with quickly."

            "It's sad they never bothered to make an updated version worthy of the Quest 3. Netflix used to be everywhere back in the days. If a toaster was released with a screen they would make an app for it. An now they don't bother anymore even on popular devices like the Quest 3.",

            "Way better with Big Screen or Virtual Desktop anyway.",
            "Plex + Skybox is the way to go anyway."

It's a cool test you've made there, but I had absolutely no trouble believing that it handles swinging your hands wildly for no reason pretty well. I'm more curious how it performs in low-light conditions when I'm actually trying to accomplish something that requires precision.",

            "You're not really showing off its capacities that well here, but whenever I used hand tracking low light or not, it's always rather janky. When people use it headset for the first time, it never works well enough for them and always have to revert back to the controllers.",
