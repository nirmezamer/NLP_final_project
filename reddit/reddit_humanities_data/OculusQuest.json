        "content": "# Bi-Weekly Questions Megathread\n\nWelcome to the Bi-Weekly r/OculusQuest Community Q&A megathread!\n(Yes, we're still tweaking things :) )\n\n# Getting Started with Quest 3\n\n* **Charge**: Plug in your Quest to charge, so after everything is ready, you have plenty of battery!\n* **Account Creation**: Make your Meta account if you haven't already on the Mobile app.\n- **Game Gift Cards:** Meta has gift cards available at different retailers, depending on region.\n\n## Things to Avoid in VR\n\n* **Guardian**: Ensure you set your guardian in a spacious area with nothing to hit. Give a buffer for safety.\n* **Sunlight**: Protect the lenses from direct sunlight. It can damage the display.\n* **Sickness**: If you feel nauseated, take breaks. Pushing through might make things worse.\n* **Cleaning**: Use only microfiber cloths for the lenses, and avoid cleaning liquids. I use Koala Cloths, which you can [find here](https://www.amazon.com/Koala-Microfiber-Cleaning-Eyeglass-Computer/dp/B06X9V866C)\n\n## Game Recommendations for Quest (Standalone)\n\nCheck out [Gibby's Guide](https://gibbysguide.org/content/gibbysguidev24_lores.pdf)\n\n## Other Things to Do with Your Quest\n\n* **Other Stores**: Check out games on [Sidequest](https://sidequestvr.com/setup-howto) or [App Lab](https://www.applabdb.com/).\n* **Exploration**: Join friends on [Wooorld](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4360608937312293).\n* **Watching**: Enjoy 3D Movies on [Bigscreen](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2497738113633933/).\n* **Productivity**: Use Quest for work with apps like [Workrooms](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2514011888645651) or [Virtual Desktop](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2017050365004772).\n* **PCVR**: Play PC VR games if you have a [VR Ready PC](https://support.oculus.com/articles/headsets-and-accessories/oculus-link/oculus-link-compatibility/).\n* **Improved Standalone Experiences**: Check out [Quest Games Optimizer](https://anagan79.itch.io/quest-games-optimizer). Be aware this does require Developer mode.\n\n## Playing PCVR with Quest\n\n* **Wired**: Use Oculus Link with a USB 3.0 cable.\n* **Wireless**: Play wirelessly using [Air Link](https://support.oculus.com/airlink/), [Steam Link](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/5841245619310585/), [Virtual Desktop](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2017050365004772/), or [ALVR](https://github.com/alvr-org/ALVR).\n\n## Referrals\n\n* We currently advise to use [Meta-Dog](https://meta-dog.github.io/meta-dog/) as we don't allow referrals to be posted here.\nYou can learn more about the referral system meta provides [here](https://www.meta.com/legal/quest/app-referrals/).\n\n## Coming from a Quest 2?\n\n**Common Questions:**\n\n* **Will my Games work on Quest 3?**\nAny existing Quest 1 or 2 games will work fine, for PCVR most titles work perfectly out of the box.\n\n* **Why is my Quest 3 charging slowly?**\nThe stock charger that comes with the Quest 3 is a fairly low power charger, using another PD Charger 20w or above can help with charging speeds.\n\n* **What are some common problems with PCVR using Link on Quest 3 and how can I fix them?**\nCommon issues seen in our community are related to wireless issues, make sure you have a wired connection to a 5ghz or 6ghz router for best performance.\n\n* **How can I remove free apps from my library?**\nAt this time, Meta has not made this possible.\n\n* **Is there a way to increase the field of view (FOV) on the Quest 3, or make it more comfortable?**\nMake sure your fitment is right, you can find a guide [here](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/help/quest/articles/getting-started/getting-started-with-quest-3/adjust-fit-feel-quest-3/)\n\n* **How can I buy games on a discount for the Quest 3?**\nYou can wait for sales, get an app referral from a friend, or use Meta Dog for referrals.",

            "So I got a quest 3 yesterday and it's my first VR experience, I must say I am very blown away.\n\nSome of the most amazing things are 360 3D videos, it's amazing, almost like being there...\n\nMy question is, does anybody have good recommendations for 360 3D youtube channels?",
            "Am I inept or is the glasses spacer on the Quest 3 just that shit? \n\nI've been using my brand new Quest 3 for about a week or two, with the glasses spacer adjustment set to max that whole time.   \nLo and behold here I am staring at a deep goddamn scratch on my right lense, regardless of glasses spacer. \n\nI am bloody furious.",
            "I saw reports of factory reset breaking the quest 2 a month ago. Is the issue fixed? I wanted to give my device to a friend but the fear of breaking the device stops me.",
            "I own a quest 2 and use it with my gaming PC with AirLink over 5ghz to play steam games.\n\nI haven't used it since Alyx came out and I'm trying to get back into it, I was wondering if people could tell me about all the other ways of gaming on my PC with the headset and controllers or steering wheel. The FAQ says Virtual Desktops ($30, most features built into airlink?) and ALVR which I haven't looked into much.\n\n\nI Feel going Quest OS > Quest Link > Steam VR is a few steps that might be reducing performance (not really noticing it, just an annoying amount of loading screens before I can play a game)\n\nAlso any recommendations for experiences would be nice, I'm mostly playing things like driving games when in VR and have heard the original assetto corsa modded is one of the best experiences however I come from the age of modding Halflife and would be interested in seeing what kind of cutting edge experiments people have made available over polished but boring games.\nWhat's the VR equivalent of goku flying around de_rats?",
            "I turned on DLNA media streaming in my windows PC to use with DeoVR. It works great. But I have a question about it: Does turning DLNA on but not currently using it take up resource (network, ram, cpu) of the PC? Does it keep running in the PC?\n\nThank you.",
            "Anyone else's Quest 2 bricked by the Factory Reset/App bug? Anyone have a fix? I'm losing my mind",
            "What is the best game for torturing people available? Blade&Sorcery is very cool but it's a bit old and there might be something better at this point.",
            "Is there an app to download for reading digital books? Seems like an odd request, I know. But I like the idea of doing it hands-free.",
            "Recently took the plunge and have enjoyed my time so far with the Quest 2 massively. Was wondering if there were games similar in style to GTA? Crime, gunplay and driving, etc.\n\nAdditionally, what accessories can I buy that are considered must-have? A new strap is definitely on the books, but is there anything else i should be considering? Thanks.",
            "sure this has been asked a lot but is the quest 2 worth it or should i save a bit more for the quest 3? it\u2019s around \u00a3200, and i\u2019ve been wanting to get into VR for a while now. also js it any good for pcvr as that is probably something i\u2019d be using it for the most, though not exclusively"

        "content": "For those of you that know me pretty good on here, I'm not one that usually makes my own posts, I usually just reply on other peoples posts... But this is a special occasion.  I know a lot of us have been buying some of these \"greatly reduced in price\" games, but here is a bit of a heads up.   Over the past month I have bought probably 10+ games where I have to key in a promo code.. Then it reduces the price, the amount is deducted from my Quest Cash and its a done deal.\n\nHOWEVER... On 4 of my purchases they have done the following.. Take Mannequin for example.  Normally $20.. I bought it for half off.. So they took $10 from my Quest Cash.. Then they charged the rest to my Discover Platinum card.   One game .. Max Mustard, we all bought for $3 right?  Well they charged my Discover card $27.\n\nI rarely look at my credit card statements, but I happened to be looking for something entirely unrelated and then went down this rabbit hole.\n\nTL:DR ... Check to make sure they didn't charge you full price for some of these recent offers that involve entering a promo code.\n\nBefore anyone asks, yes I made sure the code was applied at checkout.  I'm in the US.  Its ONLY the ones where you manually have to type a code.  Not only is it on my credit card statement, if you go to your purchase history in the app, it shows it plain as day.   Max Mustard $3.00 Quest Cash  $27.00 Discover ending in ####.. Total price $30.00\n\nYes I've contacted support.  Yes most of my game purchases were fine.  Even the emailed receipts show the money being only removed from my Quest Cash and the rest is the discount amount.  But its sure in my purchase history and credit card bill.\n\nSo, heads up.. Been buying games for years and never had an issue.  I wouldn't have ever even noticed this.\n\nEDIT-  I do not blame any of the devs for this, but since a LOT of us bought Max Mustard, I reached out to the dev to make him aware.  Some of us were charged full price, some of us it just looks like we paid full price, and some had no issues at all.  \n\nEdit 2.. Its not just games you had to enter a promo code for.. I just saw that I got charged the same way with both Contractors Showdown and Stride Fates.  Those were on just a normal sale I think..  Edit to this edit.. Stride Fates I bought in March, and Contractors Showdown I got in May.  How long has this been a thing?\n\nLuckily, most people seem to just have the weird shit showing up on their meta stuff, but were not charged.  But some, like me, have been.   I will keep updating as I hear things.  This wasn't to start a panic, or cause people to grab their pitchforks.. Its just a \"heads up\" to my Quest peeps!",

            "You had me check. All of my recent 90% games were fine except for Max Mustard. That one shows the full price charged to my card for $29.99 on the purchase history on the Meta app only. I just checked my bank account as I got that earlier in the month and I was only charged the $3.00 for it. All the others were fine as well. You have me a little paranoid now though because all the other games only show their correct discount price. But not max mustard, it showed full price in the meta app but charged me like normal for the $3. Weird",
            "I think you might be right. I just checked my history and it\u2019s charged for 30 dollars for Max Mustard. I used the code, and it was definitely 3 dollars. I\u2019ve got to look into it further.",
            "So far for me on PayPal are 3 transaction of meta, all matching the final low price of 2 or 3 dollars per game.\n\nMy bank statements for my card also reflects that so I'm OK.\n\nHowever thanks for this post, with meta you never really know.",
            "~~You know what, I wonder if this issue happens with other promotions. Back when they were offering an extra 25% off for a bundle of 3 games, I got charged more than expected. I thought that it was just because I miscalculated, but maybe there is some fine print here...yeah I got charged full price for Max Mustard as well. I have no idea why this is happening~~\n\n~~Edit: Apparently I got charged the full price for a game I used a referral code on??? Man this is actually really bothering me now~~\n\nEdit 2: So looking through my actual PayPal statement, the extra charge that appears in my Meta purchase history is not actually there. It appears to be some artifact of the meta platform, and I have not actually been charged full price for Max Mustard. I don't know why it did that for Max Mustard but not the other games...",
            "Max mustard shows Meta Cash + PayPal in my purchase history, but it doesn't show anything purchased on that day or of that amount in my PayPal history.\nFor now no issues except that it shows up weird on the meta app, i hope it stays that way.",

            "It\u2019s likely a bug for Max Mustard in the Quest Store purchase history. I checked PayPal and it shows $3, but my purchase history on the Quest Store showed $29.99. Just got off chat with support and they confirmed that I wasn\u2019t charged the full amount even though the purchase history showed otherwise.",
            "I haven't given them my credit card information yet but thanks for the heads up. I think I will just buy the meta gift cards instead from a store or something.",
            "Oh my god you're right. 3 games 90% off no worries, but Max Mustard full price. Checked my PayPal and it shows the discounted amount though, maybe it's something with Quest Cash? Thanks for the heads up though, I'll be a lot more careful in the future."

            "While the warping (especially) along depth discontinuities is impressively reduced, it also shows the - sadly inevitable - tradeoff: the perspective error is significantly higher at close range. \n\nAnd to be honest, at least for me it makes close-range interaction like reading your phone feel...off.",
