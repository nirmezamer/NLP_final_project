            "So I figured I'd open the old Runescape account, since my laptop can't run much. Turned out I'd been banned for botting earlier this year (someone else had access apparently). \n\nJust got it back and damn, he'd been busy! Very pleased with all the goodies he'd got me.",
            "I'm going to a day event called BS3. It's mostly garage, rnb and a bit of dnb. Gonna be cheesey but hopefully really fun! I'm going with my best friend who I've not been out with in years so I'm really looking forward to it.",
            "Last night I passed out at 8pm, which is incredibly unusual as normally my insomnia keeps me awake until at least midnight. Maybe I need to start getting up very early every morning.\n\n\nThe plan for today is to tackle the garden. I doubt we'll get it all done but who knows?\n\n\nI'd like to go somewhere this weekend, even if it's just a park or something.",

            "Should've been picking my new glasses up at 9AM but Boots delayed them at half 6 last night. Terrific.\n\nGonna get my hair cut at half 10 and then I think I'll do some tidying up in the garden but will ultimately end up just watching the Euros all day.",

            "Having my theeth done with retainers this week, so sucking room temp tea through a straw every morning. I'm used to gulping near boiling tea like a tea drain, so sedentary slow metal straw sucking is doing my head in. I might need to switch to necking an can of iced coffee for 6 months.\n\nAny why even go through all of this? For what? Because executive teams do secretly give or don't give out promotions all beause someone doesn't have nice teeth? Am I doing all of this just to climb the ladder so I can have piles of cash? Actually when you put it like that it seems fine.\n\nI don't agree people should be judged based on their teeth, but they are, and I am, so I'm putting that stray front tooth back in it's place.\n\nAlso I've got a lisp for the next sixth months, which there's also nothing wrong with, however, it is funny if you've never had one and then suddenly get one.\n\nGot this metal straw clanging against my cup of tea is annoying. Perhaps I should lob my tea out of the window?"
