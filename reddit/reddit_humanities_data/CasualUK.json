            "Attending a wedding later this afternoon. First time Ive been to a proper event since having my son 18 months ago. After being in the pits of postnatal depression, starting to feel better about myself and my new body and identity, so cant wait to dress up and feel confident again.",
            "Couple of weeks ago I got ID'd and refused service in Sainsbury's as I didnt have my driving licence on me (I'm 44, haven't been ID'd in yonks so that was nice), so today I'm going to see if I can pass for a 70+ yo in M&S when I go to try and return my mum's online order for her later.",
            "I was really excited to get my new bbq lights through the post. They have a magnetic base and will just click on to the gazebo, nice and easy.\n\nIn somewhat related news, I'm an idiot and my gazebo is made out of aluminium.",
            "I flew back from my rig yesterday and I still feel like absolute shit today. Everyone looked out the window as we approached land near Peterhead and the pilots brought chopper down lower to fly alongside the cliffs of Aberdeenshire. You could see the birds of Longhaven, Bullers o'Buchan, the Dracula castle and the seals on the beach and all the way up to the foothills of the Cairngorms. It was lovely except that it was windy as fuck yesterday so we got tossed about the whole time. \n\nAnyway I'll be headed back up that direction today with a friend for some photography event in Fraserburgh but idk if I can stay awake this morning.",
            "Tip run today! Feel like a proper adult.",
            "Completed on our first flat last week, so my parents are coming over to have a nosey and help transport a few things between our current rental and the new place. If theyve got time well take them out for lunch but I dont think theyre staying very long. Once theyve left well start the redecoration job, so glad its cooled down a little.",
            "I've had covid for 10 days and today is the first day I haven't felt atrocious. I'm still sick but so grateful to feel a little better, and outside my window I can hear birdsong.",
            "I'm getting my first tattoo, no one knows but me",
            "Green Day are playing Dookie and American Idiot in full at Wembley. Cant wait!",
            "Just finished scrubbing cat sick off my kids glittery Kickers. Next up: sitting in roadworks traffic to get her to dancing. But then I get an hour in an amazing cafe where they know my order and I can turn my anxiety riddled brain off for a bit."

            "What's the point of this product?",
            "The ad should have been that one clip of The Hitcher in The Mighty Boosh going elements of the past and elements of the future, combined to make something not quite as good as either.",
            "This product still baffles me every time I see it. Did the company never have a meeting about who their target market was? Because the group of people that would be interested in buying this must be absolutely tiny.",
            "They make a milk with the same method as well, that seems even more pointless.",
            "I really want to know who they marketed this for? My parter eats dairy but I don't, neither of us bought this",
            "This product was destined to fail",
            "I saw that in the shops and thought it was a badly researched idea with no audience.\n\nIt's like selling chocolate-coated lettuce.",
            "I'm kinda baffled how this ended up in the supermarkets. What was their pitch? Surely they must have sold it on the basis that there is a market for this or that the product has some supposed benefits, but then the branding/packaging doesn't explain it at all so almost everyone is just left confused.",
            "Should have called it Smeg. Would have matched the smell better."
