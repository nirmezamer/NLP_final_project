Haven't really kept up with it, but considered switching to it when said lab meat became more mainstream...but it seems to be getting banned before the product really comes to store shelves: [https://www.greenqueen.com.hk/upside-foods-florida-bans-lab-grown-meat-cultivated-chicken-miami/](https://www.greenqueen.com.hk/upside-foods-florida-bans-lab-grown-meat-cultivated-chicken-miami/) and Florida is seemingly not the only one.\n\nWhy is this? Why are they banning a yet to be released product and a (assumedly) less cruel way of producing meat.

            "Answer: Without getting too deep into the exact politics of it all, the fact is that the US has a powerful agricultural lobby that really wants to preserve the rights and profits of food industry, including meatpackers and \"traditional\" meat producers. Lab-grown meat would cut into the \"traditional\" meat industry profits, so the \"Big Ag\" lobbies to have it limited if not outright banned to preserve their interests.\n\nThere are also the actual concerns over whether the cultivated meat is safe, what should we define as \"meat\", and so on; a lot of legislature to figure out (there's a reason very few countries have permitted lab-grown meat to be sold in stores so far). But with the political climate being what it is, it's hard to determine how much of the bans are motivated by scientific concern, and how much is the result of political lobbying.",
            "Answer: performative culture war nonsense and conspiracy theorists.",
            "Answer: lab grown meat is associated with progress, which means conservatives hate it. They are banning lab grown meat to own the libs and also because the meat industry is lobbying against their future competitors.",
            "Answer: Some are afraid the government will use lab grown meat as a pretext to ban traditionally grown meat.  People in the meat business are worried they'll lose their jobs because of it, and people who like to eat meat are worried it won't taste as good as the real thing and the transition will be forced prematurely.\n\nPoliticians are pandering to those crowds by coming out in opposition of lab grown meat, therefore also opposing any slippery-slope consequences that might come along with its development.",

            "To the far right, \"globalist\" translates to Jews.",
            "Probably also because it's not cruel enough to animals.  What's the point in eating meat if you don't get the satisfaction of knowing that a living animal was raised in sub-standard conditions and killed to harvest it?  \n/s"
