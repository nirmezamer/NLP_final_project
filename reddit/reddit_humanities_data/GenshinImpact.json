            "I did a 10-pull on the Furina banner and my connection got funky for a moment. Still got the rewards, however it wasn\u2019t saved in my history. Does anyone know if my pity will still increase?",

            "What's the benefit of using Yao Yao over Nahida (1000 EM) on my Hyperbloom team (Alhaitham, Xingqui, EM Raiden (900)? Like I guess it's just the healing for content where i might need it like spiral abyss? I should say i have a full set of Deepwood Memories for her (YaoYao) with all a HP/ER build.",
            "does anyone else wish this game had \"magical\" mounts? Sorry if this isn't considered a real question, I just wanted to know if anyones ever thought of this too bc I would love to collect some. the mounts would only appear on flat land until you need to climb, swim, or fight and then it would disappear, like gliding, how the wings disappear when you're on land but the opposite. \n\nIt would give a walking boost like 20%. I feel like every rpg game has a mount feature and maybe im basic af but i want mounts in this game too, like imagine riding an ostrich or being carried by balloons in the air",

His burst animation is so full, it\u2019s like a mini movie\nFirst you see him throw his hat and the camera aims at his hat so you are distracted like a magician would do, than he starts disappearing and turning into cards that fly towards the hat, and finally the car appearing out of the hat, all of this on a giant scene and with a big spotlight",

It prolly be some team comps of the big 3 dps (Neuv, Arle, Alha)  but idk maybe even the team comps of the characs that are not even included in the big 3 deal bigger damage than the team comps of the big 3.

            "assuming c0r0, probably neuvillette, furina, kazuha, zhongli for most scenarios.\na team that i\u2019ve found weirdly underrated tho is hu tao plunge for single target, which is genuinely one of the strongest teams i\u2019ve ever seen/played, and is perfectly viable at c0. the team is hu tao, furina, yelan, xianyun. genuinely havent seen enough people talk about this when it comes to the strongest teams, because i think its a contender for best single target right now.",
            "Burgeon team breaks everything, every enemy in the game can be hurt by it and the combination of Nahida/furina/Xiangling gives you maximum off-field damage, if you run baizhu with OHC and r5 amber in 4th slot he also gets a decent amount of damage in and generates enough energy to fill the gaps and get full uptime.\n\nI've been running this team through abyss with all manner of different teams on the other side and no matter how optimal they are, the burgeon team just runs smoother.",
