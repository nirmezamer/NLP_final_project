It prolly be some team comps of the big 3 dps (Neuv, Arle, Alha)  but idk maybe even the team comps of the characs that are not even included in the big 3 deal bigger damage than the team comps of the big 3.

            "side 1 c6 Neuvi\nside 2 c6 Arle",
            "theres not really a best team because it fully depends on the enemy youre facing",
            "It highly depends on what you classify as \"strongest\". Constellations and weapons need to be considered, as well as the enemy type and whether or not you value consistency or ease of play. I'll give you a few teams that probably satisfy \"strongest\" depending on a few criteria.\n\nFor full whale teams, it's almost always some variation of furina plunge. C6r5 furina + xianyun + supports to facilitate vape allows you to output ridiculous 300k+ dps rotations. This team would get top times in pure raw dps competitions like speedrunning killing the abyss jumpy geo ball a few months ago without breaking shield. Neuv, wriothesley, and arlecchino aren't far behind.\n\nIf you're referring to what most people consider the standard (meaning all c6 four stars, all c0 five stars, and signature weapons allowed), then spreadsheet impact has lyney and arlecchino overload teams on top, mainly due to how ridiculously op c6 chevreuse is. This just measures dps though, so if you care about other metrics then:\n\nChilde international still remains one of the quickest clearing speedrun teams for aoe chambers. Despite being playable before inazuma even came out, this team consistently scores top 3 clear times in virtually every aoe abyss. However, this relies on slight crit fishing for childe burst, as well as extremely good timing and enemy AI manipulation. This team falls off quite hard for a normal player and I wouldn't even place it in my top 5 for teams I could clear abyss quickest with.\n\nThis leads to the obvious answer: Neuvillette. Neuv hyper teams with furina and zhongli allow you to never die, output insane amounts of aoe damage, and be piss easy to play. For the f2p player this is basically the dream team and probably what comes to mind when you mention \"strongest\" even if it doesn't have the highest theoretical dps. \n\nA final shoutout to my favorite overworld character to play: arlecchino - the only character who can do 40k+ solo damage a hit, be non burst reliant, have an infusion that persists off swap (and lasts indefinitely), while also having quite nice exploration qol in the form of her dash. If you know how to dodge I would firmly put her in her own tier of strength for exploration dpses.",
            "If C0R0 then it definetely Neuvi hyper (Neuvi, Furina, Kazuha, Baizu/Zhongli)\n\nIt can deal to *anything* on every abyss line up except enemies that completely immune to hydro and if there are any they still can dominate the other side without hydro immune. Everyone at C0 with 4 star weapon (Proto Amber on Neuvillette and favonius weapon on the rest members) can still outperform alot of teams with multiple signature weapons\n\nIt has everything a perfect tean want in present day's meta : insane damage output, insane range, no limited movement, no energy issues, great AOE, crazy single target damage, ultimate grouping from kazuha and ultimate sustain from zhongli on top of that really *consistent* and very easy to play. Even if you mess up the rotation this team can still murder everything due to how busted internal strength of each members are.\n\nI think Alhaitham Hyperbloom is close to 2nd best\n\nThere might be some team that *theoritically* outdamage and can speedrun faster than Neuvi hyper but in term of consistency of DPS this team always on top because how insanely good this team on *practice*.\n\nThe only downside of this team is it consists of 4 limited 5 stars but all of the peoples here are cheap to build and very complete at C0 while being the best in their respective role and even F2P are suggested to pull for these characters just to make your account better in general : Neuvillette (best field DPS), Furina (best Sub Dps) , Kazuha (Best utility) , Zhongli (Best sustain). This is All Star team at it's finest.",
