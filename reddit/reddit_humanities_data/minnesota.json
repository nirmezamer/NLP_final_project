            "Is the tail end of summer/early fall a good time of year to move in? I'm hoping to relocate there later this year, and I don't have much stuff I need to move, but I want to give myself enough time to get settled in and get all my winter supplies before the snow hits.",
            "Hi there! My partner and I are strongly considering a move to Minnesota from Missouri (Misery).\nThis will be a bit of an overshare.\n\n\n\nOur top reasons for moving:\n\n\n1. My partner has leukemia, and the way healthcare always seems to be under threat places them him in a constant state of dread. Access to quality care and consistent good state policies are important for our collective mental health.\n2. We believe that everyone is equal and that they deserve happiness and safety. That doesn't really fly here. We want to raise a family somewhere they can learn by example of their community to be a good person\n3. To expand upon #2,\u00a0We don't feel like we can be ourselves around our neighbors or even some family members because their world views are so skewed. I want to go grocery shopping and know that the majority of those shopping around me aren't homophobic racists who think I should just die if I get an ectopic pregnancy. The friction of living somewhere we don't fit has caused a lot of isolation and anxiety.\n4. We don't like how our taxes are used (can't see anything productive being done with them) yet I'm paying a substantial chunk of change on a used car that no one would even buy from me.\n\n\nAll that being said, I grew up in Illinois country, and I miss growing fruit trees and raising chickens and being able to walk out onto my property in a nightdress (aka privacy). We really want to live in a more rural area and start an orchard, keep bees, etc.\nI've done EXTENSIVE research into Minnesota, but sometimes I wish I could just get a straight forward answer about the actual vibe.\n\n\nAre there ANY blue or blue leaning/blue behavior-ed counties in rural Minnesota where we could openly be ourselves?\n\n\nAlso, what's the best way to meet people and make new friends there? I've seen a lot of comments about Minnesotans keeping to themselves out of habit. I would love to be an active member of a community, and I naturally get along with all types. My husband is a good natured, naturally curious, helpful person who loves to pitch in, so I know he will find a niche. I generally enjoy pragmatic people who can appreciate the small stuff, so I'd like to think it wouldn't be that hard to establish ourselves.\n\n\nThat's about it.\nI'm grateful for any helpful commentary.",

            "\nAnyone here taken their road test in Alexandria? Have one scheduled fairly soon; I'm a little bit nervous after seeing all the poor reviews on Google. It may just be the test jitters--I'm taking my road test for the first time--but at the same time, Alexandria is a long ways away and I'd rather not drive 5+ hours round-trip just to auto-fail in four minutes. Anyone here taken it who can give me some advice?",

We\u2019re looking at several locations for a fairly quiet town to raise our family that isn\u2019t extremely pro-Trump, and has decent schools. Based on our research, Roger\u2019s might fit that bill, but curious as to if locals have a different perspective",

I will make ~70-80k annually. \n\nJust looking for any general advice given my basic info:\n\n* Single male, mid 20s\n* Probably looking to rent, something like an apartment/condo but not opposed to home owning in the future.\n* I've lived in NY, Florida, and Ohio so I'm not that much of a stranger to winter.\n\nMy main concern is how rural this county is (and cost of living), and while I'm not opposed to it (I live in a rural area right now, but it is nowhere near what I'm seeing in Cook), and how easily you can adapt to this.",
            "For turns on drivers tests\n\n\nHow many points are they worth?\n\n\nI'm allowed to miss 20 \"points\" and still pass but I have no clue how many points a \"Fair\" is and how many points \"poor\" is. I know I turn early but I don't know how close I am to passing and I need to know if this is something I need to be drilling myself on as much as possible until my test or if I only need a little bit of practice. Because how they were talking made it seem like I could walk in 1 week later and pass",

            "I\u2019m from the Range, went to college in Mankato, and live in the metro, so I feel like I\u2019m oddly qualified to answer this conundrum.\n\nWhen referring to Up North, I\u2019d say it means the great north woods. So I\u2019d actually draw the line across from cloquet and then at an angle north from Walker to Roseau.  The people there very similar. But the folks who live on the plains of western MN are not the same culture.  Someone in Crookston is more similar to someone in Worthington than someone in Hibbing.\n\nNow I do understand why some want to include Brainerd and Lake country in Up North, but it\u2019s in the middle 1/3 of the state and lakes country people I find to be their own thing. Not like people in the Metro, plains, or Up North.  \n\nSo it\u2019s a bit of physical geography but it\u2019s more cultural geography.",

So to me, anything sufficiently out of the metro (less light pollution) and north of Iowa. Bonus if there\u2019s rocks and cows.\n\nYou\u2019re like asking three different things in the text of the post.",
            "When I hit that pine line I am up Nort. Wherever the biome transitions from deciduous to coniferous.\n\nWhether that be Brainerd/Baxter area on 371, or near Hinckley on 35, etc.\n\nOnce I hit that pine line I'm in heaven. If I'm not in a mix of pine, poplar, birch, etc. I'm not up North. I'm in a prairie/grassland/farmland or deciduous forest. None are up North. \n\nI'll die on this hill.",
            "Anything past B.",
            "I think C most accurately qualifies as northern MN. Lots of lakes and cabins in B. When I think of northern MN, I think of the Iron Range cities, Virginia/Hibbing/Eveleth. Cloquet and Duluth are the southernmost part of northern MN in my mind.",
