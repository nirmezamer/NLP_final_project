            "It'll be nice then! The area is thriving and growing constantly. I've got family members who still live out there.",
            "Is the tail end of summer/early fall a good time of year to move in? I'm hoping to relocate there later this year, and I don't have much stuff I need to move, but I want to give myself enough time to get settled in and get all my winter supplies before the snow hits.",
            "\nAnyone here taken their road test in Alexandria? Have one scheduled fairly soon; I'm a little bit nervous after seeing all the poor reviews on Google. It may just be the test jitters--I'm taking my road test for the first time--but at the same time, Alexandria is a long ways away and I'd rather not drive 5+ hours round-trip just to auto-fail in four minutes. Anyone here taken it who can give me some advice?",
            "What are peoples thoughts on the Rogers area? Were looking at several locations for a fairly quiet town to raise our family that isnt extremely pro-Trump, and has decent schools. Based on our research, Rogers might fit that bill, but curious as to if locals have a different perspective",
            "Best womens and childrens coats/winter gear?",
            "Anyone have in information on the Side Lake area?  Considering a house there.  Want to know more about the place.",
            "That will give you plenty of time. I moved here from out of state a few years back in mid-October and the first light snow started *just* as I was bringing in my last moving boxes. I managed to get by for a few weeks with just lots of layers and a super cheap shovel I picked up from Menards before I finally had time to shop for a real winter coat and other supplies. The real bone-chilling cold (like subzero) usually doesn't happen until well past fall, unless you get really unlucky. And of course, this past winter we barely had winter at all.\n\nEDIT: If you're moving from the south like I did, make sure you change out your windshield wiper fluid in your car before you come up. I hadn't even thought about that, and mine froze the first week lol. They make stuff specifically for cold climates that won't freeze, and to be safe I'd just get it done before moving.",
            "Someone told me that mid summer is better because housing looks more promising with college kids still being gone at home and not renting yet",
            "I live in Alexandria, I know of people who have had a real shitty time and experience overall with many actually failing, so you might want to seriously consider finding another option(s) for better quality treatment with an instructor.",
            "Check out Northfield and Stillwater. Both lovely towns with more personality than Rogers imo, and solid schools. Northfield is pretty safely blue, and Stillwater is purple to light blue."

            "Lived in Florida, people would forget to turn them off during hurricanes. \n\nI've never owned a sprinkler system, is it difficult to program or something? I have no clue.",
            "Worse than that, I have a neighbor that  has been manually putting out hose and sprinklers after all this rain!  At least those pictures are most likely on a timer.",
            "Should start throwing out fines to these types of people... Or at the least passive aggressive notes left on their door. IMO  there's not a person in the state who needs to have run their irrigation system yet with the exception for people seeding or sodding. We have received at least the recommended 1 inches of rain weekly.",
            "There's usually a lever on the side of your house you can turn 1/4 of a turn and that'll shut them off",
            "Watering the lawn is such a waste of water",
            "I think it should be illegal to water invasive grass lawns.",
            "I had an older neighbor who did that. He run his sprinklers all day. Im from Durango Mexico and we have a water scarcity problem, so I get really upset about wasting water. I went without drinking water for 3 and a half days once, so when I saw my neighbor continued to waste water to green his grass I made the comment to my wife that he was a wasteful prick who didnt care about the younger generations having to endure a decaying world with a lack of resources.",
            "Plenty of water to go around now!",
            "If your water comes from a river it doesn't really matter, you're just temporarily diverting the flow path back down the drainage hydrological thingy. If you get your water from an aquifer you shouldn't waste water. But I'm tired of constantly being told to save water when my water comes out of the Mississippi and goes right back into the Mississippi after detouring through my bladder.",
            "Lived in Arizona. People would water midday with temps of 100+ F, and you could watch the water evaporate before it would even touch the ground."

            "I think C most accurately qualifies as northern MN. Lots of lakes and cabins in B. When I think of northern MN, I think of the Iron Range cities, Virginia/Hibbing/Eveleth. Cloquet and Duluth are the southernmost part of northern MN in my mind.",
            "Once you're north of that Anoka County line your troubles are behind you.",
