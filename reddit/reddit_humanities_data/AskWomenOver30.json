Men are expected, per our rules, to exercise discretion and respect the space by yielding to the discussion to the women over 30. If men choose to proffer advice, they are technically allowed to do so, ***but the community is encouraged to decide whether the comment is meaningful and contributory to discussion by using the up and downvotes.*** Not everything needs to be nuked by the mods.

The reasoning being because it\u2019s a subreddit for a specific demographic. Are the women of this subreddit not afforded that same filter requirement?\u00a0",
            "It is literally called \"Ask Women Over 30\"... the only people answering questions should be women over 30 or what is the point of this separate subreddit?",

I answer questions on askmen if I know there's soemthing I've done for my husband that is relevant to the question or if it's not really a male-focused question like around careers or finances. If they're being dufuses and speaking to the female experience, downvote them and move on, it's not that serious."

Also I started to think about all uploaded images that now is on a server somewhere belonging to companies that might use ir for AI in the future etc. I stopped posting selfcentered things online like 5 years ago and now it feels like people either have forgotten I excist OR they have the impression of me as someone they need to feel sorry for. Like I am depressed,  unsuccessful or whatnot. If you don\u2019t show people you have a GrEaT LiFe it seems like they stop all interest in you? It\u2019s so transactional. I don\u2019t know. It feels wierd. Shallow. \n\nI have always felt a strong integrity and also I hate to brag about things. I am not selfcentered and I don\u2019t need validation or praise on my looks or identity (eventho I am proud of myself and happy about it) so I never upload a selfie just for likes like some people tend to do.

Once my husband passed this was around 2019 I stopped posting all that much and similarly to you it definitely feel like people moved on like even people I considered friends unfollowed me which was pretty sad because I primarily used social media to keep in touch with a lot of people.

Occasionally I'll post a pic of my cat or something and the most random people will like it and I'm like oh snap that guy I dated for like 4 months from 20 years ago is still following me??\n\nWhy do you think people feel sorry for you?

Without a title of exclusive or gf the men can gaslight you into not making any demands and into \"being chill.\" I also personally am more interested in relationships in general. My issue is that it seems men are very against these labels but still expect sex. Has this been anyone else's experience?

I definitely don't think there's anything wrong with being clear about your expectations but you also have to have strong boundaries and not be chill. I think it is better to focus more on how to use your own intelligence and intuition to weed out foolish and trifling people.",

        "content": "Hi everyone, I am quite hurt, stressed, and lacking confidence in myself these days from the hurtful words my mom has been saying to me. I am currently 31 years old, 5\u20196\u201d and weigh about 134-137 lbs.\n\nI was on oral birth control and I gained a few pounds but nothing too drastic. I came off it about a week ago which I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll help me lose weight. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism last year after noticing that I\u2019ve been gaining weight in a very short amount of time (about 10-15lbs in a few months) and now on Synthroid. Even with the medication, I\u2019ve been gaining weight or am not able to lose weight. \n\nI told myself I can\u2019t live with this so I started walking: go to the gym during the evening with my husband (I don\u2019t do it everyday because I work night shifts) and been trying to eat less per meal and not late at night starting about a week ago. Now this is all new to me but whenever I go see my mom even before I started working on myself, she always says something about my weight whether it be \u201cwow your arms are getting big,\u201d \u201cI need to stress you out so you can start doing something about your weight,\u201d \u201cdo your clothes even fit anymore?\u201d, \u201cI wanna see my pretty daughter again :(,\u201d \u201cdon\u2019t blame your illness,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m upset when I see you,\u201d etc. They are extremely hurtful to me and she knows I hate it. \n\nThis is affecting me and I\u2019m starting to think that my husband will stop loving me (we got married 2 months ago), I\u2019m starting to lose confidence, and I don\u2019t want to see people anymore. \n\nMy family and I have a family luncheon at my mom\u2019s place this Sunday for my mom\u2019s side of grandparents\u2019 birthdays but I don\u2019t want to go anymore. I know my mom and maybe other family members will mention my weight and it\u2019s embarrassing. I know that I\u2019d wanna leave right then and there when they say something. But my husband said I should attend because the luncheon is for the grandparents and it\u2019s our first time meeting the whole family since we got married. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do and I\u2019ve been really down. I\u2019ve already told my mom to stop saying those things and showed that I don\u2019t want to hear it. \n\n\nEDIT: Thank you ladies for the great advice!! I am reading all of them and will respond to questions. Some made me laugh, some made me smile, some made me feel like I am heard. To answer some questions, my husband has not said anything about my body or weight, he told my mom to stop being like that but in a light way- that\u2019s a start. He has shown nothing but love to me. It\u2019s just my head that tells me that he\u2019ll stop loving me because of all the outside \u201cinfluence\u201d (my mom talking crap) he\u2019s hearing from my mom. \n\nEDIT: My mom sent me another message to apologize if I was upset over what she said. She also said that she\u2019s been worried cuz I haven\u2019t been \u201cdolling up\u201d since I moved out and that I should try to understand her as a mother. I told her that I will leave the luncheon if she or someone in the family makes a comment on my appearance and that I honestly don\u2019t even wanna go anymore. She told me that I should do whatever makes me comfortable. Somehow I feel like she apologized for the sake of it only to bring me down again. ",

My Mum has never mentioned her weight again (and for context, she wasn't and still isn't unhealthy, she's just bigger than my Mum, as am I). \n\nI'm not recommending that route per say, but sometimes trying to avoid a scene is fighting a losing battle where the only victim is your own mental wellbeing. Obviously try the sit down serious talk first, and the boundary setting of leaving the room and even the whole home if she can't keep her thoughts to herself, but never be worried about making your genuine upset obvious. It isn't being dramatic, it's being honest.",
            "If you're a big reader or listen to audiobooks, I have a recommendation: The book of Boundaries by Melissa Urban. She describes what makes a good boundary and how to do it.  A decent part of the book is her going over boundaries to set in certain situations. She even breaks it down into I guess stages.  The first would be telling your mom to stop which you have done. She's obviously failed to listen so the next step would be clearly stating going forward. If you bring up my weight I will leave.  The important thing is you have to leave that way she knows you're serious. \n\nYou probably should make sure your husband is on board with his plan so he knows if you get up and head out the door he needs to follow if he wants a ride \ud83e\udd23Joking aside it would probably be good to sit down and talk to your husband about how this is an ongoing issue and that it would mean a lot to you if you backs you up.   If you're recently married, he probably hasn't been around your family lot, so he doesn't know that this is a reoccurring issue.",
