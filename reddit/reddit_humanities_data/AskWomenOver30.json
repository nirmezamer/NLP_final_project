Men are expected, per our rules, to exercise discretion and respect the space by yielding to the discussion to the women over 30. If men choose to proffer advice, they are technically allowed to do so, ***but the community is encouraged to decide whether the comment is meaningful and contributory to discussion by using the up and downvotes.*** Not everything needs to be nuked by the mods.

            "This confuses me because in the ask men sub, I made a comment responding to someone (just agreeing with them) and my comment got modded, and the message sent to me was that I had to add flair either identifying myself, or the comment would not be posted. The reasoning being because it\u2019s a subreddit for a specific demographic. Are the women of this subreddit not afforded that same filter requirement?\u00a0",
            "> the community is encouraged to decide whether the comment is meaningful and contributory to discussion\n\nBased on previous discussions, I think the community has already decided that those comments *aren't* meaningful and contributory, but the mods have decided they don't care. *That's* what's going to \"evaporate the sub into silence,\" as you claim to be so worried about.\n\nThough, I get it. Based on comments I've reported, it seems you all can barely bother to enforce the rules you do have, let alone enforce new ones.",
            "I\u2019ll be honest, I find it incredibly rude for men to answer questions here when the whole sub is to give the floor to women over 30. The entirety of Reddit is available if one wants the opinions of men, and these are questions ABOUT the experiences and perspectives of women. \n\nI think if men can\u2019t stand to not offer advice, they should do so lower in the chains rather than responding directly to questions asked to women. \n\nThat\u2019s my personal feeling, at least. I don\u2019t run this sub, I just wanted to offer that. At the very least, men should be clarifying that they are men when responding, because 9/10 when a man is responding, it is indeed a very male-centric response that can give the impression that women feel that way if we all assume these are women responding. \n\nFor instance, I\u2019ve seen men respond about issues of equity in the bedroom, undermining the commonly expressed concerns of women. \u201cI actually don\u2019t think x is a problem!\u201d means something very different coming from a woman who experiences it and doesn\u2019t really mind, rather than coming from a man who will never go through x and therefore of COURSE wouldn\u2019t mind. \n\nSo for men reading this thread, please understand that there are a lot of women like myself who would like women\u2019s spaces to be treated with respect and deference, as we get that absolutely nowhere else online or in the real world. \n\nMods, if you think this is inappropriate of me to say, please let me know. I\u2019m actually pretty sad to see a mod say it doesn\u2019t break the rules for a man to answer questions to women here.",
            "It is literally called \"Ask Women Over 30\"... the only people answering questions should be women over 30 or what is the point of this separate subreddit?",
            "I am confused by your responses in the comments; people have asked about whether men should be answering questions that have, by the nature of the sub, been asked of women, and you seem have taken that as a call to ban them from the sub or ban them from participating in discussions at all. \n\nI do not see why it has to be that extreme a stance. Is it really that inconceivable to have a sub rule that is \"No top level comments from men; this is an ask *women* sub and so top level answers should be from *women*. Men are otherwise welcome to contribute in resulting discussions, as long as it is in accordance with the other sub rules.\"? \n\nEven if you don't make it a reportable rule (to cut down on what would surely be a lot of reports), having it still stated as a rule that you expect people to use downvotes to manage would at least allow people to push back against the troll-ier men who are determined to bleat \"*well ackshually* I'm absolutely allowed to answer questions here so your complaints and the clear dissatisfaction conveyed by my many downvotes don't matter\", while being a helpful ever present (for when this stickied post eventually gets unstickied) reminder/sign post for men here in good faith but behaving contrary to the name (and clear will, if you check out the votes here) of the sub.\n\nSide note: I was until very recently the most active moderator of r/AskAcademia (a 1.7M member sub). I make the point simply so that you know I'm not someone ignorant to the work involved in moderating a popular sub (though I acknowledge by it's nature we almost certainly had less of the specific issues that bedevil here). But on AA, we do have a rule to report comments that are incorrect/unhelpful because the person answering does not have experience in academia, which feels analogous to the situation here. We also have rules against off topic/derailing comments, and honestly I would argue that by and large a man answering a question asked of women is derailing.\n\nNot trying to tell you how to do your job; your circus, your monkeys, but I wanted to offer a possible middle ground because clearly a large swathe of the community is not feeling heard by your responses thus far.",
            ">Men are allowed to post questions. Men are allowed to comment. \n\nThat doesn't answer the major question that most of us are asking.

Did you come from facebook or tiktok or simply not learn any manners in your life?\n\nModerating is a difficult and thankless job, and this is one of the few decent discussion subs left. Between the bots and the downvote brigade, this place is turning to crap. If /u/InfernalWedgie and the others wake up one day and say \"fuck it, I'm out\", and close the sub, I won't blame them. \n\nDownvoting is supposed to mean a comment DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE TO DISCUSSION. It does not mean you don't like what it says, or that you agree with someone they disagreed with. Respectful debate is part of conversation. Echo chambers suck. /endrant",
            "I get it, it just sucks to see the sub clogged with posts by 'I'm 19m and I'm just asking some questions here' or even 'I'm 19f and I'm just asking some questions here.' Maybe the teenagers can just post in r/advice? Or subs  that aren't age-specific. IDK why they come her."

        "content": "I 32F work in a creative industry and am a public-ish person. A few months back I came across a friend of a friend on Instagram who is the SINGLE MOST ATTRACTIVE MAN I'VE EVER SEEN. This is bizarre for me as I rarely find myself attracted to people physically (including basically everyone I've dated), I usually go for personalities and vibe and have wondered if I'm demisexual or whatever the word is for people who don't experience much physical attraction. I now know I am not that. I experience A LOT of physical attraction to this man.\n\nThis guy and I are same age, same city, both in creative industries though he is based in a different industry than me and has more public exposure stuff than me. We have about 20 mutual friends according to Instagram. We also have a load of random, quite niche personal stuff in common, most of which is unusual for our respective industries. Honestly when I first discovered this guy I was surprised our paths hadn't crossed before due to these similarities plus the number of mutual people we know, small world, etc. But we haven't. And still haven't.\n\nAnyway. Despite not having met, I have developed an absolutely all-encompassing crush on this guy. I feel like a teenager! I have no idea what to do! I am constantly thinking about him! Lengthy diary entries! Imagining being with him and dating! Choreographing our first dance at our wedding! As somebody who has had stalkers/weirdos send me awkward dating stuff online I am DISGUSTED by myself and this behaviour but I just can't help it. I have forced myself to not watch/read/listen to etc any of his existing work and media because it would be weird of me but every now and then I do because I feel so drawn to him and then I'm even more convinced he's amazing but even more disgusted with myself because I know I'm just projecting onto a stranger who I've never met and could be absolutely nothing like his public persona/person he comes across as in his work. After about six unbearable weeks of this I reached out to the mutual friend I'm closest to who was like, \"oh he's single and lovely!\" and then I've asked for more info and heard nothing back. I don't know how to \"go for it\", I'm too shy to ask for his number, or god forbid slide in his DMs, also, HE HAS NO IDEA I EXIST. There's no way forward for me to announce or introduce myself without seeming like a weird stalker?\n\nWhat should I do? I feel like an absolute freak with this parasocial thing in my head and am torn between telling myself off for being a weirdo who should move on, or listening to this teenage part of my voice being like \".... but what if we met and it was great?\". He has a gig down the road from my house next week and I don't know what to do and I don't have any close girlfriends to ask and if somebody could just either confirm I'm being incredibly weird, or tell me what to do (!) that would be great because it's been about two months now and I feel utterly consumed by this crush.

I am currently 31 years old, 5\u20196\u201d and weigh about 134-137 lbs.\n\nI was on oral birth control and I gained a few pounds but nothing too drastic. I came off it about a week ago which I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll help me lose weight. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism last year after noticing that I\u2019ve been gaining weight in a very short amount of time (about 10-15lbs in a few months) and now on Synthroid. Even with the medication, I\u2019ve been gaining weight or am not able to lose weight. \n\nI told myself I can\u2019t live with this so I started walking: go to the gym during the evening with my husband (I don\u2019t do it everyday because I work night shifts) and been trying to eat less per meal and not late at night starting about a week ago. Now this is all new to me but whenever I go see my mom even before I started working on myself, she always says something about my weight whether it be \u201cwow your arms are getting big,\u201d \u201cI need to stress you out so you can start doing something about your weight,\u201d \u201cdo your clothes even fit anymore?\u201d, \u201cI wanna see my pretty daughter again :(,\u201d \u201cdon\u2019t blame your illness,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m upset when I see you,\u201d etc. They are extremely hurtful to me and she knows I hate it. \n\nThis is affecting me and I\u2019m starting to think that my husband will stop loving me (we got married 2 months ago), I\u2019m starting to lose confidence, and I don\u2019t want to see people anymore. \n\nMy family and I have a family luncheon at my mom\u2019s place this Sunday for my mom\u2019s side of grandparents\u2019 birthdays but I don\u2019t want to go anymore. I know my mom and maybe other family members will mention my weight and it\u2019s embarrassing. I know that I\u2019d wanna leave right then and there when they say something. But my husband said I should attend because the luncheon is for the grandparents and it\u2019s our first time meeting the whole family since we got married. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do and I\u2019ve been really down. I\u2019ve already told my mom to stop saying those things and showed that I don\u2019t want to hear it. \n\n\nEDIT: Thank you ladies for the great advice!! I am reading all of them and will respond to questions. Some made me laugh, some made me smile, some made me feel like I am heard. To answer some questions, my husband has not said anything about my body or weight, he told my mom to stop being like that but in a light way- that\u2019s a start. He has shown nothing but love to me. It\u2019s just my head that tells me that he\u2019ll stop loving me because of all the outside \u201cinfluence\u201d (my mom talking crap) he\u2019s hearing from my mom. ",

Obviously try the sit down serious talk first, and the boundary setting of leaving the room and even the whole home if she can't keep her thoughts to herself, but never be worried about making your genuine upset obvious.

She's obviously failed to listen so the next step would be clearly stating going forward. If you bring up my weight I will leave.  The important thing is you have to leave that way she knows you're serious. \n\nYou probably should make sure your husband is on board with his plan so he knows if you get up and head out the door he needs to follow if he wants a ride \ud83e\udd23Joking aside it would probably be good to sit down and talk to your husband about how this is an ongoing issue and that it would mean a lot to you if you backs you up.

            "Some people like labels, some people don't. IME, it's not necessarily gendered.\n\nIn your case, raise your expectations and be pickier on who you date.",
            "If someone really wants a relationship with you, they will act like it.\n\nThis guy I\u2019ve been casually seeing literally told me he wants to fuck other people, but still wants to see me often because he enjoys my company and cuddling me and kissing me. Dude literally wants me to provide all the emotional and romantic support of a girlfriend while still playing the field. It\u2019s insane.",
            "I guess I just can't relate to this.\n\n\n>men expect gf treatment without the title.\n\n\nThat doesn't mean I'll give it to them.\n\n\n>Without a title of exclusive or gf the men can gaslight you into not making any demands and into \"being chill.\"\u00a0\n\n\nMy needs are my needs, and I'm capable of asserting them irrespective of our title.\u00a0\n\n\n>I also personally am more interested in relationships in general\n\n\nThat's great!! Don't settle for less.\u00a0\n\n\n>My issue is that it seems men are very against these labels...\n\n\nI guess those men are a bad match for you, since they don't want the same thing you want.\u00a0\n\n\n>...but still expect sex.\n\n\nI mean... If you're not into it, tell them no? What's the problem if you don't meet their expectations?",
            "I mean, different people have different expectations. I'm a woman and I'm not focused on labels for quite a while. I like the space to get to know them. Imho, the exclusivity a lot of women on this sub expect would be way too soon for me in general unless I had already known the person for a while.\n\nYou're acting like you have no agency in the situation. If you don't want to just be having sex with no label, stop doing that.",
            "If they want to take the relationship slow, you want to take the physical intimacy slow too.",
            "I think labels are important if they\u2019re important to you. It\u2019s not necessarily gendered. I\u2019m not super into labels (woman, divorced) but I also hate casual dating. To me, if both parties agree to exclusivity and are putting in equal effort, I don\u2019t need a label. The issue comes in when one partner is putting in BF/GF level effort while the other is sitting around accepting it but not reciprocating. \n\nI will also add that, though I was trying not to gender it, I\u2019ve found women to hold the label as more of a weapon and men to dangle it like a prize. Not sure how else to say it. Neither is healthy. I\u2019m absolutely not saying you\u2019re doing that, just my experience. If it\u2019s important to you, and you\u2019re secure in your reasons, screw what the therapist says and don\u2019t settle for less. Many men want a label too, you just haven\u2019t found them yet.\n\nEditing to amend my statement- I think both parties can weaponize/treat it as a prize. I should\u2019ve stuck with not gendering lol.",
            "Not wrong at all. Like can you imagine a marriage where they didn't want to label each other as husband and wife?? Or a business where they didn't label staff as staff? Lol...."
