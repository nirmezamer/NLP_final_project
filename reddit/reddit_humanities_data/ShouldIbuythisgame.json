Might be a bit out there based on what you play, but have a look at a trailer, you'll know if it's for you or not.\n\n\nFor the military shooters you've cited, titanfall 2 is usually pretty cheap and has a great campaign thats about 6-8 hours long. \n\n\nOh and dredge, a game about fishing set in a H.P Lovecraft inspired world.\n\n\nThat's all I've got for now, I don't know  you but I hope the best for you\n\nEdit: formating",

I\u2019ve already played gta 5 and rdr2 and they are both some of my favorite games, but the reason I like them so much is because of the open world in them. So my question is what are your favorite open world games to play? I play on pc so that\u2019s a factor btw as to what I can actually play.\n\nI hear the gta games other than gta 5 are also really good but I\u2019ve yet to play them. Are all of them open world as well?\n",

            "For me, Cyberpunk 2077 has one of the best open worlds because Night City is relatively small but super dense. This means that you don\u2019t really feel the need to fast travel very often, and usually you can opt to drive to your destination. That means basically no loading screens, and it really helps your immersion.",

            "I've played a lot of open world games, it's probably my second most played genre below RPGs. The games you mentioned are the pinnacle of open world gaming so any game I mention probably won't be on the same level of quality but I'm going to list my top 5 open world games excluding RDR2 and tell you why I enjoyed them so much  so you can see if you'd be interested. \n\n5. Assassin's Creed Valhalla\nThis is pretty much all I've ever wanted from a viking open world arpg. It has great story arcs, a beautiful and immersing open world that's massive with tons of unique things to do, fun combat and rpg elements that allow you to create different builds and ways to play, and an amazing soundtrack that's as authentic as ever to the Norse setting, with the likes of Einar Selvik taking part in creating the music. Only flaw this game has is it's length which may be an issue depending on how long you like your games. The main story is roughly 80 hours long.\n\n4. Elden Ring\nThis game has a beautiful but brutal world inhabited by dangerous enemies, bosses, and npcs. A lot of what makes Elden Ring so good is the lack of handholding and sense of exploration, discovery, and freedom that comes with that. In Elden Ring you are thrown into a huge map without being told anything. It is your job to find things out through interaction with npcs that are all extremely vague, and simply exploring the world. Finding things in elden ring is a very rewarding feeling, and overcoming challenges is the best part. The role playing elements in this game are the best out of any of these games, as you can really find a playstyle for you no matter who you are with how many weapons, spells, incantations, and armors are available for you to test.\n\n3. The Witcher 3\nThe world of the witcher 3 is beautiful and it speaks for itself. Every region is vastly different from the next. The story is fantastic and while the choice making isn't as deep as it seems, the game will have you caring for the characters deeply. The world is filled with captivating side quests, secrets to uncover, and dangerous foes.\n\n2. Cyberpunk 2077\nThis game has the most unique world out of the 5 I've listed here. It's beautiful in it's own way, with the bustling Night City with neon lights, tall towering buildings, and streets filled with cars and people. It feels the most alive as well, with random events happening throughout Night City such as gang wars, police shootouts, and crime scenes scattered throughout. It's as dangerous as it is captivating. All of this is highlighted by the game's incredible graphics, making every surface feel real. The story is thrilling, the combat is exhilarating and action packed. Despite Cyberpunk's disastrous launch, the game has now very much redeemed itself and much more.\n\n1.  Skyrim\nSomething about Skyrim makes it so special. It's not graphically advanced, (no where near the other games on this list) the combat is clunky, and animations feel robotic. Yet the world still manages to feel so special, and cements it self as one of the best in gaming nearly 2 decades later. It's vast and expansive, and the game perfects the sense of exploration that is is so needed in modern open worlds. The story and lore are so deep and actually requires you to immerse yourself in the world to absorb it. The rpg elements actually hold up very well, with the whole skill tree system and progression feeling quite rewarding.  Despite Skyrim's dated graphics, the game captures another level of beauty not present in many realistic AAA titles. The soundtrack is honestly flawless, from the epic main menu theme to the calming ambience of Secunda.",

The [map](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7610245/19_GRW_SCREENSHOT_4K_map_enviros.png.png) is amazing, lots of different [regions](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7610229/20_GRW_SCREENSHOT_4K_OpenWorld.png) to explore, and the whole world is really well designed.

It is squad oriented though but you can also just play with bots (or public matches). Free on PS Plus Extra and Game Pass last I checked.\n\nAlso, Sniper Elite 4 or 5 could be an interesting take. Infiltration missions set in WW2 with co op for two players. The most fun I've personally had with another person. I really don't know about 5, but 4 is free with PS Extra and Game Pass.",
