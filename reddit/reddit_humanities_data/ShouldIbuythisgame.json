I don\u2019t have much time for gaming anymore and I found it hard to get into games that take longer time spans to master and to achieve something in I\u2019ve recently played Balatro and this was for a time one of those games that I mean. It can be any kind of genre actually as I find myself playing apex legends for over 600 hours over the years. \n\nI was really looking forward to the Elden Ring DLC but I find that it takes too much time for me to explore everything and get good at the game again so this doesn\u2019t bring me any joy at the moment. \n\nThanks for your help \n",

            "If you like FPS games I can suggest Severed steel. It has some really satisfying movement. You can dive, slide, do a 360 backflip etc. It also has no reloading and therefore you have to always steal guns from enemies, which puts your movement to test. If it isn't your thing, you can always check out boomer shooters. They're fast paced and fun to play in general.",

I finished the DLC a few days ago and I love it so much. \n\nI am going to be taking a 2 week vacation and in that time also not game. \n\nWhen I come back though, I thought about buying numerous games but for some reason the thought of playing a game that isn\u2019t like a souls game just doesn\u2019t seem interesting at all to me at the moment. \n\nSo I have been looking into Fromsoftware\u2019s other games, and have decided that I want to try one of their bigger challenges. I am not too keen on any of the Dark Souls at the moment, so Bloodborne and Sekiro are the 2 options I am choosing from. \n\nWhich should I play first? I don\u2019t really have a preference for a specific setting or aesthetic at the moment.",

            "Sekiro is in my top 5 of all time list, and my favorite FromSoft game easily. It is I think the most rewarding also, in that it is very much the most 'skill based'  -  no opportunity for summons, AoW, spirit ashes or cheesy builds. (nothing wrong with any of that, but sometimes it can trivialise fights)",
            "Both are amazing. Prolly do bloodborne first as it plays closer to elden ring, then do sekiro after",
            "Very Hard to tell. Both are awesome, both have incredible aesthetics and gameplay. Though I like BB setting and story more I\u2019d go for Sekiro simply because it\u2019s newer, meaning it has better performance and many QoL things that can make BB a chore sometimes (like generating health drinks, grappling hook general interface). Be aware that Sekiro has you limited to only your katana as a main weapon but you do get tools which kinda act like secondary weapons. No looking for a weapons in Sekiro\u2026",
            "My appreciation for other from softgames' combat lowered a bit after Sekiro so I would personally pick Bloodborne first. It's also easier to go from slower to faster than vice versa",
            "Imo bloodborne is overrated and runs like shit, Sekiro is the best game I have ever played surpassing Elden Ring",
            "Bloodborne is less of a challenge I'd say if you seek that. But it has the best drip, weapons, lore and atmosphere. Sekiro is too good gameplay-wise. Definitely play both.",
            "Can\u2019t go wrong with either. Pick one you\u2019re interested in and simply play it",
            "Well the question comes down to do you want to focus on deflecting strikes or dodging them? \n\nBoth games are great and worth it.",
            "Bloodborne by far for me. Just a mire widely likable game. Sekiro can be extremely frustrating if the combat doesn't click for you.",

If destroying things in creative ways without much of a story behind it sounds appealing go for it.\n\nAs for a recommendation: have you ever tried the Shadowrun trilogy?  They are tactical RPGs that are story driven, but give you a lot of freedom regarding how you want to play.  They aren't perfect and some of the choices they made annoy me (cyberdecks taking one of your weapon slots, for example) but they are definitely worth looking at.  \n[https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/26635/Shadowrun\\_Trilogy/](https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/26635/Shadowrun_Trilogy/)\n\nTower of Time is another good candidate from what you've said so far.  \n[https://store.steampowered.com/app/617480/Tower\\_of\\_Time/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/617480/Tower_of_Time/)"
