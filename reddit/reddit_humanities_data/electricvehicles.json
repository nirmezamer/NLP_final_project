I know I will be well over miles (>10K). Fortunately, I\u2019m in a financial position where that isn\u2019t an issue.\n\nI am interested in the IONIQ 6, EV6, ID.4 Pro, and EX30.\n\nFrom a value perspective, does it make the most sense to just wait until the end of my lease and then turn it in with penalty, or buy it out, in order to maximize incentives from Kia for repeat buyer, all else equal?\n\nWith typical Kia residuals, should I enter into another lease or do it an outright purchase (depending on APR) to minimize monthly cost and total cost? Would I be better off just outright purchasing assuming APRs are crap?",

            "Has anyone used NACS to CCS ~~CCS to NACS~~ adapters?  I needed to fast charge Saturday night out-of-town.  Closest charging station was a Tesla which is not compatible (afaik - I didn't check).  I found an Electrify America station that got me to 80% in 10 min.  There are LOTS of Tesla charging stations around here and on routes I'd like to use.  Anyone have experience with the adapters?",
            "Hello everyone,\n\nWe currently own a Tesla Model 3.\n\nWe\u2019ve hit a bit of a dilemma. Our family is about to grow from four to five! When our newest member arrives, our children will be 5, 2, and a newborn. Our two oldest are quite small for their ages.\n\nCurrently, our eldest is sitting rear-facing in a huge Britax Max-Way Plus, but it's time to transition to a forward-facing seat. My wife strongly believes our 2-year-old should stay rear-facing for another year, which complicates things. I might be able to convince her that it\u2019s okay for our 2-year-old to face forward now.\n\nI've been searching for the most narrow car seats on the market, but haven't had much luck. The ones I\u2019ve found so far don\u2019t fit well with the rear-facing baby seat.\n\nI also looked into the Multimac solution. It seems very well-made, but it would cost us around \u20ac3,800 after import taxes. That\u2019s a lot for car seats, but still cheaper than getting a new car.\n\nSpeaking of new cars, I've checked out some electric options. Unfortunately, there aren't many that solve our problem without being significantly more expensive than our current Model 3. For example, I could trade in our Model 3 for about \u20ac26,000, but the cheapest ID Buzz I\u2019ve found is \u20ac44,000. Do you have any suggestions for EV-options that solve our problem without breaking the bank?\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your advice and viewpoints on this!",
            "Has anyone in Arizona been able to find a dealer who: 1) is educated on how the Used EV Credit works, 2) is registered to participate, and 3) is willing to honor it?\nI\u2019ve been to 5 different dealers in Phoenix looking at EVs who check all the boxes for the used EV credit but it\u2019s frustrating the lack of knowledge from both sales people and finance managers.\nIs it really that difficult to find a place that will do it?",
            "I am planning on buying a used EV, I found a used 2021 Chevy Bolt with about 40,000 miles. Is there anything I should be cognizant of when I go to look at the car? This is my first time getting an EV and I am particularly concerned about its range since my commute will be about 65 miles each way. Besides checking what the car says the range is, is there anything I can do to check the quality of the battery?",
            "So I am new to electric vehicles. I\u2019ve owned only gas cars so far. My wife leases a Corolla and I own a Jetta. Her lease is up in February and we are looking to get an SUV to replace the Corolla. I have wanted to go with a 1 electric - 1 gas car strategy for a while but I don\u2019t know much about the EV market. We are looking for a small to medium sized SUV. Something like the Nissan Rogue for size. What are ya\u2019lls recommendations for suvs in that size? For budget we\u2019d like to stay under 40k USD if possible. We live in North Carolina. \n\nNo children and none planned for years. Single family home. we both commute three days a week. Hers is ~10 miles and 30min. Mine is about 35 miles and 40min. The idea would be this car would be shared and could be used for all the commute time if the schedules line up right. For charging we\u2019d at minimum get a \u2018slow\u2019 charger (is that the right term?) it would depend on cost if we splurge for one of those very fast charging systems.",
            "We are shopping for our first EV and want something small, so we're likely looking at either a Kona or Bolt in the $20k range. \n\nSince we live in New England and it gets cold in the winter I want to make sure we can pre-condition the cabin (and battery?) while the car is still plugged in each morning. \n\nThe Bolt trim levels and options are easier to find info on because they are all EVs, but I'm having trouble figuring out which trim/options I need to look for on the Kona to make sure we get heated seats and the ability to remotely heat the cabin while the car is still plugged in. Do they all have that ability, or is it only on certain trim levels?"

I gave her a puzzled look and said \"that's a weird perspective\". At this point (not making it up) another lady who was behind me in line looked at me the same way you would look at the bottom of your shoe after stepping on a roach said \"Yeah, and what about all those people with dead Teslas in Minnesota this winter!\".\n\nWhat the actual heck lol?
