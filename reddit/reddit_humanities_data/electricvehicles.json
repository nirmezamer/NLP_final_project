            "We live in AZ and are looking to lease a new EV for a second vehicle. Work from home and would like an EV SUV to drive around town, average 10k miles a year. Living situation - house with solar and planning on installing a 240 outlet. \n\nWe're ready to lease. Test drove a Hyundai Ioniq5 and Kia EV6. Planning on test driving a Tesla Y, VW, and Chevy Blazer.",
            "With EV tech accelerating, do more people lease than buy? I'd imagine having a car for 3 years then getting the latest tech would be appealing",
            "Can anyone tell me if they have had luck getting the EV tax rebate with a used vehicle? I know that dealerships need to opt in to the program and don't have to offer the tax credit but I've heard others also say that they don't do it on used vehicles even when the rules on the tax credit specifically State used vehicles with so many transfers are accepted.",
            "My work wants to install additional charging ports for employee's who own an EV. I'm currently researching what the best options are. We are in the USA and would like something reliable, and fast charging. So something that would be capable of 50a or more. Not as worried about the cost, just more so about the best candidates in todays market would be.",
            "I'm buying from a dealer that submitted their info to be able to take advantage of advanced payments (dealer banking info, etc.) last Wednesday. The website told them it should be done within 48 hours, yet it's been 9 days now (7 business days), and it still hasn't been processed.\n\nHow long does that process actually take? Any dealers here that have experienced the wait? I'm carless and on a timeline so this is getting more frustrating each day that passes.",
            "My apartment complex is allowing us to use a unused dryer outlet to charge.  They will not be providing the 240v level 2 charging equipment, just the outlet. Maintenance told us it is a NEMA 10-30 outlet and has a 30AMP fuse. My question is, does my 40 amp portable charger pull 30 amps, as I wouldn't want it to pull more than 24 amps to prevent issues with the outlet. Would I need to by a new portable charger that limits to a 24 amp draw?",
            "Can someone help me understand how to use the car lease calculator when buying EVs. I.e, how does the $7500 credit come into play here. Does it get reduced when calculating the capitalized costs",
            "Would you get a Hyundai Kona 319 mile range version for 113 a month or the BYD Dolphin 265 mile range version for 106 a month. This is through a work discount btw.",
            "Any downsides to purchasing used? I'm seeing used EV6 GT with 15k miles for$40k and a GT line with 3k miles for around the same price. I'm curious as to what kind of downsides there are to purchasing used evs.",
            "A little different question, but how long does it take to process the dealership signing up for advanced payments?"
