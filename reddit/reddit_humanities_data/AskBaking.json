            "It wasn't turning any blacker or even getting any noticeable difference in color. I thought leaving it overnight would work but clearly it didn't.",
            "The heat treating method that was already suggested, or using an immersion blender.",
            "Forget to set the timer and remember it being in there hours later hahaha",
            "This is one of those tricks that even if you're familiar with the physics and chemistry of why it works it still seems like it shouldn't work even after you've seen it with your own eyes.",
            "I think this method is the most accessible one for me at the moment. Thanks!",
            "... gel color. Mix into buttercream. Then pop it into the microwave for 10-15 seconds. Mix. Let it cool to room temp. With mixer, rewhip. \n\nColor is so deep. Why on earth does this work?",
            "Unfortunately, I have neither of those, and they might be tricky to get anytime soon. Thanks anyway-it could be useful in the future.",
            "Even if it's safe for everyone eating it, charcoal still tends to taste like dirt. Black cocoa is the better option, especially for something that already has cocoa in it.",
            "I throw it into the fridge after melting in the microwave and it still works too",
            "The short version of why this works is that at room temperatures, the dye only affects the water inside the buttercream. The butterfats and the water don't mix so neither does the water-borne dye. That's why black dye in butter has a gray look. But when you heat it by boiling the water in place, the two start to mix chemically -- somehow -- so the dye is able to penetrate the butterfat."

            "Theres different types of molasses:  \n\nLight, dark, blackstrap, treacle (and sorghum - which technically isnt molasses but often considered as such). You might need more depending on the type used and the efficiency of your mixer (or method of combining the two)",
            "How much sugar are you using? It's probably almost a tablespoon per cup. Each grain of sugar is a cube, there's lots of surface area. If it's not soupy just keep going.\n\nIt also doesn't matter what it looks like. If it tastes like molasses you're good.",
            "Try 10 tbsp, then 15 tbsp youd be surprised how much youll need to reach the level of brown you desire."

            "Yes but not a huge difference. You can use your light brown sugar without a problem. Darker brown sugar is moister which can alter the texture of your bake but its a preference thing which type you use",
            "I do not make my own brown sugar.  But in nearly 50 years of baking I have only used dark brown sugar.  My mom only bought dark brown so I only buy dark brown.  The more molasses flavor the better in my book!",
            "Yes somewhat. I keep dark on hand at home because I prefer its richer more molasses flavor, perfect for things like chocolate chip cookies, blondies, crusts etc. But there are some instances where light actually works better. For instance I recently made a pineapple upside down cake and the fruit side was a little too dark visually and the extra molasses flavor masked some of the bright tartness of the pineapple."
