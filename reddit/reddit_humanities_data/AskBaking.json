            "It wasn't turning any blacker or even getting any noticeable difference in color. I thought leaving it overnight would work but clearly it didn't.",
            "Two suggestions: \n\n1. Add some black cocoa powder (King Arthur makes a good one). Less is more, it can get overwhelming fast, but in moderation and/or combined with regular cocoa powder it\u2019s really nice and tastes like the chocolate in Oreos. \n\n2. Immersion blender method. Stick an immersion blender in the bowl and buzz it a few times. The emulsification will give you a darker color. Go slow, you don\u2019t need to blend the entire batch \u2014 blend a little, stir a little until you get the color you want. This does change the texture of the frosting a little bit, but in my experience re-whipping after blending helps. You\u2019ll still probably need some black food coloring or black cocoa powder in there.",

            "Tried browning a butter substitute once - didn't work out. The milk solids in real butter are what brown and give that nutty flavor. Most substitutes don't have enough milk solids, if any. You might get some color change, but it won't be the same as browned butter. As for margarine vs. butter analogue, they're similar but not always identical. Margarine is typically all vegetable oil, while some butter analogues might include milk products. Check the ingredients to be sure. If you really want that browned butter flavor, you might be better off using the real thing for that specific purpose."
