            "This might sound crazy but this was the best part of my flight training. In my case this was done in an aerobatic aircraft that\u2019s almost specifically designed to do stuff like this. We learn how to stall and recover from stalls from very early on, before we can go solo. \n\nThis Spin training is part of a module carried out much later on during training (in my case right at the end) called Upset Prevention and Recovery Training, or UPRT. \n\nBy the time I did spin training I\u2019d flown loops, barrel rolls, and had the instructor demonstrate wingovers, and stall turns, as well as flown constant 2.5g turns. I\u2019ve been on the biggest roller coasters in the world, not a brag, but just to demonstrate I\u2019ve got a *fairly* decent stomach for this kind of thin, but given in a loop you\u2019re using more than double the height of the tallest coaster in the world, it did still get to me. \n\nAnother thing that was great fun is the instructor would tell you to close your eyes, and then he\u2019d deliberately confuse the balance sensors in your ears, put the plane into a crazy attitude, and then say \u201cyou have control\u201d and you have to open your eyes and recover.",
            "Does the instructor have some sort of override in a plane like this so he can take over if the trainee has a melt-down?",

            "My crazy cousin had his pilot\u2019s license. He took my dad up one day and then said, \u201cWant to see me get out of a dead spin?\u201d And before my dad could answer, they were in that same state as in the video. Dad said he nearly crapped his pants.",

            "Damn, that's some brass cojones. Steady voices too.",
