            "TL;DR I would avoid this car unless you know you will only ever charge at home and at work. It is rapidly becoming obsolete. Unlike most other electric cars today it will never be able to use the Tesla supercharger network or any of the other big charging networks like Electrify America.\n\nIf you want it, here\u2019s the detailed explanation.\n\nAs far as I know it\u2019s a pretty good car. People who own them seem to like them and I see old ones all the time so it\u2019s probably decently reliable.\n\nIt has one major flaw. It uses an outdated fast charging standard.\n\nBasically every electric car out there uses the CCS charger (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_Charging_System) or Tesla\u2019s charger, now called \u201cNACS\u201d. However, Nissan started making the Leaf before those standards were set, so the Leaf has always used the CHAdeMO fast charger  (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHAdeMO).\n\nWhat does this mean practically? Well when you see people plug in their Tesla or Chevy Bolt or whatever at home or a hotel they are probably using a J1772 AC charger. The Leaf does have this!You can charge it at home the same way you would any other EV. However! If you are doing a road trip, the Nissan Leaf cannot use Tesla superchargers and it cannot use any standard EV. It has to use a CHAdeMO charger for fast charging, and those are probably going to stop being maintained eventually since no other car uses it.\n\nIf you want an analogy to fossil fuel think about it this way. Tesla basically runs on diesel, which is sold everywhere and other EVs run on gas which is sold everywhere. Nissan Leafs basically run on coal. You can buy coal and fill it up at home, but you won\u2019t guarantee that if you take a road trip you\u2019ll find a place that sells coal. So road trips are out.\n\nIf you are interested in EVs I recommend this video to get a handle on stuff like charging standards https://youtu.be/Iyp_X3mwE1w?si=BNLvCCKbG7INt2rQ",
            "Nissan engineer here. Super simple answer that most people have missed. \n\nThat car is end of life, it is not made anymore. The new model to replace it is due \u201csoon\u201d. \n\nThey are selling off very old inventory to make space for the new influx of the new model.",
            "Our Nissan Leaf has been driven for 11 years without a single issue. It\u2019s honestly the most under rated car out there. Granted, it excels at commute and driving around town only.",
            "It's a small car, has a small range, slow charging.  Not very quick, not a lot of redeeming qualities. But if you're just using it to and from work it'll be a good car.  But as a primary vehicle absolutely.not.\n\nI'd do a nice long test drive to see if it's comfy enough for you.",
            "Some dealerships include the government ev subsidy as part of the price. It's possible that's why it appears so cheap.",
            "They don\u2019t usually offer discounts on good cars that are in high demand",
            "It\u2019ll get you to and from work. If I recall correctly, the battery doesn\u2019t have thermal management, so range will be affected by extreme temperatures. Overall, it\u2019s not great but probably better than any other $11k car out there. Look up tax rebates on used EV\u2019s.",
            "Loved mine when I had it. Nothing broke. Ever. It's real practical with fold down seats and a high roof. Range was my issue. Any Nissan dealer has free charging and I charged overnight at home but.. it's a range thing.",
            "Had one and got rid of it. Everything below are the reasons why. CHAdeMO charging, no thermal management, the motor design isn't modern and sit in the \"frunk\" taking up all the space much like an ICE car. The tech inside is quite dated. It was reliable and I have no complaints about it, but if you are looking to buy an EV.. get one with NACS or CCS charging. NACS being the easy way as you just pull up to the charger, plug it in.. and wait. It bills to your account based on the VIN of the car.",

            "You ever see one of those Lincoln commercials, with Matthew McConaughey? It\u2019s just like that. \n\nIn reality it will depend entirely on what you drive, where you\u2019re going, and how you drive there.",
            "I think it depends on the brand and the trim level and model.\u00a0\n\n\nI'm going to take a lot of shit for this from people who have never owned one of these vehicles who think they know everything. But I'm going to say it anyway.....\n\n\nWe've had most recently a 2020 GLS 580, and prior to that a 2017 GLS 450. And while the C-Class, if optioned up nicely feels premium, most of those models are $499/mo stripper lease specials and don't feel special. And don't get me going about the gla/b, cla class Mercs, or the other entry level cars from both BMW and Mercedes (we also have a current gen 540 xDrive and x5m50i, so we have experience with the entry level loaner cars when they go in for service or maintenance). We also have a Jaguar f pace s, so I'm speaking from direct firsthand experience of at least 2.5 years with ea h of tbese vehicles, and having recently traded in the GLS580.\n\n\nYou're going to get a lot of feedback here from people who brought the cheapest luxury brand model they could, for about something that's a decade old because that's all they could afford, which probably isn't a good decision in the first place, and are going to tell you how special they feel because they're driving around a No option Car with a European badge on the front...... Those cars aren't special.\n\n\nSo when you get to the higher level models there is something different. There's a level of refinement in the suspension and the tactile feel of the Interior components that tend not to be replicated on even the high-end mainstream brands. There tends to be a bit more feel, yet at the same time a bit more isolation from Road imperfections than on a more mainstream brand vehicle.\n\n\nThe best way to try to explain it is to actually test drive one of these vehicles yourself. You'll see that there is a difference. I'm not saying that the top trim models from mainstream brands are very refined and they do Luxury very well, but there are certain tactile Sensations that you have to experience to truly understand the difference between say a top trim Grand Islander or whatever the lexus version is, and something like a GLS 450.\n\n\nAnd also has a point of reference, we also have an MDX type S advance, and while that's a $75,000 car, and it has fantastic luxury features and decent performance, it doesn't have the same overall level of refinement as any of our European vehicles in that price range have, even though it's a phenomenal vehicle itself and I highly recommend it to anybody.\n\n\nBut the most important thing here is to never buy a car you can't comfortably afford. You should always own your car, your car should never own you, as you've correctly pointed out. The worst decision you can make is to spend all your money on a car to show off to strangers, while you're still living in your parents' basement.\n\n\nSo I know I'm going to get crucified for this post but there is a difference, it's hard to quantify, but you know it when you've experienced it.",
            "I'm used to driving normie vehicles - my daily is a 2010 Mazda3 hatchback, and my family vehicle is a 2022 Kia Carnival. I drove a luxury car for the first time on vacation in Germany last year - a basically brand new 2024 520d wagon. I put about 1000km on it in four days - here are my observations:\n\n* Shockingly quiet cabin. This has huge additional benefits - the sound system sounds better because it isn't fighting with road/wind noise, so you can keep it quieter and still hear all the detail in your music. You can hold conversations at normal conversation volume. There's less fatigue after a long ride.\n* Extraordinary seat comfort, further enhanced by the smooth suspension over the frankly incredible German road system.\n* Every touch point is well padded - even where my knees knock against the center console.\n* My wife was able to sleep in this vehicle. She can't sleep in cars - and she was asleep as I bounced against the engine governor at 225kmh on the Autobahn. I can't think of higher praise for a vehicle.\n* Everything that needed to be done was effortless - once I got Android Auto configured. The navigation system barking German directions at me wasn't great lmfao. The HUD's integration with Android Auto in particular is excellent.\n* As a large wagon, it's just enormous. No shortage of leg room or cargo space. It was WAY more car than I needed for two people and four days.\n\nComing home to my Mazda 3 just about broke me. I do 20-25k miles/year, and to go back to a 15 year old Mazda 3 was upsetting to say the least.\n\nIf you can afford to drive one, I think you're doing yourself a disservice to *not* drive a German luxury vehicle. It's well worth the maintenance, insurance, gas, and sticker price imo.",
            "I've owned and driven lots of cars over the years: Toyota, Honda, VW, Acura, Ford, Dodge, Nissan, Mazda, Lexus, Audi, etc.   Having commuted & done road trips in most of them, now that I'm well into my 30s I find the quiet comfort of a luxury brand is well worth the price of admission (& maintenance). \n\nDespite both of my Audis being a decade old, they're still more comfortable and capable than any other car I've had yet. As parents of multiple kids & dog-owners, we're planning on getting a minivan for our next car - but definitely plan to keep one of the Audis for the overall balance of comfort, practicality, and fun driving experience.",
            "Luxury cars and brands definitely put a lot more emphasis into getting the core basics right. The NVH, ride and refinement are usually better here than on mass market brands.\n\nTake the Rav4 and NX. They are built in the same platform and sometimes in the same facility, but there's no question the Lexus is far more refined than the Toyota and on a longer drive you come out feel more relaxed and less tired. \n\nI've recently taken a new CX-90, one of Mazda's newest and finest (and Mazda being a darling on this sub), on a longer road trip with the family in our annual outing. Despite it being bigger and fancier than the base Mercedes GLC 300 we taken last year, everyone including my sister all complained the Mazda felt like a downgrade once we begin to rack up the kms.\n\nThe Mazda had the initial quality and materials use that can match the Mercedes, but it soon becomes clear even to the non-car people that luxury brands do have selling points outside of cache.",

The materials, the cabin layout, the smoothness of the powertrain, that's what makes all the difference for me.\n\nAnd I saw this in another comment, but my God do you feel so much more insulated from the world. You could be going 80 and it feels as smooth as 30.",
            "Well a BMW definitely feels different from like a Toyota, Honda. With Honda,Toyota I find they don't really have as solid as a feel as BMW does from everything like the driving experience, interior, exterior basically I would say. On like Hondas, Toyotas the doors are light while the BMW is heavier, the sound system isn't as good, Interior has more noise, they don't handle as well, steering and gas pedal are much more light on toyotas while with the BMW the steering is heavier and gas is heavier. BMW all around does feel more solid (actual reliability is a different thing though haha).",
            "My parents have always been super frugal/they refused to buy cars/depreciating assets etc so we always drove old beaters. \n\nSo when I graduated, I bought a fully loaded Lexus. It wasn\u2019t the most expensive car, but it was still a far bit nicer than anything I had driven in the past. I\u2019ve had it for a couple years now- and I still really like it\n\nTo be clear, I am not a showy person. I haven\u2019t even told most of my friends that I bought it. (Or I drive my parents\u2019 beater when we hang out) \n\nBut it has made my daily commute incredibly pleasant in a salient? Way I can\u2019t properly express. \n\nTl;dr: luxury cars are nice. Having said that, don\u2019t  buy them if u just want to impress friends/keep up with the jones.",

There was this whole thing that instead of buying a louis vutton bag go to france instead because of the memories\n\nYes but the car can create memories too.\n\nAre you buying a BMW XM because you want to show off your money and impress your neighbors? That's the kind of consumerism that drives Louis Vuitton bags. And you have to keep buying those bags to keep up with their latest trends or the feeling wears off.\n\nOr are you buying a BMW M2 because you want to learn how to become a high performance driver on race tracks and autocross courses? Maybe you want to learn how to drift a rear wheel drive car? Maybe you haven't learned how to drive a manual before and this will be your first stick shift? Maybe you want to learn about aftermarket tuning and performance modifications? Maybe you want to attend car meets and make new friends? Those are all valuable memories and experiences.\n\nYou'll also notice that old M2s and M3s all hold their values because a good sports car doesn't need to keep up with fashion trends. But resale value of luxury SUVs drop like flies"
