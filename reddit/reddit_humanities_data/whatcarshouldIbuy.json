        "content": "I'm currently in the market to replace my truly awful 2019 Mercedes C43 with something a lot nicer. Honestly, my experience with luxury cars has been soured by this unreliable and uncomfortable POS. So I'm looking for something more low-key but with superior ride quality, space, and refinement.\n\nThe car that has really caught my attention is the Kia K900. My aunt owns a 2018 V8 and that thing is superb. It's crazy comfortable and is loaded with so many cool features. Also, since it looks pretty anonymous it completely flies under the radar. Also, despite being older and with more miles than my Benz, it hasn't had any issues at all.\n\nI'd love to own something similar, **something that coddles you but looks super ordinary**. Bonus points if it has good power and an RWD layout.\n\nI found a 2020 K900 with 13k miles in my price range and I'm very close to sealing the deal. That being said, I'd like to check out other cars to see if I like them better first.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nThanks!!",

Screeched the tires a few times before I understood the power I was working with. And, since it shares parts with the Fusion, it's relatively lower maintenance cost",

Smoother ride, better amenities, seats are more comfortable, better performance and power, etc. It has the same engine as the K900, available in RWD or AWD (AWD in sport mode throws 80% power to the rear tires, turn it back to comfort/eco for 50/50), and so much more.",

Just wanted to share my personal experience with it! \n\n1 month tesla ownership gripes:\n  1- cruise control is terrible.   Will turn off with a lane change, not enough pressure on steering wheel will yell at you then disable cruise control until you stop the vehicle  If it does this too many times, no joke, USELESS and #1 annoyance.\n2- build quality is sooo poor.   Interior trim not glued down, window scratching tint. Misaligned panels... \n3- gps is horrible, will completely loose signal and you have to force re- download the cars software, which you have to do with a Tesla rep on the phone....   \n4- Can't get any text messages through the car with Samsung unless you delete your stock email app... not gonna happen. \n5- user profiles keep glitching and require reset of car settings....\n6- lane departure avoidance is a nightmare.   Will start yelling at you to \"take control of vehicle! \" for 10+ seconds\n.. even though you have full control.... have to turn it off...\n7-  no garage door opener!  Have to pay a $45 subscription!  (And the \"auto open/ close\" doesn't work when the GPS doesn't work...)I don't care that $45 isn't a lot of money, the car cost 47k and it can't just have Homelink from the factory?  We live 151 miles from the nearest service center.  I'm not driving there so they can charge me $300 to open my garage.  Complete BS.\n8- have to subscribe for Satellite maps 9.99 a month... it's a 47k car, should just come with it...\n9-  head gets hot with the all glass roof, have to buy \"shades\" to avoid this. \n10 - steering controls are hard to use, easy to push them the wrong way. \n11- have had to reset the car over 5 times now so it would function right..\n12- supercharger rates are BARELY better (more if during\"peak hours\") than gas making a long trip completely pointless and only delaying things by hours due to charging stops.\n13- can't use a brush car wash or push through car wash, will ruin rims.\n14- if you close the front Frunk anywhere but on the symbol, it will dent the hood..\n15- I hate the cup holders, so sticky and tight it almost always spills some with cans. \n\nGoods\n1- definitely saving on gas, more than $100 per month. \n2- lighting is fun to play with\n3 - sound system is great\n4 - seats are very comfortable (Maybe the most comfortable I've owned) \n5- despite being cheap, interior looks nice. \n6- dashcam is really nice \n7- sentry mode is awesome, can check in on the car from anywhere. \n8- charge time has been much better than expected. \n9 - app interface is good overall and really like the cameras on the car so you know where things are. \n10- wife loves it.. that's all that matters. \n11- no oil changes, ever! \n12- acceleration is great. \n13- no start/stop button!\n14- walk away locking is awesome \n15- ability to set car up for departure and monitor from afar is underrated. \n\nAfter 1 month of ownership, we aren't honestly sure we'd buy it again, only time will solidfy that answer though!",
