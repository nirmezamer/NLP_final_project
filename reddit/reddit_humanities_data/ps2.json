You may find your question is already answered here.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# How do I install homebrew on my PS2?\n\n[**FreeDVDBoot**](https://github.com/CTurt/FreeDVDBoot) **(Prefered way, does not support all PS2's yet.)**\n\nPlayStation 2 DVD Player Exploit. This allows you to burn your own PlayStation 2 homebrew discs and play them on an unmodified console as seen in the [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ez0y-hz3VuM). With uLaunchELF as the initial program, users can include multiple homebrew programs on the same disc.\n\nRead from [here](https://github.com/CTurt/FreeDVDBoot#easy-setup-for-all-ps2-slim-consoles--bravia-tv) if you have a Slim PS2.\n\nRead from [here](https://github.com/CTurt/FreeDVDBoot#phat-consoles) if you have a Phat PS2.\n\n# I have a modern tv, how do I make my PS2 Look the best?\n\nI recommend [this video](https://youtu.be/brMW6KFue-I) by My Life In Gaming\n\nTL:DR If your tv supports it, use component cable, you can do a search on any online store for \"PS2 Component cables\" and you should get some good results. \n\n#  How Do I make my ps2 region free?\n\nTry [Swapmagic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swap_Magic), You'll have to search for a disk though. \n\n# Can I play  PS1 backups using the Free DVD Exploit/FreeMcBOOT? \n\nNo\n\n\"Due to the way the hardware is designed, it is not possible to use native hardware on backup copies without modifying the hardware (e.g. installing a modchip).\n\nSo forget about USB/HDD + FMCB + native backwards compatibility. It is simply not possible because of the architecture. Also no \"partial\" native backwards compatibility.\n\nAs long as you stick with software based modding, there is nothing else you can do to use the native hardware for PS1 backup games. That is just the way it works.\"-/u/laughms\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs more common Questions come in, I'll update this thread as time goes on.",

            "I have a phat PS2 and the laser finally gave up the ghost. Ordered a replacement of the same laser model and installed it. Its not doing anything. Just spins. I can see the laser focusing and eventually become a pin point but never loads disks.  If I put a ps1 or CD PS2 game it will jerk three-five times but never fully spin. Any ideas? Also, I did remove the solder strap",

            "Hi! I have recently tried fixing my PAL ps2 slim. I have a disc read issue with my ps2 slim and I believe the problem might be something with the dvd laser potetiometer. I have scavanged the internet for answer without luck to finding out what i should try setting it to (ohms). My model number is \"75004\".\n\nEdit: My dvd ohms is currently at 750 or something close to that",
            "\nI got a Fat Ps2 SCPH-50004 that won't read GT4 or blue disks.  \nWhen i got it, it wouldn't boot any disks, so i got a dry ear cleaning stick (i know i should have done it with isopropyl alcohol but i don't have any on me) and slightly touched the laser. Then it booted every game except a pretty scratched (not that much tho) Gt4, so i bought a new one and Midnight club 1 and 2. And here we are today, Gt4 and Midnight club 1 still doesn't work but Midnight club 2 does. Any ideas how to fix that? I looked for anything to regulate the laser but i couldn't find anything.",
            "Hi there. So basically, I used Mechapwn to change my european 7000 version ps2 slim into a japanese console (still retail not dev) so I could play my authentic copy of Nights into Dreams. Thing is, when I put the disc into the console, it'll show up in the browser as \"Playstation 2 Disc\", and upon booting it I'm met with a black screen for a few seconds and then I fade back into the browser. It's the same result no matter how many times I try doing it, and I've already tried cleaning out the laser in case that was the issue. Anyone have any ideas as to why this is happening? Thanks a ton :)",
            "Hi - PS2 SCPH 30001 recognizeds PS2, PS1, DVD discs but does not boot them. Once I click on the disc to load, the screen fades to black and then immediately returns to the browser screen. Any help would be appreciated Thanks!",

Because dvd and cd games both work. But all dvd5 and dvd9 films I've tested won't. I don't have any double layered dvd games to try.\n\nI've cleaned the laser but this hasn't worked.\n\nDoes anyone know how to fix this or what the issue might be?",

            "Hi! Some time ago I bought a Hyperkin PS2 cable. It worked great, until recently. Now I'm having these weird color problems, that sometimes pop up. I'm not sure whether it depends on the brightness or specific color of what's being displayed at the moment in-game, or if it's just completely random.\n\nAs you can see in the link (I can't attach a video to this post), the problem is that sometimes the display flickers and adds this red or pink-ish \"filter\" to the whole picture. This problem comes up with other games, as well as the console's system menu.\n\nCan anyone help me determine if it's a fault of one of the cables, the Hyperkin itself or the power adapter?\n\nI'm attaching the recording of the screen below:\nhttps://youtu.be/jwvGduSbnSE?si=p4mXcxDoTDVlscW8"
