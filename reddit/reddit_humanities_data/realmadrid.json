            "Just a reminder  lodged a formal complaint against  for taking extra long at halftime. Nothing was done and they just did it again",
            "Man, online football fans are a hive mind and so easily manipulated lol. Then people cry about how the government controls them lmaoo. After every England game the hive mind barks cant believe he is winning the Balondor after being carried by Vini. After every Brazil game the hive mind barks cant believe he is winning the Balondor after being carried by Jude. In reality the hive mind just doesnt want another Real Madrid place to win it and increase the gap between Real Madrid and their club from infinity to infinity. \n\nYou could pay a bot army on twitter to spread a notion that some random small nations striker is the best player itw for scoring 2 goals in GS and the hive minds opinion will be shaped into that.",
            "> I would like you to remember me as a youth player who gave EVERYTHING for his club. \n\n",
            "Vini and Jude are getting slandered because they are top 5 in the world. Remember that when you read the slander from fans of city and the broke Catalan club. They are jealous of these players and the success theyve had here.",
            "Also pretty much nobody noticed but ... Hungary waited 3 days to go home.",
            "vini masterclass and brace and still getting hate for a rainbow flick that worked lmao it's getting really annoying now",
            "Remember, when Emi Martinez deliberately mocks fans to their faces and does sexual gestures to crowds with children, its hahaha good shithousery, Reddit On , youd want him on your team, hes a winner so he can do that\n\nBut when its Vini, also a winner, hes causing trouble and has behavioral issues"
