            "I'm curious to see if his lvl 3 and CA have some travel distance or only hits from close up.\n\nAlso I wonder if overdrive crusher will go through Rashid's lvl 2. Seems like psycho punisher will be a counter to that",
            "I noticed that, like guile moveset, your world avatar might probably be able to use bison\u2019s entire moveset since I believe each of his four specials have a unique directional input from each other. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong but I think he has one qcf motion, one qcb motion, one (b)f motion, and lastly one (d)u motion.",
            "And here I thought there was no way they\u2019d be able to top how badass Akuma is. Capcom is the absolute Goat at character design.",
            "I was a Bison player in the SF4 days and tbh it might be time to go back to tha old me",
            "We don't know yet about Dictator's story mode, but I'm pretty sure he wants to get his old power and prestige back (we always saw him as the ruler of Shadaloo, so it's the first time he's in a more \"underdog\" role).\n\nAnd that REALLY aligns with his more \"aggressive\" gameplay in SF 6. I personally REALLY enjoy that \"storyline - gameplay integration\".\n\nFor the same reason, I think that having the manipulative JP as a zoner fits his personality like a glove.",
            "He's gonna be scary when he comes out, but I don't think he'll be the next Akuma or Rashid.  All of his non-EX specials seem punishable on block?  And no EX DP of course.  But he does have great walkspeed and what look like some great normals too, including a cancelable low forward.",
            ">Shadow Rise and it's follow-ups\n\nI realize this is an incredibly minor spelling mistake but it caught me off guard because these videos usually have pretty good production value"

Practicing with Dee Jay and during the in game guides it displayed a combo, 236+B, to do a different version of the Rolling Sabat that has two kicks. \n\nThis isn't documented anywhere in the Modern command list that I see. Are there other classic inputs that I can use in Modern? Just curious if there's a list somewhere of if this is a strange one off with Dee Jay.\n\nAaaand, I kept searching after asking and found my answer here. Has the full modern list with some moves that aren't in the game command list, https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_moves_in_Street_Fighter_6#Dee_Jay\n\nThanks!",
            "Just started playing SF6, rank low silver.\n\n1. How do you incorporate Ken's Jinrai kick?  Do you use it first or cancel from cr.mk?  If I land the first hit and land the crouch second hit, it feels awkward afterward since it's not a combo.  I usually  do medium low kick for continued harass and repeat.\n2. What's his bread-n-butter combo?  I do JHP/HK + std HP + spin kick + shoryuken which does just under 3000.  In some video I saw a longer one that was still safe and reliably able to pull off.\n3. What are his standard dash combos?\n4. In this game, if you're crouch spamming LP on the opponent's wake-up and the enemy is looking to grab you, who wins?  Who wins if flipped?  The wake-up spamming LP or the standing opponent looking to grab?\n5. I use Ken's cr.mk a lot.  It reaches long and isn't punishable and you can cancel into movesets.  I use that to poke a lot or break rhythm.  How do other Ken players poke around using what?",
            "so Punish Counters is where you attack someone during the recovery of their attacks, but ive seen punish counters in other situations like when someone wakes up and mashes and loses to meaty command grab, I was wondering what other situation will give punish counters",

            "kinda new to fight gaming meta so bear with me. when I have oki, I usually alternate between throw, meaty button (cr. HP, cr. MP, etc.) and block.\n\nbut it feels like my opponent knows which option I'm going to take every time. any ways of like, masking it? making it appear more ambiguous?\n\nI'm eating way too many EX DPs attempting to throw/meaty on their wakeup, so I go for the dash-up block, but then they throw me! it's like they're in my head lol",

        "content": "Here's the [video from Tokido](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43lA_1-BRRM).\n\nSo basically, Tokido said:\n\n1. Akuma and Ken have very similar concept in sf6(for now), so since Tokido already decided to play Ken for tournaments, there is no advantage to use  2 similar characters(can not covering each others' weaknesses).\n\n2. Since they are similar, it's easy to confuse them. When using similar characters, basically you're doing the same thing while pressing different buttons. This may cause more mistakes.\n\nAnd Tokido is looking forward to Akumas's future changes.\n\nAbout the Akuma's playstyle, Akuma is pretty much like a glass cannon version of Ryu in sf6. Akuma has a very strong fireball game(basically top 1 fireball) and it seems Tokido don't really like to stand still and doing fireballs all day. Instead players who are favor of fireball games like Daigo can be seen playing Akuma a lot. Tokido seems have more favor of getting close distance, applying pressure and hitting some meaty combos. So Ken seems fit his playstyle better for now. ",

            "I had more success zoning and playing lame with akuma than going rushdown, I guess tokido's last reasoning makes more sense now. Apart from low health and great fireball game, a lot of his normals are great pokes or whiff punishers (st.hp/hk fwd st.hp/mk). I placed D1, gone back to P5, but now in D4 after having this realization.",
            "Well that sucks. I stole his corner combo and have been using it to great effect, and was hoping to have him available to copy well into the character's future. I'm guessing if the game launched with Akuma, or maybe had him as the very first DLC character, Tokido might have mained him.",
            "Chris Wong mentioned with Akuma low health and FT2 tournament format, playing Akuma is too risky. He thinks Luke is still a better character",
            "The discourse around akuma has been interesting. Angrybird and tokido both put Ken as a stronger character. Angrybird went as far as saying that Akuma isn\u2019t even top 5, which is definitely interesting. Meanwhile the rest of Japan has been switching over to akuma, as seen in the recent topanga tournament \n\nThe shotos in general are in a really good position, all of them being considered top 10. Will be interesting to see how the meta develops tho",
            "Tokido saying he doesnt wanna do fireballs is so hilarious cause i vividly remember watching him do jump back air fireballs for 50 seconds straight every round back in sf4",
            "Tokio always played high tier characters. That's the only reason he picked Ken.  There's no reason ever to play anything but the highest tier characters. Because he wants to win.",
            "Tokido really out here trying to get buffs for Akuma... and this cry for help shit will probably work too because it clear how much the devs love this character.",
            "This is exactly why I stepped away from Akuma and went back to Ken. I can\u2019t stand that fireball/DP baiting playstyle. I like to rushdown as fast as possible and be directly on top of my opponent, and Ken simply does that better than Akuma. Giving the opponent breathing room is not my thing, and I\u2019d rather rush in and get a low kick conversion than toss a fireball and try to keep people out, lol.",
            "Tl;dr: Tokido isn't interested in playing his lifelong main if he's anywhere below the absolute top tier.",
