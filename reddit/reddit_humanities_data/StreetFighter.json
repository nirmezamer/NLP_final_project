            "I'm new to SF6 after being a casual fighting game player and only now trying to get serious - is there any good quick advice on what to do upon wake-up? I'm improving in my fundamentals, but I lose a lot of matches to getting trapped in wake-up vortexes where it feels like I'm struggling to do anything besides try to roll, try to grapple, or try to parry (and making wild guesses on the second two if I'm in the corner). I've found on a lot of guides on what to do *to* people on wake-up but little on how to not let a knockdown lose you a match outright.",
            "Any tips for facing Bison? I'm getting wrecked in diamond 2 but I also assume it's master ranked people who are ranking up their Bison. I play Marisa btw.",
            "This is probably a dumb question, do you guys think cancel OD lariat to SA2 or SA3 something challenging to do? I find it extremely challenging to press buttons this fast... and lets say I do the head butt --> OD lariat --> SA2, how much time I actually have to press all the buttons?",
            "Do you think they will continue with the theme of this game for other mainline entries in the SF franchise (having your own custom character, interacting, and basically being a catch all mimic) ? Or is this just a one and done like Shujinko in MK Deception?",
            "for those that started labbing bison (or checking stuff on twitter), how important is his (set mine) jHP stHK crmp xx  OD psycho crusher route?  i just finished all the trials but advanced 5 reminded me why i dont bother with characters with charge moves, i just cant get used to charge after stHK and have no more rental tickets to test it.",
            "does anyone have tips with linking bisons c.mp or c.hp with his psycho crusher? im having a really hard time and idk why",
            "If I buy the year 2 stranded character pass, can I then buy the deluxe at a discounted price later on?",
            "Maybe a dumb question, but I was messing around with Bison in training mode vs Aki and did his taunt, and Aki played like a response-taunt that was different that her usual taunts?  I can't seem to get it to trigger again.  I noticed Bison has one as well when I did Aki's taunt.  But it only seemed to trigger once.  Is this something all characters do?  Are there conditions for triggering it?  Is there like a video compilation somewhere -- I tried looking up \"counter taunt\" and \"response taunt\" and nothing came up, so I dunno what to search.",
            "Hi, completely new to fighting games, sf6 is my first, been putting in hours trying to practice akuma, when trying to punish counter, st hp, adamant flame, my adamant flame never seems to come out, I have no clue what I'm doing wrong because I can see I'm executing the input",
            "I'm going to my first ever local event this Saturday and I'm really nervous about it.  \nI did some detective work and found out my first opponent is a Master rank Cammy player... I'm just a plat 1 Blanka...  \nI know I'll lose for sure, but do you guys have any tips I can use, so I can at least put up a fight?"
