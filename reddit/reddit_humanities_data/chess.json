        "content": "Being Grandmaster has been my dream since I was a kid. I used to play chess whilst working full time, and I made the tough decision to take a break from chess in 2020 (never returned after covid) to focus on my career with a 2436 rating and 2/3 GM norms.\n\nRecently I've realised I miss playing chess so I'm considering coming back to the professional chess scene. Now seems like a good timing because I'm in a better financial position and if I wait longer I'll likely be at work for the next 10+ years and pass my cognitive peak (am 30 this year). I've also realised that money isn't everything and life is short, so I should do what I enjoy.\n\nA handful of top players are \"amateurs\" and I applaud them but I wouldn't try and multi-task work and chess again as it was extremely exhausting and frustrating, so I would quit my job to focus on chess.\n\nI would be all in, fully focussed on training and competing in international tournaments. Part of me is afraid of failure - I don't want to end up like Levy. But then again, so what if I fail? You miss every shot you don't take.\n\nIt can be quite lonely as a professional chess player, so I think I would also vlog/youtube my journey. I previously made some educational chess videos on my youtube channel a while ago, and one of them \"The only Pawn Structure Chess Guide you\u2019ll ever need\" is consistently racking up some views, but creating the video itself wasn't that fun for me. On the flipside I think I'd absolutely love sharing my personal road to GM journey with a community, although I'm not sure people would be interested.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts, good or bad!\n\nEdit: Wow did not expect all these comments and perspectives. Reading through has given me more mental clarity and I am going to go for it! I'll try to post some videos on [**yfchess**](https://youtube.com/@yfchess?feature=shared) - would be great to share this journey as I know it will be a long and difficult one.",

            "If you have 2/3 GM norms and \"only\" 66 elo points to reach 2500... And, overall, if it is your dream... Of course it is worth it!!! I think in some years (or when you get to reach that two objectives to be GM) you will be sooo happy being GM, not many people can really dream with it but you are so near, go on!!",
            "I'm of a similar age and playing strength to you, also trying to become a GM (I am attempting to multi-task it with work, and I understand why you'd rather not do that  but we all do what we can). I too know that spanning that final outstanding gap, even when it may appear small, is a difficult task. To me it seems that you have as good a chance as any, with 2 norms and a peak rating close to 2500. For myself, I can say that I'm not sure. Personally, I'm trying to see the task of competing for the highest title in the game in my thirties with a job as a fun adventure, however it ends up. This has allowed me to have fun traveling to new places, meeting new people, and competing for high stakes that I hope I won't regret even if I never become a GM. \n\nIf you come back to chess, my suggestion would be to have some sense of purpose that allows you to find the journey meaningful whether or not you earn the title. Not saying you shouldn't make sacrifices for it, but if you make them while thinking to yourself \"this will all be a horrible waste unless I make GM\", then I feel like the pressure you put on yourself won't be good for your overall well-being, let alone your chess. Your idea of documenting your journey for others to follow along is one good idea that could plausibly make this journey feel rewarding, whatever the outcome.",
            "I would say absolutely go for it - at age 25 I went all in on the GM title (at the time I wasn't even IM yet so it was an even greater risk). People advised against it as I could just stay at a normal job, but I didn't want to have any regrets about my chess career. So I sat down, worked my ass off for 2-3 years and went from 2300 to over 2500. I think in order to make it work, you do have to make enormous sacrifices though. Social life was pretty much nonexistent for me during that period. But I'm sure if you're asking this, then you already understand that.\n\nBest of luck if you decide on it, it isn't an easy journey. Documenting it sounds like a great idea!",
            "> Part of me is afraid of failure. I don't want to end up like Levy.\n\nDamn Levy catching strays. He is doing pretty fine though.",
            "I think you should go for it. We only have one life, if this is your dream dont let it pass you by. Its like they say in Dune, fear is the mind killer. You got this.\n\nThis also doesnt sound too much of a stretch of a dream either. This seems obtainable and within your reach. I think people would enjoy following the journey with you.",
            "I think about this frequently from a similar position  The main thing you have to appreciate isn't that you might (maybe probably will) fail, but that even if you succeed, almost nothing will actually change in your life. You'll feel like an absolute king for like a week, sure, but then it's more or less back to normal. You will still play the same tournaments for fun, still play online pretty much the same amount as before, still understand (or lack thereof) the game almost the same amount, and none of your non-chess friends will really understand or care (many of them probably think \"International Master\" is a better title than GM anyway). You'll also be sacrificing a fair amount of your life and career - more than you might think, because beyond the raw time off it's a fairly consuming endeavor, plus it's not unlikely to drag on longer than you'd think (if you're, say, consistently 2470 a year from now, would you stop?). Plus, since you've made norms already, you already know you're capable of the title, and it's largely \"just\" a question of time and dedication now - do you actually need to put in those hours to be satisfied, or is knowing that you could enough?\n\nIf you've (truly) internalized all that and still have even an inkling that it's something you want to pursue, then you have your answer  Happy to chat more in DM if it would help.",
            "It depends if you have better things to do. I you already have a family I don't think it is worth the effort. I would rather spend my time with my kids and pets, than focusing most of my energy on a single goal.\n\nBut if you do have time, you should at least try it. It will probably be harder than you think, especially since you are not very young anymore. People typically underestimate the effort required to accomplish something. You will probably need at least 3-4 years of very hard work. If you haven't played in 4 years you probably need more than a year to get to your previous level.",
            ">I don't want to end up like Levy\n\nThe most successful chess streamer, millionaire, highly respected and influential player and commentator? Why not?",
            "Mr. Yang-Fan you got this!!!!!",
            "You have to beat Levy to it, bare minimum. \n\nIn all seriousness, I'm deeply invested in your journey now."
