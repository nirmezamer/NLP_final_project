It gets really noisy and weird with all of them moans and ouches and heavy guns spinning fast. I usually play in the night, so my gf have some background noise or music to fall asleep to, but not that type of chaotic noise during any event or dops/expeditions :/\n\nAlso extra QOL: possibility to tweak/turn vats critical highlight screen and sound.

We\u2019re starting this process with today\u2019s update by making some changes to Creatures and Weapons. Our goal is for these changes to have positive effects on combat throughout the entire game.\n\nTo help set expectations, we expect these changes to take effect in a variety of different places (Weapons, Creatures, etc.) across multiple patches. Giving you all a lot of time to provide feedback on the adjustments being made to ensure we\u2019re moving in a positive direction.\n\n# Season 17 \u2013 Pioneer Scouts\n\nThe sun is out and it\u2019s time to head on over to Summer Camp. There\u2019s much to learn and do at the Pioneer Scouts sleepaway camp!\n\nSeason 17 Trailer: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPjH83FSqjQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPjH83FSqjQ)\n\nCheck out our \\[Season 17 \u2013 Pioneer Scouts article here!\\](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2NqJZC9zmanyihEhnGwe1d/fallout-76-season-17-preview)\n\n# Fixes & Improvements\n\n# Art\n\n* Muni Operator Outfit Now Looks the Same When Previewed & When Worn\n\n# C.A.M.P.\n\n* **Workshop**: Enlightened Mothman Lantern should no longer display the premium icon and can be repaired individually when destroyed\n* **Workshop**: Fluttering Moth no longer takes up CAMP Light budget\n* The Sacred Mothman Tome camp item now has candle flames\n* Nuka world radio will now correctly sync across clients\n\n# Gameplay\n\n* **Power Armor**: Fixing a state players could get in where they could no longer craft Union Power Armor when they should have been able to\n* **Power Armor**: Union Power Armor will no longer drop as loot from enemies but can be rolled from The Purveyor if the recipe or entitlement is known by the player\n\n**Dev Note**: With this fix Union Power Armor is now craftable for players who have bought and learned the recipe from Giuseppe or by players who earned the Union Power Armor entitlements in Season 10.\n\nIf you do not have the plan for Union Power Armor, it can be purchased from Giuseppe who is upstairs with Bubbles at the Refuge. Once learned, they will no longer be able to be obtained.\n\nAdditionally, Union Power Armor pieces will not drop as loot even if you can craft the Power Armor pieces, but they can be found via the random Power Amor Purchases from Murmrgh at The Rusty Pick. Players should only see Union Power Armor Pieces that they know how to craft drop from Purveyor's Mystery Picks. Pieces that they have yet to learn will not drop\n\nUnion Power Armor pieces will still have the Atomic Symbol on them and cannot be traded or dropped by players once they have been obtained.\n\n* **Workshop**: Player who had learned to build the Atlantic City Poker and Blackjack tables but lost access to them should now be able to build them again\n* **Test Your Metal**: Robot Beer Stein Display Case will now properly drop from the Test Your Metal Event\n* **Moonshine Jamboree** Improved an issue which could block enemy pathing during the event\n* **Fasnacht**: Masks of all tiers will correctly drop upon event completion\n* **Fasnacht**: Improved spawn rates of Honeybeasts\n* **Fasnacht**: Added a Donation Basket near the event! Share your repeat masks with other players\n* **Fasnacht**: Marchers now start walking to the parade start immediately when their task is completed, without needing to wait for their dialogue line to be finished\n* **Fasnacht**: Increased the walk speed of the Marchers\n* **Fasnacht**: Will now randomly pick between 5 possible end boss encounters\n* **Yao Guai Pastry**: Now counts as a cooked meal for the \"Eat a Cooked Meal\" challenge\n* Applying the Reflex Sight to the Enclave Pistol with a Flamer Barrel attachment now shows the Decrease in AP Consumption in the STATS Menu\n* Hot Rod On Blocks & Overgrown Vehicle no longer spawn damaging nuke explosions when destroyed\n* Fixed an issue which could cause players to get stuck while turning the spit in Meat Week\n* Fixed an issue with the Damage Reduction effect on the Endangerol Barrel that allowed it to stack multiple times on a target\n* Nuka Shank now requires glass & cloth to be crafted rather than oil\n* Updated mods for the Gauss shotgun, Gauss minigun and Gauss pistol to correctly require Science based perks to be applied\n* Updated the default barrel mod for the gauss rifle\n* Fixed an issue which could cause Fusion cores to appear empty when place in Power Armor\n* Players can now trade the Herdsman's Bell and Herdsman's Bell Rack to other players\n* Paddle Ball now displays the correct ammo type when inspected\n\n# Weapons\n\n* Increased the base damage of the Alien Blaster and Cryolator\n* Fixed an issue with how damage was calculated for the following weapons/mods: Auto Axe, Chainsaw, Minigun Shredder mod\n* Increased base damage for the Auto Axe\n* Adjustments to Electric/Electrified, Burning, and Poisoned mods for the following weapons: Auto Axe, Mr Handy Buzz Blade, Chinese Officer Sword,  Shepherds Crook, Sheepsquatch Staff, Sheepsquatch Club, Hatchet, Assaultron Blade, Revolutionary Sword, Baton, and Vault 63 Shock Baton.\n\n**Dev Note**: These weapon mods now evenly split their damage between Physical and Energy/Fire/Poison, and damage has been adjusted to account for damage being split between multiple damage types.\n\nThe Cattle Prod has also received a similar change - its damage has been adjusted and is evenly split between Physical and Energy damage. These adjustments generally represent an increase in damage dealt.\n\nWe have also improved how we calculate the falloff for weapon damage at range. We expect this to smooth out the falloff damage for weapons that historically lost most of their damage right away. All ranged weapons benefit from this, but it should be most visible with Shotguns and Pipe Guns, as well as when fighting larger creatures such as Deathclaws.\n\n# Localization\n\n* Fixed Various Typos\n* Fixed Some Dialogue\n\n# Quests\n\n* **Honor Bound** Fixed an issue where Vin could become hostile to the player\n* **One Violent Night**: Fixed an issue where the Nightstalker's VFX would be applied to players multiple times, creating an extremely intense effect\n* **\"Bots on Parade\" and \"A Real Blast\"** Fixed an issue that caused the objective to complete before the correct number of hostiles were defeated.\n* **\"Distant Thunder\"** Increased the objective radius to more accurately reflect the area in which Scorched can appear\n* **Hell's Eagles** Fixed an issue that would allow players to start the quest again after completion. We also removed the second broken quest from players in this situation\n* Regent of the Dead: Jordy no longer continuously starts dialogue with the player if the player exits dialogue with her before resolving the confrontation.\n* The quest Miner Miracles now starts correctly when interacting with the Garrahan Excavator Poster\n\n# UI\n\n* Items now display how much they will weigh when being placed in a character's stash\n* Score notification will no longer remain visible on ultra-wide monitors\n* Fixed an issue which would cause \"You have joined a team\" to remain visible on some super wide monitors\n* Added Height indicators for quest targets and NPCs to the Power Armor UI\n\n# World\n\n* Raider NPCs from the Coop will no longer spawn as legendary\n* The following creatures have received balance changes: Angler, Cave Cricket, Floaters, Gulper, Mutant Hound, Protectron\n\n# Miscellaneous\n\n* Fixed some dialog inconsistencies\n* Broken ProSnap Deluxe cameras will no longer appear in vendor inventories.\n* Fixed some directional prompts for Tax Evasion\n* Fixed an issue which could cause audio to cut out on some expeditions.\n* Green Thumb, Backwoodsman 4 and Verdant Season should now work on a broader selection of plants\n* Fixed an issue which would cause players to crash if they logged out during character generation\n* Fixed some cases where turret-mounted laser weapons weren't triggering the Electric Absorption perk\n* Updated \u201cComplete Any Expedition\u201d and \u201cComplete Any Atlantic City Expedition\u201d challenges to include the new Atlantic City mission from the America\u2019s Playground update",

            "One thing that they *might* settle for would be adding certain premium items that apply a weight mod to a certain number of items stashed inside of them.  For instance, a chem stash where you can store 100 weight worth of chems at 1/10 weight, even though that still eats up 100 weight from your shared stash.  It'd be similar to the Military Cryo Freezer applying a no spoilage mod despite sharing space with your main stash (from what I hear, anyway).",
