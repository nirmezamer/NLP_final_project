If you have been scammed before you cannot email me, you cannot call me, you cannot txt me and ask for me to get your money back or do an investigation. I am so sorry, I wish that I could go and help every single person that is out there, there is literally no time in the day. We go after live scams that are happening. We go after live scammers. We don't go after something that happened a month ago, 6 months ago, I wish that we could. I know most of you guys already know that. I just... I can't, I'm sorry. I don't have a team of cyber hackers that are going to message you on my behalf, there is none of that. Now we do have a team of people, yes, but part of their job is not to go and message people on instagram and ask for money and all this kind of stuff. Anyway that's a public service announcement...\"  -Pierogi*\n\n[Pierogi \\(Scammer Payback\\) - \\\\\"We go after live scams that are happening...\\\\\"](https://reddit.com/link/123xm8x/video/dvfe6jke2cqa1/player)\n\nPlease keep in mind:\n\n* Never post in comments or social that you have been scammed, you become a target for scammers.\n* [Scammer Payback](https://www.youtube.com/@ScammerPayback) does not take on private investigations but you can always send a TIP to the [TIPLINE](https://www.youtube.com/@ScammerPayback/about).
