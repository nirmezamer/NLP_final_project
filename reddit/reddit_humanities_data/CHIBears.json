            "After the war that took place at the beginning of the off-season it's refreshing to see no news for a bit.  Going from 500+ comments a day on the daily QB battle thread to barely 5 on a weekly chat thread.  I mean it when I say no news right now is good news.  The draft was great, the team is all locked in, and no drama (knocks on wood) is nice.",

            "I like that Kenaan Allen's contract expires at the end of the year, but would that $23M have been better spent on a 13M edge and 10M OL?  To be so loaded at WR and lacking at edge and OL seems like it could come back to bite them.\n\nAdding plus a 4th round pick.",
            "Super Bowl shuffle bound..",
            "Caleb Williams is undefeated as a bear",
            "I think we\u2019ll get a pretty damn good sense about our offensive potential after the first game. Raw Qb ability means so much in the NFL. Remember all those videos of Fields not seeing wide open guys? All it takes to meaningfully improve the offense is for Caleb to make two or three of those throws. I bet we get a sense very quickly of whether he has that innate vision. \n\nBut I think it will take more than a month for the offense to \u2018solidify\u2019 meaning everyone knows their assignments and roles, etc. new OC, new QB and a lot of new skill players. That\u2019s gonna take some time.",
            "Prob will take a few weeks",
            "~10 mil for an edge or OL will get you guys in the Yannick and Nate Davis tier of players: they're technically average but they don't move the needle on a position group as a whole imo.\n\nI think I'd rather pay a good player good money to elevate their position group than pay 2 meh players ok money.\n\nNot diminishing the issues with OL or edge, but I get the process they took to arrive at the decision to trade for Allen, especially since it wasn't a certainty that we'd get Odunze."

            "This really shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. And I don\u2019t know why other fanbases are getting so butt hurt about this PFF ranking. Bears absolutely do have a top 5 receiving corps\u2026 on paper. \n\nDoes that mean they\u2019ll actually be good in real life? No, not necessarily. We have a new QB and a new OC. Our O Line is decent but maybe a bit suspect in pass pro. We have no idea how this will all workout and gel together. But on paper that is a lot of *individual talent*.",
