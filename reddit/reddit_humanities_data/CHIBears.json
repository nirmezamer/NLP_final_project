            "After the war that took place at the beginning of the off-season it's refreshing to see no news for a bit.  Going from 500+ comments a day on the daily QB battle thread to barely 5 on a weekly chat thread.  I mean it when I say no news right now is good news.  The draft was great, the team is all locked in, and no drama (knocks on wood) is nice.",
            "Bears might not lose a game this year",
            "Gotta get my italian beef recipe down for this year",
            "I'm really hoping that the offense can solidify itself by the beginning of the first month of the season\u2049\ufe0f",
            "I like that Kenaan Allen's contract expires at the end of the year, but would that $23M have been better spent on a 13M edge and 10M OL?  To be so loaded at WR and lacking at edge and OL seems like it could come back to bite them.\n\nAdding plus a 4th round pick.",
            "Does anyone know if Kiran Amegadije play highschool bball with Matas buzelis the Bulls draft pick? I'm pretty sure their times at Hinsdale overlap a little bit, just wondering if their might be a connection. Matas transferred out during his sophomore season so it's kind of a small window.",
            "Caleb Williams is undefeated as a bear",
            "I think we\u2019ll get a pretty damn good sense about our offensive potential after the first game. Raw Qb ability means so much in the NFL. Remember all those videos of Fields not seeing wide open guys? All it takes to meaningfully improve the offense is for Caleb to make two or three of those throws. I bet we get a sense very quickly of whether he has that innate vision. \n\nBut I think it will take more than a month for the offense to \u2018solidify\u2019 meaning everyone knows their assignments and roles, etc. new OC, new QB and a lot of new skill players. That\u2019s gonna take some time.",
            "Prob will take a few weeks",
            "It\u2019s debatable in retrospect but when they got Allen they didn\u2019t know if they were going to get Rome. If they didn\u2019t get Allen and the Falcons or someone took Rome we\u2019d be left with only DJ at WR with a rookie qb"

            "I actually wouldn't mind more 'unknown' guys who weren't stars. Gives us a chance to learn a bit about someone new & their history in the league.",
            "Damn, so the XxXKingPoles69XxX who schooled me in Madden on the Xbox wasn't the real guy? I'm so disappointed!",
            "Will mix it up a bit. What I am trying to do is get some who were at least on the team longer than 2-3 years overall. Which for some numbers is harder than others.",
            "I really gotta hand it to him, I wasn't sure about Poles as a GM at first. The easy part was trading away players from the previous regime and most of them were fairly expensive too. 2022 was definitely an evaluation year for a lot of players to see who could be worth keeping around next year. 2023 was a step in the right direction, even though the team itself also blew a lot of games, that's also part of the evaluation and more moves were made because of that.\u00a0\n\n\nYou can say he got lucky with getting consecutive #1 overall picks but you gotta make your own luck, and he just so happened to trade 2023's pick to the right team as we wound up taking an elite QB prospect for the first time in a very long time. I'm pretty excited for the foreseeable future, Poles has a clear vision and is executing it pretty well so far, all that's left is for us to start winning.",

            "This really shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. And I don\u2019t know why other fanbases are getting so butt hurt about this PFF ranking. Bears absolutely do have a top 5 receiving corps\u2026 on paper. \n\nDoes that mean they\u2019ll actually be good in real life? No, not necessarily. We have a new QB and a new OC. Our O Line is decent but maybe a bit suspect in pass pro. We have no idea how this will all workout and gel together. But on paper that is a lot of *individual talent*.",

            "I may get shit for this but honestly, I would\u2019ve preferred to have Aaron Jones over Deandre Swift. Obviously the age difference matters but we saw years of Swift in Detroit and he rarely impressed me. He goes and has one decent season with the best Oline in the league and we give him a fat ass contract? Makes no damn sense.",
