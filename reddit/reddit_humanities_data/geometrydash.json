            "I beat Caput Mundi a couple hours ago as my second demon ever (and my first easy demon ever (and my first gauntlet demon ever))!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nlevel was absolutely beautiful and really fun (even though the ending part was kinda confusing)\n\nedit: forgot to mention, 134 attempts!!!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/synnvno1yu6d1.png?width=487&format=png&auto=webp&s=2dad29b49295b5f04c7239fa477e3ea6eefdd077",

I dont think its gonna be a new hardest since so far i havent struggled with it too much. (My current hardest is supersonic)",

            "As a player of both, I say both are difficult in their own ways and aren't comparable due to how differently their respective games work\n\n\nGeometry dash banks hard into tight timings, memorization, and generally very unforgiving gameplay, but the levels usually only last a few seconds to a few minutes in terms of how much gameplay\n\nJuke's towers of hell is a lot more reliant on special strategies for specific jumps, endurance, and much longer length (anywhere from a few minutes to hours to complete towers); but towers are generally more forgiving since you can catch yourself on lower floors if you fall",
            "As someone who thinks that Tidal wave is in the top 3 accomplishments in any video game bare minimum, Its GD and its not close, I think Trials of death in Mario make is about tied with Tidal wave (I believe that the individual that beat ToD was less equipped to beat it than zoink was to verify tidal wave, I also believe if Mario maker became competitive to the degree of gd, there would easily be more than one person who beats trials of death)",
            "i think coiv and tidal wave are both some bullshit",
            "You can't compare JToH and GD.\n\n\nGeometry Dash relies on precise clicks, jumps, gamemodes and speed to create a level. Not mentioning that it's in 2D.\n\n\nJuke's Towers of Hell relies on various mechanics such as client objects, mechanics, flicks, and glitches to form its towers, which are all in 3D (not minding CoTaW that utilizes a 2D section halfway through).\n\n\nThe building process however is kiinda the same on both games, you build creative gameplay, design it, spend months of your time making the level/tower, and what you get is a finished product that if executed well, will get the hearts of the players that beat it.\n\n\nif anyone asks, hardests are ToCA and a weekly easy demon (I can't remember the name\ud83d\ude2d)",
            "cant be compared. very different games, both based off user generated levels.\njtoh has a much higher skill ceiling potential but gds difficulty has been raised much higher due to a bigger playerbase",
            "gd there is no competition",
            "kinda obvious, does juke's tower of hell have levels like emptiness",
            "Idk bruh they both crazy.",
            "I play both, i\u2019d say they are hard for their own reasons, but JTOH has a greater capacity for difficulty, but GD\u2019s peak is much better explored and explorable\n\nIt being 3D and the fact a whole coding language and engine is used should be all the proof needed for its capability for difficulty",
            "jtoh is younger so ofc it's not as established in terms of difficulty yet\n\nHaven't had a new top 1 for months and it has like 10 victors\n\njtoh has a lot more potential for difficulty than in GD since the movements can become more complex, precise and not to mention that it's 3D which allows for more room in terms of error\n\njumps in jtoh are nearly impossible compared to gd since every tower is different and has many mechanics and different kinds of jumps that need learning, stratting and technicality, while gd is just clicking\n\ngd rn is harder, but jtoh has so much more potential we just beat our first unreal tower like 7 ish months ago which is probably around where bloodlust is now prob\n\nwhat also proves its difficulty is the large community gd has that has beaten an extreme, compared to those who are capable of beating any intense tower in the game\n\nI do play both for the purpose of reliability, hardests are ToGF and diligence"
