Here's an idea of some things you can share and talk about here:\n\n* Quick or common questions with closed-ended responses\n* Recent completions, progress on levels, or other in-game achievements, if you can't record footage\n* Asking for suggestions on levels to play or other opinions/feedback\n* Collab recruiting, planning, and organization\n* ...and much more! If you're not sure where to post it, this thread is likely the right place.\n\nCommunity Resources:\n\n* [Geometry Dash Discord Server](https://discord.gg/geometrydash)\n* [Pointercrate Demonlist](https://pointercrate.com/demonlist/)\n* [Geometry Dash /r/Place Discord Server](https://discord.gg/hZj5evMRZr)\n\nHelp:\n\n* [Setting up a user flair beside your username](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205242695-How-do-I-get-user-flair-)",

            "No. RIP Michigun, but his levels are not automatically untouchable because he passed. I personally believe his levels are annoying, but charming.",
            "no. you are absolutely free to criticize and hate his levels despite him having passed away. you're just hating his gp of his levels, not michi himself",
            "No. You're a bad person if you laugh at his death. You **aren't** a bad person because you hate his levels.",
            "No. You're still allowed to criticize his levels even though he passed.",
            "No any piece of art including gd levels arent immune to criticism just because the creator died.",
            "Separate The art from the artist, if you find his levels annoying to play, that's entirely fair and you're not disrespecting him just because he passed away.\n\nAs long as you only focus on the level itself, all complaints are valid.",
            "you're not a bad person, the levels do suck but that's not an attack on michigun himself",
            "not really. RIP Michgun, and his levels were revolutionary at the time. You don't have to like it at all. That's like saying you don't like XXX to a rap community. Just pay them the respect they deserve; you have something called freedom of speech.",
            "RIP, but i hate all of his levels and all of his parts in MC's. the gameplay is just so unbelievably annoying",
            "I commented on his level called double triple trial (his 2 star level I don't know if that was the name) and said: \"RIP Michi but this shouldn't be rated\" and hours laters I looked the comment and I saw I had 21 dislikes on my comment."

            "It actually is like that. At first glance, UFO might seem like a free gamemode like the ship, because your every input registers into the icon, unlike cube and robot, which only register inputs when on the ground, but in actuality, one wrong input on the UFO, and you're fucked, because it completely throws you off your tracks with basically no way to recover, unlike ship which still provides some leeway. It's a really deceptive gamemode.",
            "That's how the part feels like but you do get a bit of room to decide when you jump into it, making it slightly different depending on how you do it if you know what I mean",

            "That ufo really does feel stupidly tight. Hardest part of michigun for sure.",
