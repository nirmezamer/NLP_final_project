        "content": "Hey folks!    \n\n\nWe just wanted to mention quickly that we want to avoid posting identifying information and social media handles that lead to the \"pos\"s account directly.    \n\n\nPeople will take real stories and attach it to someone innocent, or fabricate stories in order to turn this sub into a on-demand brigade. As well as that, it's against reddit's terms of service- likely for this exact reason.    \n\n\nThanks for understanding. At the end of the day, if it's a real story people will find it on Google, and in our eyes that's great, y'all are fact checking yourselves and that's how things should be when it comes to internet strangers telling you to be angry at someone, tbh.",

            "hey there, im not 100% sure what that Y word means, but we generally will let news videos get uploaded to the sub directly. as far as posts go, we like people to be able to stay on the sub if that's where they started- so direct video/gif/screenshot upload to reddit.\n\nas for the news article links in comments, our automod is very aggressive in order to fight off spam bots and malicious links, and it's about 14 pages worth of regex code (it's been like that since before i got here and has gotten larger over the years from other mods), so it can be at times difficult to make changes to it to allow certain things :/\n\nif you as the OP post the news article as a comment while the post is waiting approval, we do check the comments and can see the removed website- so the news article. that speeds up the approval process drastically as we do like to try and verify posts as well. If I notice them I try to approve the news links if it doesn't look like a sketchy add-farm site, too.\n\nwhat happens tho is people copy paste stuff from the news article and include a ton of personal info as a comment, which is against tos. as well as that we'll remove that stuff as this is when we're allowing random users to explain things to people and they can lie or manipulate the info with the idea that no one will actually check the news article and take what was said at face value.\n\nlot of folks with agendas come here.\n\ntldr sorry, i do want news articles but it's just there's so many scammers on this site and it can be easy to lose track of them in the cracks, and it's very difficult to make changes in automod as ours is extremely large.",
            "Ok\n\nYinz = you, yall \n\nSo you can post a video news link but not a printed one because the bot removes those?",
            "you can upload a news video directly to reddit so that its contained in the site, we approve those ones often. links to a news article we dont- but those rarely do well as a post as  redditors want to just doom scroll and upvote or downvote. most people dont care much to go deeper than that so if your goal is to get your post seen that is in your best interest to do anyways. screenshots also do well.\n\nwhen you type out a website automod will kill it. there are multiple paragraphs across the 14 pages set up to target websites and its a nightmare to try and whitelist certain websites without harming the bots abilities to target scammers and malicious links.",

        "content": "Hi folks! Hope all's well.\n\nWe're looking for new mods! We need help with post approvals. In order to prevent the sub from getting banned, and to ensure no one innocent gets doxxed, we approve most posts manually.\n\nMy goal is for people to mod 1-3 times a week and I will do check-ins to make sure no one feels burned out. Please be aware I do spot-check your work as well. I try to ensure that the amount of content on the sub matches what our moderation team can handle, and respect and value all of the mods that choose to help here.\n\nI like down to earth, empathetic, and reasonable people. I dislike mod abuse and agendas, and will work with a mod if that kind of situation comes up to prevent it from happening again. I am very patient and understanding, though.\n\nIf you have an interest in news, journalism, or like posting informative content, you'd enjoy modding here. The mod team is very low-drama and friendly, too. We're fairly active in discord as well if you like shooting the shit, and are all very familiar with modding if it's something you have an interest in.\n\nThis will not be a good sub for you if you need to see progress with fixing problematic behaviors common with large angry groups of anonymous people. The users ban evade and use alts, and the only way to win is to remove the content that brings them here. That of course doesn't mean we just let it run rampant/don't mod, but understand this- there is no finish line.\n\nA better way to look at it is to consider that if you caused everyone to leave forever, they would go to another sub and who knows if that other team would abuse their position to threaten/doxx others, push agendas, or if they would let personal info be posted and unregulated leading to innocent people getting doxxed. The mob's always gonna want blood and a ban won't stop that type of person, but at least here we can ensure no one innocent gets their life ruined.\n\nIAATPOS tries to be as neutral as we can, and focuses on the person being an asshole. I do like diverse teams, and right, centrist, left, whatever-leaning people are welcome. Coming from different countries is of course welcomed, as is knowing multiple languages. I don't want an echo chamber and I want to ensure we have people approving posts with multiple viewpoints to help decide. I do expect everyone to be respectful of each other and keep an open mind, though.\n\nThanks folks, I appreciate it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://forms.gle/zidafinJNvPN2i1v6](https://forms.gle/zidafinJNvPN2i1v6)",
