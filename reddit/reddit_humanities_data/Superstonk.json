But it's really put a question mark on Rule 11 and so we're addressing that by allowing some bullish option positions to be posted. This will be a 2 weeks trial where we'll see how this goes and then we'll take another look at it, so we genuinely want to hear from you all across the two weeks. We've created a post to help educate those that don't understand options:\n\n[**https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1dpv5ap/so\\_you\\_want\\_to\\_learn\\_about\\_options/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1dpv5ap/so_you_want_to_learn_about_options/)\n\nWe're a community that's bullish on GameStop and so it doesn't make any sense for us to gatekeep anyone that is bullish. This has been a repeatedly requested feature for the sub with bullish posts being removed for no reason other than Rule 11 being gatekeepy. Options are a tool that give investors more choices than just buying and selling, but just as with buying and selling there are risks and in some cases those risks outweigh the benefits. In order to hopefully prevent anyone in this community from getting convinced into irresponsible positions we'll be moderating options posts in a specific way:\n\n*A new rule*\n\nWe're implementing \"Rule 14: Options must be Bullish, Calculated and Explained\" which will be:\n\n---\n\nNeutral/Bullish Options (e.g. Calls/CSPs) with strike, expiry date and quantity may be posted, gains/losses or the day/time of your purchase cannot. Include the reason you purchased those contracts for example:\n\n* why buy now?\n* why that strike?\n* why that expiration?\n* what's your exit plan?\n\nUneducated/unsafe \"YOLO's\" will be removed indiscriminately. Be responsible.\n\n[Learn more about options here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1dpv5ap/so_you_want_to_learn_about_options/)\n\n---\n\nSo let's talk a little more about this rule. You'll notice that this only allows for neutral/bullish option positions to be posted as bullish is what this subreddit is all about. For most people this will be sold Puts (Cash Secured Puts) and bought calls.\n\nMore advanced strategies such as; credit/debit/calander spreads, iron condors, butterflies, jade lizards, synthetic longs, will be allowed if:\n\n1. they are neutral/bullish positions\u00a0\n2. you take some time to explain how they work and the risks associated with them\n\nWe're not allowing irresponsible option positions which means no YOLOs, no FDs, no putting your money into a position you don't understand.\u00a0\n\nUnlike a DRS post you can't just post your options contracts without any explanation. We need to know that you're being responsible by making an informed play. As the rule implies you need to explain why you're buying that specific contract. We're not tell you want you can and can't do with your money, but we are telling you what you can and can't post on Superstonk.\n\n*A new flair*\n\nWe're adding a flair that'll be specifically for option positions. So if you want to browse the subreddit without seeing any options you can by filtering out the flair (you can read about how to do that on the subreddit sidebar or using \"see more\" at the top of the sub on mobile). Images of option positions should be given this flair and at the moment that's it; education about options can be under the education flair as per usual.\n\n*Looking for feedback*\n\nAs mentioned before we're running this on a trial basis both for the community and for the moderation team. We\u2019ll be making changes based on user feedback in two weeks. Please let us know in the comments if you have any thoughts or suggestions. It's okay if you don't like options but remember: \"No fucking fighting\" - DFV. No matter your feelings the positions posted here are going to be bullish and the people posting them are your allies. Rule 1 + 5 will be enforced just as strictly as they are on the rest of the subreddit. Which brings us nicely into the next section:\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n**Do not call anyone \"shill\"**\n\nIf you feel like you're having d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu that's because this is a copy-paste from the last open forum, but frankly a vocal minority need to hear it again:\n\nThere's been a noticeable uptick of a loud minority of users dropping the insult \"shill\" whenever someone says something that isn't the most bullish statement that's ever been posted here. We're not an echo chamber and we allow content that's questioning the company/stock/DD or whatever. You've got loads of option when it comes to seeing a post or comment you don't like:\n\n* If you don't like some content then you're welcome to downvote and move on\n* If you disagree with someone's content then you're welcome to downvote it or to engage with them in good faith to have a discussion about why you disagree and to see if there's a misunderstanding\n* If you think some content is suspicious then you're welcome to report it or comment !MODS! under it with some (non-callout: rule 5) context\n* If you believe someone is a literal shill then you're welcome to report their content, reply !MODS! and/or send us a modmail explaining your reasoning\n* If you're angry or frustrated at another user you're encouraged to disengage, block them and report any of their content that you believe breaks the rules\n\nYou get the idea, Rule 1: Be Nice. There's never an excuse to be rude or insulting. Calling someone a \"shill\" is breaking Rule 1 and frankly we've clearly been too tolerant about that, we're sorry.\n\nApe no fight Ape has always been a motto here and it's one that needs to be followed.\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nThank you to everyone that engages in good faith because it is the **vast** majority of you.\n\nI'll see you all tomorrow for MOASS after I buy the dip.",

The details can probably be refined over time, based on how things unfold, but if nothing else it should get rid of the obnoxious type of options posts, like the obvious fellow-kids ones that try to bait everyone into specific options.\n\nThis is a GameStop stock subreddit, ideally the discussion on the stock would revolve more around its fundamentals and not trying to reverse-engineer market trends to time it (IMO that's a fool's errand because the price has been constantly fake for the past few years), but I agree that it cannot be shut down completely without making the mod team seem gatekeepy.",
