This is the thread where you post your DJ mixes and ask other people to give you feedback.   **If you submit your mix, please take the time to listen and comment on some other submissions**, especially if they play a style of music you're interested in.  Thanks for your help in making these threads work well for everyone!\n\nThese threads are intended for beginning DJs who are honestly looking for feedback or critique on their technique, selection, transitions, etc.  If you are an established DJ who is just looking for more followers/listens on your new mix or have a podcast/radio show, please post it to a more appropriate place such as /r/mixes or a genre-specific subreddit.  Posts that appear to be purely promotional in nature may be removed at the moderators' discretion.  This subreddit is aimed at helping new DJs learn and is not the place to promote yourself!   \n\nGuidelines:\n\n* Please include the genre(s) of your mix.  This helps attract DJs/listeners of the same genre(s) who are likely to provide more useful feedback.  You might also include a title/length.\n* \\[Mixcloud\\]([http://www.mixcloud.com](http://www.mixcloud.com)) is the preferred place to post mixes.  It allows you to include your tracklist and transition times, allows unlimited uploads, and is generally more geared towards DJs.  If you don\u2019t want to use Mixcloud, be sure to include a tracklist.  \n* Please ask for specific feedback or list parts of the mix you liked/didn\u2019t like.  Hopefully you are looking for input on specific tracks or transitions. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Example post:**\n\n>\\[House / Tech House\\] djscsi - moving on up  (45 minute mix)  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>[http://www.mixcloud.com/djscsi/moving-on-up/](http://www.mixcloud.com/djscsi/moving-on-up/)  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>I\u2019ve been spinning for about a year, this is the third mix I\u2019ve recorded and I\u2019m hoping to get some house / tech-house DJs\u2019 opinions on my track selection and mixing.

I messed up a couple parts but I\u2019ve listened to the mix a few times and I think it sounds pretty good.   Does anyone think I used too much FX?

I'm honestly not that qualified to really give to much feedback, but one thing I will throw down, is to watch those low end blends and the ?Phase cancelling? that can work its way in there on longer transitions/blends. Personally, I've ended up setting a rule for myself to GTFO of the lowend quickly on the exiting track to avoid it all together! regardless I think I had as much fun watching that as you two did mixing/puzzling to it!\n\nMuch love - ZP",

        "score": 29,
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Beatmatch/comments/1dqqhoc/learn_from_my_bad_gig/",
        "content": "So I had a frustrating, poor gig last night at a club I've played at before, and I'm a supposedly reasonably adaptable techno DJ, so I'm embarrassed...but I thought I'd share and maybe help someone out for the future. I've been DJing forever (since 1998) but on Pioneer since sometime in 2020. Vinyl and Traktor before that.\n\nThe club has really nice gear, a Pioneer A9, 2 CDJ 3000s (8 hotcues) and one Pioneer CDJ 2000 (3 hotcues). I am pretty sure the A9 is new since I played there last, because I've only played on that mixer once before (recently) at another club. Before that it was a DJM 900 NSX2. I did study the manual before that last gig, but I guess I should have studied it more.\n\nI initially had some trouble beatmatching, and then finding the booth monitor volume knob, which, when I finally found it, revealed that the booth monitors were not in fact on. Club staff ran around while I was playing getting those hooked up; they weren't even wired. Somehow, I didn't realize it during the sound check. During the sound check even without the monitors, I played with everything and it all worked fine. No troubles beatmatching, looping worked great, transitions smooth, no problems. I didn't even notice that they weren't on until we were open.\n\nDuring the set, none of it worked. Firstly, I was still having trouble beatmatching even when the monitors were turned on, and sometimes even with sync. I had checked quantize as always, and I *thought* that because it was illuminated, that it was on. However, on the CDJ 3000, it needs to be *brightly* illuminated to be on. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0fWhen I touched it and really turned it on, well that fixed that.\n\nLooping was a disaster and I had to abandon it entirely. Somehow during my sound check or the other DJs who were setting up their hybrid stuff, we must have changed the Hot Cue Auto Load settings and/or other settings such that two things changed: a) when I set a 4 or 8 or whatever beat loop, it only demarcated the loop, rather than actually starting the loop playing. I had to hit play to start the loop and then, because I was working on all 3 decks, I had trouble exiting the loop at the right time to ensure the downbeat was where I wanted it in the mix. I am just used to setting the loop and having it run immediately, and then hot cueing out of it at the right time. Furthermore, I couldn't just hot cue out of it because the hot cue auto load settings were changed, and when I hit a hot cue, it auto *loaded a* *completely different track* than the one that was playing. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0fI am new to this particular feature, so it blindsided me and I didn't know how to turn it off or change it mid-set. On reflection, I suppose simply loading my own USB settings on to the CDJ might have fixed it? Anyone?\n\nSo despite my excited plans for my 3rd public set with 3 decks and lots of looping and effects, I retreated to what I know, just standard 2-deck mixing without loops and using the other CDJ 3000 and the older CDJ with just 3 hot cues. Yeah fine. I'm not happy with how it went and how many mistakes I made, but I have learned a thing or two for next time: LOAD SETTINGS for sure. Reload them if things go wacky? (Can you do that mid-set? I've never had to before). Ensure booth monitors work properly. Turn Quantize actually on, sigh.\n\nI'm still not sure about the loops being demarcated but on pause instead of actually starting when I hit the 4 or 8 loop buttons (or used the touchscreen to set a loop). What setting is that?\n\nOne thing I've noticed, in Amsterdam anyway, the gear is always changing in the clubs. I enjoy learning it all and being adaptable, but I'm apparently falling behind. No need to call me out on what I *should* have known as a supposedly experienced DJ, I feel bad enough as it is. But if you have any further helpful suggestions for next time I'm very receptive.",

            "Main thing that comes to mind is when doing your sound check or new gear do a full go on everything. Booth monitors, cues, matching, loops, anything youd use and make sure it matches your preferences. You never know what settings will be enabled or how other djs were using it. Its rough but it definitely happens sometimes",
