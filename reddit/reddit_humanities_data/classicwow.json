            "As someone who had a week of family vacation this is a huge dub",
            "I don't really care about dmf but those valour changes are amazing. No longer will alts be perma behind for no reason. Now you can grind out the valour whenever you want instead of getting punished for going on holiday for a week.",
            "This is good.  Now I dont have to get my cap in every week.  Some freedom",
            "I think this is a W.",
            "Classic Prog players get treated too well by our devs. Wrath was all W changes and Cata is already off to a good start with this stuff.",
            "I started from fresh at launch and had a week of holiday with family, but currently 77 and delighted I now have the opportunity to catch up! This all helps remove the natural feeling of FOMO too",
            "I am so fucking happy. I bought my deck a few days ago without realize the next one wasn't until july",
            "Can someone explain that valor cap thing? I missed a week of it already does that mean i get to free farm valor each week now?"

            "This community demands the devs jump through so many hoops to maintain the WB meta in a version of the game where players already have such an insane amount of character power.\n\nAt this point, just make WB's permanently active. Give everyone several epic items worth of free, unearned stats. That really fits the vanilla formula.",
            "The biggest problem with world buffs imo theyre fun while you have them and if you die you literally lose the will to do the rest of the raid. Make them at least last through death.",
            "Leaning harder into world buffs is the dumbest design idea, never change sod devs lmao",
            "Cutting gameplay, changing chronoboon. Doing anything except addressing the wbs themselves.",
            "You realise this is great for holding onto wbs for multiple lockouts rebooning after bosses. This is a great change",
            "Devs are absolutely killing it with a lot of these changes recently. Raid lockouts, chronoboon displacer and a lot of the balancing stuff.",
            "Just remove world buffs already. The \"fun community-driven\" world buffs of classic has died off and is just a mire of toxicity now, and it might reign in the ridiculously overtuned character power.\n\nThen we can finally start having stable class balance that doesn't revolve around compensating for having or not having world buffs, and people might stop being whiny over every losing their buffs.",
            "World buffs suck. We have done it enough",
            "Nope, just remove world buffs in raids.  Problem solved."

            "I want world buffs gone for different reasons. I hate that my entire night of parsing goes out the window the second the raid wipes.",
            "The worst part of classic was getting world buffs. Remove them for raids or make the boons raid wide so only a few people have to get the and you can put them back on after a wipe. It was the bigger chore for the every day gamer to get all the buffs required.",
            "Yes. I have better use of my time than walking around the world.",
            "Yes - so much yes",
            "yeah I would rather like if they were instead strong buffs in the world at even longer durations so you could get them for solo play instead if you so wish",
            "Yea ! Leave those for classic era",
            "Yes, I do. One wipe and there goes your parsing. Plus it's annoying having to go get them all.",

            "It is too late either way. The class balance is done with world buffs in mind so maybe next season."

            "This is perfect! Extra content on the quick and ez bosses, dont need to parse twice a week on the single boss encounters anyways.",
            "Sooo Great! And I also really like the dragons cand be done twice, i like this much more than the 3 day lockout, because with this lockout system you always had to watch which day is reset",
            "Wish they'd remove wbs too",
