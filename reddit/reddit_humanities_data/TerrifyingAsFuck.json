        "content": "Hi everyone, we would like remind everyone that this is not a political subreddit. r/TerrifyingAsFuck is not a place to discuss or argue about politics, spread your political views, blame or praise political parties or individual politicians, etc.\n\nWe understand that the US presidential elections are coming and that several other countries also have their elections this year. We also understand that some of you find actions or words of certain politicians or parties terrifying. However, this subreddit is not the place to talk about these topics. Please focus on terrifying people (not politicians), animals, natural disasters, true crimes, historical moments, military conflicts, etc. instead.\n\nFor political discussions, we recommend to visit some of the many subreddits dedicated to politics (like r/PoliticalDebate) or to individual countries (check their rules to see whether they allow political topics).\n\nThank you for understanding.",
