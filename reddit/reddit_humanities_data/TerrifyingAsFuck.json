We also understand that some of you find actions or words of certain politicians or parties terrifying. However, this subreddit is not the place to talk about these topics. Please focus on terrifying people (not politicians), animals, natural disasters, true crimes, historical moments, military conflicts, etc. instead.\n\nFor political discussions, we recommend to visit some of the many subreddits dedicated to politics (like r/PoliticalDebate) or to individual countries (check their rules to see whether they allow political topics).\n\nThank you for understanding.",

            "Maybe a lineman can chime in, but I this has something to do with having too much load on the distribution side. \n\nThis is dangerous shit. Stuff like this is the reason my electrician apprenticeship was only three years and I said \"fuck this!\" We did commercial hot work all the time, and I watched a journeyman blow a hole in his hand with 277 by grabbing a bx he thought was dead. I watched another journeyman burn his face off in a 480 panel because he was adjusting wires, and one got caught on a threaded screw coming through the back of the panel.\n\nThe last straw for me was working in a drop ceiling, and a hot stranded wire fell out of a red wire nut and hit an ac duct, and copper splattered on my face and burned into my glasses. I peaced out after that.\n\nEDIT: Gee, thanks for the enlightening comments about working unsafe. Also, it shows you know nothing about the industry. There are plenty of reasons you can't just shut everything down. You can't just shut down the lighting in a 24hr plant to change out light fixtures. That's just one example, so get off your stupid soap box. I was simply discussing my experience and expressing how dangerous it can be.\n\nAnd to the Europeans that made it illegal, that's great, but this is in the US.",
