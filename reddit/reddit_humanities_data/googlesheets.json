I'm designing a crochet shirt/pattern made with argyle pattern and want to make a calculation estimating how many diamonds shape is needed. I want the formatting to be that others can just enter their data (such as the diamond length and width and the length and width of the shirt they want to create) and then they already have an estimate.\n\nDoes anyone have an idea how to format this?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vmb8i541yh9d1.png?width=692&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b4946ad6c03006a0ed9001ac994d7e588ef7158\n\n",

            "You would just use known diamond amounts and known height/width if those known amounts. Then use basic math  to find unknown diamond amounts based on known height/width.\n\nThis would be to attempt to include the variable of border size and possible other variables.\n\nOr you can simply do math\n\n```\nArea of diamond = height x width\n\nArea of shirt = height x circumference\n\nNumber of diamonds = Area of shirt  Area of diamond\n```",

For example, when I show the closing price for SPY for the last 27 days using the following command:\n\n>=TRANSPOSE(GOOGLEFINANCE(\"NYSEARCA:SPY\",\"close\",TODAY()-27,TODAY(),\"DAILY\"))\n\nThe data shows up in Google Sheets like this (not all columns are included in this screenshot):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ej4s8b460j9d1.png?width=633&format=png&auto=webp&s=68141ff09c2b71900609b35bc898611d67add80a\n\nI would just like the data given in the \"Close\" row to show up, not the Date data. Is there a workaround for this?",
