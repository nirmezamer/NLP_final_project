This isn't anything new.\n\nThe models of the people you see there are just photoshopped form the left image. You can see the textures on their clothing. The technique to see through walls is nowhere near as precise enough to give you this and the data will be a heat map, not sharp, textured images.\n\nAlso \"pose estimation\" is a technical term that refers to finding the position and orientation of the camera or objects in the scene. This is a separate algorithm from imaging itself. The supposedly generated images aren't pose data, they're just the raw images (which could be used to estimating poses using a separate pipeline). This makes the whole talk sound like pseudoscience babbel.\n\nThere's some real science and imaging techniques here but this talk is misleading.",
