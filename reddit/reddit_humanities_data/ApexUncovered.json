            "There was a bug back in season 7 I think it was, where you could still punch while you were in this screen since you were somewhere on the map, and you could actually punch and kill other players during the black screen while you were loading into the lobby. I did this just to see what would happen and I ended up knocking a guy before the game even started, saw where his downed body landed out of the drop ship, followed him and finished him.\n\nThinking back, I feel really bad and it was a horrible thing to do since he could literally do nothing about it. But it was in the name of science. I still have the clip of it saved somewhere. But to answer your question, yeah, players are initially on the map before loading in.\n\nEdit: Someone asked for the clip so I sifted through years worth of hundreds of clips and found it. I had to upload it to my YouTube to get it off my PS4, but here it is. It's from June 2019, so it was in season 2. I was definitely way off when I said season 7. \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doexa62u75Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doexa62u75Y)",
            "Yes, players are in the map before the dropship. The start / end screens are also part of the map in all modes.",
            " Yea, I had this exact bug few seasons ago\nafaik your character teleports to the drophip when you jump out of it",
            "i\u2019ve had this bug several times this season, lol",
            "Yeah kinda, there's already player banners on the map displays and you can hear the audio and in tdm modes it used to goof up abit where ui can't catch up with whatever is going on",
            "I'd like that or the ALGS style drop ship on POI's.\nInstead of jump master and usual hit landing",
            "All good, just 1 time out of curiosity, remember this shit bug\u2026 suffered a lot",
            "Same thing happened to me. We all loaded on the ship that parked right next to the ring in Olympus, and I was one of the few people that could move.\n\nAnd then all hell broke loose when everyone was able to move! It was one of the craziest gaming moments I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nAnother crazy thing that happened to me in this game was finding at least 30 death boxes in the lab at Hydro Dam. Wish I could share the screenshot that I took back in 2019, But sadly I don\u2019t have it anymore. My PS4 just died out of nowhere for no reason a few months later",
