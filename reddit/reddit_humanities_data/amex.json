My input will be considered, but I trust their judgment.\n\n**Rule Tweaks:**  We're reviewing posting protocols and making minor rule adjustments.\n\n**Ban Durations:**  Current ban durations remain unchanged. 253 days for standard violations, 307 days for referral violations. Per the discretion of the Mod/Admin, they may impose a lower duration to send a \"wake up call\". \n\n**SUB Posts:**  We're discussing bringing back the 253-day ban or creating a dedicated thread for SUB posts.\n\n**Deception & Fraud Posts:** If we suspect that your post and or comment may be an attempt to defraud Amex or any other corporation, entity or individual- your post will be removed.

        "content": "After having both a vanilla and Charles Schwab (CS) version of the card honestly the CS is a no brainer for me. It makes the annual fee look not so much out of control (which I think it kind of is but still works for me) and everything just gets better if you have a point strategy system in place with other Amex cards.\n\nQuick example:\n\nWith the CS I get over 3.5x points on gas stations since I combine it with the Everyday Preferred (since I usually always get the 50% bonus increase) and over 1.5x points on any uncategorized purchases which is higher than any Amex points card.\n\nOf course this is assuming that you are considering getting a Platinum in the first place, that the annual works with your spending/finances and that you are not redeeming points for travel, gift cards or etc. In my opinion is a no brainer if you can get it since it gives you another exit route for point redemption when you just rather get the cash back for something else.
