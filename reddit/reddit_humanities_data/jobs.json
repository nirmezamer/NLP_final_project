            "I am currently heartbroken of where I am in life\u2026. I feel like such a failure for not knowing what I want to do with my career as a 31 y/o. I have a masters degree but I feel unhireable because I pigeonholed myself into this job which is grossly underpaid. My job is somewhat niche and I\u2019m having trouble making a career change. Just had an interview a couple weeks ago that went extremely well (or so I thought) but didn\u2019t even make it to the second interview. I feel like a fraud and my confidence in myself and my abilities is shot. I thought I came close a few times but to no avail.  I\u2019m still stuck here and idk if I see a light at the end of the tunnel. I\u2019ve been trying to carry on this week by continuing the job search but my mental health and determination is suffering.",
            "I'm tired boss.\n\nI know I'm in a bad place right now. Folks at my company say my department is where souls go to die. I've become the most senior person in less than a year due to everyone leaving, and I have photographic evidence of my director rooting around in folks things which means I also feel unsafe at work.\n\nI've applied and apparently the pay I am asking for is too high. I have 5 years of corporate experience but I guess over 70 k is too much despite getting a 75k offer years ago. I shoulda taken that offer tbh.\n\n\nI'm still applying. I want to give up so bad but I can't. I don't feel safe at work knowing I'm a target now that all my other coworkers have left. I don't feel safe bringing my medication into work. I'm overwhelmed. I want to take a day off, but I currently have to work every holiday. I am saving my PTO for an emergency like being let go, or to celebrate leaving the job by going on vacation for the first time in years. I wanna go on a cruise and sit on the beach in a tropical place. \n\nI'm frustrated because I know I'm a good employee. I work hard, my team loves me everywhere I have gone. Hell I even have my masters. Between working in accounting, project management, research, and more. I can do just about anything. At this point, I just want a comfortable safe job to work at so I can transition the time Ive spent applying to jobs into spending it ups killing myself by learning R or other things like python.",
            "I feel more hopeful this time around? I have four interviews this week and have started applying for more temp/seasonal positions (as well as a freelance job and internship) in things that interest me just for the hell of it. \n\nAnd I\u2019ve found a few federal jobs that I\u2019m hopeful about more than anything even just for the experience",
            "I've been applying and getting interviews, but I don't get called back. I've been to several interviews where I thought they went well, but I never hear from them again. I'm now desperately applying to retail, but no luck. My car just broke down so now I'm limited to where I can go. I feel like a failure because I have a stem degree, but can't even get a job in my field. Everyone always says go for stem, stem graduates always get jobs on here, but when I see that, I can feel myself sink deeper into despair. I can't get anywhere with my stem degree. Not even in retail. Now I don't even know if I still want to work in this field. I know my mind is fully clouded now, I don't know if it's just me who's failing, if it's the job market, or what.",
            "Not feeling so hot. Hearing back from jobs in my career field takes 3-6 months now, just to get rejected (if I hear anything back at all). Been getting rejections from retail positions despite having experience. Doordash isn't accepting new people in my area. McDonald's interview schedule is full.\n\nI always see folks recommend going for such \"survival\" positions when you're in a pinch... but it seems like everyone's struggling now, and everyone's got the same idea to pursue the same positions.\n\nI have an interview with Chipotle this week, so at least there's that. We'll see how it goes.",
            "I\u2019ve officially quit searching as of this morning. \n\nI only used indeed as the other known job search apps/sites were all a waste of time for various reasons and factors. \n\nI can\u2019t take a pay cut in terms of starting pay unless I want to sell my current vehicle with its payment and get a POS beater to drive everyday instead so I can be able to afford my car insurance and phone bill. My current job just *barely* gives me enough to cover those three things after taxes, insurance. \n\nNo job is willing to meet me on starting pay. I\u2019ve applied to 12 jobs in the last two months with four interviews and no hits. A lot of them are using AI software to weigh candidates and I\u2019m losing out to AI. I can\u2019t compete with it anymore nor can I keep rewriting my resume to beat it or fit the potential job better. \n\nI\u2019m working my current job until they fire me and then it\u2019s onto the next which will be Taco Bell or something. \n\nI\u2019m 30 btw.",
            "Had a good internship my last 2 semesters of school (software engineering). The plan was for me to continue with that company permanently (boss and boss's boss liked me) and the company had a round of layoffs. My position no longer existed, so when the internship ended I was let go.\n\nBeen searching for 6 months. I've done hundreds of online apps, had phone calls with about 10 recruiters, contacted my old university career center. Not a single interview. I got a job as a bike technician pretty easily but it just barely pays the bills and it's not what I want to do long term. Don't know what I'll do once my student loans start requiring payments in August, since I don't really make enough to pay those. On top of that, I'm so exhausted after work that I hardly have any energy to keep looking for jobs.\n\nWhat's so frustrating is I have the skills. I did well in school, have tech experience outside of school, did well in my internship, etc. I'm not the best engineer to walk the earth or anything, but I'd say I have at least an average resume. And I can't even get a return phone call.",
            "After searching for work since January, I got offered a position today. I should be happy, but I just can't be. In my previous position I was making $50 an hour, full benefits, a pension, but now I'll be making $26 an hour, medical only, and 30 hours a week. Effectively this makes me go from around 100k to 42k. Unemployment is running out in a couple weeks and I need to take this to have some sort of income. This is the only offer I've gotten and I only got it cause I worked with this person before   I should be happy but I just can't knowing what I lost. I feel defeated and worthless.",
            "Currently applying. Sending out lots of applications but not hearing much back.\n\nThankfully I know my resume is good. I have heard back from the likes of Facebook/Meta. I just think there's a lot of folks on the market.\n\nI struggled because my last interview, I got questions from the interviewer. And areas the recruiter was looking for that I was able to speak on. It turned out they didn't want that at all. \n\nI curse myself for believing my dad and getting into corporate. I absolutely feel resentful for it. My dad worked at the same company for years and was a happy little pawn. A cog in a wheel. He's been lucky and survived 3 or four rounds of layoffs \n\nI should have spoken to someone with a different experience than him. Someone who had been done dirty by the corporate world before deciding to go.\n\nI just want a new job. I'd love to work somewhere where I can take PTO and not worry about getting harassed when I'm back. I have a ton of days saved because I'm not confident in my team in being able to handle it, or able to trust leadership.",
            "I don't know what to do now, I am trying to apply for Aerospace/ Defense companies but all I am getting are rejection letters and even though I am a recent graduate of a Master's Degree in a related Aerospace field. Trying to get into the Space Sector but can work for Defense. Just been feeling defeated and hurt in that I want to go for my goals in life, and I can't because I am not given the opportunity to show them.\n\nAlso planning on returning to the university for Aerospace Engineering but still feel unsure of it because of the risks involved and me being more in debt then I am already in. I been working in retail for almost 16 years, and I am sick and tired of it and want to go for my passion but its been difficult to do so. I apply but then get a rejection letter all the time. I feel hopeless and am I a sore loser.\n\nI want to leave my current job but I feel trapped, my life is in limbo and my future is in crisis."

Multiply that by a few different temp agencies and I worked a few days a week and got paid weekly. I did anything from reception work, grading test papers,  being a booth attendant and random excel spreadsheet work through the temp agencies. \nI made it clear I was open to almost anything,  had no problem taking a taxi, getting a ride, or Uber etc and would answer ASAP if they called.\nAlso see if there's a labor ready or local equivalent near you as a last resort. Usually it's some sort of manual labor and they pay you that day.\nNone of these places will charge you for anything btw if anyone tries to its a scam, and as long as you have some sort of transportation you should be fine.\nI say the scam thing because there's a lot of scammy places that prey on desperate people who need work.",

Of fucking course the job listing had no information about the hours or times or pay or anything. Anyway they rang me and basically just asked me questions that everything I said was on my resume anyway. Basically they want me to work 4 hour shifts 3 days a week which would only be $180 a week. I dont even have a house so already 50 of that goes to my storage unit. Which leaves $130 a week :( And it would only be during the school term with no work during the school holidays.\n\n  \nAlso I already have a bad feeling about it because they were super rude on the phone and in the email they sent me after it said the interview will go for an hour which seems very long? They also said I would need to do alot of things including paying for my own childrens check ($80) police check ($50) First aid certificate ($220) cpr certificate ($50) Asthma course ($30) report children at risk certificate ($150) childcare certificate ($2500). So literally over $3000 for this job where I would be getting paid $180 a week which would take me over 17 school term weeks to even get that money back.\n\n  \nI'm thinking of just ghosting them and not showing up to the interview.
