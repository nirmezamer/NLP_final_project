She prefers to stay in a place with all women.\n\n**If anyone on here is looking for roommates or if you know anyone that rents out spaces for women, please dm me.**\n\nShe's quiet, introverted, an avid reader, anime fanatic and overall a very sweet girl.\n\nThe location can be anywhere on the red-line of the Dubai Metro, but it isn't so important. Anywhere with easy access to the metro in general while she looks for work, preferably on the red-line of the Dubai Metro.\n\nThank you so much and have a good one!"

Like hello not showing up for viewings is unethical? \n\nAnyways she didn\u2019t answer our questions and was extremely unprofessional and we just absolutely do not want to pay her a commission on this sale. We would like to purchase directly from the owner (which he is willing to do) so I just want to know is there any recourse for the agency? Please let us know thanks!",

This is the best way.\nIf you want the number just message me and I\u2019ll send you. \nAlso make sure the owner hasn\u2019t signed any exclusivity papers with the agent.
