She prefers to stay in a place with all women.\n\n**If anyone on here is looking for roommates or if you know anyone that rents out spaces for women, please dm me.**\n\nShe's quiet, introverted, an avid reader, anime fanatic and overall a very sweet girl.\n\nThe location can be anywhere on the red-line of the Dubai Metro, but it isn't so important. Anywhere with easy access to the metro in general while she looks for work, preferably on the red-line of the Dubai Metro.\n\nThank you so much and have a good one!",

            "I lived there for 8y and never bought a car\n My expenditure in taxis ,Uber, metro was almost equal if not less than owning a shitty car so I never bothered. I'd rather spend the money on other things and I get by just fine. However I did live in one of the central areas of Dubai where most things (that I felt like doing) were a Max of 10-15 mins taxi ride. If you're in the same situation no need for a car. If however you choose to live in a suburb it's different. It's a personal choice at the end of the day. Don't let anyone influence your perspective. Dubai is a very easy city with or without a car. Oh and it's worth noting that I used to share Ubers with a colleague who also lived in my area, it worked out really well for us.",
