            "Ok, I'm having issues finding it so I'll ask here. The websites for someone to date their own car iron and had been posted here. What one(s?) does everyone use? \n\nMight be good to add into the post also.",
            "I have been striping the seasoning off a number of pans, and each time I wash them they flash rust even if I rinse them off with cold water.\n\nI live in a really warm humid area, if that helps.\n\nWhat can I do to stop this from happening?\n\nEdit: the question.",
            "So this is my new cast iron fry pan and I'm getting a lot of black residue left on food. Can you please let me know how do I get rid of this residue?\n\nhttps://ibb.co/dLpgMVn",
            "Stupid question probably, but I just got my first cast iron skillet so please forgive me! When you say Crisco, do you mean Crisco-brand vegetable oil, or the shortening that comes in a tub?",
            "How is my post-cleaning routine: After cooking I wash with warm-hot water and scrub with a lodge bristle brush just enough to get any stuck on food off. Then I put on the burner on low heat to evaporate water, then once the water is all gone, I rub a small amount of safflower oil inside and out, and continue to heat until it just starts to smoke, then off the heat and done.",
            "Short question not really warranting its own topic, hope it's OK to just put it here. I recently got a secondhand lodge pan with a fantastic seasoning on the cooking surface, but the bottom is incredibly uneven, almost lumpy. There aren't any bare spots, but there are scattered buildups of seasoning, thick enough to cover the line going around the pan and in some areas even thicker. \n\nWhat would be the recommended way to remove the bottom seasoning without removing the cooking surface? I've scrubbed it a bunch with steel wool and that seems to help somewhat, is the answer just more elbow grease? Would it hurt to just leave it there (I don't really care about appearance)?",
            "I got a new lodge for my birthday, I saw online that I need to season it before I use it. Can I use your seasoning process or do I need to do it some other way? I saw that the FAQ says 'bare iron' and I figure that means iron that has been stripped, right? Or would a brand new pan be considered bare iron? Thank you!",
            "I\u2019m planning on getting my first cast iron tomorrow but my biggest fear is that when I season it I\u2019ll set off my fire alarms (I live in school dorm so I really don\u2019t want to be the first person to set it off). How smoky is it going to be when I season it for the first time/in the future?",
            "Why does all my food stick so badly? Even with a fresh seasoning, meats get so stuck they rip apart.  Is there a guide on how to actually COOK with cast iron, instead of just how to take care of it before/after? Like, is there a certain heat setting it needs, or a certain amount of oil, etc? Technique? What the hell am I doing wrong?"
