            "Ok, I'm having issues finding it so I'll ask here. The websites for someone to date their own car iron and had been posted here. What one(s?) does everyone use? \n\nMight be good to add into the post also.",
            "Stupid question probably, but I just got my first cast iron skillet so please forgive me! When you say Crisco, do you mean Crisco-brand vegetable oil, or the shortening that comes in a tub?",
            "Short question not really warranting its own topic, hope it's OK to just put it here. I recently got a secondhand lodge pan with a fantastic seasoning on the cooking surface, but the bottom is incredibly uneven, almost lumpy. There aren't any bare spots, but there are scattered buildups of seasoning, thick enough to cover the line going around the pan and in some areas even thicker. \n\nWhat would be the recommended way to remove the bottom seasoning without removing the cooking surface? I've scrubbed it a bunch with steel wool and that seems to help somewhat, is the answer just more elbow grease? Would it hurt to just leave it there (I don't really care about appearance)?",
            "I got a new lodge for my birthday, I saw online that I need to season it before I use it. Can I use your seasoning process or do I need to do it some other way? I saw that the FAQ says 'bare iron' and I figure that means iron that has been stripped, right? Or would a brand new pan be considered bare iron? Thank you!",
            "Im planning on getting my first cast iron tomorrow but my biggest fear is that when I season it Ill set off my fire alarms (I live in school dorm so I really dont want to be the first person to set it off). How smoky is it going to be when I season it for the first time/in the future?",
            "Why does all my food stick so badly? Even with a fresh seasoning, meats get so stuck they rip apart.  Is there a guide on how to actually COOK with cast iron, instead of just how to take care of it before/after? Like, is there a certain heat setting it needs, or a certain amount of oil, etc? Technique? What the hell am I doing wrong?",
            "What's a good brand to get in the UK? When I was back in the US I got my pans from Lodge (which I can get in the UK but it's more than double the price), so I'm looking for British recommendations.",
            "So whenever I use vegetable oil or sunflower oil, olive oil, avocado oil, any other kind of oil, food always seems to grab the pan too much. Although when I add butter on top of absolutely any oil, its perfectly non stick and any food unsticks beautifully. \nMy question is: why?",
            "Please recommend me a skillet to get started, preferably from Amazon. Also need a cookware set, but idk. Moving out of my parents in a few days.",

            "Like you say yourself, it takes longer to clean, and for that extra effort you are getting less of a surface area sear. It may look pretty, but to me that is not enough of a reason to go through extra effort cleaning it.",

            "Enameled grill pans are easier to clean than raw cast iron grill pans and I still gave away my Staub",
            "People get so weird about these things! Its a tool. This isnt about grill marks or the weird obsession with searing, the ridges raise the food a bit so that its not sitting in the liquid it gives off or frying in oil in the pan. Thats all! Its a great tool for a job that a lot of folks apparently dont need, not some weird scam designed to offend you",
            "Full surface sear > than mini line sear, as far as flavor/maillard reaction.  \n\nPlus that pan sucks to clean.",
            "I dont want to yuck someone else's yum, but since you asked: I'd rather use a grill to get grill marks, because then you get the actual benefits of grilling (like the charcoal/smokey flavours, the maillard browning from flames touching the meat, and the easy cleanup). I'd rather use a flat pan to get the actual benefits of pan searing, like increased surface area to develope a crust (more maillard browning), easy basting with a spoon to finish with butter and herbs, and pan sauces by adding broth or something to the fond and gently lifting it with a spatula. I feel like this pan only gives the superficial benefit of a grill and all the drawbacks, and all the drawbacks of a flat pan (often to an even greater degree), but with all the benefits either gone or greatly deminished. But the grill marks do look pretty!",
            "Hey! I have wanted a grill for years but do not have one due to circumstances. I have a cast iron with grill lines and I use it multiple times a week and its highly effective. Its also not even that hard to clean I think the people who dont like them dont use them.",
