            "It depends on the size of the company. If it\u2019s a huge multinational you are probably okay to pay it and get reimbursed. If it\u2019s a company you never heard of before you saw the job advertised I would ask them to make the booking.",
            "It is very normal, however as other have said GET IT IN WRITING. This too, is normal and they should see no issue with the request. However, if asking that causes an issue, or they refuse, run and don't look back.",

Then send everything over as soon as it\u2019s booked and ask for confirmation of reimbursement. Flights can generally be refunded within 24 hrs so if they give a weird answer then you have some room to change your mind.",
            "It\u2019s fairly normal in white collar high 5 or 6 fig jobs where money isn\u2019t typically an issue, and it\u2019s more about seeing if you are responsible and a good fit.\n\nIf you\u2019re broke, just be honest about it and if they like you they\u2019ll cover it. I\u2019d never work for a company that forces someone to fly out to them if they don\u2019t have the means, but claiming to take them seriously as a potential employee on their last interview.",
            "I had an out of state interview and had the same reimbursement arrangement and it worked out. I was paid after submitting my receipt. We actually parted ways 3 weeks after I was hired and they still reimbursed me. I'd make sure it was in writing though.",
            "Say you cannot afford to front the bill. Then they will either pay for it or not hire you.",
            "I would expect that they would book and pay for the airfare upfront and you'd pay for the hotel, car rental, meals, which you would then have them reimburse. \n\nAsking you to book the airfare is a bit suspicious. However, if it's a large company with a formalized HR/TA department, you're probably fine.",
            "This was pretty much the norm everywhere before covid.",
            "This is quite normal. Get things in writing and keep all of your receipts. They will give you the forms to fill out and instructions on what you need to do."

            "By collecting them. Desensitization is a good way to deal with rejection sensitivity. Instead of treating rejection like it\u2019s something to be avoided, start intentionally trying to achieve a certain number of rejections. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re trying to get an internship, maybe you decide you want to try and get a dozen rejections. That\u2019s twelve chances to work on your applications. Twelve re-writes that help you get better at cover letters and resumes. Twelve potential interviews to practice with. Job search is a skill like any other, the more you do it, the better you get at it. \n\nBesides, it\u2019s a numbers game. The more you put out, the more likely you are to strike gold. Setting a goal of a dozen rejections means you need to apply to at least a dozen internships, probably more. Which is possibly more than you\u2019d apply for if you didn\u2019t set that goal."
