The money was amazing and I was successful at one point of my career but the past 2 years it\u2019s been literally killing me and I\u2019m no longer passionate for my business anymore. All I have is a high school diploma and I\u2019m not looking to do anything in the beauty world anymore. I basically want something completely opposite like manual labor and a job that\u2019s not heavy in the social aspect. I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about car detailing. I\u2019m not opposed to going back to school I just would still need something to help me get by. I\u2019d love to hear some more suggestions and/or advice. ",

I teach too, and it takes 5 days of training for a person to be able to work on their own projects with the basic skills mastered.\n\nIt's just an example of job you can learn and start pretty quickly with modest investment (not more than 1k) even if it seems complicated from outside.",

Getting an Enrolled Agent cert can get you in the door for places like HR block. It's boring as hell but it's stable and employable.\n\nYou can also go back to school.

It took me 4 years to do what a full time student would do in 2 years but I also didn\u2019t go into any debt and kept most of my lifestyle. \n\nManual labor sounds great but sucks as you get older. Car detailing is flooded market and tough on the body. \n\nIf you want to work with your hands I wish I became an electrician. Again great hands on job for 5-10 years then you become a master electrician and can start your own company with your own apprentices doing the grunt work while you supervise.",
