            "I'd be somewhat interested to know what exactly was the phrase in bible.\n\nLike you'd think if there was an eclipse during the crucifixation of Jesus that would be shown more in Jesus media. I'd imagine people could think that would mean more and it would be easier to turn people Christian, so why omit it?",
            "It wouldn't be appropriation of a pagan holiday, it'd follow the Jewish Passover/Pesach. The last supper took place during this week.",
            "Its certainly is an interesting theory, but the amount of evidence that this is when Jesus was crucified is as about as much as he being crucified on Easter. all the Gospels were written many years after Jesuss death and they couldve certainly used the evocative imagery of the eclipse from their memory and conflicted the dates from whenever it happened",
            "As sick as that sounds, the romans did have a perfectly good understanding of what a solar eclipse was and how to predict them. So I dont think they were that spooked.",
            "Appropiation of pagan holidays?? It's dated that way because It happened in the JEWISH festivity of fucking PASSOVER",
            "That passage also states that it was dark for hours. Eclipses dont last si long.",
            "So solar eclipses were actually well known in the past, to the point we've been predicting them for over 2500 years, dating back at minimum to Ancient Greece. To Romans, solar eclipses being predictable would be as normal as it is to us today.",
            "What if the eclipse actually happened on a different day than the crucifixion and the writers of the bible were just like \"wouldn't it be cool if those things had happened at the same time?\", and then just retconned the crucifixion",
            "I mean, it could have been clouds too",
            "could have been just a huge storm\n\nI saw one of those IRL. it was like 11am and it was raining so hard, it was darker than at night (since at nigh there's streetlights but at 11am there were no streetlights)."

Even if you only have 1 follower, that can reach someone.",

            "I still have no idea how this site actually works lol",
            "I think that may just stem from a very different approach to how people use Tumblr. If they're like me, Tumblr is mainly a place to view content rather than share it, so reblogging doesn't make much sense except as a way to comment cause it's unlikely a tiny blog with only a handful of followers is gonna spread that post all that far.\n\nI mainly just reblog so I can post it later on Reddit.",
