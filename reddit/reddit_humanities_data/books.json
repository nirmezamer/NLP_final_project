            "Ireland was on the fringes of Europe during the \"dark ages\". This insulated them somewhat from a lot of the political and social turmoil of that period, as a bit of a backwater. As a result, there were a lot of literaturr and learning retained in Ireland, more so than elsewhere. Coming out of that period, they had a much higher literacy rate, and a whole network of interconnected centers of learning and document preservation (monasteries and such). There's an interesting book on this topic called ***How The Irish Saved Civilization*** (full title: *How the Irish Saved Civilization: The Untold Story of Ireland's Heroic Role from the Fall of Rome to the Rise of Medieval Europe).* During the early middle ages \"Irish\" was nearly synonymous with scholar in much of Europe. These were the guys who could read, and actually had read most of the great works of ancient literature (since in many cases the only surviving copies were in Ireland), they knew poetry and myths from all over, etc.\n\nCombined with a long cultural tradition of story telling and history reciting (bards were highly honored and had a role in the Brehon legal system of Gaelic Ireland... hell, one of the national symbols of Ireland is a bardic harp) you end up with a culture with a lot of literate people who grew up hearing amazing ancient tales that entertained and taught life lessons and dictated morals, etc etc. Add in a few dozen generations of oppression and alcoholism, and you've got the perfect recipe for a great literary tradition. Top it all with a horrific famine that killed over 1/8 of the population, and sent another 3/8 of the population all around the world in a famine-fleeing diaspora, and we **all** get to enjoy their literary talents. (Crazy note... the famine reduced the populaiton of Ireland by nearly HALF, and it has only almost *nearly* recovered to its pre-famine population TODAY, in the 21st century, nearly 200 years later)",
            "Storytelling and poetry have always been a huge part of Irish culture, so much so that in ancient Ireland the societal status of poets was almost on a par with royalty. \n\nIn more recent times, the country invests in its writers. We have organisations like the Arts Council, the Irish Writers Centre, Poetry Ireland etc that provide bursaries and other funding and training. There\u2019s quite a few presses of varying sizes and specialties. Many literary festivals. Lots of journals and magazines. Irish people like reading and they like reading work by Irish writers.",

            "Honestly, I don\u2019t think it is. It\u2019s just \u201cnot England/America\u201d so whenever you hear about a popular or talented Irish writer it stands out more to you. There are like a dozen or two canonical Irish writers I can name off the top of my head, but there are also probably hundreds of English and American writers just as highly regarded.",
            "So leaving aside some of the more nebulous things like history of storytelling (other cultures also had this), gift of the gab (we can talk a lot) and the i flu fence of the Irish language.  They matter but it is is difficult to quantify why.  \n\nGood education with really literacy rates, there was even a culture of valuing education by large parts of the country, this has been going for decades. \n\nLarge amounts of Irish emigrating and retaining cultural connections played a part.  Writers need readers so having access to markets to sell their work to helped.  \n\nSpeaking English also helped in my opinion in recent times, it gave all writers a direct market in the US, UK and elsewhere, with most the direct need for translation.  Lots might disagree with that opinion.  \n\nThere was some moves by Irish governments to promote the value of artist work.  One government made income from artistic work tax free up to a certain amount (but it was so difficult to do, it needed to claimed back and a bureaucratic nightmare). Token gesture but it was still something.",

There's no actual spoilers, so I won't put a spoiler tag:\n\n>We sit opposite one another, Kat and I, two soldiers in shabby coats, cooking a goose in the middle of the night. We don't talk much, but I believe we have a more complete communion with one another than even lovers have.\n\n>We are two men, two minute sparks of life; outside is the night and the circle of death. We sit on the edge of it crouching in danger, the grease drips from our hands, in our hearts we are close to one another, and the hour is like the room: flecked over with the lights and shadows of our feelings cast by a quiet fire. What does he know of me or I of him? formerly we should not have had a single thought in common--now we sit with a goose between us and feel in unison, are so intimate that we do not even speak.\n\nAnd further, in the same scene:\n\n>In a half sleep I watch Kat dip and raise the ladle. I love him, his shoulders, his angular, stooping figure-and at the same time I see behind him woods and stars, and a clear voice utters words that bring me peace, to me, a soldier in big boots, belt, and knapsack, taking the road that lies before him under the high heaven, quickly forgetting and seldom sorrowful, for ever pressing on under the wide night sky.\n\nAnd my favorite paragraph:\n\n>Is my face wet, and where am I? Kat stands before me, his gigantic, stooping shadow falls upon me, like home. He speaks gently, he smiles and goes back to the fire.\n\n>Then he says: \"It's done.\"\n\nI'm sorry, but I know it's meant to say how intimate bond appears between brothers in arms, especially in a place as hopeless as the front, and Paul does say later that he feels more at home in the front than where his parents are. But if \"his gigantic, stooping shadow falls upon me, like home,\" isn't the most romantic thing I'd ever read, I don't know what is. The way the novel is structured makes Kat the most important figure next to Paul, and if you look at it from a queer context, it's even much more powerful.\n\nI'm probably reaching, and I wouldn't at all be surprised if the author didn't intend for there to be any subtext at all, but it's just another aspect from the novel that left me breathless, whether romantic or not.\n\nEdit: I didn't mean it meant 'less' if it was comradery and friendship, I meant it meant more powerful to me, specifically. Either way, it's still such a highly romantic and lyrical prose. An amazing read. ",

            "I don't think you are reaching, to see it in a queer context.  But I do think you are looking at it with the eyes of a 21st century person.   \n\n(emotional) Intimacy amongst men is something that we should not brand as \"queer\", in my opinion.  That contributes to the homophobic elements of toxic masculinity.  That a man who *loves* another man is automatically suspect.   Instead we should praise male friendships as healthy and normal.  Because they are--or at least they should be.  \n\nNow if after cooking the goose they stripped down and had a shag by the fireside, then we'd have something to talk about.   \n\nBut it, like you said, to me just shows the bond of men who have gone through the most terrible and harrowing things imaginable together.  The trauma bond so common among soldiers.",
            "Why does it mean \"more\" in a queer context? Why can't intimacy between two men not be beautiful without them being sexually attracted to each other? I'm not even against queer readings of most books, but this is a beautiful example of heterosexual intimacy and I think making it queer actually makes it lose value.",

Read it now once every year and I\u2019m turning 29 this year.\n\n\u201cThey are more to me than life, these voices, they are more than motherliness and more than fear; they are the strongest, most comforting thing there is anywhere: they are the voices of my comrades.\u201d",

I always thought the chapter or two about them being naked in the river to try and meet some women and have some bread and cold cuts was funny when you realize they are at most 20 years old.\n\nEdit: they are kids fighting in trenches.",
            "I feel bad for everyone who can't read the original. I can't really put it in words but this book has some of the most beautiful, innocent prose, even though German is usually a rather clunky language. The translation does not do it justice, unfortunately.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nYou can really feel how vulnerable (and happy) he is in this moment. His love is unspoken. It is a silent confession of a man who has lost himself, who is nothing but a soldier. Just for one moment he is allowed to be a man with emotions.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\"A little soldier and a clear voice, and if anyone\u00a0were to caress him he would hardly understand, this soldier with the big boots and the shut\u00a0heart, who marches because he is wearing big\u00a0boots, and has forgotten all else but marching.\"\n\n\nThis is not meant to be queer at all, obviously. This goes beyond attraction. He loves him for who he is, in this moment, for what he represents. This is love between soldiers, not gay lovers. People have been trying to twist this special relationship between men ever since the Epic of Gilgamesh.",
            "I get no sort of queer romance undertones from the passages, although I suppose I can see where you're coming from, I feel going that far is a stretch. I think Remarque is certainly showing the closer than brother bond that forms between people on the front lines and in dire situations like that though and it is indeed some of the most beautiful and impactful writing in literature. It's one of my very favorite books and you've certainly selected some really great passages.",

My son just graduated high school and he and the one teammate that had played with him since they were 12 hugged and cried a little and then just sat next to each other in silence for quite some time after their last game. It's just shared struggles and experiences that create lifelong bonds. That's it.",
            "I\u2019ve had an old copy of that book for a decade, and I still haven\u2019t opened it to read it. That passage is so beautiful, I think it might be time to read it this year."
