        "content": "Welcome to our weekly recommendation thread!  A few years ago now the mod team decided to condense the many \"suggest some books\" threads into one big mega-thread, in order to consolidate the subreddit and diversify the front page a little.  Since then, we have removed suggestion threads and directed their posters to this thread instead.  This tradition continues, so let's jump right in!\n\n**The Rules**\n\n* Every comment in reply to this self-post must be a request for suggestions.\n\n* All suggestions made in this thread must be direct replies to other people's requests. Do not post suggestions in reply to this self-post.\n\n* All unrelated comments will be deleted in the interest of cleanliness.\n\n____\n\n**How to get the best recommendations**\n\nThe most successful recommendation requests include a description of the kind of book being sought.  This might be a particular kind of protagonist, setting, plot, atmosphere, theme, or subject matter.  You may be looking for something similar to another book (or film, TV show, game, etc), and examples are great!  Just be sure to explain *what* you liked about them too.  Other helpful things to think about are genre, length and reading level.\n\n____\n\nAll Weekly Recommendation Threads are linked below the header throughout the week to guarantee that this thread remains active day-to-day.  For those bursting with books that you are hungry to suggest, we've set the suggested sort to new; you may need to set this manually if your app or settings ignores suggested sort.\n\nIf this thread has not slaked your desire for tasty book suggestions, we propose that you head on over to the aptly named subreddit /r/suggestmeabook.\n               \n- The Management",

            "Any good introductory books to Carl Jung / psychoanalysis / archetypes?",
            "Looking for horror novels written by women with women protagonists that are MESSY. Bonus points if the plot includes cannibalism or is gay (or both. especially both). Just finished The Eyes are the Best Part by Monika Kim and LOVED IT so would love things with similar vibes.",
            "Hello there, does anyone here have recommendations for translated (or not!) Japanese literature? I read the Japanese original text of 'Kitchen' by Banana Yoshimoto for my Japanese A Level exams and loved it. Do you guys have any other books you like by her?",
            "Looking for a fiction where the main character leaves the christian faith near the beginning, and the book is about life after",
            "I'm looking for a book with the same narrative style as Fantasticland. Where each chapter is being narrated by a different character and we are able to see the events happening in different perspectives.",
            "Hello, I'm more interested in how a book made you feel than a specific genre. Anywhere for autobiographies, cult classics, fiction, fantasy, romance, history, etc. I would love for you to suggest the book that changed your perspective on life in an impactful but indirect way (if that makes sense). \n\nFor example, The Mist of Avalon gave me so much to think about and enjoy. It was an Arthurian legend told from the point of view of Morgaine, a priestess and Arthur's sister. The story was about her journey before, during, and after Arthur's reign and how women played a role during that time. It was one of the first books I ever read of an aggreges length. I read that book back in high school and although I can't tell you much about the story, I can relay to you how it affected me. Do y'all have a book like that?",
            "Looking for cozy fantasy manga. I finished Savior's Book Cafe in Another World recently and desperately need these vibes back. It feels too soon to reread that Savior's Book Cafe yet though lol.",
            "I love romance!! Any romantic book suggestions?",
            "Looking for anything horror, sci fi or dystopian that really gets you feeling uneasy and stuck in your head after finishing it."

That is the scariest thing to me.\n\nIf you've read it or know about the case, what do you think of the Kansas Police? Did they do enough to catch this serial killer? Do they deserve all the flack they get? I don't think they did because they had the foresight to refuse to analyze, and thus waste, decades old DNA on archaic technology that might have failed to find the man who they were looking for. A man who continued to get away with his crimes and managed to kill several dogs, and almost start an entirely new crime spree.",

            "Chernobyl Prayer (or Voices From Chernobyl: The Oral History Of A Nuclear Disaster) by Svetlana Alexievich is one of the most compelling, horrifying, strangely poetic books I've ever read. She worked for years collecting testimonies so we could bear witness to the experiences that were being covered up. Residents, sanitation crew, first responders. An unbearable amount of love and sacrifice in a collection of stories so filled with horrors and anger. Incredible. \n\nSeven Fallen Feathers by Tanya Talaga is one that I had to put down many times because I was crying so much-- the stories of seven Indigenous teens who were found dead over the course of a decade (starting 2000)  in Thunder Bay, Ontario, where they had been sent to attend high school far from their families. It's an investigation and contextualizing of structural racism against Indigenous people in Canada, the broken school system, the apathy and incompetence of police, and the severity of inherited trauma in communities that can't heal because they're still being abused by the government. I get so intensely angry thinking about part of it. Every Canadian needs to read this book.",
            "The Radium Girls by Kate Moore was infuriating. What those women suffered was horrific in the extreme and the refusal of the factory owners to take responsibility was mind boggling. On a larger scale, it demonstrated massive dangers of unregulated capitalism, a lesson that is particularly apt what with the SCOTUS ruling yesterday.",
            "*American Predator* by Maureen Callahan\n\nIt detailed all of the known murders of Israel Keyes. What was so troubling to me was his completely random selection of victims and his method of planning. He would bury kits in the woods and store the GPS location months, sometimes years in advance and then if he happened to be passing through an area with a kit he would commit a murder and then leave town.",
