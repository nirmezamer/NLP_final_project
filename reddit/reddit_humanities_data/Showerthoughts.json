        "content": "Hello again, folks!\n\nLast week, we [asked for your input](https://redd.it/1djiftx) on how to improve /r/Showerthoughts. There were quite a few great answers, and a handful of requests were repeated several times over. Those requests were as follows:\n \n\\- Make it easier to post      \n\\- Cut down on karma-farming     \n\\- Require higher-quality posts      \n\\- Allow a greater variety of posts\n\nAs you may have noticed, half of these requests seem to contradict the other half: If it's easier to post, or if we allow a greater variety of posts, there will be more karma-farming and a greater number of low-quality submissions by default. On the other hand, if every post is required to be a high-quality and unique showerthought, the amount karma-farming will certainly be reduced, but the difficulty of posting will only increase.\n\nStill, where there's a will, there's a way... and we think that we\u2019ve come up with one.\n\n**/r/Showerthoughts will soon feature four different post-types.**\n\nThese will be as follows:\n\n------\n\n**Showerthoughts** will be what they always were (or were supposed to be)\u2014 miniature epiphanies that make the mundane more amazing. They'll be original, they'll be unique, they'll be of exceptional quality, and they'll be exemplars of the subreddit.\n\n**Musings** will be very similar to showerthoughts, but they'll only need to be original, not unique. Basically, if you came up with a high-quality thought by yourself, you'll be able to post it, and it won't matter if a similar thought was expressed by a user of a niche forum in 1993. You'll still need to proofread your musings and ensure that they're rule-abiding, but you won't have to worry if each one is the very first of its kind.\n\n**Speculations** will be \"What if?\" premises, contemplations of things that can't be verified or falsified (like \"How does Tobias F\u00fcnke poop?\"), and thoughts on events that are *probable* but not necessarily true *yet* (like \"As AI-generated videos get better, people will almost certainly use them for next-level catfishing.\"). Speculations will still need to be thought-provoking, interesting, and likely to prompt discussion \u2013 we won't accept \"I might see a sparrow today,\" for instance \u2013 but those of you who asked for questions and \"I wonder...\" statements to be allowed will have a place for them now.\n\n**Casual thoughts** will be posts that feature original but more-common conclusions, including those thoughts that currently get removed as \"personal perspectives.\" As long as a given thought was offered with a modicum of effort and isn't in our list of done-to-death submissions (which we'll discuss in a moment), it will be allowed. This variety of post is going to be experimental, so expect it to be adjusted as time goes on.\n\n------\n\n**The Flair-System**\n\nWhen creating a new post in /r/Showerthoughts, users will select one of the above-listed flairs, then receive a prompt which encourages them to read the rules. After they've responded to that prompt, the user's post will be approved. **There will be no more question-tree**, and there will be no more \"You have violated some vaguely defined portion of the rules.\" Ideally, folks will have a much easier time understanding how and what they should be posting, and posting itself will be a smoother process.\n\nFollowing from that, something else which was suggested was a limit on the number of posts that any one individual can offer. We're going to give that a try, starting with allowing **one post per person per seventy-two-hour period**. (Only posts will have a limit, though, not comments.) Like other things, this rule may end up getting adjusted, and we'll be watching to see how it affects the community.\n\nFinally \u2013 and as alluded to in the \"casual thoughts\" section \u2013 quite a few people expressed frustration with the number of low-effort, done-to-death, and low-quality posts and comments in the community. In order to cut down on those, **we'll be condensing our fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth rules into one catch-all rule**, and we'll be explicitly forbidding certain posts (like \"The brain named itself\") and post-formats (like \"X was Y years ago\"). Comments like those that should be silent votes (such as \"Great post!\" or \"LOL, upvoted!\") will also be forbidden, partially because they add a lot of disruptive noise, and partially because they're often offered by spammers.\n\n------\n\nThere will be a few other (smaller) changes made, too, but most of those will happen behind the scenes... and besides, this announcement is already long enough that most people will have started skimming by now. If you're one of the few individuals who is reading every word, respond to this post by discussing the virtues of having radioactive lobsters run the subreddit. The rest of this paragraph will obscure that suggestion. **Watch for future announcements as we work on details, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you see something that might require our attention.**\n\nThe rollout will take place over the next few days, but for now, let us just say this:\n\n**Welcome to /r/Showerthoughts 2.0!**\n\nWe're pleased to have you here... and happy thinking!",

            "To be fair, I skimmed, then I saw comments about radioactive lobsters, and went back looking for that. So I guess it worked. Good job there.",
            "These proposals sound promising. Let's see how they pan out. If it makes it worse that will be the time to introduce the lobsters, although how easily can they type?",
            "Why does there need to be such an unusual amount of control over content? It's just Reddit. \n\nI've tried to post and been repeatedly declined for the most anal reasons possible, and I'm just not going to even attempt to post from now on. It's no fun when you have to obey a million rules.",
            "Just a thank you to the mods who give their time to make reddit one of the last enjoyable social media options.\n\nBut no lobsters, it is all about Maryland crabs in my small world. BTW  Italians can send extras across the Atlantic!",
            "Would these lobsters need some kind of lobster-to-English translation device, and if so, could this be the one positive use of generative AI?",
            "Nice to see a moderating group that is actively listening to its community and trying to make changes for the better. I hope this works out. (And I really hope it helps avoid the dozens of infinite universes means infinite X! posts.)\n\nJust how radioactive of lobsters are we talking here? Banana radioactive or Chernobyl radioactive? Maybe neutron star? Boy, that would be kinda terrifying. Though I wonder if that would make for an interesting dinner. Say, if the mods end up going the way of Louis XVI, can we have a boil?",
            "I, for one, wholeheartedly accept our radioactive lobster overlords.",
            "I think radioactive lobsters have the potential to bring on new, innovative perspectives that us mortals cannot imagine, thus resulting in more novel shower thoughts. I nominate Larry the Lobster as our new overlord.\n\nI like this structure by the way.",
