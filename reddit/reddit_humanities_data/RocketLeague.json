        "content": "Hey r/RocketLeague! We're excited to announce that we are opening the subreddit's first **chat channels** this Friday. These chatrooms will allow our members to interact with each other in a more fluid manner than with a regular comments thread. You can find them in the \"Chats\" tab on mobile, or through the Chats icon in the top-right corner on PC. To help you out for now, I'll link them at the end of this post!\n\n\n\nAs an experimental feature on the subreddit, we will only open two channels for a trial period of two weeks: a **general channel** suitable for all RLated discussions and questions, and an **LFG channel** to help you find the perfect teammate. Our chats are limited in scope and for more options we recommend the official Discord server. Still, we wanted to give the RL reddit community an easy way to communicate together.\n\n\n\nPlease note that all of our Subreddit Guidelines apply in the chat channels as well. Violating any of our guidelines will result in an immediate ban from the chat channels, and may result in punishment subreddit wide.\n\n\n\nWe're eager to chat with so many of you, so don't hesitate and come take a look at them! \ud83d\udc33 \n\n# [Join the rocket-league chat](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/s/sTL7QtCSiv)\n\n# [Join the looking-for-group chat](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/s/CM02VqEXxY)",

            "It\u2019s a strange one. It looks like you pinched the ball with opponent so maybe the game saw your touch wasn\u2019t enough to save it and the opponent pushed it outward off your car at the same time. It looks like you should have got a save though.",
            "Then you clear a ball that's clearly hitting the side wall and you get a save for it",
            "Looks like it might have crossbred out if you didn't get it as well",
            "Opponent hit the ball at the same time as u so it canceled. \n\nFor a save to happen, the attacker must first have a shot and a player from the defending team must hit the ball away from the net without the help of an attacker.",
            "better question is why is your car gold if you're on the blue team \ud83e\udd28",
            "The definition of a shot, in hockey, is if the attacking team would score if the goalie didn\u2019t block it. \n\nIn rocket league, who fuckin\u2019 knows.",
            "I realised this in hoops, the game detects that the ball could hit the goal area and it doesnt count the goalpost in it. If you change the trajectory from that, you get a save :)",
            "Velocity and trajectory of the shot and the redirect",
            "I cannot begin to tell you how many saves I've gotten in hoops that didn't count. Like the ball was literally half way in net and I get it out for it to nor count. Truly insane.",
            "Yeah, there's this glitch where if you save the ball at the same time or just after your opponent hits it, no save is awarded. I think the issue is that the calculation resets and doesn't have to time register the new touch as on target, which therefore doesn't give you credit for deflecting it."
