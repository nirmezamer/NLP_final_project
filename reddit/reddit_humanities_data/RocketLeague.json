To me the value is what you think their worth to yourself and I think holding onto the for a while might be the best option. The game is still being played and I think if it shuts down or if you wait for some of the kids who are playing it now to grow up and might value these more later than say what the current market thinks about them. That being said I would only post them for about 20% more than what you paid for them. Only cuz you do have to pay a sort of premium for getting them all at once. \n\nBut honestly put them in a box and put that box in your basement. Forget about them for about 5 years then pull them out. Collectors by that point might be more interested in them as stock will have most likely ceased to exist in stores and you might set off some nostalgia buyers when they see them then.",
