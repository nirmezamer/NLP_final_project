Plus hes taking most of the army out in one punch with the nuclear gravity fission punch or a serious punch(could SJW survive a hit from either attacks?). I know end series SJW is mostly at infinite mana. But these would be massive chunks of mana he would be losing. And Garou never runs out of energy and would keep scaling much quicker than SJW and would adapt all of SJW abilities.",
