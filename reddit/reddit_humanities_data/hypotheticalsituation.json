        "content": "Hi everyone. We've added a few new moderators and have introduced new rules. I apologize for how slow this has been, but I have been fairly busy. That's not much or an excuse, but life comes ahead of a subreddit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe at r/hypotheticalsituation have noticed a large amount of posts have a focus on monetary incentives. While this is not inherently a bad thing, the sheer \\*amount\\* of posts of this nature brings a certain level of attention that cannot be ignored. We have also heard from several users about their feelings regarding money posts, so we want to get your opinions in the form of this poll as well as your comments. The poll will last for 3 days.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe want to be clear: We are not simply going to blindly follow the majority. We want the community to speak. We are thankful to all of you that are active members and those that simply read posts. Please, in the comments feel free to give your thoughts.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1dq6loh)",

            "Money posts are fine. I think it's just a way of saying \"would thing X bother/benefit you THIS much\"",
            "I'll give you $1 bazillion to leave the thread exactly as is, except please filter out the jokers who are clearly trolling and wasting space.\u00a0 Example: $10 billion, but you have to have a full body massage 3 days in a row\u00a0",
            "Some of the money posts are interesting from a morality point of view, but the majority of them have a certain samey-sameness to them. \n\nFor the record, the ones that offer X amount per day if you do ~some specific task~ that you can't miss (the ones where you have to decide in advance how many days) are interesting thought experiments. Sure, money is involved, but it takes some thought and self-awareness instead of just Y/N answers.",
            "I agree with the others that filtering out some of the simpler and repetitive ones would be fine, but please don't become hyper exclusive, because some other subreddits are like that and it really sucks the fun out of it. All I mean is with some of them they're like way overboard on rules, and if people fear that their posts are going to not even make it it'll mean less interaction.\nThanks for all you do! btw",
            "I personally hate more the ones mocking them with dumb premises than the actual ones, every day yo might have 3 about the money and 6 compaining about them or making ridiculous ones to show how dumb they are, those are the ones that shouldn\u00b4t be allowed honestly",
            "I voted for option four. Money questions are fine, but it would be nice to have more creative posts. Maybe they don\u2019t have to be one day a week, though.",
            "Yeah, we're trying to filter that kind of stuff that's just \"mild inconvenience for unfathomable wealth plus scarlett johansson sucks you off.\" If people report it, we get notified. No reports means we would have to constantly check new to see if someone posts like that, which I just... don't want to do because I have a life to live.",
            "Nice, for the record I love this thread and appreciate you all",
            "I mean, it's a lot better when someone does an equivalent exchange kind of post. But money as the incentive is nice, easy to understand, easy to exchange to your local currency if you're not in the U.S. It's a good metric. \n\nThe part that makes it silly is when the benefit so obviously outweighs their proposal. Would you be mildly uncomfortable for a few hours per month for fabulous wealth and prizes? Well yes. Yes I would. As would 99% of respondents and the discussion bears that out. \n\nLast week there was one, I got my highest upvote rating ever for calling it out. Over a thousand upvotes for telling the poster that his hypothetical was *a* >!*handjob* !<*rather than a monkey's paw*. That speaks more to the state of things than just \"money issues bad\" if you ask me. Which you did, hence this post.",
            "While they are typically extremely stupid, the concept itself isn\u2019t bad. We just need people to ask better questions related to this.\n\nInstead of \u201c$100 for a finger\u201d, ask \u201cWhat is the bare minimum you\u2019d sell a finger for?\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t simply say \u201c$100 a day for walking 10 kilometers\u201d, also add \u201chow long could you keep this up?\u201d because there is no reason not to take the offer, even if you fail on the first day.\n\nIt would help nice if people got a suggestion or a post that tells them how to write better questions to reduce the amount of stupid questions"

As part of the deal you are also not allowed to wear any special underwear or pants to absorb the farts\n\nThese farts happen approximately every 5 mins and are supremely stinky. No doctor or medicine can fix this and apart from the farting itself you have no health issues. You also don't have any discomfort or bloating from the farts.
