        "content": "I have had these on the underside of my penis for as long as I can remember. They appear as small, superficial nodules. Some of them can be popped while some cannot. They never go away. Those that can be popped will gradually refill over a couple of weeks. I tried to keep the lens as reasonably close to my skin as I could, I did not want to be obscene. Sorry if the camerawork isn\u2019t the greatest. It is not easy to hold the camera with one hand and pop with the other. It also doesn\u2019t help that the skin in this area is so mobile. I hope you all enjoy the video. I really am sorry that I could not film a different body area. I understand that male genitals can be very off putting for some. ",

            "Given the nature of what you\u2019re filming, this is the least offputting way to do it. Credit where credit is due \u2013 this isn\u2019t obscene.\n\nNot saying you would want to do this since the skin is so sensitive, but I wonder if a chemical exfoliant (like AHA/BHA) would clear out the spots and keep them clear.",

            "I get these! Most people do at some point. They're enlarged oil glands. They can happen anywhere, but they're easier to see/squeeze on hairless skin like the lips and genitals. I also get them on my breasts close to my nipples.",
            "Thank you for being vulnerable and sharing this! I never knew these existed, so this is fascinating.  I guess I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s considered an oily area, or if delays in cleaning after intercourse or even using lotion or lubricant during m@sterb@tion could cause these pores to clog?   (I\u2019m in no way putting OP down\u2026 I\u2019m just wondering about these!)",
            "My best friend and brother has these too. They were scared that it was an STD or something and were freaking out lol I might be wrong but the bumps are related to hair follicles or something similar.",
            "Fwiw, the degree of detail that\u2019s shown is vague enough to not be specifically genitalia, you did a respectful job filming the pops without OMG D***.  And there have been scrotal cyst posts/ labial pops using the nsfw filtering and warnings.  I think the crowd in this subreddit, posters and readers, tend to treat genitalia respectfully.  Thank you for the pops.",
            "Sincerely love how this sub is normalising the human body. It's almost refreshing.",
            "I never knew what these were! I have some on my beanbag, had them checked for STD and was clear, Dr said it was completely normal.",
            "I get these on my boobs (I\u2019m female) I wondered what they were! Thanks for showing me I\u2019m not alone!"

The rest of the brown spots you see are called seborrheic keratosis (You can read more about them here: [https://dermnetnz.org/topics/seborrhoeic-keratosis)](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=comments&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbWluejJ5S0pEM3ZlYnJ2UEo2T2RxUU5Md0s2QXxBQ3Jtc0tsUDhwYWlobjA3UUZlQ3ZoYVNidzVvbDNkTGprWHVQNEk3elpjQkh3YnBrYmZocDBsakxhMFpuRmtyb0poaGgxWkJiSFlZU19tZW5JTmVuVzBsY2FTTjJJZ2VKYmhTVU9vYS1ybUlXY01yN2ppeHUwMA&q=https%3A%2F%2Fdermnetnz.org%2Ftopics%2Fseborrhoeic-keratosis%29). These are benign growths that people develop over time, and a significant portion of my elderly patients have numerous of them on their back similar to what you see here.
