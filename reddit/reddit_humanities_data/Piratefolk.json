            "This chapter was so all over the place visually (the panel to panel storytelling has regressed to terminal levels) but somehow felt more enjoyable than the sludge weve been getting recently. Any time in this terrible arc that Oda has actually let the straw hats be active and engage physically in whats going on, everything just *feels* better",
            "Bonney using armament further convinces me that Robin not knowing haki is the dumbest thing in the entire series",
            "Is it me or has the eye popping gag become way more frequent than it should be?",
            "Bonney's powerup wasn't as OP as some feared, and the Robot actually did something and seems to have some interesting lore both in-universe and outside considering the etymology and possible mythological references of the name Emeth. Chapter felt better and more satisfying than the previous couple, as did the pacing. Even though it was a short chapter again.\n\nWe even got a little bit of crew vs outsiders -dynamic humour with Luffy/Sanji/Franky and Bonney! Haven't seen much of that barely with so much going on. I hope this arc wraps up quickly and that the start of Elbaf would be a little slower so we could get some more crew interaction again!",
            "not ass not peak , in between",
            "How long is Oda going to milk the Vegapunk yapping broadcast? Its pretty clear by now that he wont reveal anything new to the readers.",
            "The panel of them punching Luffy to send the bird flying broke my heart. Convoluted, messy, and the end result is worthless.\nOh we can't actually fight them so let's just launch them away. Gorosei are frauds.",
            "Soooo are we just gonna ignore Franky potentially having Haki?",
            "Feels a lot better than past chapters, I really liked the conversation with Kaku and Stussy. Outside of that my issue of Luffy being God doesn't look like it's changing anytime soon so I'm still dreading Elbaf.",
            "the giants getting heart eyes for bonnika feels really gross. i get that it's supposed to be adoration but like come on"

            "very obvious , hope one of his nakama almost dies( cause oda can't kill) , and he finally becomes serious in a fight",
            "i do like the aspect of gear 5 of him turning the floor and anything he touches into rubber. i think all that stuff is fun. Just too many looney toons gags for me personally",
            "Gear 5 should have been the seriousness of gear 4 but the ability to turn everything rubbery like current gear 5 does\n\nWell never have a serious fight unless he uses G4",
            "I am ok with the Nika stuff and at the time is was hype, however this Bonney being nika and forgetting about her father and all trauma and suddenly knowing how to use the fruits abilities is bullshit",
            "Nah I like the goofy Gear 5. But when he used it against Lucci, it already felt cheapened. Now hes spamming it against Kizaru and the Gorosei. Personally I wouldve had the conditions be the exact same as with the Kaido fight. Luffy has to die in order for Nika to awaken. Should only be brought in extreme circumstances as a lifeline. Thats when he can turn the tide of battle with a morale boost, fighting happy and whatever. As for everything before though, Gear 2 to Gear 4, he has to take these fights seriously.",

            "Nah, Nika would be awesome if Oda turned down the glazing, eye-popping, and had more energy like the anime added to the Luffy v Lucci fight. It's clear Nika came from Oda's ass since there is 0 mention of it before Wano.",
            "I couldn't care any less about all of this Joyboy/Nika/chosen one prophecy shit. If all the answers to the mysteries I've been waiting for over 15 years are just related to Nika then I'm gonna be so disappointed.",

The fact youre even able to stand on Zeus at all does indicate he is made of the same material as cloud islands, not like normal irl clouds",
