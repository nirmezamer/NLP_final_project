            "Kidd fans watching the giant robot appear to get one shot and fall into the sea only to get a second wind and keep fighting\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o673q96ls49d1.jpeg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=915875ba7336b4a859296fa89cf14e1d16b46b90",
            "This chapter was so all over the place visually (the panel to panel storytelling has regressed to terminal levels) but somehow felt more enjoyable than the sludge we\u2019ve been getting recently. Any time in this terrible arc that Oda has actually let the straw hats be active and engage physically in what\u2019s going on, everything just *feels* better",
            "Bonney using armament further convinces me that Robin not knowing haki is the dumbest thing in the entire series",
            "The Robot did something??\n\nLETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!\n\nOnly thing we\u2019re missing is Gear Green.",
            "Is it me or has the eye popping gag become way more frequent than it should be?",
            "A definite improvement over the last few chapters. It's a bit annoying Oda spent so much time with the robot going back and forth between \"it's doing something\", \"it's doing nothing\", \"it's getting beaten\", \"it comes back\", but that is not really this chapter's fault. Getting at least a bit of lore for the robot is cool too.\n\nThe rest is pretty mid for the most part tbh. Combo attack to launch Mars away was okay, standard Oda fluff. Franky getting to contribute was cool (though I am not looking forward to the inevitable \"does Franky have haki?\" debates that are bound to follow).\n\nThere is also more plot development in this chapter than the previous Stall Piece chapters, stuff happening with Seraphim, Atlas, and Vegapunk's message. Speaking of, this chapter made it blatantly obvious that \"cutting off\" the message was really just about Oda wanting to skip one particular lore drop because he wants to blueball the readers for longer lmao",
            "Bonney's powerup wasn't as OP as some feared, and the Robot actually did something and seems to have some interesting lore both in-universe and outside considering the etymology and possible mythological references of the name Emeth. Chapter felt better and more satisfying than the previous couple, as did the pacing. Even though it was a short chapter again.\n\nWe even got a little bit of crew vs outsiders -dynamic humour with Luffy/Sanji/Franky and Bonney! Haven't seen much of that barely with so much going on. I hope this arc wraps up quickly and that the start of Elbaf would be a little slower so we could get some more crew interaction again!",
            "... it just hurts so much seeing everyone call Luffy \"Nika\" now... it just further solidifies how much I hate the direction the series is going now.\n\n  \nand idk... is it me or is the art really declining?  It just looks so much more rough than it used to.\n\nHaving said that  \nYAY, robot did something.  \n\nOkay Joyboy's words here make me wonder if Joyboy knew he was going to lose and his last words to Emeth were \"When the time is at hand and I return, fucking... do something this time...\" or something like that, idk.",
            "not ass not peak , in between",
            "I would say it is better than the last few chapters simply because stuff actually happens, even though the stuff that happens feels kinda random und suprising in a bad way.\n\nLike what was the point of having Boney turn into Nika for a combination attack only.  \nAlso it feels like the power/threat of the Gorosei randomly changes each week."

            "I really don't like the goofy eyeball gear 5 stuff. It was funny when we first saw it during kaido fight but now it is a stale gag. It's like Oda is telling the same joke over and over. Look, Isn't gear 5 so wacky and silly!",
            "I get what he's trying to do, have Luffy be a \"no matter how grim everything looks he's not worried\" kind of symbol, but fuck me does he fail badly.\n\nIt should be more like Goku or All Might, who are always excited and smiling respectively, making the other characters feel hope. Luffy laughing and being goofy every goddamn time is counterproductive because it starts feeling like he's making fun of the characters for feeling worried or sad or whatever",
            "this is not just\u00a0 unfunny it's straight up weird and demented, like seeing someone trying to peekaboo a baby a few times but then they just don't stop",
            "I really enjoyed Gear 5 when it first showed up, it was a nice change of pace of an ultimate form being more silly instead of *grr me angy* but it's really getting stale now\n\nIt definitely should be used more sparingly or at least use different gags",
            "Oda's decline is so unfortunate. Pre-timeskip was a masterpiece. Pre Wano was a drag but acceptable. Wano fell extremely flat. And now Nika Piece threatens to ruin the series.",
            "I wouldn't care if the eye thing was done every once in a while, but it gets boring when you have it in every chapter several times.\nChanging up the gags would be way better, or switching with the old one piece eye pop-out every so often"

            "TL:DR No content moderation will change. Rule was now made explicit, examples did not clearly convey the spirit of the rule.\n\nFor those of you who care or not we added a new mod to the team. We\u2019ve grown by over 10k users since the last person was added to the team and are still looking to add to the team, particularly from the eastern time zones.\n\nWriting rules isn\u2019t easy, I know when I wrote rules for this sub a lot of people complained they were vague or didn\u2019t make sense, it took me a couple tries to get it right. Feedback is important and I\u2019m glad we are getting some.\n\nI\u2019ve rewritten the rule in a way that I believes more accurately conveys what we are trying to get ride of. We always removed degenerate things and used the reason \u201cdon\u2019t be weird as fuck\u201d but never had an explicit rule against it. Maybe the examples weren\u2019t the best but I think we can all agree this shouldn\u2019t be a porn lite sub.\n\nNow for the conspiracy theories / fringe political opinions. If you see the attached photo this is what we are talking about. This shouldn\u2019t apply to 99.9% of the people that post here. If you believe joyboy is based on Hitler you\u2019re not welcome here.\n\nI\u2019m going to ( unfortunately ) be spending some time next week in the airport and during my layover I plan to rewrite the rules so the spirit of them stays the same but there are less and easier to understand. If you catch any typos feel free to roast me and I\u2019ll give you a custom flair.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nrs4zmqdrd9d1.jpeg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=55fffe653597c2c65943f43536d2bcb6e7aefbee",
