We do not allow solicitation or material offers.\n\nThis means OPs cannot hint at or ask for money, and community members cannot offer money or food. There are local services that can verify and address a person's situation better than any of us can (and many services will not turn people away if they are asking for it). A kind community member offered a scammer a job and that is okay.\n\nThis community is read by millions of people, and scammers around the world know this. We have cultivated an empathic community so we know it can be hard to resist offering material help. It takes only one person to make it worth it because it costs nothing to post. That is why the rules are strictly enforced.\n\nThere are many signs of a scammer. They will present a financially desperate situation often with a highly emotional component. They are likely to mention payment services. They may have payment services in their Reddit profile and ask people to look at their profile. They will ask people to privately message them. All of these behaviors may be obfuscated with weird spacing and other ways to evade detection. If they evade detection it's up to the community to report it. Do not call out OPs, report only.\n\nThank you for your cooperation.",

        "content": "Throwaway account for privacy.\n\n  \nThis happened during the height of the pandemic. \n\nMy girlfriend (29F) and I (29M) have been dating for 11 years before she died from Covid. She got sick somewhere around March of 2020 and was brought to an ICU of a hospital in our city. They quarantined me for about 2 weeks since we were living together, but quickly found out that I didn't have the virus. However, I was not allowed to see or visit her at the hospital. We kept contact through sending memes and doing videocalls, and everytime we did, she would tell me that's she's gonna get better and that we're eventually gonna get through this nightmare. I had high hopes, but through the weeks, I could see the virus taking its toll on her. The doctors were kind enough to keep me informed about her wellbeing the entire time.\n\nAbout 3 months in, I was finally allowed to visit her. She has noticeably lost weight, had a rather hard time breathing, and could barely eat the food I brought her. Despite these, I still saw her excitement upon finally seeing me, though we were not allowed to take off our masks, nor make physical contact of any kind. When I left the room, one of her doctors talked to me and told me that her situation was dire, and it was unlikely for her to make a recovery. More weeks went on like that.\n\nEventually, the same doctor told me that she had about a few weeks left at best; seeing her in that state, I knew there were no two ways about it. During her final days, I asked the attending nurse if I could please just give her a hug; she was dying for fuck's sake. Of course, I was denied that request. I cannot stress enough how much I hated it in that room, sitting across a transparent film and watching my girlfriend deteriorate in front of me. Just seeing her breathe in irregular intervals was enough to break me. I know it's very selfish, but I hate that hospital for not allowing me to hug her or give her a kiss. It would've given both of us some sort of solace in that very difficult situation. I couldn't even attend her funeral out of grief. I also stopped talking to everyone for a long time after her death.\n\nIt's been four years since this happened, but it still hurts just as much, especially when I play the guitar she gave me on my birthday. I understand that what they did was a preventative measure to stop the virus from spreading; it's for this reason that I have not told anyone about this (out of fear of being seen as selfish).",

            "Literally no amounts of Im so sorry this happened to you will make you feel better, but know that I am. I also know that even though there were barriers, she was not alone in her last days because of your dedication. I hope to be even half as good a partner as you.",
            "The pandemic was a shit show and so awful. So many nurses as well have ptsd over it. I'm so sorry you had to endure that.",

I put her in a wheel chair and took her down stairs to say goodbye to her grandkids , I was handcuffed by the cops after this in front of everyone at the hospital entrance but didn't care . she got to say goodbye to them . they let me go after a reasonable Dr intervened on my behalf , but what utter nonsense.",
            "I know this doesn't make it better but as an ER nurse that worked the entire pandemic we hate everything that happened. We hated watching people say goodbye to their loved ones over Ipads. We hated telling families over the phone that their loved ones passed and they can't even see the body. We hated having to be the ones that held people hands as they took their dying breaths (I never let anyone die alone but it felt so wrong knowing they had loved ones who wanted to be there). If we could go back would we of done things differently idk. Everything about the pandemic was unknown/unprecedented in this generation, we fully thought that the things we were doing keeping people safe. I am so so so very sorry that you didn't get your last good bye, I am sorry that we robbed people of the physical touch of their loved ones. This has turned into my own \"off my chest\".

None of his family was allowed to visit him and to top it off, that whole side of the family are Covid-deniers and antivaxxers.  When the death certificate came back with cause of death due to Covid complications the whole family questioned it and asked my hubby who is a biologist (and I am a former funeral director ) what does this mean???   None of them understood how a healthy elderly man just died since Covid wasnt real.  They stopped talking to us when we answered them that it meant he died from Covid and we ended up not bothering with the funeral.    Im so sorry your girlfriend passed, especially like that. It really does suck, but your hospital wasnt the only one keeping family away.",

        "content": "I work out of the country and had been gone for seven months when everything happened. My wife and I had been married for 4 years, and I thought things were going well. We had our ups and downs like any couple, but I never imagined it would come to this.\n\n\n\nWhile I was away, my wife started an emotional affair with a guy she met at the gym. They exchanged a lot of texts and sexts, but according to her, nothing physical ever happened. She admitted that she enjoyed the attention and kept teasing him, but she swore she never crossed the line into physical cheating.\n\n\n\nThen, one night, she went out with a couple of friends along with the guy. She told me he drugged her and sexually assaulted her. She confessed everything to me after she found out she was pregnant over the phone and I had to rush back home. She told me she didn't want to go to the police because she was scared and didn't want to deal with the legal process. I don't believe her. There was enough in her texts to him to see she wanted something physical and there was flirty texts between them after the supposed incident happened as well. Instead, she wants to be focused on the pregnancy and wanted to keep the baby. She told me that she saw the baby as a blessing, a way to start fresh, and that she wanted us to raise it together.\n\n\n\nI was furious. I told her there was no way I was going to raise another man's child, especially one conceived under such circumstances. I felt like I was being punished for something I had no control over. We argued heavily, and I ended up starting the divorce process. I couldn't see any way to move past the affair and the fact that she wanted to keep the baby.\n\n\n\nAnd it gets more shit for me as every single one of my friends turned on me. They all said I was horrible for leaving her while she was going through something so traumatic. They said I should be supporting her and that I was being selfish. I don't care. She was cheating on me before the \"assault\" happened. I consider emotional cheating just as bad as physical cheating, and I couldn't see myself staying with her after everything that happened.\n\n\n\nIts been 6 months and she's been constantly trying to contact me, begging me to come back and talk things through. I refuse to speak with her directly and only respond through my lawyer, which causes her additional issues. The court ordered paternity test has already confirmed that I am not the father. I fucking hate how it takes a year here for divorce to be finalized. I also know it sounds harsh, but I need to protect myself. I'm already going to have to pay her alimony since I make more than her, but at least I won't have to pay child support for a kid that's not mine.\n\n\n\nEverything sucks right now. I feel betrayed by the person I thought I could trust the most, and I feel abandoned by my friends who can't understand my perspective. I don't have family I can talk to. I just feel angry over everything. I'm not looking for sympathy or validation; I just needed to vent.",
