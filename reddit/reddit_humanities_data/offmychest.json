We do not allow solicitation or material offers.\n\nThis means OPs cannot hint at or ask for money, and community members cannot offer money or food. There are local services that can verify and address a person's situation better than any of us can (and many services will not turn people away if they are asking for it). A kind community member offered a scammer a job and that is okay.\n\nThis community is read by millions of people, and scammers around the world know this. We have cultivated an empathic community so we know it can be hard to resist offering material help. It takes only one person to make it worth it because it costs nothing to post. That is why the rules are strictly enforced.\n\nThere are many signs of a scammer. They will present a financially desperate situation often with a highly emotional component. They are likely to mention payment services. They may have payment services in their Reddit profile and ask people to look at their profile. They will ask people to privately message them. All of these behaviors may be obfuscated with weird spacing and other ways to evade detection. If they evade detection it's up to the community to report it. Do not call out OPs, report only.\n\nThank you for your cooperation.",

But ever since my sister has developed an eating disorder, I feel a lot of pressure in also restricting my diet. It's so exhausting .. I don't know how to just \"accept\" that she is pretty, and will be prettier than me.

I also became smart (have two Science UG degrees and halfway through a PG med degree). \n\nI also want to say that asymmetry is much more interesting than symmetry IMO. The little quirks are what makes you stand out and what I find beautiful.\n\nCultivate your self-confidence, work on your personality, and your kindness and your empathy. These are the things that people are going to notice about you and these are the things that are going to make you even more beautiful in someone\u2019s eyes.",

        "content": "My 40ish year old sister lived in a city bordering a US state with her 2 children and once deported husband. One day she fell ill and had to be transported to the hospital where she was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia and was in the ICU for about a little over a month in critical condition. This was early 2021 in the midst of pandemic restrictions. \n\nShe then is in remission and discharged and begins to receive treatment at a cancer facility in the US, so she and her 2 kids (who are finishing up the school year online) began living at our parents\u2019 house in the US to get her treatment meanwhile her husband was to stay in his home country. Because traveling and chemo were so hard on her body, long trips were not possible so over the course of these 10 months their communication was pretty much limited to over the phone.\n\nFollowing a failed bone marrow transplant and relapse after relapse, she made the decision to not continue chemotherapy and let the cancer take its course and passed just shy of Christmas of 2021. She made us promise that no matter what, we would always put her children first.\n\nBy the end of February we find out that her husband was dating and wanted to introduce his girlfriend to their children. Now, I am aware that people grieve differently and it\u2019s possible he just moved on a long time ago blah blah blah but my sister had a feeling that during the middle of all of this that he was cheating on her (emotionally at least) which turned out to be true. His new GF was an old high school flame who tried time and time again to come between them during the almost 20 years of their marriage. But alas, it is his business what he does with his life. \n\nNow what IS our business: about a month after her passing, he completely abandoned his children both emotionally and financially. One of the kids was about to begin college and the other was still in high school and he just cut off all support and pretty much all communication to dedicate his time to his new family (the lady has 2 children who he boasts about on social media). His biological children receive absolutely no financial help from him (in fact he has asked THEM for money) and rarely, MAYBE twice a year reaches out to them. He hasn\u2019t wished them a happy birthday this past year as we\u2019ve just recently come to find out. \n\nI absolutely HATE him. It is an absolute DREADFUL weight to carry but this just feels like a betrayal to not only my sister but their kids, ESPECIALLY their kids. I know it is impossible to force him to be a father but all that\u2019s left to say is what the hell?! When she was alive, honestly, he seemed like the perfect husband and father. I know that I shouldn\u2019t \u201cforgive for him but for my peace of mind\u201d but how the hell do you even go about beginning to forgive something like this?!",

It takes a hard, hard heart to just decide your own children don't matter anymore, especially when you're the only parent those kids have left.  That's going to bite him later, when he's older and finds he needs them.  Those kids are going to turn their backs on him and tell him to go ask his new family for that mess.\n\nForgiveness?  Sometimes that's not the best route.  Sometimes the best route is to scream your rage into the void, rant about the unfairness of it all, cry about it...Then pick yourself up and do what you need to do to help the situation.  You can't control those kids' father, but you can control your reaction to him.  But you can't control it until you first deal with it.  It's apparent to me you're still grieving, both for your sister and for the terrible situation thanks to your sister's ex.  And once you deal with those feelings, you're going to find that you just don't care about him.  And your niece and nephew need their family.  If their dad isn't man enough to do it, then family needs to step up to do it.   It doesn't have to be money, sometimes just the emotional support, just the knowing you aren't going to abandon them the way their dad did, is what they desperately need.\n\nSo yeah, go ahead and hate the guy.  He deserves it.  And you'll know when the anger has served its purpose, and it's time for you to move on.  It's just that the time is not now.",

He claims he's not in \"as much\" pain and that for the next year or two he has to \"keep doing what I've been doing\" (which means not helping with kids or house at all) and that somehow is going to make him better. He's also not willing to join the gym or go to PT.\n\nIt seems like he really just wants to use it as an excuse and I'm so over it. I'm already doing everything myself why should I be carrying around his dead weight too? \n\nYesterday I was showing off my progress, wearing pants two sizes smaller than last year and muscle definition in my whole body and while I was excitedly bouncing around in my smaller clothes he asked if I was drunk and told me I look silly. I told him I don't really care what he thinks anymore. Not gonna let him put me down and mock me for working on myself while he sits on his behind doing nothing. \n\n",

            "I had something like this. It might be a subconscious mental barrier. What helped me was feeling desired. Like my bf moaning at my touch and telling me how bad he wants me. Men moaning is such a huge turn on. So it may be just finding what makes hers feel so desired and comfortable that she\u2019ll eventually get there. Sometimes it\u2019s unlearning lessons taught when you were growing up and just about feeling free and what you\u2019re doing is right.",
            "I would agree that it\u2019s a mental thing, unluckily one that is probably getting worse, the more you actively try to get it done. While for men the climax is almost all about the body or the \u201emechanics\u201c for women it\u2019s often a fairly even split between mental aspect and physical stimulation. Obviously any sort of pressure is thus counterproductive. That\u2019s why sex usually is way better when both partners can just turn off their head. It\u2019s also (imo) the reason why the most common dynamic in bed is the woman as submissive part and the man as dominant one, that takes charge, simply for the reason that the submissive part usually doesn\u2019t have to think or worry as much about what comes next, what they\u2019re supposed to do, etc. They can let themselves go, which often times is more important for women than for men, due to aforementioned reason. \n\nIn a way the more emphasis you put on her orgasm, the more pressure there is for her to \u201cperform\u201d or get it done, and thus making it less likely. Counterintuitively maybe the best thing, would be to therefore focus less on her orgasm, at least at the forefront of things, and rather focus on yourself more. Like the mindset should not be that you\u2019re like \u201cokay now I try to and expect to make you cum\u201d, but more of you doing whatever you want to do (which hopefully includes her pleasure though). I\u2019m not trying my best to make her cum, I\u2019m doing what *I* want to do and if she cums in the process that\u2019s great, but I put neither pressure on her, nor on myself to make it happen. Hopefully this makes some sort of sense.",
            "It's not your fault , make a girl climax is not common but mostly is a path that requires time and mostly mindset. After me and my gf spent time and time thinking to make it happen, in the end it happened in the most random ways like we didn't even think about it. It was spontaneous, natural. And I think this is the key. \nWe have stereotypes from Porn that we need to let it go. Sex and Love is another thing personally. Everyone is  different and everyone has their time to develop awareness to certain type of things . \n\nAs you describe seems like you have an amazing sex life. Just enjoy it as already is and eventually, will happen one day :)",
            "Its worth encouraging her to explore her own body more solo so she knows better, and is more comfortable with what works for her. I'm only assuming based on it not being directly mentioned in your post, but if you aren't already, it's worth getting better acquainted with Mr. Clitoris too.\n\nGetting frustrated and pressuring yourselves to get there will just make it harder to get there together though, take it easy, be patient and don't try to force it.",
            "Slow down a little and get away from the daily sex. She may be feeling like she has to put out to keep you happy and that\u2019s putting a lot of pressure and stress on her.",
            "I advise you both to stop making her ogasm the goal. Instead, focus more on making her feel sexy and desired. Maybe focus a bit more on exploring her body and sensual things like massaging/caressing her body. Just enjoy each other without expectations. \n\nAlso, a little bit next level, you could ask her if she has any kinks? I personally come so much easier if I'm psychologically dominated or if there's a bit of pain mixed into the pleasure. Being pinned down especially sets me at ease and relaxes me so long as i already feel safe and desired. THIS IS ONLY APPLICABLE TO ME PERSONALLY, DONT TAKE THIS AS A TODO LIST. Talk to her about things you both might be interested in exploring. \n\nAnother more risque thing to explore may be blindfolding her, and have her use her toys in front of you. A scary and vulnerable concept, but may help her to focus on her own pleasure with you present."
