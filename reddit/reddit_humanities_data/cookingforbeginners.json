We're putting together this thread as a place for you to share resources, recipes, updates, experiences, commiseration, and anything related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We've already assembled some resources for you!\n\nBig things:\n\n \u2022 Wash your hands and practice social distancing. Read the CDC's tips on all this: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html\n\n \u2022 Cook fresh foods first. If you have stocked up on nonperishables, try to save them for when you have run out of fresh ingredients. Eat all your leftovers, too!\n\n \u2022 Take caution when going out. If you must go out (for instance, to buy groceries), exercise extreme caution -- don't touch anything, maintain 6 feet of distance from other people, and wear gloves while picking up anything. The virus is known to survive on hard surfaces for hours to days, so please wipe down any packaging before bringing it into your house, especially if you live with anyone in an at-risk demographic. Alternatively: look into getting them delivered -- there's a bit of a delay for some stores but it may be your best option.\n\n \u2022 If you don't have enough food, especially if you have young children, look into any local schools or public agencies that are offering meals in your area.\n\nCooking Resources:\n\n \u2022 https://www.treehugger.com/green-food/pandemic-pantry-basics-how-eat-well-humble-ingredients.html\n\n \u2022 https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/voraciously/wp/2020/03/15/how-to-cook-for-and-with-your-kids-during-the-extended-coronavirus-school-closures/\n\n \u2022 https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/voraciously/wp/2020/03/05/heres-how-padma-lakshmi-and-other-expert-cooks-say-you-should-stock-your-pantry-for-a-coronavirus-quarantine/\n\n \u2022 https://www.sfchronicle.com/recipes/article/6-recipes-to-cook-from-the-pantry-during-the-15132707.php\n\n \u2022 https://www.npr.org/2020/03/14/815916438/coronavirus-meal-planning\n\n \u2022 https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/flnnwp/under_50_nonperishable_pantry_shopping_list/\n\nSupport Resources:\n\n \u2022 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/managing-stress-anxiety.html\n\n \u2022 https://adaa.org/finding-help/coronavirus-anxiety-helpful-resources\n\n \u2022 https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/opinion/sunday/anxiety-treatment-therapy.html?searchResultPosition=4\n\n \u2022 https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/\n\n \u2022 https://www.montereybayaquarium.org/animals/live-cams/ (this is not a support resource but who can argue with watching baby penguins?)\n\nIf you are experiencing excessive anxiety in this time, and just need someone to talk to, feel free to send me (u/viscous_crescendo) a message! I can't guarantee I'll get back to you right away, but (as a fellow anxiety sufferer) rest assured you won't be alone in feeling a tad overwhelmed.\n\nKeep your head on straight and listen to the doctors. We'll make it through this soon enough!\n\nPlease keep things civil and provide sources for any information about COVID (hearsay is discouraged; deliberate disinformation is bannable).

I feel like crying but I don\u2019t have the energy to. \n\nI spent the last 4 years living on takeaway food or other crap just depression food. Never made my own food unless it was throwing some frozen pizza into the oven or having cereal. \n\nI was fed up of putting on weight and feeling like shit and all the money I was blowing on takeaway so I decided i\u2019m gonna learn to cook. \n\nTonight i tried making butter chicken. Followed the recipe. Ok I fucked up on the first step because even though my hob was on medium heat i put the butter in and it burned immediately like instantly. Straight to black. Ok try again right? Second time I added the onion before the spices. Ok try again. Third time everything seemed to go ok. Put the chicken in LONGER THAT IT FUCKING SAID. Took it out the oven added it to the sauce and simmered it for LONGER THAN IT SAID. because the chicken finishes off cooking in the simmer with the sauce right? \n\nSo i finish, serve it up and the sauce is actually good. I liked it. So imagine my sheer fucking disappointment in myself when I cut into the chicken to find its not cooked after i already ate some of it. \n\nSo i\u2019m sitting here I don\u2019t even have the energy to fucking cry. I\u2019ve fucked it up, I\u2019ve given myself food poisoning which i have to look forward to tomorrow. I spent all that money on ingredients for it all to go in the bin. The 6 servings were actually 2. \n\nCooking isn\u2019t worth it. It isn\u2019t worth the meltdown and the panic and the stress. What the fuck is wrong with me. I know people make mistakes and all that but how the fuck did I still undercook the fucking chicken of all things. \n\nI can\u2019t even make myself throw up. \n\n",

We can't tell if you will like it though so try it out.\n\nPersonally I would just cut the cheese and go for lentils + bell peppers or some sausage.\n\nIf you want to vary a bit without any meat you can try things like black/red beans, chickpeas or mushrooms. These are all high on protein so they are a nice substitute for meat.\n\nFor cheaper animal protein you could use sausages (not the healthiest though), canned tuna/mackerel and  eggs. Any of these should be great by themselves or with some cheese (parmisan/padano, sharp cheddar, mozzarela are great options).\n\nSome stuff can be more or less expensive depending where you live. Chicken breast should still be cheap enough in most places, but you could try turkey or rabbit as well.",

You can also check out community colleges continuing education/extension classes (Im in San Diego and some of those are free).  Ask at the ymca.  Or even post to your local community groups (Reddit, Nextdoor, Facebook) to see what is available. Private chefs sometimes will offer courses. \n\nIf you dont need in person training then definitely check out YouTube videos   Find applicable videos as you go.  For example if you dont know how to brown meat find a video just for that.  \n \nUsing recipes will also help you learn different techniques and food combos and youll use those as building blocks for better and more complex meals \n\nAbove all have fun and forgive/learn from mistakes.

The perfectionist thing will go away as you cook cuz youre gonna screw stuff up. I will say for me, whatever I e made hasnt been inedible, just not something Id share with guests.\n\nCooking is an evolution, like learning an instrument or a second language, or a new job or skill. You build on top of things youve already learned. Youll learn to see a recipe and know that youll want less of X, more of Y, and maybe youll omit Z cuz ya dont have any and its no big deal or ya dont like it. \n\nA lot of blog recipes Ive found are under seasoned and can be bland because theyre catering to the masses and already know that cooks with some stripes on their sleeve, are gonna tweak it anyway.\n\nYouTube cooks with larger followings are usually good with how they tell you to make things. And most will even say things like,.if ya dont like X, dont put it in.make it your own.. \n\nSomeone mentioned Jacque Pepin, and I agree. Americas Test Kitchen YouTube is also a great channel.
