I feel like crying but I don\u2019t have the energy to. \n\nI spent the last 4 years living on takeaway food or other crap just depression food. Never made my own food unless it was throwing some frozen pizza into the oven or having cereal. \n\nI was fed up of putting on weight and feeling like shit and all the money I was blowing on takeaway so I decided i\u2019m gonna learn to cook. \n\nTonight i tried making butter chicken. Followed the recipe. Ok I fucked up on the first step because even though my hob was on medium heat i put the butter in and it burned immediately like instantly. Straight to black. Ok try again right? Second time I added the onion before the spices. Ok try again. Third time everything seemed to go ok. Put the chicken in LONGER THAT IT FUCKING SAID. Took it out the oven added it to the sauce and simmered it for LONGER THAN IT SAID. because the chicken finishes off cooking in the simmer with the sauce right? \n\nSo i finish, serve it up and the sauce is actually good. I liked it. So imagine my sheer fucking disappointment in myself when I cut into the chicken to find its not cooked after i already ate some of it. \n\nSo i\u2019m sitting here I don\u2019t even have the energy to fucking cry.

That's a win! And now you know for next time!\n\nMake sure to read the recipe all the way through first. Have all your ingredients prepped ahead of time. A meat thermometer can help if you're unsure about how cooked something is.",

Are you absolutely sure the chicken is undercooked?  Perfectly cooked chicken will sometimes still have a slightly pink hue, which newbies sometimes mistake for undercooked.  And if it is, just pop it back on the heat a bit longer so it cooks though.\n\n3.  Don't panic.  Even IF the chicken was undercooked, it's not certain that you'll get food poisoning from this especially since it sounds like you were eating the exterior, more cooked parts before you discovered it.  Frankly the biggest health risk for you at the moment is the anxiety spiral you seem to be going through.  Just calm down, it really isn't as bad as you think.",

Soon you will be able to even say, \"well the recipe says X minutes but in my oven it would take Y\"\n\nAnd to lift your spirits here is a story of one of my glorious fuck ups.\n\nSo I'm baking a cheesecake for company potluck. Realized I made too much filling, well, no problem, more cheesecake. I took a smaller pan and prepped a smaller cheesecake, but the problem is they won't fit side by side, well, still no problem. I put one on top, the other on the bottom rack to change around halfway. It all goes well until the time of switch. I carefully take the cheesecake upstairs and pull out the bottom rack, at that moment the small cheesecake escapes the grip of the oven mitt AND PLOPS RIGHT INTO THE LARGER, PARTIALLY COOKED CHEESECAKE. \n\nLucky for me the smaller cheesecake, plopper, was salvageable.

They supply too much material for r/stupidfood.  :)\n\nSecond, try working with ground beef. It's pretty easy to brown ground beef, and there is a lot you can do with it. Like Italian? Bolognese sauce. Mexican? Taco meat. Chili Mac/goulash is a tasty and easy one pot meal. Piccadillo... I'm about to recommend a YouTube channel that has a recipe for Korean beef bulgogi using ground beef. \n\nThree YouTube channels to check out: Vicenzo's Plate for Italian. Rachel Cooks With Love for Mexican. Aaron and Claire for Asian. All three do walkthroughs of their recipes, many of which are approachable by beginning cooks. \n\nAlso - consider investing in an oven safe skillet with an oven safe lid. (Most glass lids have temperature limits). One thing that I like to do is brown some chicken, pull the chicken, build a pan sauce using the fond, add the chicken back in and finish in the oven. I find cooking in liquid to be more forgiving. Poulet au vinaigre,  coq au vin, and Filipino adobo chicken are examples of dishes I prepare this way. \n\nKeep at it, don't give up!",

Depression (and more) cam sap your energy and lead to bad food choices.  \n\nNow leaving you and a professional to your mental health...how about starting slow on the cooking.  Let's add healthy too.  First you get all the fresh fruits and vegetables you want....and all the EVOO...and all the beans and lentils ..and all the salmon, anchovies, sardines (if you like any of them).  But start with a bowl of beans with lots if seasoning and fresh onions and whole wheat toast.  Maybe tuna or salmon salad with a dab of may, mustard, celery.

            "Why are you flipping your burgers three times?\n\n80/20 beef\n\n2.5-2.8 ounces per patty ball\n\nBurger press (flatten it to around a 1/4\u201dthick. Thick burgers are dumb, just double up on patties if you want more meat)\n\nLet it cook in its own fat to achieve the Maillard effect (dark crust on the outside, soft inside)\n\nMinute and a half -2 minutes per side\n\nFlip it once\n\nSeason (I like sucklebusters steak seasoning)\n\nCheese\n\nCarmelized onions\n\nCondiments\n\nBun\n\nEasy.\n\nThe best burgers take no time, and are simply made.\nGood food makes people feel good, love your food and you\u2019ll love yourself \u2764\ufe0f",
            "Thumbprint. That's what you need. After you form your burger, poke it in the middle. Dent the middle to about half the thickness of the rest.",
            "I get that a lot of people enjoy smash burgers. I am not a fan of that. I want a thick juicy hunk of meat. Not a paper thin McDonald\u2019s style patty\u2026\n\nMaybe get one of those instant read digital thermometers\u2026when th inside hits the magic number, you\u2019re done!",
            "Punch the middle of the patty so it looks like a red blood cell: thin in the middle and thick on the edges. It will cook more evenly and flatten out as it cooks."
