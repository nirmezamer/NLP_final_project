Bots take part in the following 2 other subreddits, r/TiktokCringe and r/SipsTea\n3. Bots also tend to comment on their own post, with a caption that seems to be copy pasted when posting the same video on the other two subs they repost the same media to. (To farm even more karma by getting the top comment)\n4. Inactive for a year or more, and few posts since then.\n\nPlease report posts from users that satisfy atleast 2 of the following criteria, and report the account to reddit.  \nWE SHALL NOT LET THE BOTS DO WHAT THEY WANT.",
