            "(My original post was removed so I\u2019m replying on this thread here instead)\n\nIs it accurate to say HK is a fast paced city?\n\nHello! The last time I visited Hong Kong was in 2010.  My first impression was that everyone there seemed to be in a rush.  Everyone there seemed to be speed walking.  I didn\u2019t see anyone wandering around.  Everybody seemed to have a destination to go and limited time.  Even the elderly seemed did not seem to be relaxing at all.\n\nThe other thing I noticed was that bus drivers often brake at the last minute, making the bus rides jerky and kind of uncomfortable.  It\u2019s like they want to show off their driving skills.  \n\nIs my perception accurate? Note that I was only 14 years old in 2010.  I\u2019d like to visit Hong Kong again.  I grew up in California so maybe Hong Kong is generally more \u201crushed\u201d than any city in the USA?",

I took it to mean a kind of tradesman license or certificate. \n\nIs that what it is? I did a cursory search and I did find modern examples of this for electrical work. Does it exist for other sectors too? Plumbing, AC repair and so on? Just something I was curious about.",

            "What to have on your person while sightseeing\n\n* Cash: HK is a very cash based society, with a large number of \"traditional\" family-owned restaurants taking cash exclusively. You will also need cash to buy street food, shop in the night markets or street markets in Stanley and Mongkok. ATMs are widespread.\n\n* [Octopus](http://www.octopus.com.hk/home/en/index.html): Contactless payment card akin to a debit/bank card. This card is used for *almost* all forms of public transportation in Hong Kong, and is also accepted is basically any major chain store, restaurant, fast food chain, etc. Just tap the card/your wallet to the reader, and wait for the doot sound, at which point it will flash your remaining balance on the screen. There's a fuller list of places where you can reload the card with cash on the website, but off the top of my head, you can reload at Starbucks, McDonalds, Watsons/Mannings, any supermarket, or any convenience store (7-11/Circle K/Vanguard). The card has a stored base value of 50 HKD, so you can go up to negative 50 HKD in a single transaction. Cards with a preexisting negative balance will be declined by the reader.\n\nThe card can be purchased at the service counter in any MTR station, including the airport.\n\n* Passport: Carrying identification is required by law, and police will ask for ID if you are stopped for any reason.\n\nGetting around Hong Kong\n\n1. [MTR](http://mtr.com.hk/en/customer/tourist/index.php): Everyone loves/hates the MTR, which is HK's subway system. It spans across the small territory and is fast, reliable, and blessedly air-conditioned with a breeze. Downside is that it can get VERY crowded during peak commute hours and weekends. The subway will go between districts, and exits are clearly marked with both sightseeing destinations and major buildings and destinations. Fare is relatively inexpensive, costing up to 28 HKD for the longest journey one way. (Not including airport express and Lo Wu/Lok Ma Chau)\n\n2. Double-decker buses: Countless bus lines criss-cross Hong Kong and provide a cheap way to get around the city, or reach areas that are not accessible by subway, for example, Sai Kung, the southern side of HK Island and Aberdeen, and Eastern Kowloon (Whampoa, To Kwa Wan, and Ho Man Tin). Stops are displayed in both Chinese and English on screens inside the bus, but older buses may simply do computerized announcements in Cantonese, Mandarin, and English. Fares are cheaper than the MTR when traveling long distances, but travel time is longer due to traffic. Fare is paid by tagging your octopus or paying cash when boarding.\n\n3. [Green minibuses](http://www.16seats.net/eng/): Wherever the double-decker buses won't go, the green minibuses will. These buses have somewhat shorter routes than the larger buses, but are definitely intended for more local use. The fare is comparable to the larger buses, but each bus sits a maximum of 16 people and will only take on additional passengers when there are empty spaces. While they do follow set routes (check the streets it travels along), there are few set stops other than at the start and end points. Green minibuses are usually flagged down wherever they are able to stop, similar to taxis, then pay the set fare when you board, then take a seat. When you are approaching your stop, call out to the driver to stop the bus (\"Driver, stop please\" or \"\u524d\u8fb9\u6709\u843d, tsin biin yau lok\"). I don't recommend this option for tourists unless absolutely necessary because it is difficult to know where your desired stop is, as drivers rarely speak in English and do not announce stops. If you must take the minibus, I recommend showing the driver the location where you are getting off, and also keeping track of location via GPS to see when you are close enough to the exit Google Maps has indicated.\n\n4. Red minibuses: While they do follow set routes (check the streets it travels along), there are few set stops other than at the start and end points. They are usually flagged down wherever they are able to stop. However, they generally do NOT take Octopus cards. \n\n5. Ferries: HK has numerous outlying islands to travel to, as well as the iconic [Star Ferry](http://www.discoverhongkong.com/eng/see-do/highlight-attractions/harbour-view/star-ferries.jsp). The Star Ferry is the cheapest way to cross the harbour, soak in some views of the skyline, and feel the ocean breeze. Ferries to the outlying islands as well as Lantau leave from the Central Pier, and are reasonably priced per single journey. Simply tag your Octopus as you pass through the fare gates. Note that springing for first class is usually not necessary, but they do have slightly nicer amenities, like air conditioning in the heat, an indoor cabin in the rain, and access to vending machines and tables.\n\n6. [Taxis](http://www.discoverhongkong.com/eng/plan-your-trip/traveller-info/transport/getting-around/taxi.jsp): HK's taxis are cheap and plentiful. There are three kinds of taxis: red for within the main parts of the city, like Kowloon and HK Island; blue taxis serve Lantau Island; green taxis operate in the New Territories. Note that taxis often DO NOT take Octopus cards or credit cards, sadly.\n\nFrom: https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/39z2sm/traveling_to_hong_kong_megathread/ , modify a bit.",
            "Bandwagoning on this post to get some personal travel suggestions and maybe condense down the Google doc recommendations a bit. Sightseeing and FAQs in the next posts, hopefully.\n\nGetting to and from Hong Kong\n\n1. Plane - probably how most visitors come to HK. [Hong Kong International Airport](http://www.hongkongairport.com/eng/index.html) is well-connected, and has airlines between basically nearly all major countries within 13 hours' worth of flying, barring transfers. Some other regional airports to consider would be Shenzhen and Guangzhou, but HK is a hub in itself.\n\n2. Train - somewhat underrated option. If you're in China itself or want to head out to China, HK's West Kowloon station is the final stop for some inter-city trains in China. There are also direct trains to Guangzhou numerous times daily from West Kowloon, making for an easy day trip into China.\n\n3. Boat - most people already know about the Macau-HK high-speed and regular speed ferries, but HK also has ferry links to many cities around the Pearl river Delta in Guangdong Province.\n\nPacking tips for Hong Kong\n\n*  HK has a hot and humid climate during the summer time, which can be very uncomfortable. Bring a few extra shirts if you plan on changing shirts more than once a day. \n\n* Insect season starts picking up when the rainy season hit around mid-April, up until the weather cools down around October. If you are prone to mosquito bites, bring repellant, or purchase some in HK at any convenience store, Watsons, or Mannings. For insect bite relief, I personally prefer [Mopidick](http://www.amazon.com/Mopidick-Mopidick-s-Lotion-50ml/dp/B004XG4MNI) and similar types of roll-on liquid itch relief that use menthol.\n\n* Air conditioning is heavily utilized during the summer; some malls and stores have a temperature difference of more than 10-15 degrees Celsius from the outside. Bring a windbreaker to put on when indoors if you are sensitive to sudden temperature changes.\n\n* Carry an umbrella with you at all times during the summer. Sudden, short showers happen regularly, and umbrellas can be used to provide shade in sunny areas.\n\n* During the winter months (December-March), the weather is dry and breezy and falls to a moderate 15-17 degrees. Medium to light jackets and hoodies are suited for this time.\n\n* HK uses 220 voltage and [3 prong UK-styled plugs](http://johnlewis.scene7.com/is/image/JohnLewis/231577941?$prod_grid3$). Bring adapters as necessary, or purchase them when you arrive. They are widely available, especially in areas like Sham Shui Po or even Temple Street.\n\n* Prescription medication is not widely available in HK. Bring enough supply of medication for the entirety of your trip; otherwise, you will have to visit a clinic, wait for a doctor's appointment, then fill your  prescription at the clinic. OTC medicine is available in both Watsons and Mannings.\n\nFrom: https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/39z2sm/traveling_to_hong_kong_megathread/ , modify a bit.",

I'd like to break this trip into two experiences and perhaps even 2 different stays. One to see the lush side of HK and go on 1-2 hikes (medium-difficult) and the other to experience the city life (without compromising a decent hotel stay).\n\nDoes anyone have recs for where to stay if I want to be closer to the hikes and lush side? I was thinking of ending my trip there or starting my trip there with 1-2 day stay and the rest in the city. Also, I wrote down some hiking trails but would love actual recs.\n\nFor staying in the city, I was thinking of staying central and being in the heart of it, but my mom (who might meet me out there and goes yearly) says to stay in Kowloon and certain regions are dangerous with gangs, like Yau Tsim Mong. Does anyone have feedback? My mom's idea of \"danger\" is very different from mine \ud83d\ude05. I'd like a roomier hotel preferably in case the Madre wants to stay with me.\n\nLastly, has anyone tried bringing over a \ud83c\udf43oil cartridge? I read up on the vape ban. \n\nThanks!!!",

For transportation, it would be a mix of taxi and public transportation I'm expecting.\n\nI will be staying in Wan Chai and some places I plan on visiting are Tsim Sha Tsui, Victoria Peak, Causeaway Bay and Tian Tan Buddha.  I also want to visit some Night Markets. I haven't converted any money yet because I am unsure on how much to convert at once. I would be converting USD to HKD."
