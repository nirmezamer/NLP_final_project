            "Really need help for this.\n\nGot caught jaywalking 2 weeks ago on my way to my internship and just received the court summons. I wanna plead guilty by post/letter to get it over with. I don't mind paying the fine tho hopefully i don't have to. I'm just worried if it's gonna be in my criminal record??? If I request Certificate of No Criminal Convection, will it be there? I asked the officer that caught me and he said it most likely won't be but i'm just so anxious and panicking rn.",

            "I remember a scene in an old HK movie ages ago, a Hui Brothers comedy I think it was. \n\nIt was a private detective trying to infiltrate some guys apartment posing as a TV repairman. \n\nHis colleague helped him with the disguise and before he went in, passed him a sort of business card from a stack. I took it to mean a kind of tradesman license or certificate. \n\nIs that what it is? I did a cursory search and I did find modern examples of this for electrical work. Does it exist for other sectors too? Plumbing, AC repair and so on? Just something I was curious about.",

            "(My original post was removed so Im replying on this thread here instead)\n\nIs it accurate to say HK is a fast paced city?\n\nHello! The last time I visited Hong Kong was in 2010.  My first impression was that everyone there seemed to be in a rush.  Everyone there seemed to be speed walking.  I didnt see anyone wandering around.  Everybody seemed to have a destination to go and limited time.  Even the elderly seemed did not seem to be relaxing at all.\n\nThe other thing I noticed was that bus drivers often brake at the last minute, making the bus rides jerky and kind of uncomfortable.  Its like they want to show off their driving skills.  \n\nIs my perception accurate? Note that I was only 14 years old in 2010.  Id like to visit Hong Kong again.  I grew up in California so maybe Hong Kong is generally more rushed than any city in the USA?"

            "> Samaritan Befrienders Hong Kong said on Saturday that 1,092 suicides were reported in 2023, the highest since 2006, and 12 cases higher than the previous year. About 52 per cent, or 573, involved people aged between 20 to 59.\n\n...\n\n> Samaritan Befrienders executive director Clarence Tsang Chin-kwok said the increase in suicides might be related to the economic and social environment.\n\n> Hong Kongs economic environment is in a state of a downturn, which might put pressure on people to strive harder to support their livelihoods, he said.\n\n...\n\n> If you have suicidal thoughts, or you know someone who is, help is available. For Hong Kong, dial +852 18111 for the government-run Mental Health Support Hotline or +852 2896 0000 for [The Samaritans](https://samaritans.org.hk/?lang=en) and +852 2382 0000 for Suicide Prevention Services.\n\nAlternatively The Samaritans also have [an Befriender email form](https://samaritans.org.hk/services/befriending-email/?lang=en) you can use.\n\nIn this day and age it is very easy to be overwhelmed emotionally. Please seek help if you feel you need it."
