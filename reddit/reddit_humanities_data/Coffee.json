Neither of us are sure where it came from - I guess it's just one of those things married people acquire along the way. \n\nAnyways, I want to use it to make cold brew; I'm looking for advice on ratios, and if medium or dark roast is 'better' (better is of course subjective, but general consensus is fine).",

Because the mesh filter seems to have a max capacity of 280g... Which if it is a true gallon of water the only ratio which works is 1:12 but I'm seeing 1:8 and 1:10 recommended.\u00a0\n\n\nWhat is truly recommended for a non concentrated cold brew? Or should I approach this at a different angle by just using less water and a higher ratio?\u00a0\n\n\nI'm sure it's all dependent on quality of beans too but roughly, how do I approach this specific scenario?

I recently bought a bag of Ethiopian washed from S&W (very light roast) and they mentioned in the description that, at low extractions, it can be somewhat tea-like. She is a tea lover, so I\u2019m wondering if this might be a way for us both to enjoy a good cup of coffee together. \n\nMy question is: has anyone had success brewing for a tea-like cup, and what were the best ways to do it? This bag tastes incredible when brewed with my normal recipe, so I\u2019m hoping to maintain some of the key flavors. \n\nI\u2019m running a Chemex with reusable metal filters (although I suspect paper filter would be best, and will probably order some), but I can also do espresso, moka pot, French press, etc. if another brewer can get me to the right place. \n\nTIA!\n\nEDIT: Seems some think I\u2019m trying to force my s/o to enjoy coffee.

            "In my experience, some kind of pourover with a paper filter is best at expressing the more delicate, floral flavors that people are usually thinking about when they say \"tea-like,\" so I think you're on the right track. Chemex in particular has a very thick paper filter, so it will likely give the \"cleanest\" cup that's the most like tea (as opposed to the thicker texture that comes with the increase in oils and silt that passes through on a metal filter).\n\nWhat kinds of tea does your girlfriend like? The kind of experience she enjoys could vary wildly, there's so many different teas.",
            "Below is how I start when I'm chasing the \"tea-like\" profile in a V60 or Chemex since they're both conical. This is basically using the 4:6 method as a starting point.\n\n1. Rinse the paper filter with boiling water so that it sticks to the dripper then discard the water. I use tap water for the rinse.\n2. Heat 400 g of brew water to 93\u00b0C. I use Third Wave Water.\n3. Pour 26.7 g of coffee into the filter and shake it a little to flatten the bed. On my ZP6, my grind setting is 4.5.\n3. Start the timer and pour 80 g of water.\n4. At 0:45, pour another 80 g to bring the total to 160 g.\n5. At 1:30, pour the remaining 240 g which brings you to the final 400 g total. If my bed isn't looking to flat, I'l give it a quick swirl to flatten it.\n\nFrom there, these are the tweaks I usually make:\n* If I want a weaker flavor, I'll lower the coffee dose to 25 g or 23.5 g.\n* If I want a brighter flavor, I'll increase the water in the first pour and decrease the water in the second pour. I'll start by changing the first and second pour to 100 g and 60 g respectively, but I'm not afraid to even try 160 g in the first pour and skip the second pour.\n* If I want less brightness, I'll try lowering the brew water temperature to somewhere in the 85\u00b0C to 90\u00b0C.\n* If I want less bitterness AND a weaker flavor, I'll try removing some water from the final pour and instead replace it with a bypass. For example, I may only pour 120 g for my last pour then just add 120 g of hot water to my cup.\n* If I want less bitterness and potentially more brightness, I'll coarsen the grind by a few clicks.\n\nI'm still relatively new to coffee, and I could be wrong on the effects of my dial-in techniques, but I've been very happy with my results so far by sticking to this game plan on my last couple of bags.",

            "The biggest issue is why someone doesn't enjoy coffee.\n\nIf they don't like a 'coffee' that is a second crack robusta bean brewed poorly, then you have room to work with.  \nIf it is something else entirely, you might struggle.",
            "Hey! My gf isn't into coffee either, but we found that brewing light roast Ethiopian beans with a Chemex and paper filter gives a nice tea-like vibe. Worth a shot if you wanna share a cup! Cheers!",
            "Get a Hario Switch or a Clever dripper and brew water first full immersion recipe (like Hoffmann's Clever recipe) for her with 1:20 ratio (yes, it must be this high ratio). This will result in a really clear and low body brew. It is my wife's favorite method regardless what other dripper or recipe I try.\n\nIf you don't want to buy a new equipment, just get a vessel large enough to fit the water (mason jar, french press etc.), and get filter paper for Chemex (and you are correct, the filter paper is really crucial here). Do the recipe from above in the jar (pour water first, pour grounds, stir a bit, wait 2 minutes), then filter the whole thing through a Chemex paper (it may take a while, but don't worry it won't extract at that point anymore). It will result a really similar to what you can achieve with a Clever / Switch (although a bit less clean).",
            "Don\u2019t know about the tea-like coffee you\u2019re asking but there\u2019s a coffee called Raf (created by Russian baristas). It\u2019s literally made for people who don\u2019t like coffee. And there are a lot of variations of it like Lavender raf, lemon cookie raf, citrus raf etc. It\u2019s not made with syrups to achieve such flavours, which is amazing cos it\u2019s not sweet, you just gotta make the base yourself for it.

            "Geisha varieties tend to have tea-like flavor profiles",
            "Of the brew methods you listed Chemex with the paper filters are going to be your best bet. A metal filter will leave too many coffee particles and oils in your brew. \n\nThe coffee matters a lot and it sounds like you're on the right track with a light roasted washed Ethiopian. In general you want to avoid anything with too many roasty or chocolate tasting notes. If the roaster describes the coffee as \"bright\", \"fruity\", \"fruity acidity\", etc. that's what you want. \n\nChemex usually calls for a fairly coarse grind and I would stick with that. You don't say what grinder you are using. \n\nAs far as the number of pours goes, I would try to limit it to three or less. A light \"swirl\" after the first pour especially to make sure all the coffee is wet (and you don't get too much obvious channeling) is a good idea. \n\nYou can experiment with ratios from 1:16-18. For water temps I would recommend 90-93C as a starting point. Changing too many variables at one time will likely lead to confusion over what \"worked\" to get you the result you want. Consider logging your brews in an app such Tasting Grounds - there are others too. \n\nGood luck.",
            "Not sure about brewing it differently but there are more tea like coffees out there. I just had one from Burundi that was supposed to be reminiscent of \u201cpeach iced tea\u201d. I definitely thought it was very tea like in flavor (at least compared to other coffees I\u2019ve had) which actually made me really not like it personally. But perhaps it\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for.\n\nIf it\u2019s not flavor you\u2019re going for but more so texture, then maybe try to get beans with less body. Kind of depends on the roaster for the words they use to describe a tea like texture but it\u2019ll probably be something like \u201cdelicate\u201d body."
