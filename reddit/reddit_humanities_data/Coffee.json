            "I\u2019ve just ordered a breville express impress. Any additional accessories that anyone would recommend to get?",
            "Why does my moka pot coffee tastes so sour? I put boiling water in it, I turn down the heat once the coffee starts coming in. And I fill the filter part but don't tamper it down. I use good coffee, except I don't grind it freshly, the barista in my local coffeeshop ground it specifically for moka pot when I bought it (2 weeks ago). Is it that the coffee is too old now? Or is it my technique? Please \ud83d\ude4f help",
            "What might be causing a liquorice type flavour? Over extraction? It happens now and again regardless of bean type, grind size, method.\n\nAlso while I'm here, my V60 runs way too fast even if I've ground so fine that the grinder struggles. Any ideas?",
            "I Moka Pot my coffee fairly regularly. I also French Press and auto-drip my coffee regularly. My wife does not like MP or FP coffee. She thinks they are too much a knock in the jaw. Have you compared MP to FP or auto-drip? It could be not to your liking.",
            "Several years ago I gave my wife a DeLonghi coffee machine for Christmas and she loves it because she's never used it, I aways make the coffee...\nThis year for my Birthday she \"allowed\" me to pick a new machine... a duotemp pro, I chose it because it seems to be bomb-proof with few gadgets to go wrong down the line and it was on offer @ \u00a3299.\n\nPaired with the sage grinder I got for Christmas (with bean subscription) it makes for a nice coffee corner...\n\nCan anyone give me a good recommendation for the starting point to grind and extract for this machine using the stock baskets, fresh roasted beans, aiming for a decent flat white and latte base?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice...",
            "If you can get a grinder and grind fresh it will greatly improve. I can't believe how long I waited to get a burr grinder which is 100x better than the cheap \"chopper blade\" kind. Unfortunately these start at $200, and 2x-3x for something quiet, low retention, and long life.\n\nRecently roasted is always best, between 7 and 30 days. ALWAYS buy coffee with a \"roasted on\" date, ignore those without and having \"best by\".\n\nSour usually indicates under-extraction, so the grind could go finer, assuming the beans are fresh and grind just prior.",
            "Try it with cool water instead.\n\nThe coffee isn\u2019t too old; moka pots are pretty good at extraction and will get everything useful out of it. \u00a0\n\nYou could actually be getting *over*extraction, though, with the hot water. \u00a0There\u2019s a thing called \u201cbitter-sour confusion\u201d, and it *might* just be so bitter that it\u2019s fooling you into thinking it\u2019s sour.",

            "I've finally been getting into my Colombian variety set from Sweet Maria's after letting it all rest a couple weeks. Drinking some of the washed Chiroso right now, it's just fantastic. City+ roast, ground to about 300 microns and brewed at 1:18 in my V60 with Cafec abaca filters, with just two relatively turbulent pours and heavy stirring after the bloom and main pour, Very fruity in the cup with a thick, syrupy body. I'm in love. (:",
            "Finished the last of my Koru Espresso from Chocolate Fish, and the rest of the week has been Kahawa 1893 from Trader Joe's (pretty good budget brand!)",
            "This week I've been brewing a delicious Ethiopian Yirgacheffe from Blue Bottle Coffee. It's got such a lovely floral and citrusy taste, perfect for these summer mornings. I'm using my trusty Chemex to brew it. Anyone have any other bean recommendations? I'm always on the lookout for something new and exciting to try!",
            "I'm brewing a natural Rwanda from Corvus Coffee.  Tastes like berries, stone fruit, chocolate, and has a really nice finish to it.  I use my Chemex as always and have been drinking it black because it's so good as is, but I feel like it would also hold up nicely in a milk beverage!",

            "That's what I had before the Koru and I agree, will definitely be getting more in the future. I want to try their Guatemalan options next though.",
            "I've been alternating between Blue Bottle's Moka Java Blend and Paradise Coffee's Hawai'i Island Blend. \n\nThe Blue Bottle is, as far as I can tell, a Sumatra blend. No Arabian coffee in the mix. It's still really nice and chocolatey. Reminds me of what originally drew me to their Bella Donovan way back when BB was still an indie company. \n\nParadise's Hawai'i Island Blend is intended as an espresso. I'm finding it's really nice coming from my Aeropress. \n\nWith both, I'm using an upside down Aeropress, water in the high 190s and about 1:20 immersion time before plunging."

        "content": "So I'm a hard cold brew person. During Covid around September 2020, I was helping a company trying to explore sous vide coffee as a potential product and measured the brix, caffeine level, etc. \n\nThe project ended up halting because the market for it was small but I recently saw an ad on youtube for sous vide cold brew. Is this becoming a thing within the coffee community now? It's also found in the sous vide community. Do any of ya'll actually do this or use it at shops? \n\nMy personal opinion is it makes a slight difference but I don't think sous vide coffee is worth doing the clean up after. I'd rather just do traditional cold brew method and stick with that. Thoughts? ",
