A. You can book on [Royal Caribbean's website](https://www.royalcaribbean.com) or through a travel agent/3rd party travel service. You can also call Royal Caribbean directly to book (US number: 866-562-7625).\n\n\\- How do I get to my cruise? A. Most people do not live within driving distance of their cruise, meaning a flight is sometimes required. General advice is to fly into your cruise port at least one full day before your sailing to account for flight delays. The ship will not wait for you if you are late. You alternatively can book your flights through Royal Caribbean through the [Air2Sea program](https://www.royalcaribbean.com/flights/bookFlights), though it is still advised to fly in a day early.\n\n\\- What if the price of my cruise changes? A. Before final payment date (generally 75-90 days before sailing) you can re-price your cruise as many times as you would like to the current rate if you booked in the US. The difference will be refunded to your credit card or taken off your remaining balance owed. After final payment, you typically can't reprice your sailing and if anything may be offered on board credit to account for a fare drop.\n\n\\- How do I check in? A. Through the Royal Caribbean app (log in, add your sailing with your booking number, swipe to the left and look for a blue \"check in\" button) or on the [website](https://www.royalcaribbean.com/account/signin) (sign in, find your cruise or add it at the bottom of the page if you do not see it listed, then click \"check in\").\n\n\\- When can I check in? A. 45 days before your cruise you will see the option in the app. To find your exact check in day, open the app and swipe to the left and then scroll down to the 'check in' area.\n\n\\- Do I need a passport? A. US citizens can cruise with a US passport book that MUST be valid for at least 6 months from the last day of your cruise. Alternatively you can use an original birth certificate (with a raised seal) and government-issued photo ID on closed-loop sailings (that start and end from the same US port).\n\n\\- Do I need to be vaccinated against COVID-19? Do I need to test? A. COVID vaccinations or testing is no longer required unless specifically noted for your booking (very rare).\n\n# Topic 2: Inclusions in your cruise fare\n\n\\- Food: Your cruise ticket includes all food needed for the duration of your cruise. You do not need to spend any extra money on food if you do not wish to do so. Food is complimentary in the main dining room (breakfast (B), lunch (L) on sea days, dinner (D)), the Windjammer marketplace buffet (B/L/D), Johnny Rockets only for breakfast and only on Oasis class ships, Promenade Cafe, Park Cafe, Cafe 270, Sorrentos pizza, and Solarium Bistro (B/L/D on select ships). Coastal Kitchen is the complementary suites-only restaurant available on select ships, open B/L/D for grand suites and above, D only for junior suites. Room service is free for continental breakfast, incurs a $7.95 fee plus gratuity for full B/L/D however all food is included after that fee is paid.\n\n\\- I've heard about the main dining room (MDR)! Do I need reservations? A. The main dining room is the main complementary dining venue on board where you can expect multi-course, full service meals with varying nightly menus. At the time of booking you will have two options: My Time dining or traditional dining. My Time dining is a reservation system that lets you select the time you'd like to eat each evening, usually from 6:45-8:30 PM. Times vary by ship. You can also just show up to the stand by line during My Time dining hours and wait for the next available table. This option is great if you want to change your dining time each night to better fit the activities you want to do. Traditional dining will be a set dining time each night (5:30 PM for early seating, 8 PM for late seating). You will have the same table and wait staff each evening. If you do traditional dining, no reservations are required, you just show up at your selected time and your table number/deck number for dinner will be printed on your SeaPass card.\n\n\\- Is there a dress code? A. There will typically be two formal nights on a 7 night sailing (fewer on shorter sailings). You are free to dress your best! Formal night only applies in the MDR so if you go to a different venue, you follow their typical dress code (though people typically still dress up for other specialty restaurants that night). Otherwise minimum acceptable dress for dinner is typically long pants/jeans for men. Women definitely have more flexibility. On a non-formal-night, dress up as much as you'd like. Most people will dress as if they are going out to a regular dinner.\n\n\\- Do you have any pro tips for the MDR? A. Absolutely! A vegan menu is always available and sometimes I select those options just to try something new. On the app, scroll to the bottom of a given night's menu to see the vegan options.\n\n\\- Beverages: Tap water, iced tea, lemonade, hot coffee, hot tea, non-fresh squeezed juices at breakfast, and milk are included in your cruise fare. Alcohol is not included.\n\n\\- Entertainment: Shows, including broadway shows on select ships, comedy, live music, and most activities are included in your cruise fare. See your cruise compass for exact offerings. Events that cost extra are marked with a \"$\" symbol. Shows can be reserved in advance on select sailings. Check the cruise planner website and app prior to your cruise to see if this is an option and reserve your shows as early as possible. On some sailings, advanced reservations may only be made once on board and connected to the ship's WiFi. On many smaller ships, reservations are not required.\n\n\\- Accommodations: Your stateroom selected during your booking serves as your accomodations for the sailing. You will have a once daily cleaning service for your room, including restocking towels and having your bed made/turned down. Rooms include a TV, private bathroom, and a bed that can be separated into twin beds. Some rooms accommodate extra guests with pullman beds/pullout sofa beds. This will be designated on the deck plan for your stateroom at the time of booking. Please note that some higher-level suites will include things such as WiFi, unlimited specialty dining, a deluxe drink package and more. Check [here](https://www.royalcaribbean.com/faq/questions/what-are-the-benefits-of-royal-suite-class) to see what the suite you are looking at includes.\n\n\\- Tips: Gratuities are not included in your cruise fare, but are essentially required. These tips can be paid before your sailing or will be automatically added to your SeaPass on-board account once on board. Current gratuity rates are $18/day for non-suites and $20.50/day for suites, per person. Gratuities are critical for supporting crew members who make your vacation special and should not be removed for any reason. Some sailings include tips in their fare, such as those booked in Australia.\n\n\\- WiFi: WiFi of any kind is not included in your fare. You can purchase a \"Voom\" internet package on the cruise planner in advance of your cruise or once on board. Both full sailing passes and 24 hour passes are offered on board. The 24 hour passes can't be paused, it runs continuously until it expires. It is generally a better deal to purchase these packages in advance. You can use the ship WiFi for free to use the Royal app.\n\n\\- Gym: The fitness center is included in your cruise fare and is unfortunately not open 24 hours on all ships. Some ships have hours such as 5 AM - 9 PM, so that the gym can be deep cleaned overnight. Amenities vary by ship, but expect everything you'd typically find in a land-based gym. Fitness classes cost extra with the exception of the morning stretch classes.\n\n# Topic 3: Packages/extras\n\n\\- How do I pay for things on board? A. Your SeaPass card functions as your room key and payment method on the ship. I'd advise linking it to a credit or debit card to skip lines at the end of the sailing for those settling their statements in cash. It is preferred to link a credit card over a debit card as it is common for holds to be placed during your sailing, which may hold up your funds if using debit.\n\n\\- Alcohol: Alcoholic drinks are not included in your fare. Prices vary, but typically expect to spend $7-9/beer, $8-15/glass of wine, $9-12/shot, $14-15/cocktail plus 18% automatic gratuity. Drinks can be purchased a la carte with your SeaPass card or with a package, see below. See **Topic 8** below for an important exception to this: Diamond/Diamond Plus/Pinnacle drink vouchers.\n\n\\- Drink packages: Multiple types of packages are offered, with pricing changing dynamically before your cruise. The deluxe beverage package (DBP) offers the classic \"unlimited\" experience, covering pretty much any drink including alcohol up to $14/drink. Many people ask for the \"breakeven\" point to determine if it is worth getting a DBP. The best way to figure this out for yourself is to look at the current rate of the DBP on your cruise planner and see if you feel you can drink enough drinks per day to exceed that cost if you were to pay a la carte. Don't forget non-alcoholic premium drinks are included (espresso-based coffee drinks, bottled still/sparkling water, Powerades, soda, milkshakes) - so factor this in your equation. The DBP pricing is dynamic, but expect $65-$105 per person, per day. This package requires everyone older than the legal drinking age of that sailing that are sharing a cabin to purchase a package. If you have an exception, for example your partner is pregnant or doesn't drink alcohol, you can call in and request that the requirement be waived. They will be required to purchase a non-alcoholic refreshment package instead.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Can I share a drink package? A. **NO. Drink packages (with the exception of the Cafe Select Card mentioned below) can't be shared. You risk being charged for a full additional package if you are caught or even being disembarked. If you ask about sharing drinks/cheating the drink package in this sub, you will immediately be banned from making new posts no questions asked.\\*\\*\\***\n\nAnother option is the refreshment package. This package is considerably cheaper than the DBP, however does not include alcohol. Think of this as the \"soda plus premium non-alcoholic drinks package\", like espresso-based coffees, mocktails, etc. It typically is approx $25-33/day per person.\n\nFinally is the soda package. This option is typically around $10-15/day per person and grants package holders unlimited fountain and canned sodas, including from the Coke Freestyle machines.\n\n\\*All drink packages listed above include a souvenir Coca Cola refillable cup.\n\n\\*\\*Gratuities are paid at time of purchasing the package, so no additional tipping is required, however if a bartender is providing excellent service, adding an additional dollar or two makes their day!\n\nOne last thing to note: you can buy a Cafe Select card, usually $30-38. This card entitles you to 15 small-size espresso-based drinks and is the only type of package that can be used across multiple sailings. You are given a small paper card that has the numbers 1-15 for the barista to cross off when you redeem a drink. This is a great option for those with Diamond/Pinnacle drink vouchers who want to reduce the price of espresso drinks without using a voucher towards it! This package is shareable and does NOT require everyone in the cabin to buy it.\n\n\\- Is a drink package worth it? A. The best way to figure this out for yourself is to look at the current rate of the package you want on your cruise planner and see if you feel you can drink enough drinks per day to exceed that cost if you were to pay a la carte. Don't forget non-alcoholic premium drinks are included in the DBP (espresso-based coffee drinks, bottled still/sparkling water, Powerades, soda, milkshakes) - so factor this in your equation. The DBP pricing is dynamic, but expect $65-$105 per person, per day.\n\n\\- Dining packages/specialty dining: Specialty dining varies by ship, but includes options like Chops Grille (steakhouse), Jamie's Italian/Giovannis Italian, Izumi (sushi/teppanyaki), Wonderland, Playmakers sports bar, etc. Pricing is typically a set cover per restaurant, check your cruise planner for exact pricing. You can also consider a dining package. There are three main varieties: Chops + 1 (includes dining at Chops Grille and one other restaurant of your choice), 3 Night Package (includes 3 specialty dining restaurants of your choice), and the unlimited dining package (includes any and all restaurants, including a set amount at restaurants that are a la carte, like Playmakers). Gratuities are included automatically for any specialty dining reservations or packages at 18%, however adding a few extra dollars is appreciated for excellent service. These restaurants are optional, and as mentioned in the earlier section, there are plenty of great complimentary options to dine at. Think of specialty dining as a premium experience.\n\n\\- A dining package sounds great! What's the catch? A. Unlike booking a single restaurant in advance and paying the full cover charge, a dining package restricts your ability to make reservations until you are on the ship. Your preferred dining time may sell out. Go to any restaurant or a \"dining reservation\" stand in the promenade on boarding day to make all of your dining reservations if you got a dining package. **NOTE: As of early 2024, some ships are experimenting with allowing those who purchased a dining package to make reservations in advance. This is still in the process of being rolled out.**\n\n\\- WiFi: WiFi of any kind is not included in your fare. You can purchase a \"Voom\" internet package on the cruise planner in advance of your cruise or once on board. Both full sailing passes and 24 hour passes are offered on board. The 24 hour passes can't be paused, it runs continuously until it expires. It is generally a better deal to purchase these packages in advance. You can use the ship WiFi for free to use the Royal app. Since 2023, the fleet is using Starlink as their internet service provider which has resulted in considerably faster speeds.\n\n\\- The Key: This program includes some additional benefits to add to your cruise vacation. Perks are changing, so check this link for included benefits at this time: [The Key program benefits](https://www.royalcaribbean.com/faq/questions/what-are-the-benefits-of-the-key-program). The Key must be booked for everyone in a given stateroom and includes Voom Surf and Stream WiFi for each person.\n\n\\- The Spa: Spa services are not included in your cruise fare. Check the cruise planner website for current pricing. 18% gratuity is automatically added. Note that once on board, there will occasionally be spa specials, for example on port days/slower days. Sea days are the most popular times for spa services and rarely see discounts.\n\n\\- Fitness classes: Aside from morning stretch classes, fitness classes vary by ship and cost extra. Check the app to book fitness classes as they do occasionally fill up.\n\n\\- Bingo/gambling: Bingo/casino gambling is, of course, not included in your cruise fare. If you plan to gamble in the casino, you must be 18 years of age or older. The casino operates in USD. Plan on bringing cash, otherwise ATMs are available for a $6.95 surcharge. Additionally, if you don't have casino status, you can charge your room for a surcharge for table games. You can charge your room for slot machines at no additional charge. Ask the casino host for instructions. Bingo can be purchased with your SeaPass card and charged to your on board account, cash is not accepted. Scratch off cards are available from the Cashier's Desk in the casino and must be purchased with cash. **NOTE: If you have certain tiers of casino status, the table game surcharge for charging your room will be waived.**\n\n\\- Laundry: With the exception of those with high enough Crown and Anchor status, laundry is not included. You can pay per item or ask your stateroom attendant for a \"wash and fold\" bag. You can fill the bag with as many clothing items as you can (it holds a lot) for a set price, usually $34.99. If you have your bag picked up for your morning room cleaning, it is usually returned by the evening of the following day unless you pay for the express option. Note that clothes are all washed together in hot water and dried on high heat. Do not use this service for sensitive items.\n\n# Topic 4: Excursions\n\n\\- How do I book excursions? A. Excursions are a great way to explore new destinations. You can book excursions through Royal Caribbean on the cruise planner or app. Excursions can sell out, so book as early as possible. If you book through Royal Caribbean, the ship will wait for you in the event of delays. You can additionally go off on your own in ports of call, including booking 3rd party excursions. Keep in mind the ship will NOT wait for you if you go this route so keep an eye on the \"all aboard\" time and plan on being back early to account for possible delays.\n\n# Topic 5: Prohibited items\n\n\\- The list is extensive! Check [here](https://www.royalcaribbean.com/faq/questions/prohibited-items-onboard-policy) for the current list of prohibited items. Highlights include firearms, marijuana/THC/CBD products of ANY form, clothing irons, any other illegal drugs or weapons, and extension cords. Check the link above for the full list.\n\n\\*Drones can be brought on board but are not permitted to be used on Royal Caribbean ships or at any Royal Caribbean private destination (Coco Cay, Labadee).\n\n\\*Please do not ask how to sneak marijuana on board on the subreddit, you will immediately be banned from making new posts as this has been covered extensively.\n\n# Topic 6: Things to bring with\n\n\\- One 750 mL bottle of wine is permitted PER PERSON. Keep these bottles in your carry on luggage, do NOT give luggage containing wine to the porters when you arrive at the port, you must hand carry wine on board. You may be charged a corkage fee if drinking your wine in a restaurant on board, though in practice, this is rarely assessed. You can ask for wine glasses at any bar. Wine can be consumed anywhere on the ship if you put it in a glass first, but may only be provided to those over 21 years of age on North American sailings.\n\n\\- I'll list some items from my personal cruise packing list here: passport, COVID vaccine card (or picture of it), ear plugs, toothbrush/toothpaste, shampoo (though a 2-in-1 shampoo/body wash is provided in your cabin), sunscreen, sun hat, reusable water bottle, flip flops, long pants/clothing for formal nights, pen, gum, books, beach bag, sunglasses, masks if you choose, rechargeable battery packs.\n\n\\*You do NOT need to bring towels. Towels can be checked out for free with your SeaPass card. Be sure to return them by the end of the cruise, otherwise it is $25/towel.\n\n\\*\\*This list will be expanded over time. Add suggestions to the comments below!\n\n# Topic 7: Smoking on board\n\n\\- Ships are non-smoking with the exception of designated smoking areas (typically in the casino and on one side of the top deck, usually port side. Some larger ships have additional smoking areas on lower outdoor decks, such as deck 5 starboard side on Quantum class ships). Look for signage indicating designated smoking areas.\n\n\\- No, you can't smoke on your balcony. It is a major fire hazard. Don't do it. If caught, it is a $250 USD fine and you risk getting kicked off the ship.\n\n\\- You must be at least 21 years of age to purchase, possess, or use tobacco on sailings beginning in U.S. ports. For sailings beginning in all other ports, the minimum age is 18 years old.\n\n# Topic 8: Crown and Anchor Society\n\n\\- What is the Crown and Anchor (CA) society? A. This is Royal's loyalty program. It operates on a point system, where every night you spend on board a ship counts as one point. If you sail in a double occupancy room solo or in a suite, you get two points per night. If you sail solo AND in a suite, you get three points per night.\n\n\\- Points never expire and accrue over your lifetime. Additionally, you can \"status match\" your spouse and dependent children under 18. At the time your children turn 18, their status falls back to the true number of points they have earned at that time. To status match family, call the C&A Society at (800) 526-9723 to make the request. For example, I am Diamond Plus and could status match my spouse after their first cruise to automatically be Diamond Plus, as well.\n\n\\- Benefits improve as you move up through the various tiers of the program. Tiers start with Gold status at 3 points, Platinum at 30 points, Emerald at 55 points, Diamond at 80 points, Diamond Plus at 175 points and Pinnacle Club at 700 points.\n\n\\- A notable benefit includes **4, 5, and 6 free drinks per day, per person** for those that are Diamond, Diamond Plus and Pinnacle, respectively. A full list of benefits can be found on [this website](https://www.royalcaribbean.com/crown-anchor-society). Pinnacle Club members also receive a free cruise for reaching Pinnacle, plus additional free cruises at pre-determined point levels thereafter! These drinks also work at Royal Caribbean's private destinations (Coco Cay/Labadee)!\n\n\\- I'm missing points! A. No worries - give them a call at (800) 526-9723 and they can look up your cruise and give you credit. Points may take 10 business days to post after coming off a sailing so make sure to allow a few weeks first if it was a recent cruise.\n\n# Topic 9: Coco Cay/Labadee\n\n\\- What is Coco Cay and Labadee? A. These are two fantastic private destinations offered by Royal Caribbean on many Caribbean sailings. Coco Cay is a private island that is part of the Berry Islands in the Bahamas. It was just fully renovated in 2019 (now called \"Perfect Day at Coco Cay\") with new attractions such as the elevated Coco Beach Club and Thrill Waterpark (both at an extra cost) along with many new free dining options. Labadee is on a peninsula in northern Haiti and is a private destination for Royal Caribbean, as well. Both locations are free to explore, with many complimentary beaches including chairs and umbrellas as well as ample complimentary dining options and activities. I would absolutely recommend both locations and would also suggest checking out some of the video tours on YouTube to get a sense of both places.\n\n\\- 2023 Update: Announced in June 2023, Royal's sister brand Celebrity will begin calling on Perfect Day at Coco Cay in mid-2024! These bookings are live on the Celebrity site now. (I'm booked on Celebrity Beyond in June, 2024 with a stop at Coco Cay!)\n\n\\- I purchased a beverage/WiFi package. Can I use them at the private destinations? A. Yes! Both packages seamlessly transition to Coco Cay and Labadee. Additionally, the Bahamas typically charges an additional tax on purchases including drinks. So for example your $14 cocktail would be more like $14 plus 15% Bahamas sales tax plus 18% automatic gratuity. That can add up quickly. If you have a DBP or use Diamond/D+/Pinnacle drink vouchers, you do not need to pay any additional tax and your drinks are fully included.\n\n\\- What costs extra? A. While you can have a fantastic complimentary day at both destinations, there are some extra purchases you can make. You will see excursions like snorkeling on offer on the cruise planner. Additionally both locations offer various types of cabanas for rent for the day. Coco Cay offers the Coco Beach Club, an exclusive beach area with a (fantastic) restaurant for lunch. You do have to pay extra to access this area, though lunch is included in the cost (I recommend the fried lobster sandwich with a \\*side\\* of filet and a Coco Cuvee for a beverage, thank me later). One thing to note: drinks are not included with admission to Coco Beach Club - you can pay a la carte or with a beverage package/voucher. You can also choose to spend a half or full day at Thrill Waterpark, which also costs extra. There is also a dining location called Captain Jack's right at the entrance to the island that is a la carte pricing.\n\n**NEW FOR 2024!** Hideaway Beach is a new adults-only beach area including a heated pool and ample beach seating along with new dining venues, including a sports bar and the first pizza option at Coco Cay. This area is now open and typically costs $35-65 per guest, must be 18 years or older.\n\n\\- How do I pay for things at these destinations? A. Coco Cay and Labadee accept SeaPass card for all transactions with the exception of the straw markets which now take both SeaPass or USD. I recommend bringing some extra cash with you in case you wish to tip bartenders or servers, especially those that are running drinks to your beach chair.\n\nPro tip: Some itineraries (like my December 2022 Odyssey of the Seas sailing) hit both of these destinations in the same sailing! This provides great value as your drink package will work all day and most food is free.\n\n# Topic 10: Royal Up Program\n\n\\- What is the Royal Up program? A. The Royal Up program is offered by Royal Caribbean and presents the opportunity to participate in a blind bidding process for a room upgrade. You can find out if your booking is eligible by following [this link](https://www.royalcaribbean.com/booked/cruise-room-upgrade) (note: you may not see your booking as eligible until <30-60 days prior to your sail date and bookings made through Costco Travel are typically not eligible at all). Once on the site, you'll be presented with prices on various room upgrades. These prices are at double occupancy meaning the real rate you'll pay is 2x the listed price. This includes those traveling solo.\n\n\\- Example: You booked an interior room. On logging into the Royal Up site, you see the minimum bid for an ocean view balcony is listed at \"$200\". Regardless if there are one or two people in the room, if you win the bid you will be charged $400 for the upgrade.\n\n\\- How do I know if I won? A. You will typically be notified via email. It can happen any time up until you are already on the ship, but typically you will get a denial email prior to sailing if your bid did not qualify. If you win, you will automatically be assigned a cabin in the category that you won (NOTE: YOU DO NOT GET TO PICK YOUR STATEROOM. You run the risk of being assigned an upgraded room in a worse location.)\n\n\\- Is there a cost to the program? A. No. The only money you pay is the upgrade price you bid should your reservation bid win. If you do not get an upgrade, you will not be charged.\n\n# Topic 11: Club Royale\n\n\\- What is Club Royale? A. Club Royale is the casino loyalty program for Royal Caribbean.\n\n\\- Are drinks free at the casino? A. No - only for those who reach prime level or higher (see below).\n\n\\- How do I earn points? A. Points are earned by inserting your SeaPass card into a slot machine prior to play or placing it on the table games to be scanned. Earning rates vary, typically slots earn the fastest with 1 point per $5 coin-in. Tables are based on theoretical loss compared to your time played.\n\n\\- What can I earn? A. Perks can be lucrative including free drinks while in the casino and free cruises! Check out the earning tiers [here](https://www.royalcaribbean.com/experience/cruise-casinos/rewards). Reaching \"Prime\" status is typically the first step towards rewards as it comes with free casino drinks and a free cruise. This typically involves earning 2,500 points, or approx $12,500 coin-in on the slot machine.\n\n\\*Obligatory please gamble responsibly! The perks may be good, but the casino is better. I promise. You will likely not come out ahead, but if you are able to have fun and earn some points, enjoy! If you have a gambling problem or wish to self-exclude, please talk to guest services at the beginning of your cruise.\n\n# Topic 12: Community Pro Tips\n\nHave a pro tip? These pointers are awesome and come from comments from the previous FAQ! Have a pro tip you want included? Write it in the comments with \"Pro Tip\" at the beginning of the post so I don't miss it!\n\n1. Each stateroom has a small safe\n2.

            "Sad to see this happening, I went to Labadee back in September last year for my very first cruise, and even though it's just a glorified private resort and not a real part of the island, it was my first time ever stepping into a different country so it's a little special to me. Hopefully, things get better soon. I'd love to go back one day!",
            "Anyone know how far forward RC has gone for itinerary changes? Labadee is our only stop on Indy in the middle of April.",
            "My favorite itineraries are those that include Labadee + Coco Cay.  I\u2019m eying one on Indy for January \u201825 because the Bahamas aren\u2019t always warm in the winter.  Hopefully things turn around soon.",
            "Labadee was changed to Nassau for our July trip. \nI\u2019m so bummed. The posts were open for sooo many  other nearby  locations. I spent $6k on a cruise to go to Nassau?! This stinks.",
            "We went in March and absolutely loved the resort. However the local sellers were terrifying. I had heard rumors that they were aggressive and kind of scary but I wasn't expecting it to be as bad as it was. They pulled my daughter and I apart and kept us separated and one guy actually reached into my bag and took my cash. Definitely recommend going as it's absolutely beautiful but not I probably would advise against buying anything. We waited until we got back to Miami and went to a Haitian market by our hotel and got souvenirs there, we ended up finding much more interesting and unique items. \n\nIt was our first cruise, and we traveled solo, just the two of us. Had we not had fun on the ship itself it very well might have ruined our whole experience and turned us off completely. However we just booked our second one for September. \ud83e\udee3",

        "content": "Just got off the 8 day 7 night Western Caribbean cruise on Enchantment of the Seas.  We were very happy with our experience.  We went for our 25th anniversary and had a wonderful time.  We had booked a guarantee Ocean View and got obstructed ocean view.  Tried to royal up but didn\u2019t get upgraded.  In the end it didn\u2019t matter even though we joked about being in steerage.  I honestly think we could probably do an inside stateroom next time.  Housekeeping was amazing.  Loved the main dining room.  My husband liked the buffet.  I thought it wasn\u2019t too bad but could skip it.  Bingo wasn\u2019t worth it.  Galley tour and brunch was fun.  We didn\u2019t do a lot of the shows but loved to sit out watching the ocean on Deck 5.  It is a smaller boat so the ride wasn\u2019t as smooth as some of the big boats, especially when they went fast.  My husband was grateful for the Bonine.  Cozumel?  Meh.  Seems like people went to drink.  Excursions were not well organized.  Shopping experience:  Effy\u2019s?  Overpriced.  Cariloha?  Overpriced?  Del Sol?  Cool and more reasonable.  Roatan?  Amazing!  Belize?  My husband liked it.  It was ok but I could skip it.  Costa Maya?  Didn\u2019t leave the port area.  It was crowded but ok. \n\nWith the service and food quality in the main dining room, you really don\u2019t need the speciality restaurants.  We did do Chops one night.  It was nice but I won\u2019t do it again.  Favorite foods?  Key Lime Pie, Vegetable Pot Pie, French Onion Soup, Wild Mushroom Soup and, despite preferring the MDR, I did enjoy the fried rice on the buffet.",

            "I\u2019m doing symphony in October and never watched/read a bad thing about the ship. Been to this itinerary in Bahamas many times before and its dope\u2026there\u2019s plenty to do if you do your research.",

            "I did liberty to Bermuda last month, we got to Bermuda at like 10am and the ship left around 4pm the next day",
            "Yes. You can get off the ship at like 9am on Day 3 and it doesn\u2019t leave until like 5pm Day 4. The ship doesn\u2019t move at night. I don\u2019t think you even need to spend the Day 3 night on the ship if you wanted to get a hotel in Bermuda, but I\u2019m not 100% on that.\n\n(The times are rough idea off the top of my head.)",
            "Done both, just got back from symphony.  If you have kids the symphony is likely a better choice due to more activities.  I personally felt there was too many people on the symphony, but I really liked Central Park, also symphony has Izumi (Japanese) which is better than Sabor (Mexican)\n\nI also personally don\u2019t find many of the eastern carribbean ports all that interesting, so itinerary wise it\u2019s a wash.  I will say though I enjoyed Coco Cay more than I thought.  Everything was really close and made for a great pool/beach day.\n\nOn last thing I found the 5 day a bit short for us (it\u2019s a 4 hour drive to port for us) and prefer to do the 7 nighter."
