            "Sometimes i feel all hype and pressure for india is dragging their performance, hopefully this time not as i feel its less hype compared to wc 2023 final\n\nThere was post saying is Rohit the greatest captain of all time , bruh i don\u2019t know what op was even thinking \n\nThere are lot of things other than having trophies , like captain should set a legacy and impact",

            "Look, as much as I despise the BCCI, the venue for the semis being fixed for us wasn\u2019t really their fault, it\u2019s down to the ICC wanting to maximise Indian viewership via prime time slotting. So if you really wanna blame someone in this case it should be them. I would have jumped on the BCCI bad train with y\u2019all if they had pulled some shit like \u201crequesting\u201d the ICC to have all their super 8 games there",
