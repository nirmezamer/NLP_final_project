Come, cousin, don't be obtuse. **My mother taught you well**. Give me your Sardaukar.\"\n\nDoesn't Leto mean his grandmother Jessica? Or is he actually referring to Chani here? I thought it might have been a whoopsie on Franks part, but saw no one talking about it online so I'm wondering if I'm actually missing something.",

            "i want to believe it's an error as well\n\nbut early in that chapter, only a few pages prior to this line, there's this (emphasis my own):\n\n> Jessica sighed, shifted her attention to Leto on the throne. A\ngiant canopic jar containing the water of Muad'Dib occupied a\nplace of honor at his right elbow. He'd boasted to Jessica that his\nfather-within laughed at this gesture even while admiring it.\n\n> That jar and the boasting had firmed her resolve not to participate in this ritual. **As long as she lived, she knew she could never\naccept Paul speaking through Leto's mouth.** She rejoiced that\nHouse Atreides had survived, but the things-that-might-have-been\nwere beyond bearing.\n\ngiven that the author has a habit of dropping plots/themes like easter eggs in the text sometimes, almost hiding it intentionally *instead* of making sure the reader is following along, i can't be sure it is an error\n\nEDIT: like, potentially, the author thought it would be cute and enjoy *tricking* the reader into thinking she is saying \"speaking thru Leto's mouth\" in the typical way we usually say that, as a metaphor, and then drop a breadcrumb later for a close reading to realize, oh shit, maybe she means *literally* talking thru his mouth... just seems like something this author would do lol",
            "It\u2019s Paul\u2019s memories speaking through Leto like we see him do with Duncan at the beginning",
            "Yeah it probably is an error. I guess you could rationalize it by saying that Leto *is* Paul, in a way, but yeah it seems like a mess up. That scene is just Leto talking to Farad\u2019n. But, I think you\u2019ll find it amusing how Leto is able to use his inner lives later. \n\nThere are a couple others in Children. They could also be editing errors. Are you reading the paperback? I posted about this before. There is a complete glitch in the text where a line is repeated and it doesn\u2019t make sense, and then the conversation resets. This is when Gurney is talking to Leto and the Preacher. There is also a part where Ghani is referring to the multitude within her and the text says \u201cI am just my father\u2019s daughter\u201d but it clearly should read \u201cI am *not* just my father\u2019s daughter.\u201d",
            "And this is set up earlier in the book when Leto and Chani play the \u201cparent game\u201d and each speak to each other, Leto as Paul, Ghanima as Chani.\n\nEdit: but upon further thinking, I do not think this is an error or that it is Paul speaking through Leto. I made a comment upthread about what I think\u2026",
            "It is not an error. Just before this, as Leto is trying to convince him to take Ghanima as concubine, he says:\n\n> \"As my mother was not wife, you will not be husband,\" Leto said. \"But perhaps there will be love, and that will be enough.\" \n\nLeto is referring to Chani in both cases not as someone who Farad\u2019n met or knew personally, but rather as someone Farad\u2019n knew of, and is an example of this sort of political marriage that Leto is trying to arrange, which also occurs in the first novel. Leto means that Farad\u2019n can learn from Chani\u2019s example, but it is also confusing because Jessica was also concubine and trained Farad\u2019n in Bene Gesserit ways.",
            "To me it felt like it didn't really make sense for it to be Paul speaking and Farad'n not reacting. We're talking about the Dune series here where every character is aware of every minute detail that's happening around them. I'm choosing to believe that that was an oopsie on FK part, that's *my* canon \n\nI read [this](https://store.gollancz.co.uk/products/children-of-dune) paperback edition and I did notice some small glitches in the text like two words stuck together, but nothing major like what you described.",
            "My initial thought was that perhaps Paul sort of \"came forward\" in that moment.",

            "The one guy said \u201cno shields\u201d so I assume the shields would have attracted worms. Doesn\u2019t look like any of them use shields outside of the city",
            "It was a gun similar or the same to what the Harkonnens are wielding. They can\u2019t use shields out in the desert because it attracts the worms. \n\nThey don\u2019t normally patrol that far out for that exact reason, but Rabban was trying to get Spice production back on track.",
            "I think they used Mala Pistols, and they were hidden among the rocks and crevasses on the plateau. \n\nThe entire worm summoning was to get them on top of that plateau into an ambush. \n\nWhen Stilgar and the other Fremen move out, one most likely split from the group and planted that thumper. \n\nThe rest, climbed the plateau. ( We see them rock climb in the movie, and I assume they know a quick way to the top ) \n\nThe Harkonnen, are too worried about the worm to clear the plateau. Thus, they completely miss the hidden Fremen using their clothes to blend into the rock. Then they open fire, and probably attack with knives. \n\nThe entire ambush was a genius way to lure the Harkonnen troops into close quarters. Negating the Harkonnen advantage with laz guns.",
            "Its from the book. It is a spring-loaded rifle, called a Maula. It fires a metal dart, and is REALLY accurate. (The Freman are sharpshooters that prefer headshots in order to not ruin the victims stillsuit. This is the same reason why -in the book- they strip down to their underwear when they duel.)",
            "For what i saw they used Maula pistols, i like that shows how potent theyre cuz i remember reading that they had a big range even though theyre dart guns essentially",
            "The books make it much more clear that the Fremen have their own self-sufficient industry and that they don't rely on off worlders for weapons.",
            "They were using lasers, you just can't really see them in the bright sunlight. You'll notice the same thing from the \"machine gun\" lasers they use in their ornithopters - in the clip where they're attacking the harvester, you can't see the lasers coming out, but later during the night fight in the city you can.",
            "If \"floating\" tech is available to Harkonnen rank and file, wouldn't worms be easily avoided?",
            "Definitely maula pistols. The Harkonnens start shooting their lasguns but you see some bullet tracers aimed at them in certain shots."
