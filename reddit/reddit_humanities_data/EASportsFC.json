            "Dupe theory's gotta be real, today I've gotten 4 different icons once (Desailly, Mcmanaman, Trez and Zanetti) and then Rijkaard x7, Rui Costa x4, and Xabi Alonso x3 lmao. All in from about 400 82+ picks & their exchange packs. At one point I got dupe Rijkaard and dupe Rui Costa in the same 27x gold player pack",

            "Bottled 14 wins for second week in a row but I couldn't care less. I got Messi and James from 94+ picks. Last week I got Bacha and Stanley lol.",
            "I won all my play off games last week, gone 0-5 this week. Cant touch my opponents.",
            "Hardest champs all year that, needed 2 wins and just gave them away to take 7. Couldnt be bothered anymore.",
            "Who else is having their worst qualies all year. i always get 6 wins minimum easily in qualies but ive lost my first 5 today",
            "Worst start ever but still got 11 wins for red Haaland. This year I've got all the best attakeys but missing in defence massively.",
            "How the fuck is everyone allowed to fucking foul me? Not only that, my players fall over at the slightest touch, while my opponent stays on his feet even after losing the ball, continues their running animation and without even trying runs into my players before my passing or ball roll animation is even finished. What the actual fuck?",
            "Div2, 11 Wins best pull was TOTS Lewa. Did some sbcs with the fodder and got.....more fodder.",
            "Yep. Only got 8 wins last week. Might just get my 6 and get out. Lol",
            "Gameplay in playoffs is much smoother and you can actually enjoy it. I enjoy no matter the result. Champions are totally different gameplay and lag"

Don't think EA expected anybody to get to season2/3 lmao.\n\nI read online that it is because EA barely put effort into career because it doesn't make them much money, and FUT is where it's at for them. Since I don't play FUT and just offline career (and an occasional online match with a buddy) I'm pretty shocked at how poorly career mode is. It's full of bugs, glitch and shenanigans =/",

            "Its so typical. I dont even see this as a career mode issue, just a UI one. Recently came back to the game since I upgraded to a series console and every time without fail I have to restart the game to open packs because they dont show up properly and are all bugged out.",
            "I mean.. I could add the bugs that sometimes a match does not register after completing, simming a match to the end after you scored a hat-trick will not count and you lose all progress in the match, when you get called for international match duty you suddenly lose all training options (no exp) and your overall rating for the club team you play for gets lower because they think you didn't show up (bugged obv), etc etc etc.. \n\n(not to speak of the ABSURD contract goals you have to complete to stay in the club.. Scored 120 goals, 41 assists and won all cups? Nope, you're fired BECAUSE you didn't have a goal conversion rate of 80%, but 75%....... Wtf hahah).\n\nBut I thought this one was just funny because it's so easy to fix and they never did :P\n\nCan understand the FUT issue you're having is super annoying and frustrating.. Can only imagine that's one of many bugs for FUT haha"
