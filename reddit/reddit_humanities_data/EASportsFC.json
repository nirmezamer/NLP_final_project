Examples:\n\nUsing 4321 formation, Balanced with Direct Passing, 67 depth,  my players stamina is gone by the 70\u2019 minute. But using 100 depth and pressure on heavy touch don\u2019t seem to consume stamina at all. Wtf?\n\nWhy can my opponent catch me from behind or any angle really and easily take the ball. What button combination do you use to actually tackle? I use R1 + Circle.\n\nHow can I get my players to press, why when I get the ball I am surrounded by opponents but when they get the ball my players go picnic?(even with 2nd man press)\n\nWhy do my opponents players perform gymnastics moves to intercept my passing lanes easily, and my players, placed perfectly, seem to ignore the ball, or, even if they touch it, it gets back to the opponent?\n\nWhy does my 97 rated keeper NEVER catch the ball? Always corners or badly placed rebounds?\n\nI\u2019m willing to give 1 or 2 million coins if someone can help me out here, or in private.\n\nI\u2019m not a headless chicken, I keep my back line in formation, is use R1 to trigger sprints and stuff like that, but I do not abuse mechanics, and don\u2019t use Player Lock, Flick Volleys and other gimmicks.\n\nThanks.",

            "All that you just mentioned, it happens vice-versa, the sad thing is that we're all guilty of being oblivious to it and only notice and complain when it happens to us, so what I can say though is try not to let get to you, if you can tell that you're going to lose your head, take a breather, maybe chill off the game for a bit, relax coz yes the game can get really intense and frustrating at times. \n\nSo while I can't really give you the answers you were looking for, the one thing I can say is to help with your mental illness, don't let the game consume you like this, the calmer you are, the more relaxed you, the better you'll be at managing games rather than making rash challenges or getting frustrated by how your opponent did something. \n\nHope that helps in some way.",
            "Provocative post. Those things happen against us but also in our favour, but we simply ignore them when we win. The only thing I hate is those flick volleys and corners but it's just poor gamecode, keep in mind we had el tornado crosses spam in pro tournaments back in a day",
            "Honestly best thing I did recently was experiment with different formations rather than chase the meta 4321 and work out what works best for me and my playstyle and then find the best players to work with that formation. Will take some time to adapt but worth it and you will have more fun on the game",
            "That's just your perception. The game isn't coded speciifically against you and your opponents likely feel the same from time to time.\n\n\n\n1) it does make a difference but not massive. Relentless and relentless+ especially are fantastic playstyles and you can basically use a relentless+ player on full stamina for 120 mins on any pressing tactic. Midfielders under 94 stamina with no relentless will be done by 70\n\n\n\n2) I think bruiser helps with that behind tackle. But r1+O is just for strong tackle and has a slower animation you only really want to you use it front on.  If you are using advanced defending the seal out is best for that tackle.\n\n\n\n3) team press, constant pressure, 2nd man press, good manual defending and player switching \n\n\n\n4) intercept+ does get some good animations but otherwise you're passing too close to them. Pinged passing with a player with the playstyle is usually good at getting through. And although rare, Tiki taka+ gets through when it really shouldn't.\n\n\n\n5) mostly to do with the shot type you're facing if they are finessing far post and you move your keeper that way they catch it a little more often. But finesse and power shots often get you a corner.\n\n\n\n6) player lock isn't a gimmick. It's a good feature that finally gave us an answer to bad AI runs and is a good balance of requiring some skill and being rewarded. Very few players around 900+ skill rating just ignore it completely.",
            "My last opponent won 5-2 he scored from 2 cross play and 3 corners. His strikers are Drogba and of course 97 Haaland. And I have both CBs with Aerial+. Besides this, I Have all the same problems you just mentioned.",
            "This kind of stuff happens to everyone. It\u2019s got nothing to do with how good or bad you are at the game, these things will still happen unfortunately. It\u2019s mainly down to the game. Obviously there are a few things you can do to get yourself out of these situations. For instance, when you feel like your players are getting chased down by a defender and they are going to catch you, be ready for it. Slow down your player as they get closer to try and turn them as if they don\u2019t let go of sprint they will go straight past you. If you\u2019re near the touch line and don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible, try and win the throw so you keep the ball. The thing with all the things mentioned is, you will get these things happen in your favour as well in some games",
            "Best way to get better is to watch better players play.\n\nJohn sims on youtube has a lot of videos breaking down his gameplay and hes a top 200 player.",
            "My mindset is based around trying to minimize the \u201crandomness\u201d as much as possible. My personal biggest improvement from 11 to 14-16 wins and finally 18 wins this past weekend has been remaining patient on defense and trusting that I will eventually win the ball back with second man pressing. Defense was/is my biggest weakness by far, so this might not even be relevant to you. \nOther small details that have helped me minimize randomness include utilizing powershot+. That really helps me in those games where it feels like their keeper is saving everything, including finesses that I would regularly be scoring. Green timed finishes have also significant improved my conversion rate, particularly on finesses. \nTakes a few games to get comfy with these mechanics, but it\u2019s very worth it. And somebody at your level is very capable at picking up these skills quickly. Best of luck to you going forward!",
            "Bro you're rockin the 4321 with direct passing, off course you're going to be vulnerable defensively. Your tactics relies on outscoring your op in the 1st half. Direct passing will drain your teams stamina, no wonder why you don't use other game mechanics, that tactic will spread out your players and drain their stamina.",
