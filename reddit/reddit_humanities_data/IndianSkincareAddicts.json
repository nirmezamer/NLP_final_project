        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/1dqq1eg/an_easy_effective_technique_preventing_postacne/",
        "content": "#The backstory\n\nThis method is a tried and tested one I've been using for several months now, with great success.\n\nI'd seen people online using and suggesting it often, but they were usually white \ud83d\ude43 and didn't have PIH (post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation AKA brown acne marks) so I guess it never occurred to me that it could help with that - it didn't occur to me that _anything_ could help _prevent_ that, TBH \ud83d\ude02 As most people with brown skin know, post acne marks stick around way longer and can be even more frustrating than the pimples themselves.\n\nI finally decided to give it a shot when I saw [this Alexandra Anele video](https://youtu.be/Q8ok_8f5Q4M?si=AHcRu-59CmbWRHDf) on how she treats a pimple before covering it with makeup. The technique helps to hydrate, soothe, flatten and, in the long-term, heal the pimple faster. It also happens to resolve the crusty areas and lessen any swelling that makes the bump noticeable if you do want to conceal it with makeup.\n\n#The technique \n\nYou will need: Vaseline, lanolin, Boroline or any other kind of thick healing balm or ointment or occlusive. Thick barrier repair moisturisers also work well, you just need something that will stay in place and doesn't melt or smear away. It doesn't matter which kind, so long as you know it suits your skin. \n\nIf you are afraid of using something thick because you think it may cause acne, then a blob of a gel or gel-cream moisturiser is the next best option, since they do form a transparent film when they dry down, and that creates a barrier as well. This doesn't work as well as a proper occlusive, since it doesn't keep the area as moist, but it definitely helps.\n\nIt's simple - simply put a light dab of Vaseline/occlusive over the spot as a last step in your skincare routine (before sunscreen, because you do want the spot to be well protected from the sun). \n\nReapply to make sure it doesn't dry out, if necessary, throughout the day. A thin layer of Vaseline or lanolin works fine, and you can apply sunscreen etc. over it without it being particularly noticeable. Using translucent powder or compact over it will mattify it more, while still keeping that moist protective layer intact underneath. \n\nIf you'd rather not do this in the daytime at all, doing it as a last step only at night does help with faster healing, although it's not quite as effective. \n\nAvoid medicated products, or ones with acids, since the purpose of this is simply to PROTECT THE HEALING SPOT. It's to keep the area moist, which helps skin heal faster, and block any air or irritants from stimulating melanin from forming - our skin forms melanin to protect itself \u2764\ufe0f So if you provide that protection proactively, it doesn't have to work overtime!\n\n#When to use it\n\nPimple patches help me a lot to heal pustules fast, but removing them leaves an exposed wound that always left a mark. Granted, my pimples leave a mark regardless \ud83d\ude43 Everyone's skin responds a bit differently, of course, but I know some people find that using the patch leaves worse pigmentation than just letting the pimple heal on its own (even if it does take longer). \n\nUsing drying spot treatments can also cause worse pigmentation, since it's basically stressing the skin in that one spot and could be causing barrier damage, dehydration, irritation etc. Thankfully a lot of the spot treatments that are now available have moisturising properties as well, to prevent this - once the active stage of the pimple is resolved, switching from a spot treatment to an occlusive can help with preventing the spot from turning darker.\n\nSo dabbing an occlusive is for AFTER THE PUS STAGE of the pimple is resolved, whether by itself or by using a patch/treatment over it. At this point, it's no longer an infection, and we want to treat it like A HEALING WOUND, just like a surgical incision or anything else that could leave a scar.\n\nUsing it on active pimples won't really do much, in my experience. I personally use a pimple patch only when I see pus beginning to form OR if a bump has gotten painful, and the physical protection offers some relief. It can take a few days for a patch to encourage pus to be drawn out, and for the sebaceous plug within the pustule to come off with the patch. After that I make sure to keep the spot covered with lanolin.\n\n#The results\n\nI find there to be a vast improvement in post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (brown marks) AND erythema (reddish marks) when I use this technique vs when I don't. Yes, I still develop a bit of a pinky brown mark, but far lighter than usual. It also fades that much quicker.\n\nAnother benefit I notice is that the bump left by the pimple flattens out faster. My skin tends to form scar tissue quite easily, so this was a big annoyance of mine, how a pimple would leave a firm bump for weeks after. Seeing the overall healing of even cysts and larger pustules happen more rapidly is SO satisfying \ud83d\ude06\ud83e\udd0c\ud83c\udffc\n\nRather than a brown mark forming and darkening in a day or two, that sticks around, you can expect to see the area stay a pinkish colour and gradually return to a flesh-tone, just a shade or two darker than your skin, as it heals. Within a week or so, my marks are a light brown, with some lingering redness. I continue to dab lanolin on them for a couple weeks, usually, at which point I no longer notice them.\n\nLike with most things, it turns out prevention is a lot easier than treatment. And if you couldn't help yourself, and have picked or popped that pimples, then I'd suggest you use a patch to make sure the pus is out, then keep the spot covered with occlusive - the body can heal all manner of sins.\n\n#Pimples vs acne\n\nThere's a big difference between getting ocassional pustules or even cysts vs getting a larger number or area of inflamed, red pimples. A lot of people see a single or ocassional pimple and freak out, use a lot of potent products on it, and either irritate their skin overall, damaging their skin barrier, or end up causing irritation that spreads the infection and leads to actual acne. Partially a self-induced situation \ud83d\ude05 God knows, I've been there - and if you've ever been a skin picker with acne-prone skin, you probably have, too!\n\nI find it helps to remember - once you see a pimple, half of its life cycle it already over. The formation and infection stage was days before it even became visible, so once you see it, its already on its way out. The best way to handle it, in my long experience of years going through all the stages of acne grief (often simultaneously, it feels like) is to stay calm and stick to the plan I've decided on beforehand, that I already know is going to work, given time. \n\nIndividual pimples can be treated with pimple patches or spot treatments, if you find that your skin responds well to them, but I think it's important to recognise that they also HEAL BY THEMSELVES. And perhaps one of the hardest parts of having a swollen, inflamed pimple is sitting on your hands and having the patience to not mess with it and make it worse \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nA lot of lone pimples resolve themselves in time, and whatever we do in the meantime, hehe, is kind of timepass, to some extent \ud83d\ude05 But even timepass is important, if it keeps us too occupied to make things worse! Hence my penchant for soothing face masks - great to soothe anxiety as you're being patient, and helps skin calm down along the way.\n\n#What about my whole ass skincare routine for acne??\n\nThe reality is that even with a good, effective routine for acne - retinoids, exfoliating acids, soothing barrier support, diligent sun protection, etc. (or all of the above), if you are acne-prone it's very likely you will still get ocassional individual pimples. Whether that's menstruation related or stress or diet related, or down to a change in weather - THIS DOES NOT MEAN YOUR ROUTINE ISN'T WORKING. \n\nYes, acne-prone skin is best managed through using all-over products to prevent and treat clogged pores, inflammation etc. that could otherwise lead to acne, but a couple pimples are to be expected (especially if you ate a mango a day this summer, like yours truly, or have other human experiences like IDK the stress of being a sentient being in this timeline).\n\nContinue to use your chosen routine. A random pimple or two does not negate that your skin is healthy, functioning well, and well-loved \ud83e\udd70 It's the overall picture that matters, and that's a fact would have served me well to know as a self-critical, anxious young person who simply had a super common and natural acne-prone skin type.\n\nThis technique is an easy (and practically free) one to add to your routine as it is.\n\nHaving and managing my acne-prone skin has really been as much about mindset as products or ingredients, and making sure I'm not getting in the way of my own skin and it's natural cycles. That's the point I hope to convey \u263a\ufe0f \n\nHope this was helpful. Let me know if it works for ya! It's an easy thing to try for yourself, and if any of y'all have methods that have worked to prevent pimples from leaving dark spots, I'm curious to hear them, too.",
