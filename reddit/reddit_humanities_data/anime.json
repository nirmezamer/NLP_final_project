            "> This is the place!\n\nMenou my beloved! This is one of the anime that I enjoyed enough to check out the LNs, which in turned I enjoyed enough to keep reading over the years whenever a new volume comes out. I'd love to see another season someday, the story goes interesting places.",
            "This just popped up in my head, there was an anime I sometime watched several years ago. All i can really remember is the main guy looking similar to the guy from plastic memories and\u2026. Bouncy chests. I\u2019m fairly certain it\u2019s some kind of demon (isekai?) anime. I can\u2019t find it I just know it had that shiny art style and I\u2019m sure it was a broadcasted anime.",

            "Hearing the SFX section again now with the answers made me feel so dumb lmao. Like the FMA and GuP SFX are so obvious in retrospect but I was absolutely stumped when I did the quiz. Shocked at how low the bakas from Oshi no Ko and Frieren are considering how popular (and recent) those shows are. \n\nThese are always very fun, thanks for making them!"

            "\u201cOf course you did it, Todoroki\u201d",
            "This seasons been the best adapted/closes to source material since first 3 seasons , rly good so far",
            "Of all the many myriad Quirks AFO has, his natural gifts for hating and shit talking come for free. Hawks is right, second you get into a lobby with him you gotta insta mute.",
            "Glad they gave Jirou some screen time",
            "Endeavor wasn't injured, he just wanted to match with his bestie",
            "Dabi getting taken down was a good morale boost but it definitely seems too early to celebrate, especially when Tomura is still out there. Plus that mfer Spinner went from Ninja Turtle to Turtlezilla lol. \n\nEndeavor and Hawks vs the big man himself was a hell of a fight. Jiro and Tokoyami might have saved Hawks from AFO\u2019s attack, but it looks like now they\u2019re the ones who have to take on the man himself. Doesn\u2019t look too good for Team Hawks with Endeavor temporarily out of commission\u2026.",
            "That desperation in Endeavor's look in the preview.",
            "Dope episode. Curious to see what AFO chicanery is going to be pulled for Dabi (obviously glad that he isn't in the final war for one episode, but that was such a fitting thematic end to Todoroki's story), great to see the map a little bit more and noticed Deku (I think) is likely to have to go through some of these fights to get to Shigi? Could be wrong. Jirou and Tokoyami got a moment to shine with Hawks. Really excited for upcoming Endeavor stuff",
            "Earphone Jack :( At least the first save was cool.",
            "Shiggy never would\u2019ve allowed this to happen Spinner. Heartbreaking. And hey AFO spoke the truth. All he did was save Toya. His turnt o villainy was due to Endeavor still treating Shoto the same, not AFO"
