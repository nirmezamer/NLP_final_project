You can even trap her yourself now!\n\n(Anyone\u2019s who a big fan of Railgun and Kill la Kill might  also want to check out the new plushies of those series.)",

I do think that Gintoki vs Takasugi is probably in my top 3 anime fights - not for it's animation (which is good but I wouldn't call it *outstanding*), but for its sheer emotional weight. I can safely say that there aren't a lot of fights (that I've seen) that [have felt as utterly soul-crushing](https://i.imgur.com/rCqN5Ih.jpeg) as this did. Also, while I wouldn't say Takasugi has been redeemed, I think this episode did a *masterful* job at making his motivations clearer and him as a character more understandable. He might be evil, but it's hard to really blame him!<...\n\ntl;dr - it is the best arc in the entire show (so far!) and I haven't even finished it yet lol.\n\nu/KendotsX u/Shocketheth u/Shimmering-Sky [](#forgotkeys)",
            "Finished Kanata No Astra and loved it, Could it have used a little more room to breathe? Sure but you can tell the people who made it really cared about it and despite only having 12 episodes they did their best to tell a coherent story and even had a double length premiere and finale as well as cut the OP for most episodes. The characters were likeable and the their found family dynamic was very believable given the circumstances, the mystery was quite interesting and the answers were rewarding, the themes of identity, humanity and knowledge were compelling  and it also had one of the most satisfying endings I've seen which is a rare feat in of itself.",

Ever since Episode 4 I've just been waiting for an explanation for [VL spoiler] >!why Thorfinn was taken away while the rest of the crew sailed back to Iceland, especially since the one dude tried attacking Askaladd while Thorfinn was with Thors as he died so they were on the same boat. Am I supposed to assume Thorfinn willingly didn't go back to seek revenge or that one dude tries getting Thorfinn but Bjord or Askaladd halted him?!< Does this get answered? I just need a yes or no. If there's clarification stated at some point, I can sit back and wait. If it doesn't get resolved then I can't possibly like this show. It's a major plot hole that needs to get filled for me."

If you want to make this subreddit a better place, then please apply and let us know why you would be a good fit for our team!\n\nIf you're interested in applying, you should take a minute to take a look at our [mod page](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/mods) to see how we organize ourselves as well as the [rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/rules), as some questions that appear on the application will refer to them. If you have any further questions feel free to ask in this thread!\n\n# Responsibilities\n\nModerators of [/r/anime](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime) are expected to be able to execute most Reddit moderating tasks, as we don't have any divisions or specialist roles on the team. There are other optional responsibilities, like managing CSS and bots, but that's going above and beyond the base requirements.\n\nA large part of what we do is review reports on posts and comments and remove them if they break the rules of [/r/anime](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime) or Reddit in general, along with potentially banning users that have repeatedly or egregiously broken the rules. We're also expected to review and reply to moderator mail sent from users to answer questions and handle appeals for removals or bans.\n\nAside from that, we're in frequent communication with each other in our Discord server about the above as well as the future path of the subreddit, and want new moderators to be involved in our discussions as well.\n\n# Application\n\n[**Fill out the application here!**](https://forms.gle/g795TJabYS3p9Sj26)\n\nThe form will be open until [11:59 PM UTC on June 22](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/vote?iso=20240622T1159&p0=1440&font=cursive&csz=1) before we move on to review applications, and we will reach out to those chosen to become new moderators in late June. *Take your time to come up with thoughtful responses, as low effort applications will be discarded.*\n\nIf you happened to stumble across this post without knowing a lot (maybe browsing for subreddits that are recruiting mods), we really want people who are interested in *anime,* and not just the moderator role, since a lot of what we do requires having some knowledge of various series for context. Previous moderation experience isn't necessary, but we're also hoping that applicants are frequent visitors or participants of our subreddit and have at least a general understanding of how it currently functions.\n\nSo if you think you would make a good moderator for [/r/anime](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime), now's your chance! Recruiting new mods is always a very exciting process - [so we hope to see you join us soon!](https://i.imgur.com/f0QsBb5.png)",

            "Love that Dabi's biggest complaint of Shoto is how despite being his brother and Endeavour's son he chose to make friends in UA instead of training hard alone.\n\nIt's also telling that before the tournament with Deku, Shoto too had one goal of becoming stronger than his dad at any cost.\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted Talk \"Todoroki family and their genetic urge to be the last man standing\"",
            "\u201cThis week on *Keeping Up With the Todorokis*: Local man is literally too angry to die\u201d",
            "I honestly kind of pity Dabi. He couldn\u2019t control his powers and it almost killed him. Imagine being hurt by your own body\u2026 wtf. All the guy wanted was to make his dad proud. Straight up broke him and now he\u2019s literally driven by rage and resentment. Endeavor really made a monster. \n\nShoto was getting his ass beat so bad he had to do a little mid action monologuing/soul searching to fight the guy haha. Guy\u2019s fueled by the Power of Friendship too. It\u2019s the most OP quirk lol.",
            "Endeavor messed up Toya\u2019s mental state so bad that even All For One gave up on manipulating him. Even the Demon Lord himself couldn\u2019t penetrate the hold that Endeavor had on Toya\u2019s mind. Says a lot. Endeavor may not have been able to surpass All Might, but he was able to surpass All For One at one thing: fucking up a kid\u2019s mind.\n\nAnd we also get confirmation that Dabi saw his endeavor against his family as a suicide mission. He doesn\u2019t value his life at all because he has been conditioned to see himself as a failure because he wasn\u2019t able to fulfill the purpose of his birth. Endeavor neglecting him after giving him so much attention when drilling into him how important surpassing All Might was only served to make Toya feel like his existence was pointless. \n\nShoto vs. Dabi essentially operates as a more extreme Deku vs. Shoto. He\u2019s trying to get Toya to cool down and stop him from killing himself and hurting others, and he does that by fully accepting himself by uniting both sides of his quirk. Instead of constantly putting a dividing line between his mother and father, he embraces all of himself to complete his quirk. He\u2019s created a unique technique that is perfect against fire users. The development of Shoto\u2019s cold flames is interesting to theorize about as he improves his Flashfire Fist: Phosphor.",

I know Endeavour is now paying for his sins but seeing what his abuse has turned Toya into makes me feel like it's not enough. \n\nSo if I understood this correctly, Toya is supposed to be a backup for All For One just in case Shigaraki didn't work out but [because Toya is so fixated on Endeavour](https://i.imgur.com/B7u4e39.png), he wasn't able to control him and they just gave up. Also did [Toya burn down that orphanage?](https://i.imgur.com/yo0lImU.jpeg) Christ. Those kids are fucked anyway since they were all going to end up as All For One's pawns. \n\nNot gonna lie, [watching Dabi go completely wild against Shoto](https://i.imgur.com/3FVRqMp.jpeg) was pretty damn cool. Not as cool as [Shoto's new power though.](https://i.imgur.com/xeXeb37.jpeg) That's [one big baddie down!](https://i.imgur.com/MSApncz.jpeg) I'm guessing that Dabi is still alive?
