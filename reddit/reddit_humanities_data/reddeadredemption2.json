        "content": "There's been a few posts asking about the stables bug. So I'm posting a workaround as suggested by Kelly on the RDO discord. \n\nPlease refer people to this post if anyone asks about this bug.\n\n\nCurrently, there is a persistent issue around horses, wagons, and the use of the stables, including but not limited to:\n- attempting to enter the stables and becoming stuck with no menu or control\n- attempting to call out a different horse or wagon from player menu but failing to\n\nTo fix these issues, follow these steps:\n1. Flee your active horse or wagon *first*. Focus on your horse and flee it, or dismiss the wagon from the player menu. If the horse refuses to run, shoot around it to spook it into running or mash the flee button until it leaves. Make sure the horse despawns completely, as indicated by a lack of horse icon on the mini map or you see it physically disappear.\n2. You should now be able to enter the stable without the game glitching. Additionally, you can use the player menu to call your horse/wagon when out in free roam. Best done near roads.\n\n**Note:** You will need to do this any time you wish to call out a different horse or enter a stable.\nIf you get stuck in the stable, you will need to change lobbies or restart game. If you call a different horse and it does not come, wait a few minutes and try again. Eventually the game will despawn your old horse and the new one will spawn. If you fast travel and your horse is not spawning after the fast travel, it is possible it got \"stuck\" from where you fast traveled from. You will need to wait as stated above to try calling it back to you.",
