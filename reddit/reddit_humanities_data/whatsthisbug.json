        "content": "Based on recent trends, we have made some changes and clarifications to our guidelines.\n\n**1: Do not post pictures of bites or stings.** There are lots of things - many of which are not bug-related - that can cause bumps, rashes, swelling, itching, or other marks on your skin. It is impossible to tell what caused them from a picture of the symptoms. Post pictures *of the bug only*. \n\n**2: Post _helpful_ responses only.** These are responses that will lead toward an accurate identification of the bug in question. Non-helpful responses clutter up the thread and OP's inbox, hindering OP's ability to get an actual answer because people see that the post already has comments and assume that it's been answered - or because they don't want to read through a page full of non-helpful responses to see if a real answer has been offered (or if it is correct). \n\n* Joke responses are not helpful. We are not opposed to occasional humor - but only when it is part of a more substantial answer. For example, \"*That's the Pokemon Caterpie!*\" is not helpful, but \"*That's the caterpillar of a swallowtail butterfly - one of the Papilio species. This is the real-life caterpillar that the Pokemon Caterpie was based on.*\" would be fine. \n\n* Intentionally incorrect answers are not helpful. \n\n* Repeating an ID that has already been established is not helpful. If OP has already been told that they have bed bugs, they do not need dozens of people to chime in saying \"That's a bed bug!\" hours or days later. \n\n* Comments mocking or ridiculing OP for not already knowing what kind of bug it is - or for submitting a common bug - are not helpful. These include things like \"Haven't you ever seen a cockroach before?\" or \"How does anyone not know what a tick looks like?\" or \"You should just Google what bed bugs look like.\" Keep in mind that the primary purpose of this sub is *to identify bugs for people.* That includes *all* bugs - however common.\n\n**3: Do not ask for or offer pest control advice** beyond basic removal or exclusion of the bug in question or links to reliable sources or related subs such as /r/pestcontrol, /r/gardening, or /r/Bedbugs. We are not a pest control subreddit. While we understand that people are only trying to help, some of the \"advice\" that has been offered in the past has ranged from totally unnecessary (exterminating a harmless or even beneficial bug simply for existing) to excessive or even dangerous (irresponsible or excessive use of pesticides or other toxic chemicals). \n\n**4: No medical or veterinary advice** beyond identifying dangers and linking to a reliable resource such as the CDC. Personal opinions and anecdotes will be removed.\n\n**5: Refrain from posting inflammatory or anti-bug rhetoric** like *\"WTF is this nightmare fuel?\"*, *\"Do I need to burn my house down?\"* or *\"What kind of demon is this?\"*",

            "We can still bug the OP for geographic location, right? /s",
            "Can we make it a rule that ID requests are photo only. My personal experience is video of a small moving insect really doesn\u2019t lend itself to being identified.\n\nAt least with a photo, especially on a phone, can easily be zoomed to see more detail.",
            "What about pictures of plastic bugs or toys?",
            "Can I ask about a toy bug? They're toy beetles, but I want to know what they are.",
            "I would prefer it if the rules were relaxed slightly once the bug has been identified correctly and the correct identification has enough upvotes. But that's up to you, these are good rules.\n\nI assume partial ID is also helpful? E.g. when I know something is a type of fly (but definitely not what species or subgroup) and definitely not a wasp, then I like to be able to say that.",
            "Can I post pictures of some eggs I found on my houseplants? They're not exactly bugs, but they're going to turn into bugs and I'd love some help identifying them!",
            "Yeah, that's fine. It's the other option - making fun of them for not knowing - that is not appropriate.",
            "In my experience it's a useful diagnostic criterion: with mites, way more posts are shaky, low-res videos than still photos. I hypothesize it's a kind of anti-memetic camouflage. However the acarologists have stopped returning my emails so this theory has yet to receive mainstream scientific attention.",
            "Yes, we get requests for those from time to time. Just be clear in your title that you know they are toys and you want to know what kind of beetles they represent. Otherwise you'll end up with a bunch of people telling you that they're toys or accusing you of trolling by trying to pass toy beetles off as real beetles.",
            "Of course! Bug eggs are welcome here! If you can specify what kind of plant you found them on, that is sometimes helpful in identifying them."
