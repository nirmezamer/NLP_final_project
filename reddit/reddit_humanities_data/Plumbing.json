            "Hi, I've got no hot water in my upstairs bathroom. Nothing comes out when you turn the hot water knob. Cold water works though. Nothing at all comes out of the shower, which is one of those one knob setups.\n\nHot and cold water both work fine on the other two levels of the house.\n\nIt is 2-3 degrees Fahrenheit outside ATM",

            "u/Gooseferatu\n\n\u201cGetting super conflicting information and keep going back and forth myself on what to do. I have an older pier & beam house with a gas water heater. All the pipes are under the house and we had them burst during the freeze in 2021 but we really didn't drip as much as we should have. We now have foam insulation tubes on the pipes, but I still worry. Should we turn off at the main or just try to drip this go around? If turned off, what do I do with the GWH? I talked to two different local plumbers who both said drip, but I don't know if that was just for their own self interest.\u201d\n\n\nu/ba12348:\n>Just turning off the main will prevent flooding, but it won't prevent freezing and pipe bursting.\nDripping is your best bet at this point. In theory he only way to guarantee water doesn't freeze in the pipes is to not have water in the pipes, in practice it's almost impossible to be sure you got it all.\n\nu/imperfectably\n>\tClose your crawlspace vents. Open your under sink cabinets. Let your faucets drip. Every few hours let your cold and hot water faucets ru blast until you feel warm water.\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/SKM6pO9",
            "First time my pipes ever froze while sitting at sub zero temps for 47 hrs and with all faucets dripping, rolling black outs that happened like every 30 mins ended screwing up my heater some how and I was sitting at freezing. Lucky my pipes unthawed today without any damages and seems the heater kind of wants to blow warm air. Hope you all have the same fortune and merry christmas.",
            "Long ago at my old landlords appt, there was a bathroom that stopped working one winter. We found that putting a mini space heater in there \u201cfixed\u201d it. There was mold below there in the basement on the drywall. Oh how I\u2019m thankful to learn things and well that this wasn\u2019t my appt at the time. We did tell the landlord about it of course. He didn\u2019t have any concerns lol"

Buy pex b crimper from Amazon. Then run to Lowe\u2019s or Home Depot and buy a T pex b. Buy flexible tubes. You will also need an adapter from solid pipe to pex. You may need to buy a pipe wrench too to remove the cut pipe connected to that red pipe  valve.. install the adapter to pex (solid to pex adapter). shut your water near your meter\u2026 by twisting it clockwise (form T shape to shut water).  Then cut the white pex where the red pipe crosses (path) - then insert the T connector then connect a new pex and connect it to the newly installed pipe adapter (red pipe).",
