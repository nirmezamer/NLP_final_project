            "We had a bad cold front come in last night and I forgot to disconnect my outside hoses. I got them both disconnected but one of the spigots has ice inside it. Is there anything I can do?",
            "Woke up to discover no hot water coming from faucets. That is, no water flow at all when faucets are opened to hot. Cold water seems to come out normally. Any ideas why this would be or how to fix it? We have a tankless water heater, FWIW.",
            "First time my pipes ever froze while sitting at sub zero temps for 47 hrs and with all faucets dripping, rolling black outs that happened like every 30 mins ended screwing up my heater some how and I was sitting at freezing. Lucky my pipes unthawed today without any damages and seems the heater kind of wants to blow warm air. Hope you all have the same fortune and merry christmas.",
            "Long ago at my old landlords appt, there was a bathroom that stopped working one winter. We found that putting a mini space heater in there \u201cfixed\u201d it. There was mold below there in the basement on the drywall. Oh how I\u2019m thankful to learn things and well that this wasn\u2019t my appt at the time. We did tell the landlord about it of course. He didn\u2019t have any concerns lol",
            "Frozen Pipes not Thawing\n\nHello.  Woke up this morning to no water it\u2019s currently -5 feels like -30F with windchill so I\u2019m assuming my pipes have frozen.  Live in a single story house with a crawl space where I put two heaters and turned the main water valve off.  I\u2019m just wondering how long it normally takes I have had the heaters going for about 3 hours and still nothing has changed I felt the copper pipes and thought I found where the freeze was but nothing has moved.  When should I expect some movement?",
            "Q: How can I diagnose a frozen/burst line?\n\nLast night I took a shower in the main bathroom with zero issues. This morning I noticed that no cold water is available at that same shower. All other lines in the house are operational i.e. no issues with hot or cold at sinks, other showers or tubs.",
            "Yesterday we woke up to none of our faucets working, save for one sink in the basement with a small drip (a drop every 9 seconds or so). Called a local plumber, they gave me some tips and told me to wait it out. We kept the house hot, wrapped an electric blanket around the mains and opened the taps a little. Husband turned off the mains while we slept overnight, turned them back on this morning, heard a clunk as an ice chunk flowed through and, alleluia!, water is flowing! Hot and cold both are working as normal in all sinks and tubs, toilets are flushing (thank goodness, we were melting snow to fill the tanks!) and we can't see any evidence of obvious leaks in the walls, basement or outdoors. We've had a single tap going for about an hour now just to keep water moving.\n\nI guess my question is ... are we good? I'm dying for a shower and have a dishwasher full of dirty dishes I'd love to get done. I tried to call the plumbing office for advice but they're closed until Monday (understandable). I think I will call them Monday and see if I can have someone come out, though I don't know what they'd be looking for.",
            "Can some northern plumber ELI5?\n\nHow do pipes not freeze in Alaska? Do they drip them all winter? Do they have a recirculator or something? Is there some kind of permanent solution I can implement? I\u2019ve never burst a pipe yet, but gosh darn, my water bill \ud83d\ude2d",
            "Perhaps a little meta, but is there a better alternative to those !@$ \"frost-free\" siphons? Just had the *third* one burst on me in so many years, and now I'm slowly drying out all the lumber in my basement that got soaked.\n\nI suspect that some gardener or another left a hose attached during that freeze a couple weeks ago, but my girlfriend swears that's not the case.",
            "Need some advice. I live in the south. House is raised. Pipes are uninsulated. I'm leaving town for 4 days. I plan to insulate the line that comes from the street into the house. Shut off the main supply, leave all faucets open, and put some RV antifreeze down the toilet. Is this the right move? Or am I better off leaving the faucets running for 4 days?\nI am also concerned about my water heater. It's a gas tank that's outside. Will it be fine or do I need to drain it?"

You can buy a \u201csplit flange\u201d escutcheon that is the exact size of the pipe that splits into two so you can secure the pipe in place without having to take the plumbing apart. If it still moves after use some silicone adhesive to seal the pipe to the escutcheon. That\u2019s should do it if no access to it from below or the other side of the wall.",

I wouldn\u2019t worry about it, though it might be subject to abrasion which will eventually puncture the pipe wall. If you so desire, open the wall and make sure it\u2019s isolated from other surfaces and add a strap or two. Might not be easy or attainable."
