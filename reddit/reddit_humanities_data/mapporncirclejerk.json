            "Because half the people hate those posts, the other half loves them. But pretty much everyone agrees it's stupid if the OP randomly decides to just ignore the top comment. At that point it's not a map game, it's just daily spam from a person who does whatever they want.",

            "The rule is meant for cases where the OP doesn't do what they said in the title (which is almost always \"most upvoted...\"). It's not meant to tell people what to post, just to ensure OPs follow whatever they said they'd do and don't pick random comments instead."
