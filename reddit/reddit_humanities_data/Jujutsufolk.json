            "Yea I do too. Shes very annoying",
            "Basically some people think he was talking about his sister in the Todo scene eventhough there's literally nothing proving it",
            "I thought you would relate to her with that flair",
            "Narratively its also weak characterization. Sukunas plan is to crush Megumis spirit by using his technique to kill his sister. Were supposed to care about Tsumiki because Megumi does, but we see literally nothing with regards to the character of Tsumiki. She spends half of the manga in a coma, so shes a non-character, and when she awakens she isnt Megumis sister. Shes just Sukunas jilted crazy ex. It really doesnt help that Yorozu was cracking goofy one liners the whole time - it made the fight feel far more comedic than it shouldve been. And I felt nothing when Yorozu was finally killed. I certainly didnt gain a deeper understanding for why Megumi would be devastated. This fan work is far more compelling because you have the stakes of Tsumiki caring about Megumi just as much as Megumi cares about her. This actually feels like Sukuna destroying something dear to the characters, whereas the one we got just felt like Sukuna getting his ex off his back. \n\nAnd thats the thing - yes theres no way Sukuna was going to lose whether it was Yorozu or Tsumiki. But crucially, one scenario would have had real narrative consequences. The scenario we got had none of that (because nobody gives a fuck about Yorozu teaching Sukuna about love or some shit bffr), and the fight felt like padding more than anything else. Frankly, Tsumiki couldve just never woken up from her coma and it wouldve changed nothing narratively. By far the most throwaway fight in the manga holy shit.",
            "There is one important thing proving it... AGENDA!",
            "Flashbacks from over a hundred chapters ago?",
            "First few times I heard Megumi talk about his sister, I dont know why but I thought he was interested in her (Idk, I may have been smoking something too much). It got clarified later, but god I thought some wild stuff was going on in the background\n\nThe worst part about this hilarious fan work is that it frames my original thoughts of Tsumiki perfectly. God I cant stop laughing.\n\nAlso, this is peak. Keep cooking comrade",
            ">Were supposed to care about Tsumiki because Megumi does\n\nNot necessarily \n\n>but we see literally nothing with regards to the character of Tsumiki.\n\nShe is in flashbacks in cursed womb arc and OOO.",
            "great cooking :)",
            "Sure I joke around and such but Im not loud and annoying or full of myself. Her love for Sukuna isnt really love its for her own selfish endeavors. She thinks shes teaching him love but Sukuna doesnt need to be taught that. However my delusional self thinks Id be more useful to him and thats how I can show my love to him."

            "It's simply because Kenjaku is more of a **potential** threat than an **active** one\n\nIn short, he's easier to deal with, but if left undealt he could pose a much larger danger",
            "They made the plan that way because they know Kenjaku isn't that strong.\n\nI thought his performance against Yuki, Choso and Tengen was underwhelming for a major antagonist, considering that he is supposed to fight even more sorcerers later, especially when Yuta is arguably stronger than Yuki.",
            "They were going far more heavily on Kenjaku, at once. Yuta+Todo+Takaba better work.",
            "They probably still having plans even if yujo loses lol",
            "Kenjaku is only more of a threat in the sense that if he wins the outcome is worse than if Sukuna wins. Kenjaku is still much easier to actually defeat than Sukuna is. And we don't know that they didn't have any other back ups in case Yuta failed.",
            "They probably had a few just in case but honestly Yuta, Rika and Todo are probably enough to defeat kenjaku. Add Takaba if he didn't decide to enter that weird half dead state and it's almost a sure win",
            "Id guess they knew if Gojo lost then in that moment Sukuna would be a way bigger problem than Kenjaku and they had faith Yuta would be able to surprise Kenjaku/ beat him after Kenjaku fights Takaba, they also had Todo on hand too, but Yuta did end up finishing Kenjaku and using his CT for whats currently happening. I mean, they were kinda gunning for the surprise attack working since I believe they said all of them combined might not have been able to beat Kenjaku because Kenjaku was focusing on Yutas ce to anticipate Todo bringing him in.",
            "They had takaba and Todo. If Yuta couldn't have done it with all this,he would be a fraud but Yuta didn't do much against kenjaku,he just blitzed him and I think that even with that kenjaku will come back and yuta is just the path for him to come back.",
