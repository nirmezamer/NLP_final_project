            "Yea I do too. She\u2019s very annoying",
            "Basically some people think he was talking about his sister in the Todo scene eventhough there's literally nothing proving it",
            "I thought you would relate to her with that flair",
            "Narratively it\u2019s also weak characterization. Sukuna\u2019s plan is to crush Megumi\u2019s spirit by using his technique to kill his sister. We\u2019re supposed to care about Tsumiki because Megumi does, but we see literally nothing with regards to the character of Tsumiki. She spends half of the manga in a coma, so she\u2019s a non-character, and when she awakens she isn\u2019t Megumi\u2019s sister. She\u2019s just Sukuna\u2019s jilted crazy ex. It really doesn\u2019t help that Yorozu was cracking goofy one liners the whole time - it made the fight feel far more comedic than it should\u2019ve been. And I felt nothing when Yorozu was finally killed. I certainly didn\u2019t gain a deeper understanding for why Megumi would be devastated. This fan work is far more compelling because you have the stakes of Tsumiki caring about Megumi just as much as Megumi cares about her. This actually feels like Sukuna destroying something dear to the characters, whereas the one we got just felt like Sukuna getting his ex off his back. \n\nAnd that\u2019s the thing - yes there\u2019s no way Sukuna was going to lose whether it was Yorozu or Tsumiki. But crucially, one scenario would have had real narrative consequences. The scenario we got had none of that (because nobody gives a fuck about Yorozu teaching Sukuna about love or some shit bffr), and the fight felt like padding more than anything else. Frankly, Tsumiki could\u2019ve just never woken up from her coma and it would\u2019ve changed nothing narratively. By far the most throwaway fight in the manga holy shit.",
            "There is one important thing proving it... AGENDA!",
            "Flashbacks from over a hundred chapters ago?",
            "First few times I heard Megumi talk about his sister, I don\u2019t \u00a0know why but I thought he was interested in her (Idk, I may have been smoking something too much). It got clarified later, but god I thought some wild stuff was going on in the background\n\nThe worst part about this hilarious fan work is that it frames my original thoughts of Tsumiki perfectly. God I can\u2019t stop laughing.\n\nAlso, this is peak. Keep cooking comrade",

            "great cooking :)",
            "Sure I joke around and such but I\u2019m not loud and annoying or full of myself. Her \u201clove\u201d for Sukuna isn\u2019t really love it\u2019s for her own selfish endeavors. She thinks she\u2019s teaching him love but Sukuna doesn\u2019t need to be taught that. However my delusional self thinks I\u2019d be more useful to him and that\u2019s how I can show my love to him."

            "It's simply because Kenjaku is more of a **potential** threat than an **active** one\n\nIn short, he's easier to deal with, but if left undealt he could pose a much larger danger",
            "They made the plan that way because they know Kenjaku isn't that strong.\n\nI thought his performance against Yuki, Choso and Tengen was underwhelming for a major antagonist, considering that he is supposed to fight even more sorcerers later, especially when Yuta is arguably stronger than Yuki.",
            "They were going far more heavily on Kenjaku, at once. Yuta+Todo+Takaba better work.",
            "They probably still having plans even if yujo loses lol",
            "Kenjaku is only more of a threat in the sense that if he wins the outcome is worse than if Sukuna wins. Kenjaku is still much easier to actually defeat than Sukuna is. And we don't know that they didn't have any other back ups in case Yuta failed.",
            "They probably had a few just in case but honestly Yuta, Rika and Todo are probably enough to defeat kenjaku. Add Takaba if he didn't decide to enter that weird half dead state and it's almost a sure win",
            "I\u2019d guess they knew if Gojo lost then in that moment Sukuna would be a way bigger problem than Kenjaku and they had faith Yuta would be able to surprise Kenjaku/ beat him after Kenjaku fights Takaba, they also had Todo on hand too, but Yuta did end up finishing Kenjaku and using his CT for what\u2019s currently happening. I mean, they were kinda gunning for the surprise attack working since I believe they said all of them combined might not have been able to beat Kenjaku because Kenjaku was focusing on Yuta\u2019s ce to anticipate Todo bringing him in.",
            "They had takaba and Todo. If Yuta couldn't have done it with all this,he would be a fraud but Yuta didn't do much against kenjaku,he just blitzed him and I think that even with that kenjaku will come back and yuta is just the path for him to come back.",
