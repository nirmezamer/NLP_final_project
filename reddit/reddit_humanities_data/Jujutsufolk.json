Then, when the second round began, he had to hold back both Red and Blue so that Mahoraga wouldn't adapt to them, but he still beat Mahoraga's and Sukuna's asses to the ground, sending his opponents to sleep in the middle of the fight. Even after his hand got chopped off, he took on Sukuna, Agito, and Mahoraga and won. If Gojo were the protagonist of the series, he would have won.",

Had Gojo been raised in the Heian and/or fought more elite sorcerers, he probably would've won. Sukuna had to pull out every trick he had and put in months of planning to bring him down.\n\nIf anything, it's kind of a reversal on the whole \"protagonist\" point you brought up.

            ">gojo vs sukuna fight made realise how one-sided the whole fight was until the end. \n\nThat's why I didn't enjoy their fight that much, Sukuna was treated like a clown through out the fight, it's hard to take it seriously. \n\nThe thing about Sukuna not being able to maintain his domain because he took a bit of damage didn't make sense, in every fight except this one, the domain got disactivated when the sorcerer/curse die or is close to dying.\n\nYuta got cut and half but his domain was still active for a while.\n\nGege obviously made the fight too one sided because he planned to kill off Gojo in the end.",
