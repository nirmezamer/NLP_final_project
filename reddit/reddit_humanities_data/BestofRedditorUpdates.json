            "There was a BORU post where a woman was upset that her rich fiance never spent his own money. Like she had to pay for everything for the both of them, all because he was previously financially abused by his ex and he wanted to make sure OOP wasn't just with him for his money. I vaguely remember one point she mentioned was that she had to purchase drapes\u00a0for their house, which he refused to contribute to. In the end, she called him out for his financial abuse of her and left him. He was planning to sell the house that she hated anyway because he bought it for his gold digger ex.\u00a0",

            "I always think about the one where the guy wants to give his step daughter his ex wife who is dead\u2019s necklace and his bio daughter is furious because it was her mums and a family heirloom and said if he gave his stepdaughter the necklace she will never talk to him again",
            "Looking for the post where OP\u2019s girlfriend wants to surprise him for his birthday, but in order to keep it a surprise tells people he assaulted her and no one will speak to him, the story gets out of hand but she eventually owns up. Needless to say, he breaks up with her. I think her parents were apologetic. Been looking for a while and can\u2019t find it, I think it was a year or two back.",

            "I\u2019m looking for a post where the OP is a teenager. Their father had died and the mother moved them across the country to be with her new spouse as the grandparents would not acknowledge the new step sibling. OP\u2019s siblings had turned 18 and moved back to their hometown to be near their family and OP was planning on following suit. The mother and stepfather decided therapy was the only option. \n\nI remember the mother said leaving the family behind was a sacrifice they had to make for a better life and OP said it wasn\u2019t worth it.",
            "I remember there was a really long post, don't know if it was just long or a multi-update thing.  But basically OP was getting married and her sister was an extreme golden child.  Her parents and sister approached OP's fianc\u00e9 and tried to organize a bunch of stuff like wearing white and walking down the aisle at her wedding.  Fianc\u00e9 was aware of their family dynamic, so he (with OP's knowledge/consent) basically led them on and pretended to be super enthusiastic about their batshit crazy plan.  They were careful to only talk in person and not leave any text evidence that he was in on it.  Then at the wedding, he pretended to have no idea what they were talking about and the parents + sister were humiliated.",
            "I want to read about the lady who got married to a guy with 2 children, but the mom was still entangled in their life. They cheated on OP and were expecting her to continue doing the adulting while they all play happy family. The stepson was poisoned to hate her, but the stepdaughter was close to her and I think she stayed with OP. Tho i think by the end, OP had to move on."

New Update is 7 days old, in accordance with the rules of this sub.\n\n**Mood Spoiler:** >!frustrating all around; maybe some hope?!<\n\n**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1dj4glu/aita_because_i_went_on_my_honeymoon_without_my/)**: June 18, 2024**\n\nHi. I am posting this here after it got removed from AITA because there is going to be an update after my wife comes home I think.\n\nI just got married. My wife, Tonya, basically raised her sister, Marie, after their mom passed away. Even after their dad remarried Tonya and her sister were more mom/daughter than sisters.\n\nMarie got married last year and she got pregnant right away. No not before. They figure they got pregnant on their honeymoon.\n\nMarie went into premature labor at our wedding reception. She gave birth to a tiny but healthy baby girl. And for some reason Tonya decided that she needed to go take care of her.\n\nWe were supposed to leave for our honeymoon two days after our wedding but Tonya said she couldn't just leave. She isn't a doctor or a nurse. Marie has a dad, a stepmom, a husband, a mother and father in law. I don't understand why she had to go.\n\nBut we had nonrefundable tickets. And insurance didn't cover \"I have to stay and take care of my sister\" as part of the coverage. Plus I had booked two weeks off for my wedding and honeymoon.\n\nSo since I was going to be home by myself doing nothing while my wife was in another city doing whatever I went on the honeymoon by myself.\n\nI got a massive bed all to myself. I used all the resort credits that were for couples massages, romantic excursions, and special meals on deep sea fishing and a dune buggy tour of the island.\n\nI just got back and my wife is still with her sister. But she is upset that I went on our honeymoons by myself.\n\nWas I supposed to let the money go to waste? Was I supposed to sit at home playing Diablo while I waited for her to be done?\n\nWe are fighting about it. My friends all agree that I would have been dumb to waste the money and my time off.\n\nHer friends think I was a dick to go enjoy myself while she was taking care of her sister and a new baby.\n\nI will add that there was no place for me to stay at Marie's house. Tonya is sleeping in the nursery since the baby is still in NICU.\n\n***Relevant Comments (OOP engaged with a few heavily downvoted people. Everyone was talking in circles, so I did not include those sets of comments here)***\n\n*More on baby:*\n\n>Baby was just over a month premature and just under four pounds. I think all preemies go into some sort of special unit.\u00a0\n\nCommenter: So what did your wife want you to do? And did she share with you how she felt before you left?\n\nBased on your brief post, your wife is NTA for feeling like she had to stay for her sister, you\u2019re NTA for going on an unrefundable trip alone, and you\u2019re both TA for not understanding each other - you for not understanding that she felt like she had to stay, and her for not saying that there is nothing for you to do with her sister\u2019s situation and understanding that you went.\n\nAnd you better book another honeymoon, and hopefully this will be a trip for two!\n\n>**OOP:** She told me to go home. 600 miles away.\u00a0\n\nCommenter (downvoted): YTA for the dismissive way you are describing the situation and the total lack of empathy. Instead of being understanding about her emotions about this whole situation and giving some grace you just had to run to Reddit so the terminally online dorks will urge you to get a divorce.\u00a0\n\nI probably would have gone on the trip myself, I don't even disagree there. But the total contempt you have for your wife is asshole behavior.\n\n>**OOP:** We had our wedding in her home town specifically so her sister could attend. My family and friends had to come from Colorado to Iowa for my wedding. I went out of my way to accommodate her family. Her sister told her to go on the honeymoon. But yeah I'm dismissive.\u00a0\n\nCommenter (downvoted): \"Was I supposed to let the money go to waste? Was I supposed to sit at home playing Diablo while I waited for her to be done?\"\n\nYes\n\n>**OOP:** Pass\u00a0\n\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1dmbxh7/update_on_going_on_my_honeymoon_without_my_brand/)**: June 22, 2024 (4 days later)**\n\nThe baby, Emily, is home and healthy. Just tiny.\n\nMy sister in law kicked my wife out the day the baby came home. Tonya wouldn't let her do anything. Marie told her that she had plenty of help. Tonya said she didn't mind sticking around. Marie told her that her and her husband did have a problem with it. Marie also told all her relatives that if Tonya was staying with them they weren't allowed over until she left.\n\nTonya asked if would mind if she rented an Airbnb so she could stay nearby. I said I would prefer if she came home. We had an argument. I said that we should just not actually get married if this was going to be my life.\n\nTonya came home to fight face to face.\n\nWe had the fancy wedding and reception in Iowa for her family. We were going to get \"officially\" married in Colorado after we got back from the honeymoon.\n\nShe wants to know why I'm having second thoughts. I showed her the original post and how almost 50% of the comments were calling for an annulment.\n\nI said we are both young and can walk away without losing much. All the gifts are in her dad's garage and they are easy enough to return.\n\nI said that there was no way I was going to out up with being the third wheel in our marriage.\n\nShe has agreed to start going to counseling and we are going to hold off on getting nthe paperwork settled for one year to give her a chance to decide what she wants. If she says that her sister comes first after one year then I'm out.\n\nThat's all. No more drama.\n\nThanks for everyone who told me where I stood. I love Tonya but I love myself too. Everyone who said I was an asshole for not understanding why she was needed can suck it.\n\n***Relevant Comments:***\n\nCommenter: Sorry, but if she needs a year to figure out if she wants to be your wife, you\u2019re better off walking away now.\n\n>**OOP:** I'm giving her a year to get therapy instead of ending it with a woman I love.\u00a0\n\nCommenter: NTA, but to confirm, are you registering the marriage or waiting a year to register it?\n\n>**OOP:** Waiting a year.

Last month, he lost his job and told me he felt exhausted and wasn't eager to do anything. I said okay and offered to work so he could look after our daughter at home and get some rest until he feels better. By the way, our daughter goes to daycare, so it's mainly some housework and picking her up. But he said no, he needs his time to be completely free. I got furious because this means either I work while also taking care of our daughter, or our family will face significant financial pressure. \n\nBut I stepped back anyway and had a hell of a month doing everything while he hung out with his friends and played PS5. Finally, I couldn't take it anymore and told him he had to choose between being a househusband or divorce. He chose the first, but it felt forced. \n\nI keep questioning myself: was I too harsh? Any good advice would be appreciated. \n\nUpdate: I never thought this would draw so much attention. I'm trying to read as many comments as I can and I really appreciate your opinions, especially those pointing out things I should have told him and I didn't. I've decided to show him the post after work and see if we can have a real talk based on that. Again, thank you all. \n\nTL;TR: I told my husband to choose between divorce and being a househusband, AITA? \n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS** \n\n**ahkian** \n\n>NTA giving him the month was super generous \n\n**OOP** \n\n>>He was the one who supported the family before, I thought I'd give him time to recover.

Is it normal? \n\n**FairlyFartDaydreams** \n\n>>>Yes when I get depressed I can still read but I don't really want to do anything else. Video games, binge watching shows, reading, food can all give us a dopamine hit that may make us feel \"normal\". It is important to call out the behavior and make sure he is attempting to get better. PArt of it might be the ego hit from getting let go from his job. The important thing is to not let it go untreated/unremarked too long. Tell him adulting sucks but we all have to do it \n\n[Update: I (36F) showed my husband (37M) the last post, and we had a talk. Then, without asking me, he invited my mother-in-law to come, even though he knows I\u2019ve never gotten along well with her](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/D74Xo2hwAC)\u00a0 **June 22, 2024** \n\nI decided to make a new post so it won't be too long to read. The previous post link is here below: \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1dioyrk/aita\\_forcing\\_my\\_husband\\_to\\_choose\\_between\\_divorce/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web3x&utm\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1dioyrk/aita_forcing_my_husband_to_choose_between_divorce/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) \n\nSo, I got off work, picked up my daughter, and showed my husband the post after she fell asleep. I told him that millions had seen it and made various points. I admitted that my ultimatum was an impulsive reaction and that I preferred having a calm discussion to work through this. He said he was surprised I shared family matters on Reddit and that he wouldn't have done it. He said he wasn't feeling depressed, just tired and exhausted after years of working, and he just wanted to be childish for a bit and really enjoyed the month off. I kind of understood because we used to travel a lot before our daughter was born, and life has been harder since then. I told him I wouldn't force him to work and that he could take his time as long as he could pick up our daughter and do the housework. He hesitated but told me not to worry. \n\nI thought this was the end of it. Then, the next day, I came home from work to find his mother there. I was shocked because he hadn't told me anything. She started picking up our daughter and doing the housework. This is driving me crazy because I have never gotten along with her well, and my husband knows this. I feel like he asked her to come so he could continue being childish, disregarding how I feel. \n\nHis mother raised him as a single mom, and according to my husband, she was very protective and planned to live with him for his whole life. He felt suffocated, so he went to a university far from home and reduced contact with her. I remember one time she came and got sick, vomited, and I cleaned up her mess. Suddenly, she asked her son to come and told him that her underwear was dirty and needed to be washed by hand that very night, even though we had a washing machine. \n\nMy husband and I had agreed that our marriage was ours and that she wouldn't come and live with us. He broke his promise. \n\nI'm considering divorce, but I'm worried our daughter is too young to understand it. I've thought about holding on for a while, but these days of living with her are already driving me crazy, and I don't see a quick end. I've thought about being an AH and forcing her to leave, but that might lead to divorce. \n\nI really need some advice. Thank you all. \n\nTL;DR:I (36F) showed my husband (37M) the last post, and we had a talk. Then, without asking me, he invited my mother-in-law to come, even though he knows I\u2019ve never gotten along well with her. \n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS** \n\n**Glittering-Bat353** \n\n>So... you tell him he needs to pull his weight as an adult, and his answer is to literally call his mommy to do the work for him?!

Doing it \"for the kids\" is only damaging their views on what a relationship should be.

We went to school together, did most of life's major milestones together and I consider him my brother in all but blood. When his grandmother passed while we were in high school, she even had me in her will, leaving me a small trust to use for college. For as long as I can remember, his family has been mine and vice versa. We both got married in 2017. Our wives are very close and have been since we were dating. While I'm not as close with her as my wife, I see his wife like my sister and I care about her the same way. \n\n3 days ago I was riding in my best friends car when he asked my to put on some music. I picked up his phone and put in his code (we've both known each others passcodes for years) and while I was navigating spotify, a text came through from a \"pizza place\" that said \"Coming over tonight?\" I sat there stunned for a few seconds before turning and asking him who the fuck \"pizza place\" was. He immediately starting yelling at me for going through his messages before I told him what happened. He pulled over into a parking lot and spent a few minutes yelling at each other until he finally came clean. He's been hooking up with a coworker for about a month. He says that he still loves his wife and has no intentions of leaving her. He begged me not to tell his wife, and that he's going to find a way to break it off with this other woman, but says he's in too deep to just ghost her and doesn't know how to cut it off yet. He swears it will never happen again and that his mistake doesn\u2019t warrant ruin his and his wife\u2019s marriage. After some back and forth I reluctantly agreed to stay quiet. But later that day I remembered something that might change my mind. \n\nHe and his wife started the process of IVF a few months ago. I haven't pressed for details but she has used my wife as support through the process, and I know it has been very taxing on her. Ultimately my dilemma is this: is it right for me to keep this a secret, knowing that they are trying to bring a child into the world, and knowing that child could be born into a broken home if his wife finds out after she gets pregnant? \n\nI'm torn between the friend that I love like my brother, and what I feel would be the right thing to do. I know I'm not the one who was wronged here, but I feel so betrayed and angry. I feel like he's done something that's going to tear apart the small family the 4 of us have built together, and the bigger one we planned on having one day. I know he\u2019s not a bad person, and up to this point I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s been a model husband. I'm so unsure what to do and I need help. \n\nTL;DR my best friend is cheating on his wife and I don\u2019t know if I should tell her. \n\nEdit: Thank you all for your replies and advice. I talked to my wife last night and she\u2019s asked friends wife to come over tomorrow night to talk. I\u2019ll update with more details afterwards\n\n\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/lVndgRNn6Y)\u00a0 **June 22, 2024**\n\n\nLink to my original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/vaUuBhkOwI \n\nFirst off thank you everyone for your advice. I think i was still kind of in a mode of shock and panic and reading your comments helped me sober up. I appreciate you all.\u00a0 \n\nI\u2019d also like to quickly address those of you who suggested burying it because \u201cI have no ties to this woman\u201d or \u201che\u2019s your friend not her\u201d or \u201cbros before hoes\u201d. This isn\u2019t some random girl he just started hanging out with. They\u2019ve been married for 7 years and were dating for 2 before that. She\u2019s been a big part of our lives for nearly a decade and is my friend in her own right, even if she doesn\u2019t share the same history me and her husband do. So the idea that I have no ties to her or owe her nothing is just wrong. \n\nThe evening after posting this I told my wife. You all were right that I shouldn't have kept it from her in the first place. She listened to what happened and then sat silent for a minute. I was afraid she was going to be mad at me for not telling her like a lot of you said, but no. She said that a part of her was relieved because she could tell that something had been severely bothering me these past couple of days, but aside from offering the occasional \"are you ok?\" she decided that I would tell her when I was ready to share. Though, when I told her about the thread, she was slightly annoyed and thought it was silly for me to have brought my problem to a bunch of strangers on the internet before I brought it to her. I apologized for not telling her sooner and for waiting to act despite knowing in my heart what I needed to do. My wonderful, amazing, and astoundingly understanding wife responded with, \"even when we're sure what is right, it's only human to hesitate when we know it's going to cost us dearly.\"\u00a0\nThat said, she and I are all good. \n\nAfter our discussion, I showed her the thread. She read comments for nearly an hour before we started talking again. Ultimately we decided that we had to tell my friend's wife (who I will from here on refer to as Sister so I don't keep having to say friend's wife). The reason we did this instead of an ultimatum is my wife was concerned he would use the time to cover his tracks or orchestrate her opinion against us. Neither of us really felt that would be in character for him, but we wouldn\u2019t have thought it in character for him to cheat either. My wife texted Sister and asked if she could come over after work the next day (Sister works mostly evenings so she usually gets off around 11.)\u00a0 My wife had told her it was a serious conversation so Sister was pretty tense when she arrived at our house. We sat her down and we told her everything. After hearing it, she took a long breath and said, \"I've known for a couple of weeks.\" Apparently, she had asked her boss if she could go home early one night a few weeks ago because she wasn't feeling well, and found he wasn't home. She texted him asking what he was up to and he said he was \"at home watching tv.\" She tried to look up his location on their tracking app but it was turned off. She left home and waited until when her shift would normally end to return. He was home when she got there and when she asked how his evening was or if he did anything interesting, he told her hed been home all evening watching tv and playing video games. She checked the app again and sure enough, his location was turned back on. Sister said that, until we told her, she didn't have any proof but felt she knew what must have been happening. We asked her what she was planning to do now that she knew. \n\nHere's the part I didn't see coming: she plans to move forward with IVF. According to her, it's always been her lifelong dream to be a mother and without IVF it will never happen. IVF is expensive. She won't be able to afford it on her own and she's afraid that if she leaves her husband she'll never get another chance. Her current plan is to follow through with implantation and decide what will happen to her marriage afterward. She says they have a healthy embryo and she wants to give her child a chance, even if it means she could end up raising the child on her own. When I asked if threre was any way she could see them reconciling when this is all over, she said it depended on him. In the end, she asked us to please keep it quiet and not tell him that she knows. We agreed and assured her we'd be there for her if she needed anything. I called my friend the next day and told him that, while I still love him, I need space after learning what he did and that we wouldn't be seeing each other for a while.\u00a0 \n\nI still feel a lot of things: relief from not bearing the secret, sorrow for sister and what I fear she's going to have to go through, anger at my friend for destroying our family as it has been (if not destroying it entirely), and grief from what feels like the loss of the person who has been with me my whole life. I hope for all 3 of their sakes they can work it out, but I know those chances are slim.\u00a0This whole thing has been exhausting and, while I\u2019m not sure exactly how to move on from it, now I can at least try. \n\nThank you all again for your help.
