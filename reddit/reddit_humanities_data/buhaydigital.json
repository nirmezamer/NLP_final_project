Transcribers whose grades fall below the maintaining average (3.6) will be removed from the team and will have to apply again and start from scratch...  That said, if you do survive, if you work full time, you're looking at up to a possible income of >20k a month as a transcriber, and >45k a month as an editor. There are months in the pandemic where I earned over 60k working overtime...  You are paid on a per job basis, kaya your earnings are based on how fast you work. If it takes you 3hrs to finish a 5min transcription worth $1.33, then mababa ang kita mo. If you take only 20min to finish that, then makakarami ka and kikita ka.

As u/Typical_Yoghurt2590 pointed out in our community thread:\n\n\"While online freelancing platforms are great especially if you are just starting out, these platforms are not the only places you can get clients. Personally, I have been able to get clients from Facebook and LinkedIn. They could also be on Twitter, IG or even Reddit.\n\nThe key is to have an optimized profile, you must be clear about your target market and how you can help them. And then engage with your target market. On FB, start joining groups where your market hangs out and cheerlead or engage with their posts. On LI, start connecting with people in your target market.\n\nAgain, nothing against freelancing platforms but don't limit yourself to these sites because **potential clients are everywhere**. We just need to know where and how to connect with them.\"\n\nLastly, to anyone that reads this feel free to suggest any sources that we may have missed.\n\n*Last updated: 12/1/2023*",

            "Some info for future Upwork users. I\u2019m a graphic artist who landed a few freelancing jobs and I want y\u2019all to be aware of the 20% service fee of Upwork for the first $500 you earn from *each* client. \n\nSmall <$10 projects will turn into much smaller profits because of their fee. Imagine deducting 20% from each $8 project you complete. **I suggest charging higher rates**, switching to another platform, or doing really well that your client gives you a bonus.\n\nAfter you earned $500, you will only be charged 10% (only for that one client) and the best way to get to this quickly is by really impressing your client and a bit of luck. **I suggest approaching potential clients who are just about to start a business**. Do your best, impress them, and you have a higher chance of working on future projects with them. Loyal clients can give you more peace of mind as your income will be a bit more stable, knowing they\u2019ll come back to you.\n\nHope this helps~",

I am heartbroken. Tuloy lang daw trabaho but still, he's 72 y/o and was literally like a dad to me. Better than my dad talaga, even. \n\nI found out from his wife na I was the last person that he emailed. He emailed me at 2 AM kasi a day ago, sabi niya \"I am going today. Thanks for your help.\" Tapos sumagot ako, \"What do you mean, are you going home?\" \n\nHe replied \n\"No I am dying later. Say pray for me.\" \n\nBakit yung mabubuting tao pinapahirapan?

        "content": "I recently got hired through Reddit as an Executive VA for an insurance /slash/ financial freedom advisor. The job description was just basically the usually VA stuff. Email management, cold calling, follow ups, admin tasks and etc. The hourly rate was $6.25 paid thru PayPal. I accepted the offer thinking it was fair. (LOL) \n\nLittle did I know\u2026.. \n\nI will also be a VA for her husband, be responsible for content creation and manage their business FROM SCRATCH. \n\nI was willing to put up with it since I really wanted to help their business and potentially train other VAs that their members will hire under their team. (Plus her husband is a Filipino so I thought they\u2019re gonna be nice LOL)\n\nBut it only gets worse.\n\nThey asked me to do a slide shift every week from 11-7am (without breaks), to 3am-11am every Wednesday then back to 11-7am. I politely disagreed because it will definitely mess my body clock and I cannot keep up with it. The client said \u201cokay don\u2019t bother then\u201d which I did not take seriously at first. \n\nThey asked me to do contents and newsletter which I am okay with since I had a background in Canva and Adobe, but whenever I present them the materials, they would always say \u201cyou\u2019re work is not good enough\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of it\u201d. I figured out just ask them to give me logos, theme colors and fonts to use for the business so I can stick with it moving forward, but they did not send me any. I also asked them to be more specific on what they want since whenever they ask me to do something, they just tell me to \u201cjust do it\u201d. I explained that I need further instructions and I need them to be more specific so I can work with what they want, and they just told me \u201cjust make it colorful\u201d. The other one even told me \u201cwhat\u2019s the reason for having an assistant when I have to figure it out\u201d like????? I even spent almost an hour teaching her on a CRM that she wanted to use.\n\nMy last straw was when they kept on asking me to join their 8AM calls as a team, with my camera on, fully dressed with makeup, only to take minutes of meeting, WORD PER WORD. Tbh, I can stick with it but how they treat their \u201cteam\u201d sucks. They feel superior about everything and would make them feel less because they don\u2019t have enough recruits. The more I join their meetings, the more I understand that they are not financial advisors but NETWORKERS. It\u2019s not just about buying an insurance but recruiting people because more they recruit, the more they earn. \n\nDays go by and their demands as a couple becomes more, and their attitude gets way worse. They will call you without any heads up, ask you to do things simultaneously and ask for a result right away when  they just assigned you something. If you don\u2019t get it done right away, they\u2019ll tell you things like \u201ci\u2019m paying you, why don\u2019t you get it done\u201d LOL\n\nPlease, stay away from these kinds  clients. I know they\u2019re hiring people here and they\u2019re probably looking because I just resigned hahahaha \n\nINITIALS: KP & AP\n\nIf you hear about WFG and WSB, RUN!!!!",
