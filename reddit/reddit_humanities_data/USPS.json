Check with your ADRs and DRs on your specific dispute procedures, and if you have any questions, ask your stewards!\n\nI won't have a long winded post this time, mostly because I don't feel like it, partially because there's really nothing new to say!\n\nATLANTA CARRIERS: The NRLCA knows you got railed, they're doing something about it. What? Shiiii idk I just work here. Anyway, here's a poll.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1br7evl)",

            "Ugh, Everytime they knock me down 40 minutes. I'm doing so much more than I had been to start and all my metrics  have gone up EXCEPT PARCELS. I still get decent package volume, a lot of times more than my coworkers and they still cut over 100 minutes of package office and street time. I don't know what else I can do.",

            "I went up an hour, what changes a J route to a K route? How is that decision made?",
            "does anyone have a breakdown of what each category is in the 4241A and M? some seem self explanatory, others read like a riddle.",
            "The 3 routes in my office have been overburdened since 2020. We were delivering Amazon and then lost the majority of it due to Amazon starting their own delivery around 11/23. So when this last count came back it still shows us overburdened on paper due to the fact that the count has 3/23 through 3/24 worth of numbers and now we are on the adjustment list. With current daily numbers we would probably be low K routes so if they adjust us and cut around 250 deliveries each, when there has been a year of no Amazon numbers I believe that the routes are going to come back as not even full time. Talked with the union and they said the only thing we can do is write a letter! Anyone else have this problem or advice?",
            "MMS were supposed to happen every three months for the first year. Managerial and union level incompetence broke the contract **we** ratified. This needs to be taken to the NLRB.",
            "I can answer the CBU inquiry. You only get credit for an address IF you have DPS (or boxholder) for that address. Does not matter if they have flats, only DPS counts.",
            "Route cut process begins in April** on select routes, focusing on extremely overburdened routes first.",
            "Its an hourly time frame, 47:24 standard hours is a 40K"

It helps on the interview but you can surely think of maintenance related experience to relay for an interview. Based on fixing things around your house, the car etc. *Always* mention working safely.\n\n\n\n*Pro tip:* You can apply for any job that has an exam opening and the test is administered local to yourself. Make sure you're serious and score decently; you can turn down the job offer. Keep a physical copy of your exam score, I believe they are good for two years.\n\nThe reason is: These job postings can be posted externally at capacity for testing, meaning they will not allow you to take the exam if they have enough qualified applicants. However, if you have a test score on the books, *you* are a qualified applicant.\n\n\n\nExplanation of MVO/TTO to save time:\n\nMVO= CDL B Can only drive box trucks on public roads, can drive anything for moves on postal property.\n\nTTO= CDL A Can drive anything.\n\n\n\nUSPS provides the training. (Maintenance jobs at least. Management...GOOD LUCK)",

            "That's fine and a good question to ask. I am also an MPE with a bit of experience so my own case would also be \"fuck no\" since once you go EAS you lose your union protection and are expected to get shafted on the regular.",
            "My plant just posted an EAS-16 Process Control Assistance position open to all postal employees within the installation.  I think all MHA/PSE should check e-career/in plant posting to see if they have such options.\n\nI am already MPE9, so I don't think being PCA is something I want to do for money.  But being MPE9, I had often got requests from them and wondering, \"They really need someone who have experiences on the workroom floor and know what requests are unreasonable.\"   So I am somewhat temped.\n\nOf course, there is also \"This is a career ladder position and is not to be authorized on a permanent basis\" mentioned in the posting.  So do people know what's the typical career progressing PCA position is a ladder for?  This is not something I feel need its own post.  So I am piggybacking on this here.  Hope you don't mind.",
            "The PCA is an EAS-16 in-plant support position. It could lead to advancement to various positions along the in-plant route. One of ours was recently promoted to a 19, but I can't recall the title.\nHowever, i'd look into the future of the PCA, because that position is being phased out from what I know and could eventually leave you at the mercy of an RIF process. I'd check with the Butts on Naps if you can."
