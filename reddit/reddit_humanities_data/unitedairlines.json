Please just take a minute to read through this before posting. \n\nOften people ask questions that tend to fall into a category so we have megathreads for those types of questions. They are below.\n\n**Any post on the front page that belongs in a megathread is subject to removal. Report them if you see them.**\n\n#Megathreads may be removed/added every once in a while. Check this place before you make a post.\n\n***\n\n#[Gifts/Exchanges Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/s7hces/runitedairlines_gifts_and_exchanges/)\n\nIf you're selling or buying or looking for pluspoints or vouchers or any sort of stuff, all that will be in here. Yes, this place is where the giveaways happen.\n\n**Do not post** in here if you're looking for a giveaway or free stuff. Instead, scroll through the thread and see if anyone's offering something you might want. This way every top-level comment is someone offering stuff for free/for sale, instead of a million people asking for stuff.\n\n\n***\n\n#[First Class/Premium Cabin/Polaris Food Selection Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/1csmlzd/first_classpolaris_meal_selection_questions/)\n\nAre you flying premium/first/polaris and were you offered a choice of meal on your upcoming flight? Ask about it in here, not on the front page.\n\n\"What meal should I get\" belongs here.\n\n***\n\n#[Seat Selection Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/1csmoor/seat_selection_megathread/)\n\nAre you looking at the seat map and you're not sure which seat is the best choice given what's available? Feel free to ask in here.\n\nThis includes \"What seat should I pick/What seat is the best on this aircraft\" questions.\n\n***\n\n#[Polaris/Premium Plus Upgrade Questions Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/1csp6rw/polarispremium_plus_upgrades_megathread/)\n\nAny posts asking \"Is this worth it?\" about upgrading to polaris/premium plus belong in this thread.\n\nThis includes posts that have a picture of the upgrade and ask if it's worth using points/miles to upgrade to premium plus and polaris.\n\n***\n\nIf you guys have any other ideas for megathreads or have any questions, message me. \n\n**Again, this place will be updated whenever megathreads need to be added/removed. Check back often before making posts.**\n\nThank you!",

There aren't many seat options left that will accommodate our family (traveling with an infant in a car seat also). Does anyone know if the view in row 26 is blocked by the wings? Thank you so much!",
            "I booked a flight for next week and there's only one free seat left to choose. Several Preferred are available for a fee. If I don't pick a seat and get assigned upon check-in, assuming that free seat is already taken, do I end up assigned to one of the Preferred seats?",
