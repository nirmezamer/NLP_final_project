They put the jaded old stewardesses in Polaris and they\u2019re just giving shit to people.  \n\nUpon boarding, the one tasked with collecting everyone\u2019s order was like \u201cdo you know what you want for lunch?  It\u2019s printed on the menu.  THIS IS THE MENU!  You don\u2019t know?  Fine I\u2019ll come back\u201d.  \nIt\u2019s like she hated her job and literally wanted everyone to know it.  She gave people like 2 seconds to look at the menu before she ditched them.  She did this to almost everyone who didn\u2019t pre book their meal.  Total fucking bitch. \n\nAlso upon boarding, I was getting checked in and the gate agent said I was only allowed two bags on the plane.  I literally just bought snacks in the airport for my staff that I\u2019m visiting.  I\u2019m flying Polaris and am Star Alliance Gold and she\u2019s giving me shit about a tiny bag with a box of cookies in it.  What the fuck is that shit?\n\nNow the main problem is I\u2019m flying the opposite route tomorrow on United so I\u2019m going to be subjected to this garbage service yet again most likely.  \n\nThe worst part is that a friend used 250k miles to upgrade me for this flight and I used 200k miles to buy my return flight tomorrow.  Round trip in Singapore is usually just about 215-250k all in.  \n\nI regularly fly Singapore business and its night and day.  I\u2019ve brought the full  max allowance of bags (3x32kg to check, 2x20kg carry ons, 1 personal item bag, AND shopping stuff) and they will check my carry ons for me (total of 5 bags checked) and offer to help carry my shit so I can buy more stuff.  \n\nOn board I\u2019m always called by my name and the service is always comforting, genuine, and warm.  The seats are also wider, screens are bigger, and it\u2019s just an overall better experience. \n\nAnyway just a rant and a good reminder why Singapore is my airline of choice wherever possible ",

            "I feel you.  I am monogamous (mostly) to Cathay Pacific, although I've flown business class on Singapore, Qatar, EVA, and Asania.  Qatar aside, the Asian airlines understand customer service.  Worst case the service is impersonal but professional.  Normally they fall all over themselves to take care of you. \n\nI often get scolded because I'll walk from my seat (in business class) to the galley to ask for another drink.  When they bring it I am always reminded to press the call button and they will be happy to serve.  I point out to them that I'm American and we've been trained to only push that button if someone is dying. \ud83e\udd23\n\nI have never once been questioned about carry on items, and I always bring duty free.  I always buy some chocolates and give them to the crew.  A \"thank you\" in advance.\n\nMeanwhile,,I always fly F domestically and rarely get noteworthy service. Is not just United... It's Delta and American as well.  Never even thought of bringing chocolates. \ud83d\ude33  Frankly, I wish they'd allow self-service on the flights so I'd not have to deal with the generally surly attitude.\n\nPlus, threads here and on FlyerTalk are filled with stories of involuntarily downgrades on the domestic big 3.  You rarely -- if ever --  hear about that on Asian airlines.\n\nSo commenters here can quote the fine print all day long,, but they miss the point.  American carriers might match the hard product on their metal,, but until they can match the soft product they'll always be considered second rate by experienced international travelers.",
            "I must have encountered the same FA when flying UA polaris to Asia a few years ago. Asked me if I would like to drink anything before takeoff and I asked her if she had tea or coffee available.

When she brought it, she looked at me and said \"I mean come on shouldn't you know that as a 1K?\"  I was completely flabbergasted. Made the rest of the 12 hour flight extremely awkward.",
            "United is widely known for inconsistent f/a service quality. But, honestly that\u2019s the case with most \u201cWestern\u201d airlines. I\u2019ve had similar experiences on almost every European carrier in business. I just chalk it up to the culture we\u2019ve created.",
            "Interestingly, United's webpage says the following:  \"You can bring a few items in addition to your carry on bag and personal item for free... food or other items bought at the airport.\"  [https://www.united.com/en/us/fly/baggage/carry-on-bags.html](https://www.united.com/en/us/fly/baggage/carry-on-bags.html)",
            "The cranky tenured flight attendants always seem to get the Japan or Hong Kong flights, from Chicago anyways\u2026.. I respect that a person has tenure or seniority or what not, but it just seems like those particular folks just don\u2019t give a shit.",
            "I mean, welcome to Polaris. Good hard product and absolutely nothing else.\n\nEx-Japan you would have been able to choose JL, NH, or even SQ ;if flying NRT-LAX).\n\nI\u2019d never advise a US airline for TPAC unless you\u2019re getting a complimentary upgrade or something.",

The seat was nice and the food is surprisingly better than what I expected but the service is definitely not what I expect for business class at all. \n\nCouldn\u2019t care less because I basically just need a bed to sleep and my company pay for it but oh boy I would be annoyed if I\u2019m paying out of pocket",
            "Using 250k miles to upgrade is INSANE. A roundtrip in Polaris is usually 200k miles total to book outright, paying more than that just to upgrade is bonkers",
            "I can't solve your United problems but next time you return to the USA, you should check out Spirit Airlines for your US domestic travel. They are probably the only option that will get you the service you demand in the continental USA.  (They are a younger airline so you won't have to deal with any of those old lady stewardesses.)"
