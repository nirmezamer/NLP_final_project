All of it is shot on green screen and I'm keying them out, then filling that with black over a white plate to make a sort of silhouette of the talent. The silhouettes of the talent are super recognizable. Hope that makes sense!\n\nSo, they had an agency shoot the footage and now I'm editing it. They're expecting the final edit to be 15 minutes, except we only have roughly 4 minutes of footage. Explained this isn't doable with the assets we currently have, and proposed we find time to shoot more footage of the talent. The workaround they want to try is using a slew of AI services to extend the footage and make puppets of the talent that the AI will then \"reanimate\" \n\nPersonally, I don't want to do this, in part because I'm doubtful it will result in something that looks good and allows me to reliably key or roto them out, in part because I'm personally opposed to using AI for \"mission-critical\" work like this, but also because using AI to make our talent do something they didn't do rubs me the wrong way (I don't know that I'd call them A-listers, but they're pretty well-known public figures).\n\nHow can I professionally explain that I'm not willing to go with what they've proposed? I've tried the gentle nudge of \"I'm not sure this would look very good, I think we'd get a better result if we booked time to shoot more footage\" but they're pretty insistent on \"just trying the AI option out.\" I'm in a pickle here.

This is the real way AI will hurt the industry - bad bosses and management who have no clue what AI tools are capable of. And for most, it will be too late to revert because Ai fatigue is settling in much faster than expected.\n\nNow back to the topic, there's no single AI tool I know of that's up for the task length-wise, much less quality-wise. \n\nWould slow motion be a viable option at least to help fill the timeline? Add some ramping to add dynamism. Topaz is a very competent AI frame generation but it also will cost.",

There may be ways of doing it, but it'll take more effort. A reshoot is your best option, honestly. It'll make your life easier.\n\nBut, you've voiced your concerns and at the end of the day it's about what the client wants.",
            "Lol. I guess to the amateur, everythings an option.\n\n1. Literally not possible at the moment.\n2. The beta 'shot extension' tech they've shown off is only meant for a few seconds at MOST.\n3. EVEN THEN, the footage still 'pops' into what looks like a weird pseudo-cartoony look once its transitions to the AI generated frames. You can see this on the presentation videos. Its definitely not a replacement for real footage.\n\nYour agency really dropped the ball on this one. You'd be better off slowing the footage down to 30% and using AI to interpolate frames."
