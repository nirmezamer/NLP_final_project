            "Any advice for looking for a post-pa or ae position in film/tv, I'm a bit worried as I've been hearing it's still pretty slow. Currently working my first \"real job\" in sports as a post-pa but trying to move away from that after my contract ends in early fall. I have been emailing post houses, and have a couple folks I've kept in touch with over the past year, about to restart my staffmeup membership, but advice on anything else I should be doing would be much appreciated!",
            "Hello! I want to eventually get into video editing as a career. Are there any reputable online courses I could do that look good on a cv? What would you say is the best course of action for a beginner?",
            "are jordy vandeput premiere pro courses worth the money? he has 2 courses for beginner to advanced level, 2 more for color correction alone and one just for masking, I wanna study video editing but before I buy these expensive courses I need to know that they're suffecient and worth the price, thank you. any advice/ suggestion/ recommendation will be appreciated.",
            "Trying to make an portfolio, but I need more stuff to have edited, since most of the stuff I've edited is narrative and is thus not very flashy. \n\nShould I shoot some random stuff or are there resources to find footage to show off my skills with?",
            "Hi there! I finished filming a short film and I'm editing it as well. My video doesn't have any source audio. Audio was recorded separately and we used a clapper. I used to edit with source audio, but this is the first time I'm doing it like this. What is the best way to synchronize it in Premiere? Is manual the only way?\n\nThanks.",
            "I've been having a lot of trouble finding a job in post production. I've been doing this for three years and have a decent number of low to no budget films under my belt but it's not getting me anywhere. I did some professional work for a streaming app for almost a year but I got laid off a couple months ago due to budget cuts. I'm still doing indie film festivals, film races, and the like but no professional post house wants anything to do with me unless I already have published work and every application I send in to networks like CNN just ends with an automated rejection email. I network as best I can but most of the people I meet do this for fun and the few people that are professionals can't do more than throw my name in a hat that's already filled to the brim for jobs that they aren't trying to fill. As for finding more film groups/work through said film festivals, it seems like every director is an editor too and cuts their own stuff so there isn't a whole lot more that I can do on that front. Any advice?",
