Please do not remove this comment, it is a legitimate question about tiktok..\n\nI need to verify my age, as I wasn't asked to input my birthday when I made my account, so I can see the videos TikTok arbitrarily assigns an age restriction on, however I've heard that TikTok will delete your videos if you verify your age because they \"were made when you were underage.\"\r  \n\r  \nI made my account two years ago, so surely TikTok will see that I was and still am of age, right? Or do they not care?\r  \n\r  \nI tried asking them directly and all they did was tell me that they \"can't resolve my issue\" until I send proof of my age. Typical automated response email.",

Today they removed the same video for the same reason and removed the appeal button. What should I do???? I know for a fact my video didn\u2019t contain anything bad. I was calling her out for pedophilia and that was the least tame thing about it. Other videos on the same person that are just actual bullying have all stayed up.",

I waited for 20 days after posting consistently, nothing changed...\n \nNow I'm wondering what's the way of safely creating a new account and posting?\nDo I need a new phone, do I need to re-export the videos to prevent being detected as re-upload,...?\n\nThanks for the advice!!\nSheena ",

Even if they don\u2019t get 100% watch time, just a couple seconds is enough to count as a view that makes money. \n\nIf ur not posting 1 min+ long videos that\u2019s step one. Aside from that, unless you are going viral consistently, your next step is to get sponsorships or sell your own product of some sort. Going semi viral occasionally won\u2019t make consistent money. Reach out to people who you think would wanna sponsor your experiment if you\u2019re doing more original stuff. This is niche dependent",
