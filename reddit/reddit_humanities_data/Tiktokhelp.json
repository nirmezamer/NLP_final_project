I waited for 20 days after posting consistently, nothing changed...\n \nNow I'm wondering what's the way of safely creating a new account and posting?\nDo I need a new phone, do I need to re-export the videos to prevent being detected as re-upload,...?\n\nThanks for the advice!!\nSheena ",

I would try with a new phone with a separate sim and never connect to the same wifi...i tried resetting my IP from the router but no luck. somehow i get shadowbanned eventually for having more accounts. idk what to say....i hope we will find a way soon. Also, do you think I could get in touch with your ad manager? thanks!",
