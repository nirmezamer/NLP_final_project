        "content": "A little while ago, I argued that [Tom Delonge's theory of UFOs and the Phenomenon ](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighStrangeness/comments/1dnkfq9/the_tom_delonge_theory_of_ufos_the_gods_of_eden/)is about malevolent NHI that start wars using religion and certain secret societies so they can feed off of negative human energy a la The Gods of Eden and that we are a cattle farm or agricultural product. Basically, the elites who are in these secret societies are co-opted to work with the malevolent NHI on this.\n\nIf you've kept up with a lot of the \"woo\" side of ufology, then you've also probably heard of [Chris Bledsoe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbg3KSgn2k0) and [his interaction with the \"Lady\"](https://youtu.be/5TYkgmLTIQs?t=1134) - a mysterious, angelic-like being/woman that came through a portal to Chris Bledsoe on the back of a mysterious bull.\n\n[Take a look at this comment by Ryan Bledsoe, Chris Bledsoe's son, regarding Tom Delonge's theory of the Phenomenon](https://twitter.com/SkyFireNews/status/1800207913526669412). It lines right the fuck up. The idea that there are NHI walking among us who feed off energy.\n\nMoreover, I think that [the sighting of the Lady suggests that said malevolent NHI are trying to use religious imagery and concepts to push us towards war](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/lp81sx/chris_bledsoe_and_the_lady/?share_id=ph_Id6tyH1Mt_FQFyaYcH&utm_content=1&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=4).\n\nWhy do I think that? Because I think that the description of the Lady matches up with imagery from the Book of Revelations, specifically [the Whore of Babylon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whore_of_Babylon). (I know this sounds schizo, but I'm not religious, I'm not Catholic, I'm just noticing similarities).\n\n>So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and **I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast**, full of names of blasphemy, **having seven heads and ten horns**.\n\n>And **the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour**, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:\n\nWhile the bull is not described in detail, the Lady supposedly came to Chris Bledsoe on the back of a horned beast.\n\nAccording to people hanging out with Chris Bledsoe, \"[there are others, especially those in the higher ranks of NASA, who take The Lady very seriously, and revere her like a deity. They know She has been appearing to humans for thousands of years, and even as recently as 1917 during an event known as The Miracle of the Sun](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/lp81sx/chris_bledsoe_and_the_lady/?share_id=ph_Id6tyH1Mt_FQFyaYcH&utm_content=1&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=4).\" In other words, this sighting last came in the middle of WWI - one of the bloodiest events in human history.\n\nAnd look at this fucking patch:\n\n[A lady in purple and scarlet](https://preview.redd.it/n6k7p326sb9d1.png?width=295&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cd96efb3e0f527aaafeea273e772cfa51170ef7)\n\nThis is my theory based on the extension of Tom Delonge's thoughts. I'm not saying that the Lady is the Whore of Babylon from the Book of Revelations. I'm saying that the malevolent NHI take on these mystical forms and come to us with prophesies and talks of wisdom to gear us up for war and violence.\n\nIf the theory is correct, the Lady is not this pretty being that's a sign to Chris Bledsoe. She is a malevolent NHI or NHI manifestation that is meant to create religious fervor among our co-opted elites/secret societies to drive us into war.",

We\u2019ll never be able to wage war in that realm, that does exist and that god and gods spiritual army fights that battle for us. All of what delogne is saying is just a repeat of that. They can call them reptilians because it\u2019s human lore that the average person can connect to. But they are essentially just repeating what\u2019s already in the Bible. So should there be shock?",
            "I believe this to be an accurate take on the situation. At least what has been conveyed to me in my contacts lines up. Pretty disconcerting stuff. I believe there cause for true concern if disclosure occurred because people that sway towards negative polarization could wholesale begin helping these beings in mass which would be tragic for our species on this living rock!"

            "I know how and why some of these work basically through the principles that made the Townsend Brown Experiments work ( not ionic winds). It lets us mimic gravity through the use of energy sources rotating around each other (rather than mass) because as Einstein's famous equation lets us equate mass to energy and vice versa. We place capacitors closer than they would naturally find equilibrium  if they were masses rotating in space. Its why its important to have two different sized Tesla capacitors. They generate an EM field by rotating at a certain distance so that the fields overlap and this overlap of the fields produce lift. My paper doesn't explain this specifically but it is the principle that makes this work. We need to accept that space is not empty, space is full of energy, fluctuating at the Planck Scale. Once we realize we live in a medium we can explain gravity through the principles of displacement.\n\nDisplacement is where mass takes up an area of a medium and increases the volume, but other things happen as well. The medium pushes up against mass and the mass resists the medium, this constitutes work. In all things this energetic field we live in, I simply call the scalar field (because it allows us to quantize each unit of space), comes in contact with mass, work is done and an EM field is produced, it even happens in living beings. This also explains why space is \"denser\" or \"thicker' in certain areas, namely around mass. The mass/energy equivalency determines the strength of the displacement, and this along with the rotation of the mass distorts spacetime, giving us the curvature that Einstein describes. I feel like using logic we can determine the veracity of this. On the ISS the density of the field is so much less that astronauts lose muscle mass and tone, it's because they don't have the resistance we are used to on Earth. On the Moon the density is 1/8 I believe so it's extremely easy to move through, much easier to move through than on Earth.\n\n[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/381327118\\_Unified\\_Cosmic\\_Theory\\_Dynamics\\_of\\_an\\_Energy\\_Ocean](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/381327118_Unified_Cosmic_Theory_Dynamics_of_an_Energy_Ocean)\n\n[https://www.academia.edu/120625879/Unified\\_Cosmic\\_Theory\\_The\\_Dynamics\\_of\\_an\\_Energy\\_Ocean](https://www.academia.edu/120625879/Unified_Cosmic_Theory_The_Dynamics_of_an_Energy_Ocean)\n\nI really want to build a version of the rotating pulsing tesla capacitors to see if my hypothesis of the overlapping field  does anything.\n\nMy paper also explains the anomalous Pioneer 10 and 11 acceleration, and all acceleration in space. When this field exerts pressure against an object that has inertia and a trajectory, rather than is at a stable rotation, it assists the object through the pressure it exerts on it. Which is why we se gravitational assists when objects move towards masses, because the field is denser and exerts more pressure against it.",
