        "content": "# This subreddit will be joining in on the June 12th-14th protest of Reddit's API changes that will essentially kill all 3rd party Reddit apps.\n\n\n## What's going on?\n\nA recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app permanently inaccessible to users.\n\nOn May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from Apollo to Reddit is Fun to Narwhal to BaconReader to Slide to Infinity.\n\nEven if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface. i.reddit.com has already been killed.\n\nThis isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.\n\n## What's the plan?\n\nOn June 12th, [many subreddits](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away permanently unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because we love Reddit, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.\n\n**The two-day blackout isn't the goal, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.**\n\n## What can you do as a user?\n\n* Complain. Message the mods of /r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site: message /u/reddit: submit a support request: comment in relevant threads on /r/reddit, such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/), leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to [this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/)\n\n* Spread the word. Rabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy. Bitch about it to your cat. Suggest anyone you know who moderates a subreddit join the coordinated mod effort at /r/ModCoord.\n\n* Boycott and spread the word...to Reddit's competition! Stay off Reddit entirely on June 12th through the 13th- instead, take to your favorite non-Reddit platform of choice and make some noise in support!\n\n* Don't be a jerk. As upsetting this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side. Please make every effort to be as restrained, polite, reasonable and law-abiding as possible.\n\n## What can you do as a moderator?\n\n* Join the coordinated effort over at /r/ModCoord\n\n* Make a sticky post showing your support, [A template has been created here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProCSS/wiki/api_protest_template) you can use or modify to your liking, and be sure to crosspost it to /r/ModCoord.\n\n**Thank you for your patience in the matter,**\n\n**-Mod Team**",

            "Depending on the sub, some teams are in the background only in helping things run smoothly. Meaning you only hear from us if it's bad. The sign of a healthy sub for some situations is exactly this, you question if there are mods but yet you don't quite see anything off the rails for long within the threads. (Again sub and team dependent on their style and type of content)\n\nA check-in could look like: Removing spam, verifying reports, taking abuse from upset people, banning offenders, removing off topic content. Which is what helps the sub grow. I have seen this sub go from 1k users to where it is now (currently 18,400). Prior to me coming aboard the sub was littered with spam, we had to remove hundreds of posts at the time.\n\nEDIT: If reddit does follow through with shutting down APIs or making them super expensive. My tools will no longer function and I will no longer be able to moderate this subreddit, meaning unless others want to step up that can provide a solid history. I will be turning off posting to this sub. This is the same story for many subs as a lot of moderators rely on additional resources to get their volunteer work accomplished.",

NYC subway stations are not climate controlled so it can be 20+ degrees hotter underground in the summer than it is at ground level; even though (most of) the train cars are climate controlled you can be dripping in sweat by the time you actually get on one.
