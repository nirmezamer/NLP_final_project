            "I'd like to take the opportunity in this thread to thank everyone whose comments I saw in the past few months regarding things to do in the Charlotte/Concord/Mooresville/etc. area. I garnered some great advice, and my road trip turned out even better than expected!\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/H2IQFGe\n\nI tried posting that gallery as a thread, but got modded, so I figure if I confine it to this thread, I'll be ok.\n\nI usually have hiccups and/or other unforeseen issues when I travel, but not this time.",
            "Getting commercials during green flag after all those yellows is insulting",
            "I'm going to Sonoma with one other person, and I'd like to get a headset/scanner. Would you recommend I get the intercom system so I can talk to my friend? And I assume we'll still be able to listen to the team audio and talk to each other at the same time? Additionally, if we don't get the headsets, would you says hearing protection is required pretty much everywhere?",
            "Headed to the truck race tomorrow by myself. It'll be my first Nascar race. What should I know about renting a scanner or maybe getting some autographs.",

            "Anyone know where to buy scanners for the Brickyard 400?",
            "Will be going to Atlanta for the summer night race next year. Any tips/tricks, places to go to eat or see, etc? Is premium parking worth it?",
            "So, let's say there's a doubleheader...Xfinity at one track, trucks at the other two different channels but the same network. It starts raining at the truck race and it doesn't stop until before the Xfinity race. The track dried. Will NASCAR compete with itself, or would it delay/postpone the truck race?",
            "Anybody at the track yet? How are lines to get in to the lot?",

            "Props to Frankie Muniz for taking the checkered flag in his Truck Series debut in P31, 20 laps down in the #22 Reaume Bros Ford(In fact it\u2019s the first time he has finished a race in the top three divisions). Could have been 27th or 28th had he not gone to the garage to fix an overheating problem.",

            "Bowyer going to only race at the tracks which have great nightlife outside of the FOX season lmao",
            "The surprise of the night for me was Dawson Cram. I will give credit when it is due. He took a truck that has been repeatedly wrecked or has finished laps down on pace this season so far by Thad Moffitt and got a top 20 finish on the lead lap. Great run for that new team this year.",
            "Domination. While Heim may have more hype especially with the Toyota affiliation, Eckes is making a case that they\u2019re co-championship favorites. No one else is even in their zip code really. Eckes tonight surpassed the 600 laps led mark this season.\n\n\n\nGreat run for Caruth and Dye as well",
            "That was probably the most truck series race in a while. Domination with a wreckfest, over aggression, wacky saves and 5 wide passing, and a retired driver coming back for a run at it one last time",
