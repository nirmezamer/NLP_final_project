            "Getting commercials during green flag after all those yellows is insulting",
            "I'm going to Sonoma with one other person, and I'd like to get a headset/scanner. Would you recommend I get the intercom system so I can talk to my friend? And I assume we'll still be able to listen to the team audio and talk to each other at the same time? Additionally, if we don't get the headsets, would you says hearing protection is required pretty much everywhere?",

            "BJ McLeod. Love this guy's passion for the sport, effort to make his stuff the best he can, and overall vibe. He also tends to drive with respect to his competitors and keep his equipment in good shape because he knows any repairs are coming out of his bank account. He's well-respected in the garage for a reason. I hope he wins a random plate race one day, because that would be awesome!\n\nETA: Excellent pick with Boris. Loved when he'd show up at Daytona and road courses as a kid. He was like a fun recurring character from a sitcom, but for NASCAR",

Not sure if hes considered an underdog bc he did make it to the RCR 31, but especially when he drove the 13 & 7 I felt he was at least underdog-ish.\n\nNow, since his truck days, been following Haley.  Gotta find me some 51 merch if he ends up staying there.  I gladly accepted his rain win at Daytona."
