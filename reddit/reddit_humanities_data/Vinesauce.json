        "content": "Hey chat. It's finally up!\n\n**We're launching an official Vinesauce Trading Card Collection.** \ud83d\ude0a\n\nVinny will likely talk about it today on Sunday stream, but you get the exclusivity first!\n\n[Kickstarter is live until July 9th](https://preview.redd.it/ag2y2l3u8z6d1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c4a813d0836dbf6013a23cf961e55b86de1bdff)\n\n**\u25b6\ufe0f The link:** [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pulsebooks/vinnyvinesaucetcc/](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pulsebooks/vinnyvinesaucetcc/)\n\nI really hope you'll enjoy it. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n\nIt's a very fun project, made with love (and a few members from the community, like [RT-Pickred](https://www.reddit.com/user/RT-Pickred/) himself)\n\n**Several things:**\n\n* We're making a Kickstarter project because we have absolutely no idea how many people would be interested, and we need funds to produce the intial stock\n* The main pack will feature **the 120 cards collection** (including 20 holographics), a **mini 36 pages booklet** (with lore stuff, jokes, trivias), and **a poster** by u/Tiny_Crusader\n* No boosters / random stuff. **Collection is complete**\n* It's **Vinny lore** focused only (no Joel stuff, for example)\n* The campaign is available **for a very limited time** (but if the goal is met, Vinny will also sell some packs on his merchandising site later)\n\nIf you saw the Cardsauce episode where I sent Vinny prototype boosters, it will be a quite similar content **(same concept with QR Codes  -> YouTube clips/origin of the meme)**.\n\nBut I'd say a good third of the cards have been changed (to avoid legally borderline stuff) and/or refined.\n\n***Please, don't ask if we can add \"this thing\" or \"this thing\" on a card:***  \n**It was kinda hard to chose what the main cards content would be...** So no super recent memes (like anomalies hunt, etc.) BUT I have several ideas if the project is successful enough to make an additionnal expansion deck.\n\nIt will also officially feature some neat stuffs too (**Rem Lezar** card, **Frich/Arzette** card, **Vinemon** card...), and special ***\"soundboard cards\"*** that will link to Vinny's famous sounds (splort, metal pipe...) uploaded on a dedicated YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/@VinesauceTCC).\n\n**\ud83d\udcc5 When:**  \nIf Kickstarter is successful, we expect the cards to be done in October and shipped **around November** (but still unsure)\n\nThanks for reading! \ud83d\ude0a",

            "Instantly backed with the highest tier (plus an extra $40 so my bestie can have a collection as well). You can see in my post history I'm a card freak, so this is one of those things where two of my interests collide.",

            "Holy shit that hit goal quickly. Also when I looked it had 420 backers. Nice."
