            "My brother in law went to one of this tours shows when Michael came to Australia. What these clips never show is how he hyped the crowd. There was a massive screen overlooking the stage where they played a clip of Michael essentually crash landing into the concert. He'd say things like can you hear me (whatever city he's in) and that he's about to land. Then he'd spring up like this and people lost their shit. My brother in law said people were fainting throughout the entire show, which went for like 2 and a half hours.",
            "Just jumped? Lolllll. This is more than just a jump. I mean, he rocket propelled into the air framed in pyrotechnics and landed in that quintessential MJ pose. Imagine seeing that live in 92.",
            "Bro stands there like he just flew in to whoop Frieza\u2019s ass.",
            "What a great crowd. Everyone just screaming to let Michael know he\u2019s got his underwear on the outside.",
            "So, Michael existed before the internet boom, before social media. He very rarely did interviews. His elusiveness (and obvious mega talent) made him so intensely famous people would faint in his presence. \n\nEverything he did on stage was calculated. The white socks were to bring attention to his feet. The taped fingertips were so people could pay attention to his hands. He wore sequined socks the first time he did his moonwalk so no one would miss the show. He would command the attention of the audience by standing still for long periods of time, then remove just his glasses or his hat or slightly move his head and people would literally pass out. \n\nSeeing Mj in his prime would have been like seeing a mythical figure to a lot of people. He was so big that it was unimaginable for our generation to understand.",
            "SECURITTEEEEHEEEEE!",
            "The most Heavy Metal kid in my school, the kid spent his entire allowance on metal albums.  Celtic Frost, DRI, Exodus, Slayer, etc.   Even he had Thriller in his collection.  And he said, \"Michael Jackson is killer.\"",
            "Fame was concentrated back then. Famous people were VERY famous, and MJ is probably the most famous person that I will be alive to have seen. Distribution was expensive, and attention wasn\u2019t fragmented. Millions went into production for everything that you saw on television. \n\nToday, fame is cheap, attention is cheap, production is cheap, and you just don\u2019t have to be that talented at all to get a following.\n\nNo one will ever be as famous as MJ in our lifetime.",
