        "content": "Hey everyone, I just needed to vent a bit. Recently(a bit more than a month ago) I decided to give Tinder and dating apps a go.\n\nTurns out the pool of people there are not for me, I don't like 99% of the girls on there and I'd barely get a few likes at all. \nBut out of nowhere while I was showing my friend my lack of success and troubles, I swiped someone interesting and it was my first match!\n\nWe talked for about a week, she was very engaged in the conversation, and her hobbies, interests, education , goals, tastes, beliefs and everything all perfectly align with mine! And she was initiating and writing just as much as me.\nWe gave ourselves a date for sunday, and on Saturday as I was about to show how well it was going to my friend... the conversation was gone. No way to see anything. She must have unmatched me, I thought \ud83d\ude1e\n\nI had never been ghosted before, and by someone so kind...\nI felt like shit for a good while, eventually moved on to other apps but never found anyone quite as compatible.\nBut anyway, recently I tried an app that claims to match people with high compatibility, and I saw her again... I decided to DM her, saying how I must have done something wrong and I was sorry, that being friends would truly be enough for me if she wanted to.\n\nShe accepted the match, and said she had the same experience. I disappeared from her conversations one day and she thought I had bailed on her, I ghosted her. She told me she felt really bad for a whole week because of that.\n\nEdit: I'll write an update soon in a few days!\nEdit 1.5: in response to lots of those comments, she is real. Not gonna go into details but it's not a bot.",

I feel bad for you for that \"being friends will truly be enough\" thing you did but that's just me, maybe she's into that. This just gives me... Simp-ish vibes, I don't know? Good luck though!",
            "Keep an open mind. Don't assume. A lot of comments make assumptions. Don't judge. You can't and don't know. When you can be comfortable with not knowing, it will give you so much peace. Just enjoy. Enjoy the conversation. Enjoy your meeting. Make enjoying your priority. Don't expect anything. Expectations lead to dissappointment. When you have trained the mindset of always enjoying, you will be a lot less dependent on the circumstances for your happiness. Enjoy!",

I\u2019m just trying to hook up with girls and have fun. I\u2019ve been using dating apps and meeting people in real life.\n\nBut I\u2019ve noticed that all the girls that show interest in me don\u2019t just want to hook up. They are looking for something real. Am i not good enough for just sex? Why does it seem every girl only wants one thing nowadays? Where are all the hoes at? \n\nI\u2019m tired of dealing with these innocent girls looking for love, when I\u2019m just trying to smash. I hear from friends all the time how they\u2019ve hooked up with some random girl at a bar or club. It\u2019s very upsetting.

Now that it's hear tho I'm at a loss because I'm also losing the girl I knew for years. We were together since we were 15 and her family was like the family I never had. Now I'm going back home and I'm just upset. Like this sucks. I'm losing everything I knew and more and I simply don't know what to do. Like I tell myself it's a new chapter it will be better. But we still love and care about each other we have no bad blood. We just aren't romanticly compatible. How do you move on when so much is changing. I haven't been home in years and that's where we (my wife and I) spent those pivotal years of being a teenager together. We grew up together. She's the only girl I've ever been with my whole life and this \"new\" dating scene feels so foreign. I'm so out of my element. How do you even explain to someone that the 10 year relationship didn't work. Like is that not embarrassing. She is and will always be like family to me. It just didn't work out and it didn't hit me till I finaled out today from the army that I will be losing some of the closest friends I've ever had in 2 days. I know I'll be ok in the long run but it just hurts so bad right now and I just want it to go away. ",
