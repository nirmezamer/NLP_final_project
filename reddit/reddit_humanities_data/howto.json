From there find a place you want all the wires to travel and bind them together with Velcro tape.

That should bend the metal a bit which would increase the ability to use the pliers (or scissors but be careful i would absolutely stab myself, to get in between the larger gap and pry the metal open until the belt is free and you can replace it",
