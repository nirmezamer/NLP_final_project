            "MUSIC UPDATE LET\"S GOOOOOO\n\nlove the new track, very bright in comparison to the other pieces, fits the academy well.  it almost reminds me of a visual novel bg for some reason?  tho i guess most of the game's story is told through a visual novel-like format\n\n>As a composer this is very exciting for me because for the first time I get to move from a broad, zoomed out perspective of planets, star systems and large factional groups to the up-close intimacy of airlocks, hallways, private rooms, and most importantly: individual people!\n\ni adore this game's music, i think it fits the tone and aesthetic perfectly, so the thought of getting more specific location and character themes is amazing."

        "content": "This tier list is made to attempt to rank the capital ships included in the [Ship/Weapon Pack]( https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=11018.0) mod by Dark.Revenant. It is heavily based on and inspired by the many great tier list of the base game made by user Grevious69, who was inspired by the tier lists made by user PureLSD. This list will follow largely follow the format of the tier lists by Grevious69 where I will include 2 ranks (first rank being in AI control, second rank in the player\u2019s control) if there is a significant performance difference in rank between an AI piloted VS a player piloted. If either person of the tier list feel that this list should be removed or changes made, please inform me to do so.\n\n**Cathedral:** B+ / A-\n\nThe station can move and it can hurt you, the Cathedral is similar to a station with a pilotable central ship piece surrounded by several uncontrollable modules. The central piece is the only part that by default has a shield and has a built-in weapon, the Redeemer missile which is a regenerating, long range guided missile that does high HE damage while also splits off into smaller missiles as it approaches its targets which can cause more damage as well as distract point defense. The Cathedral also has the Mine Strike ability like the Doom cruiser and normal stations, letting it supress an area, destroy swarms of fighters or be cheeky and target enemy ships unshielded engines. The other modules are similar to a station with their own weapons, armor, hull and flux though none of them have shields by default so consider the Makeshift Shield Generator hullmod. The separate health pool makes the Cathedral and incredibly tough nut to crack, making it ideal for holding the line while providing support. \n\nWhile it has several built-in exploration hullmods such as High Resolution Sensors, Salvage Gantry, and Surveying Equipment, its dreadful burn level and the fact it devours supplies and fuel just to maintain it means you wouldn\u2019t be exploring with it. It also moves slower than an Onslaught without its engine and costs an ungodly 85 DP. Ludicrous ship which while its really funny and incredibly difficult to take down like stations, you have to keep in mind that its so slow and expensive to deploy that alternatives like 2 Onslaughts is probably more practical.\n\n**Chronos:** A-\n\nFast high-tech battlecruiser, the Chronos\u2019s high speed, respectable flux stats and its Time Accelerator ability which speeds up time for itself similarly to phase ships allow it to quickly swoop in and out of combat to whittle down its opponents. It has fairly modest firepower but decent missiles which allows it to hunt down smaller targets while harassing and potentially slowly whittle down opponents of similarly size in larger battles. The Odyssey may be a preferable choice if you\u2019re looking for a capital that has stronger burst damage or flank attacks but the Chronos can still do so decently while being easier to pilot for both the player and AI while being cheaper to deploy. Has a burn level of 8 like the Conquest and Odyssey which also makes it pretty good when you need some protection when exploring.\n\n**EDIT:** Jazzlike-Anteater704 pointed out that the Chronos's Time Accelerator is more similar to the Scarab's Temporal Shell than phase ships time speed up.\n\n**Conquest (XIV):** B / A+\n\nA Conquest with the Fourteenth Battlegroup hullmod with its benefits such as 10 more OP, better armor and flux in exchange for lower speed and manuverability which isn\u2019t a bad deal considering the Conquest can use its Manuvering Jet ability to boost them so its mainly a better Conquest.\n\n**Conquest (LG):** B- / B+\n\nLion\u2019s Guard variant with the typical LG Energy Bolt Coherer, Solar Shielding and Special Modifications hullmod and even though it has 15 more OP compared to the standard Conquest, it also performs the heretical act of removing the Heavy Ballistic Integration hullmod so in practice you will have much less OP to play with. Changes all large ballistic mounts into hybrid mounts, meaning you can equip energy weapons which potentially allows interesting loadouts such as long-range beam sniping or close-range Plasma Cannons which the Conquest\u2019s great flux stats can support but its poor survivability due to poor armor and shield might make this dangerous and in the case of long-range beams, the Executor\u2019s ability to buff them might still be preferable unless you need the Conquest\u2019s higher manuverability and potentially speed. Another thing to note is that since there is no large ballistic mount, the Ballistic Rangefinder hullmod becomes useless on this so you can\u2019t benefit your medium ballistic mount. Kind of a meme ship like most LG variants and is the worse Conquest variant if you use plan to use ballistics and other ships might be preferable if you want to use large energy weapons.\n\n**Liberator:** B\n\nEssentially a low tech Odyssey, the Liberator is surprisingly fast for a low tech ship with its Burst Jets ability which propels the ship forward, letting it hunt down targets or make a quick push. Like most low tech ships, it has good armor, hull and large amount of ballistic weaponry however its quite weak in missile firepower. Also has a single fighter bay which can allow it to equip something like a Xyhpos wing for some support. Compared to the Retribution, the Liberator is much slower and has less firepower but it doesn\u2019t die to a breeze due to its good durability. A safer to use Retribution that can brawl well while still being capable of flank attacks but a burn level of 7 and it having less firepower than the Retribution and not as durable as the Onslaught means if you don\u2019t need the combined capabilities, other ships might be preferable.\n\n**Liberator (Luddic):** B+\n\nReplace the fighter bay with a built in Hammer Barrage large missile mount which I think is overall better since it gives the Liberator a much larger missile firepower to burst down opponents quicker.\n\n**Victory:** S-\n\nWith respectable durability and massive frontal ballistic and missile firepower, the Victory functions similarly as a Midline Onslaught with 2 built in weapons, the Klutoekhnes Assault Gun. The Klutoekhnes are essentially are an even faster firing Hephaesteus Assault Guns that function on charges though its more than generous enough to absolutely demolish armor and hull. It also has an absurd amount of weapon mounts including multiple missiles mounts and with the Victory's better flux stats, it can more comfortably fill its many weapon slots unlike an Onslaught.  Has a similar Burn Drive ability as the Onslaught called Maximum Drive which lasts a shorter duration but allows some turning. On the downsides, it\u2019s a little slow and has poor shield coverage so it can be vulnerable to flank attacks and it costs 60 DP to deploy but honestly you pay for what you get, a ship with outstanding firepower at anything in front of it.\n\n* This tier list is mainly my own feelings and experience so your experience may differ.

            "For cathedral  must say a one thing; Exploring with cathedral means you are going with big and probably low tech fleet, as a anchor this ship holds its weight against \\[redacted\\]. This is the main deal, 1 cathedral equivalent of 4-5 shepherd, 1.5-2 apogee etc. which means you can use your 30 ship cap for more firepower or transport capacity. Other than I agree with you.",
            "Thanks for the tier list! I have a question though, about building the cathedral. I really struggle to make it worth its 85 DP points cost, do you have a good build (or good tips) to make me try again and get the ship working in endgame fights/multiple ordos clearing while lifting its weight?\n\nThank you in advance",
