            "Abyss 4K / Aliens 4K / True Lies 4K...  WTF happened?  It's like the distributor produced 1/3 of what was needed to meet demand on release day.  I should have driven like 5 hours to Canada and bought it there because it seems like Canadians got it on release day.\n\nEDIT: Revisiting this a few months later.  I ended up getting a copy of these through Walmart and thankfully mine all played without issue.  I think the problem isn't so much the distributor.  I have seen this in the past with Amazon where they have these little disputes with Disney so then Disney screws them on stocking things.  It seems like Walmart got a few shipments and then were filling online orders only (in store was unavailable) but Amazon kept delaying mine into May 2024.  And I pre-ordered this back in January or whenever the pre-order went live.",

        "content": "Hello, 4K Collectors!\n\nThree months ago, we hit an incredible milestone of 50K members on the sub. It's a bit mind-boggling, but in three short months, we just hit 60K!\n\nWe didn't expect this next milestone to happen this quickly, but it's definitely a testament to the passion people still have for collecting physical media...and we're all for it!\n\nWe've had a blast seeing more collectors join the community, seeing new collectors take the dive by posting their first hauls, and seeing everyone watch each other's backs with posting sales and release information. If you asked me a few years back if there would be this much of a massive growth, I wouldn't have believed you. It's incredibly reassuring knowing that collectors are out there --- and that this hobby will continue to endure. \n\nSo, you guys know what time it is...It's time for another giveaway!

After identifying which films you're entering for, please write about a film you're still (unfortunately) waiting on to get a 4K Blu-ray release! Tell us why you're waiting for this film specifically (perhaps get into depth as to what the film means to you, what you're hoping 4K/HDR can bring to the table, how long you've been waiting, etc.). Effort is important here -- we like meaningful entries, not just one line comments.\n\nAnd it's as easy as that! Winners will be selected by **July 5th, 2024**. We will post the winners here and tag them. We appreciate ALL of you for being a part of this community. Thank you so much for making it what it is today.

            "Sweeney Todd, Crawl, Smile \n\nI am really looking forward to Fantastic Mr. Fox getting a 4K release. I have always been a fan of animated movies but never really got into stop motion films, so after hearing that this was a great one I decided to check it out and was left with an incredible experience! It was my first Wes Anderson movie as well and is still to date my favorite from him. I just adore all of the visuals, characters, and music in the movie. Being able to see all of the stop motion elements in 4K would certainly make the movie even better, so I really hope it happens one day!",
            "Young Guns _ Sweeny Todd _   The Mist\n\nI am really looking forward to Tombstone. I always loved that movie, and we used to watch it as a family every Christmas. I will definitely Preorder day 1 that is is available.",
            "Wow 60k of us. Good to know physical media is important to so many others. Congrats.",
            "Smile, This Mist, Young Guns.\n\nWaiting on One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. You all know why - it's an absolute classic in every way. I've never seen an actor cook as hard as Nicholson does in this. And Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratchet? Come on now. One of the best villains of all time! Looks like we'll be getting this next year for the 50th anniversary - can't wait.",
            "Young Guns, The Mist, Sweeney Todd\n\nI'd like to see a 4K release of American Splendor. It never even made it to Blu Ray and my old DVD seems to have grown legs. I would pick it up used on DVD if I saw it somewhere, but I'm holding on to my money for a better version!",
            "Next stop 100K! All the K's\n\n![gif](giphy|Ae7SI3LoPYj8Q|downsized)",
            "Hi - thanks for the chance - my picks would be either Scream 2, Scream 3 or The Mist\n\nI am really hoping for.a 4K of Kingdom of Heaven (Directors Cut) someday - nobody does a period movie better than Sir Ridley Scott and his Directors Cut is outstanding and I would love to see it in all its 4K glory, and for others to also see the Director\u2019s cut who may not have, since it is night & day better than the original theatrical cut.",
            "Young Guns, Sweeny Todd, The Mist.\n\nI'm very keen for Willy Wyler's Ben Hur to make it to 4K. As well as being shot with special lenses, it's an epic from a time when films of such scale could be made. Charlton Heston is also one of my favourite actors and I have had his films on VHS thru 4K over the years. But this one is missing and notably so.",
            "Rosemary\u2019s Baby\nSweeney Todd\nScream 2\n\nI\u2019m waiting on There Will Be Blood because the Blu Ray is sourced from the original 1080p DCP that PTA reluctantly made for theaters, because he wanted people so badly to see it in 35mm. He shot on extremely low ASA film and a proper rescan from the negative would be atrociously beautiful.",
            "Rosemary\u2019s Baby\nYoung Guns\nThe Mist\n\nWaiting for Dogma on 4K, I would love to see this come out in 4K, the prices on the OOP Bluray are crazy, and I love Kevin Smith films. Sadly, I don\u2019t even own this on DVD and I haven\u2019t seen it in years. Which is why I would love a 4K release. \n\nThanks for the giveaway!"

            "Usually Criterion makes sure that the transfer is the best one and gets approval/supervision from the film\u2019s director. They also tend to have more special features, commentaries, etc. In the case of Wall-E, the criterion release is the only one that has Dolby Vision. Otherwise as far as I understand, the 4K transfer is identical to the Disney release."
