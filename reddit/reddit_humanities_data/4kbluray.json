            "OP, I appreciate the work you've done here to consolidate information on players, HDR, and transfer quality. A repository for this information will be invaluable to newcomers and has been needed for some time.\n\nI will suggest however, that the requirement for \"most desired\" titles to be limited to a single thread be removed. As I'm sure you are well aware, that thread does not generate much meaningful discussion on the the possibility, plausibility, and merits of particular films yet to be upgraded. Such discussion should generate enthusiasm within the community, and excitement at the prospect of future releases, as well as provide insight and speculation as to the likelihood of such an upgrade. Consider also, the potential visibility such threads would provide. If I google \"the holdovers 4k blu-ray\" for instance, the first search result links to an r/Bluray thread on the matter rather than one in this subreddit simply because one is not allowed to exist here. I propose that we allow perhaps one thread per film in the form \"Will X come to 4K Blu-ray\". Who knows, perhaps this visibility could even persuade some studios to move forward with a release or two.",

            "Abyss 4K / Aliens 4K / True Lies 4K...  WTF happened?  It's like the distributor produced 1/3 of what was needed to meet demand on release day.  I should have driven like 5 hours to Canada and bought it there because it seems like Canadians got it on release day.\n\nEDIT: Revisiting this a few months later.  I ended up getting a copy of these through Walmart and thankfully mine all played without issue.  I think the problem isn't so much the distributor.  I have seen this in the past with Amazon where they have these little disputes with Disney so then Disney screws them on stocking things.  It seems like Walmart got a few shipments and then were filling online orders only (in store was unavailable) but Amazon kept delaying mine into May 2024.  And I pre-ordered this back in January or whenever the pre-order went live.",

It's a bit mind-boggling, but in three short months, we just hit 60K!\n\nWe didn't expect this next milestone to happen this quickly, but it's definitely a testament to the passion people still have for collecting physical media...and we're all for it!\n\nWe've had a blast seeing more collectors join the community, seeing new collectors take the dive by posting their first hauls, and seeing everyone watch each other's backs with posting sales and release information. If you asked me a few years back if there would be this much of a massive growth, I wouldn't have believed you. It's incredibly reassuring knowing that collectors are out there --- and that this hobby will continue to endure. \n\nSo, you guys know what time it is...It's time for another giveaway! Please thank fellow community member u/Halflife84 for his graciousness in giving these codes back to the community. We appreciate you!!!\n\n*DISCLAIMER: Titles are only redeemable in the U.S. -- Sorry to our international friends!* \n\nHere are the titles up for grabs!\n\n**GIVEAWAY TITLES** \n\n***The following titles are redeemable only in the U.S. via*** [***Paramountmovies.com***](http://Paramountmovies.com) \n\n* Rosemary's Baby\n* Sweeny Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\n* Smile\n* Crawl\n* Scream 2\n* Scream 3\n\n***The following titles are redeemable only in the U.S. via*** [***lionsgate.com/redeem***](http://lionsgate.com/redeem)\n\n* Young Guns\n* The Mist\n\n**RULES**\n\nYou will need to comment on this post for an entry.

(Winners will only receive one code, but this will give you an opportunity to win other films if your first selection is won by someone else). \n2. After identifying which films you're entering for, please write about a film you're still (unfortunately) waiting on to get a 4K Blu-ray release! Tell us why you're waiting for this film specifically (perhaps get into depth as to what the film means to you, what you're hoping 4K/HDR can bring to the table, how long you've been waiting, etc.). Effort is important here -- we like meaningful entries, not just one line comments.\n\nAnd it's as easy as that! Winners will be selected by **July 5th, 2024**. We will post the winners here and tag them. We appreciate ALL of you for being a part of this community. Thank you so much for making it what it is today.

            "Rosemary\u2019s Baby\nSweeney Todd\nScream 2\n\nI\u2019m waiting on There Will Be Blood because the Blu Ray is sourced from the original 1080p DCP that PTA reluctantly made for theaters, because he wanted people so badly to see it in 35mm. He shot on extremely low ASA film and a proper rescan from the negative would be atrociously beautiful.",
            "Rosemary\u2019s Baby\nYoung Guns\nThe Mist\n\nWaiting for Dogma on 4K, I would love to see this come out in 4K, the prices on the OOP Bluray are crazy, and I love Kevin Smith films. Sadly, I don\u2019t even own this on DVD and I haven\u2019t seen it in years. Which is why I would love a 4K release. \n\nThanks for the giveaway!",
            "* Crawl\n* Sweeny Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\n* Rosemary's Baby\n\nFor \u201cCrawl\u201d I saw it in theaters with my friend and we really enjoy it despite it\u2019s poor marketing and that\u2019s something since my friend rarely like horror/gory films. Given the movie takes place in mostly dark settings I\u2019m hoping the HDR with keep the quality of what we saw in the theater. None of that glowing edge around certain object/people like what you usually get with non-HDR content. Been hoping to get \u201cParamount Scares: Volume 1\u201d but it\u2019s still a little too high for my budget.\n\nIf you were meaning a film not on the list than that would be \u201cJohn Carter (of Mars)\u201d. Despite the BD being pretty great, it still doesn\u2019t meet the quality of what I saw in theaters. The HDR should hopefully fix that and then some. It\u2019s a real shame Disney ignored its 10th anniversary in 2022. The movie actually did well on its opening weekend despite losing the number spot by a small margin compared with \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d which took that spot. One would even think that Disney would\u2019ve released as a way to somehow exploit \u201cStar Wars\u201d fans as it\u2019s one of the many inspirations for Lucas\u2019 saga.\n\nThanks for your generosity and good luck to everyone.",
            "Rosemary\u2019s Baby, Smile and The Mist.\n\nI would greatly appreciate seeing both Dogma and The Mothman Prophecies in true 4k!\n\nI\u2019m lucky. I have a Blu-ray of Dogma from when it came out.\nHowever, I\u2019m drawn to the minutiae of details within this movie\u2026 and Blu-ray just can\u2019t show that level of information!\n\nSadly, Mothman Prophecies is only available as a DVD. It is an atmospheric movie that would have so much more to offer in 4k!\n\nI hope to see both of these in 4k within my lifetime!",
            "1) Rosemary\u2019s Baby, Sweeny Todd, and Young Guns\n\n2) The first film I desperately want a 4k release of is Stargate (1994). This film, while not only being one of the best sci-fi films of the 90s, also holds a special place for me in my personal history of physical media. This was the first movie my family watched after buying a new Sony Wega tv and dvd player. We rented it from our local video store, Carbonated Video, and it was mind blowing. The picture was so crisp and clean, the colors vibrant, and no VHS ever looked the same after it. Also this film is excellent and deserves a UHD release. This is the one!\n\nAnother film I am now rooting for 4k release is Wim Wender\u2019s Directors Cut of Until the End of the World. As of now it is only available as Blu-ray, which apparently was made from a 4K master, according to blu-ray.com. So if there\u2019s a 4k master, where\u2019s the disc?! Anyways with Wenders\u2019 Perfect Days releasing in 4k in July, I can only hope we might get another 4k Wenders\u2019 film.",
            "Sweeney Todd, Crawl, Smile \n\nI am really looking forward to Fantastic Mr. Fox getting a 4K release. I have always been a fan of animated movies but never really got into stop motion films, so after hearing that this was a great one I decided to check it out and was left with an incredible experience! It was my first Wes Anderson movie as well and is still to date my favorite from him. I just adore all of the visuals, characters, and music in the movie. Being able to see all of the stop motion elements in 4K would certainly make the movie even better, so I really hope it happens one day!",
            "Young Guns _ Sweeny Todd _   The Mist\n\nI am really looking forward to Tombstone. I always loved that movie, and we used to watch it as a family every Christmas. I will definitely Preorder day 1 that is is available.",

            "OP for starters, do you even have the same TV settings in effect for Blu-ray vs 4K? A lot of TVs switch modes when in HDR picture mode so this is worth checking. You're going to want to dial in your TV settings as best you can, what's the TV model? You should look up and follow RTINGs calibration guide for your TV model, keeping in mind different TV inputs and devices may all have their own default configurations, on top of standard vs HDR modes. Most likely a lot of the differences seen here are due to your TV calibration rather than Blu vs 4K.",

If your TV is set to \u201cstandard\u201d and you claim the SDR Blu-ray\u2019s motion seems more \u201cfluid,\u201d you\u2019re going to want to make sure you don\u2019t have motion smoothing and image processing gunk enabled giving you that artificial fluidity.",
