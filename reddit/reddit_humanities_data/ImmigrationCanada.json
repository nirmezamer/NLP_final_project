            "Hi there, I am looking to move to Canada in October. Have tried through the IRCC to make an application for work permit or for anything and was told I was ineligible for any Federal Applications at the moment. I have a Ba in Counselling and Psychotherapy and also a Bsc (Hons) in Counselling and Psychotherapy. I just turned 36 so kicked out of the pool for IEC and am really struggling to find out why I am not eligible. Wondering can anyone help me??",
