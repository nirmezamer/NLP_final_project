            "As someone who is on medical leave currently because of depression, this is fairly accurate if you want to tightly squeeze everything in one overview.\n\nTheres a lot of nuances missing here of course. But I honestly wish people would take a look at this and try to understand that it sometimes (maybe even mostly) isnt laziness. Its feeling overwhelmed by the simplest tasks sometimes. And its not feeling sadness itself, but its a feeling of helplessness, lack of perspective, circling thoughts that spiral downward without giving one the opportunity to even breathe.",
