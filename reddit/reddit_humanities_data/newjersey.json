            "I'm selling my old car this weekend and buying a new one next month, as I have to wait for delivery. I will be taking the plates off of the old car and want to reuse them for the new car. How long am I able to keep the plates to install on the new car before the MVC rules them as non-returned plates? The website says \"if you don't intend to transfer them to a new car, they must be returned\" but I do intend to transfer them, just after 4-8 weeks. Help?",
            "Where are the affordable starter homes in NJ?",
            "Question for fellow Democrats from Passaic County. Is the ugly infighting between the Adamo and Speziale camps turning you off politically too?\u00a0\n\n\nWith all the in-county smear tactics I will definitely vote for Biden, Andy Kim and my congressman for the primary, but I honestly don't know who to vote for with the sheriff and county commissioner candidates and may not vote for any of them. We're getting fliers from both camps in the mail just about every day leveling all sorts of accusations against each other and I'm tired of it. I immediately toss them into the paper recycling box without bothering to glance at them anymore.\u00a0",

            "can my wife start Maternity Leave application before stop working officially?   I know it will take a while for them to process the application. I don't want to apply 4 weeks before the due date and them taking 1 or 2 months to approve the insurance. \n\nbaby should be here July 15-20. what is your advice?",
            "Just got an offer to work in Morris plains, NJ. Salary is still in negotiation (is an inside move from the same company but different country so they are still figuring out the salary conversion)\n\noffer is in the 165-190k range. Assuming the worst case let\u2019s say it\u2019s 165\n\nim not from the US, is this enough for a family of  two? (Wife and me\u2026well and the dog) what would be the expected monthly cost of living between rent, groceries, etc, etc\u2026 what else is something I would need to consider?\n\nwe don\u2019t plan to have kids and My expectation is to get back to my home country to retire so not  really looking into buying Or renting something big. A 2bdr apt would be more than enough. We like to travel and I would need to keep paying my house mortgage back in MX (around $1200 month and that is our biggest expense In here)\n\nand sorry if this comes as a ridiculous question but looking into Reddit its could basically look like living in the US with any salary less than a million bucks is basically being poor.",

New flight was set to leave Thursday night at 9:15pm. We didn't leave until 11:45pm. We were told we wouldn't miss our connection in London but hey here we are stuck in London now instead of Newark still waiting for our final flight. It's like a south park episode.",
            "Why are private jets even allowed to operate out of Newark? They should be relegated to smaller local airports, Teterboro, etc.",

            "I'm a pilot.\n\nThe private jet going off the runway causing a runway closure is not surprising as that's an NTSB event. It's like a bad car accident, essentially.\n\nHowever, EWR is not good. It's far too small for the amount of flights it has. There's just not enough pavement for all the aircraft that operate out of there.",
            "I was delayed about 3 hours, which sucked, but I also don't think it's unreasonable to shut down a runway when a plane crashes. That it was a private plane with one passenger is not really relevant, logistically.",
            "Flew out of EWR yesterday late and was fortunate to not get hit by this. NJ Transit trains failing Monday, massive weather delays Wednesday, this nonsense yesterday. Our infrastructure is crumbling.",
