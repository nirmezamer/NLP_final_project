            "I'm selling my old car this weekend and buying a new one next month, as I have to wait for delivery. I will be taking the plates off of the old car and want to reuse them for the new car. How long am I able to keep the plates to install on the new car before the MVC rules them as non-returned plates? The website says \"if you don't intend to transfer them to a new car, they must be returned\" but I do intend to transfer them, just after 4-8 weeks. Help?",
            "Where are the affordable starter homes in NJ?",

            "can my wife start Maternity Leave application before stop working officially?   I know it will take a while for them to process the application. I don't want to apply 4 weeks before the due date and them taking 1 or 2 months to approve the insurance. \n\nbaby should be here July 15-20. what is your advice?",
            "Hi! I just accepted a fellowship near Princeton starting mid-August. I'm a bit worried about logistics, as I've lived in the Kansas City area for the past six years, so this is a big move for me! I'm wondering where the best places to live are. Since this is a fellowship, I don't have the biggest stipend, so I am mostly looking at places with affordable 1-bed's trying to find roommates for a 2-bed situation. Since I've lived in a big city for a while, I'm also looking at Philadelphia, since it's less than an hour of a commute to my workplace. That being said (especially as a midwesterner), I'd be worried about the winter roads if I lived in Philadelphia. Does anyone have any advice? Thanks!",
            "Why its just another super windy day in New Jersey",
            "Anyone else worried about the impact of the chevron decision? Usually with a lot of these crazy things happening I reassure myself that I live in a blue state run by a blue governor that (for the most part) looks out for my safety. \n\nFar reaching federal decision making has the chance to screw citizens on a national level and Im not sure it can be mitigated living in a blue state",

            "Hmm. Makes one wonder why they arent tested",
            "Oh how kind that hes open to the idea",
            "It's insane that this isn't already a requirement. Wtf",
            "The current rules for the state is simple. When a victim is raped she goes to a hospital and evidence is collected. The victim tells the police whether she wants the evidence tested. The victim decides and tells LEO whether she wants to press charges. The kit is held in storage. A couple questions arises: Can police open and look at the evidence? With or without the victims cooperation? How successful you think the prosecutor will be in court without a victim? Defense lawyers will have a field day with that. Should this be addressed as well? The current issue is that some kits are not tested when victims comes forward and request they be done. That is completely wrong and traumatizing. Stronger laws and enforced rules need to be in place. It should be ordered that every single case should be reexamined to determine if a victim came forward and whether it was tested or not.",

New flight was set to leave Thursday night at 9:15pm. We didn't leave until 11:45pm. We were told we wouldn't miss our connection in London but hey here we are stuck in London now instead of Newark still waiting for our final flight. It's like a south park episode.",

Despite this, the vast majority of funding goes to 4-year publics.\n\nYou are related, work with, or have family members that went to community college.
