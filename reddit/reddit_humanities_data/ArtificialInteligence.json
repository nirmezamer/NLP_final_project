However, there is no need to worry as these changes will primarily focus on improving organization, resources, and pre-prepared content. To ensure that the community is fully informed and able to provide feedback, multiple opportunities will be given for feedback on the changes.\n\nThe first round of feedback gathering is through this thread as a \"Request-For-Comments\" (RFC), which is a standard method of gathering feedback. There will be multiple rounds of the RFC process as the changes are prepared and implemented.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Rules on posting new applications / self-promotion / AI generated content\n   * Posts that are applications consisting of a ChatGPT-api \"skin\" or similar will be prevented or confined to specific stickied threads.\n   * AI generated content specific to the arts (writing, visual arts, music) require flair, or will be confined to specific stickied threads.\n   * Blog links should consist of high-quality content. Posts that link to blogs that are purely promotional will be removed.\n   * Posts with just links will be prohibited unless there is a certain word count of detail included. Some effort must be put in.\n   * Should we prevent posts that are written by AI? There exist models that could be used in a Mod-bot, but this is a question we need feedback on.\n* Use of flair in order to organize posts. Note that new flair has been added already, we are open to more suggestions.\n* What should the sub policy on NSFW applications and techniques in regards to AI/ML application?\n* We would like to include the community with ideas for mod-bots. While some standard bots will be used for basic maintenance, but what interesting things can the community come up with for AI/ML bot functions?\n* Cultivating beginner, intermediate, and advanced resources to assist people in finding information, training, models, technical data, etc. that they are looking for\n* Starting substack/podcast to interview people throughout the AI/ML spectrum. This could include philosophers and thinkers, programmers, scientists, business people, even those with antithetical views on AI\n*  If you would like to create banners that represent the sub, please do so with the appropriate size. Any method of creation is acceptable.\n\nIt should go without saying that everyone should be treated with respect. I personally feel that we all know this and it doesn't need to be hammered into people\u2019s heads. Be nice.\n\nThank you for your patience and assistance!",

            "But, I'd also like to comment on the direction. I have seen others that do focus on a specific direction. But what if the big picture were the focus? I keep ranting about Roger Penrose's views on human consciousness and what it means for human value v. ai, which I won't go into here. The point, though, is that it is possible for a group to actually make the focus defining and thinking about the fundamental level of what this or that type of computer is and does versus a human. That does bring in science, though, very much, not just philosophy. That's why I keep thinking about how Penrose associates the collapse of the wave function with how consciousness emerges from the organ of the brain. That's something non-computational, and, so, even a quantum computer as currently conceived, if that's true, can generate something like human consciousness, though maybe some other definition of AGI is possible. I find those sorts of discussion guiding in that they sort of shed light on the borders of absolute human value, which may not be replicated, perhaps, at least not now. I can discuss those things, whereas when CPUs or training at Nvidia or all that, I'm lost. So, I'm looking for a place to look at things at the fundamental level and what the implications are on a big scale.",

I've raised concerns amongst my network and friends about how AI, even in its infancy already has the capacity to replace less skilled jobs and lower quality content on social media.\n\nHowever, the constant \"comeback\" I hear is that AI is not there yet. So, I've decided to start playing around with it and see how far someone like myself would be able to take AI and try to create content in an industry they have 0 understanding of.\n\n**Where it led me to:**\n\nI've currently created a fictional character called \"Lil Nietzsche\". This is a fictional persona, that draws from the works of Friedrich Nietzsche (German Philosopher) and creates hip-hop songs.\n\nI've so far used very simple and free AI tools to spin up a Youtube channel that I'm going to use to play around to try and create a diverse range of hip-hop songs.\n\nSo far with *alrightish* results, which you can see here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N63K85Ci6zY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N63K85Ci6zY)\n\nI'm using:\n\n1. ChatGPT (Creates Persona and Lyrics)\n2. Suno (Creates the Audio)\n3. Veed (Brings it all together)\n\n**I have 3 goals with this concept project:**\n\n1. Firstly using only free tools and no technical background, I want to see how far I can stretch the AI capabilities to produce content\n2. When I'm happy with the quality of the content I can produce, I want to use the same tools and create a fully automated production pipeline using their APIs\n3. The last goal will be to create a full concept album using only AI. Including Artwork and Videoclips\n\nWith the end result being, that I'd be able to show that using AI only it's possible to produce/create \"good enough\" content at a far faster pace than any individual/business would be able to do so on their own.\n\n**Why I'm reaching out for your help:**\n\nThere's too much information and AI tools out there for me to be able to navigate, filter and test all of them in order to find which ones would be the best fit for what I'm trying to achieve.\n\nApart from the ones I'm already using, I plan on using Midjourney for the Artwork and I'm still yet to figure out what to use for Video generation.\n\nI'm just looking for some pointers from this community, for tools that could possibly fit my needs, so I can narrow down my search and start exploring a bit more in-depth.\n\n**Thank you in advance for tips or pointers you can provide, I'd greatly appreciate it**",
