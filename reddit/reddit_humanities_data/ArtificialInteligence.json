Posts that link to blogs that are purely promotional will be removed.\n   * Posts with just links will be prohibited unless there is a certain word count of detail included. Some effort must be put in.\n   * Should we prevent posts that are written by AI?

            "The first thing I\u2019d like to note is that the community here has a user count that\u2019s nearly in excess of 100,000, but interaction seems to be minimal, at least in terms of discussion, and I think this could be turned around a lot, and that it exists and persists for a few reasons, in my opinion.\n\nThe biggest problem here, similar in some ways to Quora, is that it\u2019s not, for lack of a better way to put it, structured; you might say that it lacks a solid foundation.\n\nRight now, it seems more of a general location to post A.I. content, which isn\u2019t inherently a bad thing, but it doesn\u2019t seem to come across as a go-to location for experts, given the post differentiation towards matters often relating to unrealistic concepts and proposed implementations, outside of those that are mainly promotional.\n\nWhich, this in-turn leads to another problem, in that you have people that do come here, from what I\u2019ve seen, seeking some sort of expertise like the above, but generally can encounter problems.\n\nBecause of the above, in part, more entertaining and light-hearted discussion on subjects that are, to say, outside the realm of current reality, tend to gravitate more towards options catered to those, whether that be /r/singularity or /r/ChatGPT , to which I\u2019ve also seen people simply recommend or forward others to /r/MachineLearning for more academic discussion, or one of the computer science communities.\n\nI think you have the capability here to essentially be sort of a nexus between those, as long as some sort of dynamic is applied, structured, and likely enforced. I can\u2019t count how many times I\u2019ve scrolled through the postings here, trying to get through the promotional content or projects, looking for discussion, only to find it, at times, in relation to matters that just made me sigh.\n\nDo I expect that\u2019s the case for everyone? No. Do I think there are at least *some* similar cases that are affecting user-base interaction and associated growth? Probably, yes.\n\n>\tFacilitate philosophical and ethical discussions about AI\n\nI think it would help to be more specific here.\n\n>\tThere will be multiple rounds of the RFC process as the changes are prepared and implemented.\n\nI understand the sentiment, but i don\u2019t think this is really needed, especially when interaction, in my opinion, seems to be on the lower side. I would imagine you see diminishing returns.\n\nAs to the proposed rules on new posts, I think you\u2019re on the right track.\n\n>\tCultivating beginner, intermediate, and advanced resources to assist people in finding information, training, models, technical data, etc. that they are looking for\n\nI think this is a great idea, but based on the contents of such so far, i would say you need to be *extremely* careful, if you want this to be held as reputable and by-extension be forwarded traffic.\n\n>\tStarting substack/podcast to interview people throughout the AI/ML spectrum. This could include philosophers and thinkers, programmers, scientists, business people, even those with antithetical views on AI\n\nThis should be fine, but I would likely place the other matters as higher priority I think, or at least that would carry more weight and facilitate progression.\n\nNow that I\u2019m out of prior agreements, I can actually talk about this. I\u2019m an A.I. Scientist that\u2019s worked both in leadership in cases, as well as in international / multi-national groups. I\u2019ve also built and exited a company around it, and have plans to segue into other industries on the subject.\n\nI dont mind volunteering or advising in a manner of speaking, if it helps to move things along, so long as it\u2019s not an everyday occurence or overwhelming.",

            "AI moderation regarding AI bots on a subject discussing AI? Intresting...",
            "A suggestion. \n\nMany, especially enthusiastic youngsters (I\u2019m a permanent one!) who are excited, during discovery, will post without realising there are karma or other restrictions. \n\nTo avoid having them make instant mental decisions like \u2018oh I\u2019m not welcome\u2019 or :( the matrix or authority grid of dogooders blocked me :( my words are lame :( it\u2019s useful IMO if great care is given to guidance on how to get a post accepted, or how to retrieve a deleted post, and how to copy and paste it on a mobile to another subreddit or how to repost it later if they attain the karma level set. \n\nMany struggle to copy and paste in phone apps. And many struggle to remember to go back to old posts that passion and effort was put into. So you end up potentially blocking people who\u2019s sometimes most natural, free and interesting first posts end up stuck in the \u2018deleted posts\u2019 graveyard. As there\u2019s no formal instruction on how to access the deleted post, and no encouragement to go back and try again later, I think that graveyard takes a lot of value from forums. It\u2019s a bit like the thousands of web forums online where you have to 2fa sign-in with legitimate email before posting a tip, suggestion, observation or advice, which discourages you from sharing the detail you took time to learn and can see people might value. \n\nI don\u2019t know the reddit clients that well, ios or Android or browsers via PC or osx etc, so I don\u2019t know if this already exists. But are there reminders that can occasionally appear to remind users of posts that were deleted or moderated out, to suggest they either try repost or try to copy/edit in notes app/re-paste?\n\nI\u2019m sure there\u2019s many actual users, no matter how simple or trivial or insane or weird or badly spelled or simplistic their posts are, who loose interest overall with the app or website, when their posts are moderated or consigned to permanent graveyard. \n\nMaybe there\u2019s a non-official reddit client or web app that uses api, that can remind people on particular dates, the metadata on whatever is moderated off the public web, and auto deleted. Eg. On new years or your birthday or some holiday, you get a notification:\n\n\u201cthese are the posts that didn\u2019t get through on past months years. Did you want to try again? Perhaps the moderation policy is different? The mods are asleep! Maybe you learned more and wanted to add or edit these posts to leave a kind guide to someone, to save them time?\u201d \n\nWhere you could then tap to choose a year, tap to chose a subreddit or tap to choose a post based on length etc, to re-edit or repost, where you\u2019re hand-held through sharing a lost post. \n\nAn advantage is also to the mentally or physically exhausted who are desperately seeking advice and are a bit over-run and non-technical. They often have overwhelming challenges already, the friction of automoderation is a serious one that most affects those who have no capacity to stand up for themselves when their well-being is under pressure or compromised. \n\nI\u2019d assign high value to the exact words any automod bot uses. And ensure they are very supportive and briefly apologetic, but not so brief it\u2019s without humanity or the personal touch. Then gently and kindly lift the moderated individual to a point where their aren\u2019t discouraged or suppressed but instead are guided and advised. \n\nThere\u2019s a sterile, dead formality that ends up being terse and artificial, that many well-meaning IT or science or industry focuses people apply. It\u2019s often found from complaint and striving for brevity and consensus while being precise and keeping text as concise and to-the-point as possible. It does come across as very hard and excessively blunt and almost cold, more often than not.",

I have 754 overall karma, for example, but on this sub I think I have only a few. or can I post now? As well, I want to make sure not to approach the \"self-promotional\" zone. I'm thinking to summarize three blog posts worth of my thinking into a short text I can post here directly and no one would have to go offsite to respond. But, I'd put a link to my blog at the end in case anyone wanted to pursue it further or read my sources or something. Is that appropriate?",

I found out the requirement of 25 karmas already high, but that forced me to read the publications, understand and feel the thread audience. So that was positive. But frankly the 100 karma threshhold feels high, and may discourage new users who come with new ideas. Could there be another way to certify or authenticate with humans in the loop?\n\nWhat about the permission to post a single post after 25 karmas, and the second after 50 karmas? And 100 karmas would me the threshhold for unlimited posts. \nThe upvote system would filter IMO.\n\n[Edit I just realized this is an old post]. Does 25 or 100 karma limit applies now?"
