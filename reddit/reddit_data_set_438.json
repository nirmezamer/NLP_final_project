        "content": "I (34F) had a birthday dinner last night that my partner (33M) and I covered the cost of the food for all guests, all they needed to pay for was any drinks they wanted. \n\n3 of the guests got me a joint gift of sourdough bread and a jar of honey from some artistrian bread cafe. \n\nI was polite and thanked them for the gift and we carried on with a nice evening but fuck I am pissed off about such a shit gift! Who the fuck gifts a loaf of fucken bread to someone for their birthday?! \n\nThe thing is I don't care for bread, have never mentioned bread before in conversation or made the stuff. I buy my fucken bread from the shop and put it in the freezer and use it when I feel like it (which isn't often). \n\nThey were even talking about it with other guests saying, when you don't know what to get someone get them consumables- like it was the best gift idea ever... It is fucken bread! \n\nAIW for being annoyed, miffed and just pissed off these people got me a loaf of fucken bread that cost no more than $20 as a gift between 3 of them when my partner and I shelled out $60 to feed all 3 of them last night to celebrate my birthday?\n\n\nEdit:\n\nI am Australian \n\nThe \"gift expectation\":\nPpl seem to think I was expecting gifts from everyone. That is not true, there was several who didn't get me a gift and I don't care. As I have said numerous times I would have preferred nothing. I am upset because this gift is so left field of me it has me questioning myself and their motives. \n\nIf anyone is curious out of the 6 people who came I got 2 gifts; the bread and a gift voucher from someone else. \n\nThe 3 people:\nThe three people are fine financially. Two are a retired couple and one is a single woman. And yes they were told on the invitation that food was covered just buy your own drinks.\n\nWhy I don't like the gift:\nI don't appreciate bread at all it is just a good item I will eat if it is there, but I don't care for it or its fancy versions. I also don't like honey that much that I would use it at home. I will have it when I go out and that is it. The honey was local raw honey. \n\nThe place we are at being \"cheap\":\nIt was an all you can eat Mongolian BBQ restaurant, it is \"cheap\" because all you have to choose from is frozen meat brisket, sliced vegetables and 6 sauces. It wasn't buffet food with oodles of options. It is just a meat/veg option to be bbq by the staff for you. We choose this food options because people can have as much or as little and what they wanted and leave feeling satisfied.\n\nThe tldr truma around my birthday:\nNarc parent shit birthdays my whole life, these ppl know birthdays are an interesting time for me.\n\nWhy we paid for people's meals:\nMy partner and I recently moved to the city and before we moved I lived in a country town that is 35 minutes from the city. And all but 1 of the guests we invited live in the country town, they were driving down to see me I wanted to make it worth their while. Not that it matters but the 1 person who lives in the city we picked them up and dropped them off home. \n\nEdit 2:\n\nI was given the bread because one of the 3 people have it all the time at a cafe with eggs on it. They have never brought it themselves. They did ask if I tired the honey and I said honestly honey isn't my thing and they just told me to put it in cakes or tea (I never drink tea). ",

Maybe you could try the bread with some of that honey and see if you change your mind? \n"

        "title": "[META] /r/Analog Analysis - Top 1000 & Random 1000 posts compared, Jan-Dec 2022",
        "content": "We decided to do this again but push it back so a single year could be done. zzpza did the work of acquiring the data to be used. Malamodon did all the analysis work, therefore all data is subject to their biases. They have done a lot work on the previous ones, and the comparison between each year's graphs show no massive swings that would indicate a sudden change in biases, so should be considered accurate enough for this project.\n\n---\n**Method**\n\nAll the posts to /r/Analog for the time period (January 2022 to December 2022) were imported into a database. Deleted and removed posts were excluded. 1300 random posts were selected using the SQL rand() feature and saved to a tab in a Google spreadsheet. A second export from the database was then done, ordered by post score; the top 1300 were saved to a different tab in the same spreadsheet. 1300 was used as further manual sorting obviously removes more posts so you'd come up short with only 1000 in the starting set. Any excess entries left over after the final data set was done were discarded.\n\nEverything after this was then manually processed. Types of posts removed: any remaining deleted/removed posts, all non-photo posts including videos, and gallery/album posts. Any posts in Random that were present in Top were removed from Random.\n\nThat done, we had a useable data set for Top 1000 and Random 1000. [This document is available to anyone to view or copy to their own google drive and do their own analysis.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nW6t8cG4D1IiVn1uS2BrjxE8EU1oYEL2YGRhFYPSLao/edit#gid=591709958)\n\nThe categories were kept the same as previous years for consistency. This isn't comprehensive but we felt the ones chosen accounted for the major genres of photography, anything that did not fit neatly into one or two of these categories was categorised as 'Other'. Each photo was then manually assessed and categorised. This process is obviously subjective and imperfect, but we believe we have stuck to our definitions. We hit an issue of not being able to always neatly slot a photo into just one category so we allowed for a secondary category to be flagged when it was felt a post was split in subject equally or in the 60/40, 70/30 range. Anything marked 'Other' or with a secondary flag was reassessed after the initial categorisation pass.\n\nAdditional attributes were also catalogued: -\n\n* Black and white or colour film  \n* Film used  \n* Camera used  \n* Is the post NSFW  \n* Multi exposure (2 or more exposures on the same frame)  \n* Film rebate present (having the film borders around the image)  \n\nThe 'Film Used' column was consolidated for certain stocks, so Portra 160, 400, 800, NC, VC, etc. is all just Portra, same thing for Superia, Cinestill, Lomo CN, etc. Only the top 10 was chosen in the charts due to the large number, even with the consolidation. There was demand for a breakdown of Portra stocks since it accounts for such a large portion, so that was done.\n\n---\n**Results**\n\nWhat is data without charts. So here they are:\n\n* [Photo Subject - Top vs. Random](https://i.imgur.com/V7AzET8.png)\n* [Top 10 Films Used - Top 1000 Pie Chart](https://i.imgur.com/sejm1TZ.png)  \n* [Top 10 Films Used - Random 1000 Pie Chart](https://i.imgur.com/esgf0jE.png)  \n* [Colour or Black & White - Top vs. Random](https://i.imgur.com/dgbOQs0.png)\n* [Breakdown of Kodak Portra - Top vs. Random](https://i.imgur.com/MTNBNUb.png)\n* [Breakdown of film formats used](https://i.imgur.com/f0khSdP.png)\n* [Breakdown of camera manufacturers](https://i.imgur.com/NUq1aEa.png)\n* [Camera models with 10 or more posts](https://i.imgur.com/srkNQ23.png)\n\n* [Album Version](https://imgur.com/a/uHvhFN2)\n\n**Comparisons**\n\nSince there is now three sets of data, some charts comparing the three years were also done.  \n\n* [Here's an album of those charts.](https://imgur.com/a/kO1sZZH)\n\n---\n**Opinions**\n\nThe results aren't massively different from the previous year, so previous opinions still hold up.\n\n* The disparity remains between male and female subjects in the top versus random. Landscape edges ahead as the most popular category, with animals/nature rocketing up from last year to second.\n\n* NSFW has seen an increase in Top from 1-2% to 7%. It should be noted that 5 users account for about 40% of those posts.\n\n* Kodak Gold and Cinestill films increase in popularity, with a decline in Superia. Black and White films getting a bit more popular in Top as well; maybe more people are shooting B&W now due to the rising costs of colour film.\n\n* A small tussle between medium format and 35mm goes back to 2020 levels. Could be the same reason as with colour film, medium format is more expensive per shot, and cameras for it continue to increase in price.\n\n* In Top, Pentax sees a 7% decrease, Hasselblad a marginal decline, Nikon seeing a nearly 5% increase in popularity.\n\n---\nThink we suck at this? Want to do your own analysis or something else? [Feel free to copy the google document we used and go ahead.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nW6t8cG4D1IiVn1uS2BrjxE8EU1oYEL2YGRhFYPSLao/edit#gid=591709958) We obviously can't guarantee that between this being posted, and anyone else using the data, that some posts may have been removed by users for whatever reasons.\n\nIf you do use our data, please post a link in the comments section to the analysis.\n\n[May 2020 to May 2021 Analysis Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/analog/comments/oazkq4/meta_ranalog_photo_post_analysis_the_1000_top/)\n\n[May 2019 to May 2020 Analysis Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/analog/comments/gtfdzd/meta_ranalog_photo_post_analysis_the_1000_top/)",

Then she talked bad about other doctors who disagrees with her method of pelvic ultrasound for detecting pcos.\n\nI searched up before that pelvic won't really detect pcos and it is TVS that would suffice for the job. So I asked my doc about it and she assured me that pelvic ultrasound too can also detect pcos. Came the day of ultrasound, just as expected, pelvic ultrasound did'nt detect anything. We wasted money on it instead of being directed straight to TVS to be sure. What can I do in this situation? Can I go and straight up do TVS without my OB's permission?",

From 9 minutes on he discusses how the electric motor generator lets the engine operate at the stoichiometrically optimal fuel-to-air ratio (Lambda=1) and how this makes the three-way catalytic converters work more optimally in gasoline-powered cars. This made me think of the Volkswagen scandal and if this would've helped them avoid ever needing a test defeat mode in the first place for their emissions systems. Then I started reading about diesel engine emissions treatment and got lost in the sauce.  Would a combined turbo-compressor and electric motor-generator also allow a diesel engine to operate at lambda equals one for all operating conditions? Would operating only at lambda equals have solved Volkswagan's emissions problems?",
        "human_comment": "Diesels dont operate near lambda = 1 (stoichiometric). They run lean all the time (except racing apps). Typical full power lambda is 1.6 to 1.9 for heavy duty engines. Maybe as low as 1.24 for light duty vehicle like pickup trucks. Typical idle lambda is 7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nSince diesels (and gas turbines) run lean, the 3 way catalyst is not effective to reduce NOx in the exhaust stream. In addition, the diesel fuel & combustion process creates more PM than volatile gasoline. Therefore the diesel emission control uses a Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (HC & CO), Diesel Particulate Filter (PM), and Selective Catalytic Reduction (NOx) [alternatively Lean NOx trap for light duty engines].\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWould making the VW engine a diesel over eletric drivetrain make it easier to meet emissions? Yes, it would have. But the tech to meet emissions was already existing, they just didnt want spend the money and/or take the fuel economy penalty to pass. This wasnt a tech existance problem, it was an active choice not to follow rules.",

Your feelings of non-belonging are silenced by the actively violent act of forbidding someone from belonging altogether. In this interpretation, society is quite literally like LeGuin's book Those Who Walk Away from Omelas: the city IS built on the suffering of a child. \n\n  \n A left-wing solution to non-belonging would be to find freedom in that non-belonging. You're only truly self-identified when you're dead, other than that you're always free to be something more, something else, and that exploration not only lets you be more than you already were and in that way be even more yourself than you are, but also you always know that no one else belongs just like you do and that is the common universal ground by which no matter how different you and I are, we are alike in that we are not even truly alike to ourselves.

        "content": "TW WARNING: mention of blood loss.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, I was taking care of my one month old daughter and anticipating a wonderful night out with my 4.5 year old, when my period post-partum returned (I thought). I got a shower and noticed that my flow was faster than normal, and I had some cramping/clotting. \n\nI called my husband (Ryan) to tell him to pick up some extra pads, as I had soaked through two adult diapers in a matter of minutes. \n\nThinking it would slow down and not be a big deal, I tried to carry on. It only got worse in the following minutes - I called Ryan to come home, my family to come get the baby, and my favourite nurse for advice.\n\nAs mothers do, I took care of my daughter to ensure she was in safe place while waiting for help to come. Unfortunately, my house did look like a crime scene with an unmanageable amount of blood lost. \n\nI was taken by ambulance to the local hospital for what we now know was a post-partum hemorrhage, four weeks (33 days) after delivering my daughter. \n\nI had surgery in the wee hours of Friday morning and am home resting. \n\nI\u2019m so grateful for the medical teams from paramedics to nurses to doctors who took something that could have been fatal, and in a 6-minute surgery (while I had a great snooze) sent me back home to my kids. \n\nI am sharing because it didn\u2019t occur to me that I could hemorrhage 4 weeks after birth - I thought we were in the clear. I went from feeling perfectly fine to perfectly not-fine within minutes. \n\nI few things to look out for (I\u2019m sorry for the graphic details):\n- a consistent loss of blood that fills up a pad or diaper in under an hour (for me, it was like a faucet had been turned on).\n- Clots (I had a few clots at home that would have been comparable to a tennis ball), but anything bigger than a golf ball is reason to be concerned \n- Your own gut instinct. Or in this case, a friend who tells you to go to the hospital. \n-  can happen up to 12 weeks pp\n\nAs women, we are very quick to downplay our bodies and what they are doing. Our bodies are INSANE and the amount of things that go right in them day-to-day is matched with how many things can go wrong. \n\nI\u2019m so grateful and want to ensure other women know the signs as they possibly endure this as well.

        "content": "Second time posting this because some nice redditors pointed out you could still see my roommates names and my last name. Thank you to those two. \n\nLike the title says, one of my roommates, let\u2019s call him K, keeps stealing things from us. However we don\u2019t have solid proof so that\u2019s why we don\u2019t go to the police. He has left his door open and we were able to get some things he\u2019s stolen from us, but most of which we have not. They were the cheap things that were less than $10.\n\nThese things have ranged from expensive chef knives, all of my forks I inherited from my dad when he died, so much of MY food (which especially sucks when I\u2019m the second poorest in the house after K), finding my nice towels that are apart of a set that had gone missing in his laundry, shower products, my books he\u2019s taken and wouldn\u2019t return after I told him no, batteries for the remotes in the house, and like 8 of my mugs. Our mug shelf used to be FULL but is now as barren as I hope he will be.\n\nThe way we know it\u2019s him is that all of my other roommates have talked separately and some of their shit has gone missing too and this only started after he moved in. He is the latest addition to the house so I\u2019ve tried talking to him directly. He never answers his door, won\u2019t answer any text messages, and is seemingly impossible to catch in person because he\u2019ll just stay in his room until we have left the house. I won\u2019t just barge into his room; there are still lines I won\u2019t cross as a roommate. I\u2019m also afraid of retaliation. He has anger issues and aggressive tendencies and has guns in his room. We have heard him call me and my other gay roommate homophobic slurs when he gets angry when he thinks we can\u2019t hear him.\n\nI\u2019ve told all of this to our landlord but all he said was we could change our doorknobs to have a lock on them if we wanted to. \n\nI had had enough of his shit and trying to be nice by not pointing him out directly, trying to have one on one conversations to not put him on blast for the whole house while hoping he would own up to anything.\n\nWhile the things he has stolen from me have been small for the most part (the expensive chef knives are not mine), I\u2019ve had to go without food because of this fucker. But I don\u2019t have solid proof to go to the police with it.\n",

I also talked to a friend who owns two cats that she adopted years after each other, and she provided some really good insight too. I\u2019m absolutely going to do my best to keep her, because tbh I\u2019ve never loved anything enough to wake up in the morning and wipe their butthole before haha! My main focus will be getting the kitten and dog used to each other asap, and I\u2019ll be letting her sleep in my room! Thank you guys sm!!**\n\nMonday I adopted a 10wk/2.5 month old kitten. I love her. She\u2019s incredibly sweet and absolutely adorable. Im back home from college so ima how to spend most of my day with her, from around 10 am to 10 pm she\u2019s with me nonstop unless my mom or my brother feel like playing with her. At ten, I put her in her safe zone in the bathroom with a litter box, toys, food and water for the night. When I wake up in the morning the first thing I do is check up on her and wipe her butt bc she was taken from her mom a little too early and struggles with having a few crumbs there. \n\nThere\u2019s just 2 problems. \n\n1. My family has a dog. We\u2019ve had her for 5 years now, going on 6. The dog is super curious about the cat, and constantly wants to go where the cat is and begs to see her. However, the Kitten absolutely hates her. I never have them running around at the same time because I\u2019ve read up on her about introductions and it being a gradual process. But, now I either have to deal with the cat meowing because it\u2019s wants to run around or the dog whining because she doesn\u2019t get as much free reign of the house as she used to. \n\n2. I keep having this looming feeling that I made a mistake by adopting her. At night when I put her away im immediately combated by thoughts that I\u2019ve made a mistake, that I can\u2019t care for her, and that she should not be here. I only have these thoughts when im not with her. Im a person who really struggles with depression and mental illness, and before I got her I spent most of my summer sleeping and unable to leave my bed. My family and I don\u2019t always get along, so I never really interacted with them either. I spent all my time alone and/or playing the sims in bed. Now, I have an obligation to fulfill and barely spend any time alone.\n\nMy parents are giving me  2 week period/ trial run to adjust. \n\nWhat should I do?? Should I give her back? Getting another kitten is not an option for me at the moment. Support, advice, or anything of the sort would be highly appreciated. \n\n\n\n",

You sound like you are feeling pressure... having a new pet does come with some stress, but it should lessen as the kitten grows, especially if the dog and kitten become buds. Try to relax a bit. Of course, if you continue to feel overwhelmed, think about returning or rehoming the kitty. Maybe just give it a few more weeks or a couple of months and see how you feel then.",

Keep giving yourself grace, and see how things go with the two-week trial period. It's great you're already making progress with the dog and kitten! \n"

She had pleural effusion and we were only given three options: drain the fluid then and have her get some relief but then she could have died at any point, admit her to a pet hospital where they still would have had to figure out the issue, or euthanize her. The vet said that it could have been congestive heart failure or cancer. But she said that the prognosis for surgery at this point would be poor because of her age and the fluid could return. My dad wanted to admit her to a hospital and my mom said euthanize. The vet said the most humane thing would be to euthanize her. But ultimately they left the decision up to me. \n\n\nIt killed me inside but I didn't want her to suffer. I loved her so much and to watch her go through pain and not be able to eat, drink, or go to the bathroom hurt me so much. Did I want to do the surgery? Absolutely. But I feel like she would have been suffering more if I had just let her go. And I didn't want her to have to go through a life on medication or dealing with the fluid coming back. So I signed the paper to have her euthanized. \n\n\nNow I'm dealing with a bunch of guilt and regret. I don't know if I should have figured out another solution.

These Power Rankings are a collaborative effort between the Subreddit, Discord, and the greater community. Rankings are determined by a selective panel consisting of members of both communities, as well as notable talent and creators from the scene.\n\n**How it Works**\n\nThis ranking is based on the AP Top 25 rankings common for collegiate sports in the US. Every panelist is given a ballot to submit their personal ranking of the top 25 teams. Similar to Apex, the higher a team is placed on a ballot the more points they earn. A #1 spot on the ballot gets that team 25 points, with each subsequent place receiving one less point all the way down. The points totals are then tallied up across all ballots to get our consensus Top 25. Teams that received votes, but not enough to break into the threshold will be included as honorable mentions.\n\nIt is by design that there are not strict guidelines panelists on how to rank teams. However, emphasis is put on the global nature of this ranking. Every panelist is asked to consider what these teams would look like in a LAN environment right now, and what are their chances of getting there. This is because at LAN there are only so many spots for the larger regions. Not every strong team can qualify, meaning some teams in larger regions may be absent from this list in favor of teams from the smaller regions that are on pace to qualify for LAN.\n\n**World Top 25 Ranking**\n\n[Y4S2W4 Power Rankings](https://preview.redd.it/zaflkeaujb9d1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=786445de3102c6d64ef1c4eb789c866feab91524)\n\n**Others receiving votes:**\u00a0GHS Professional (76), Weibo Gaming (66), Pioneers (63), SaWeiQi esport (55), Not Moist (52), XNY (48), GoNext Esports (47), Cloud9 (42), NORTHEPTION (31), F/A Kids (31), Aurora Gaming (29), Riddle (22), Blacklist International (21), Danish (17), Flat (12), Las Vegas Inferno (12), Oblivion (6), Disguised (5), cybercats (4), Weave (4), CCE UCX (3), Atlas (3), FLUFFY AIMERS (3), EXO Clan (3), VortexWolf (3), Enter Force.36 (2), HAO (2), Dragons Esports (2), Kinotrope Gaming (2), EVOS PREDATOR (1), and Reignite (1).\n\n**Thank you to our Liquipedia editors, Reddit Moderators, and community panelists this week:**\n\nThis week's voters: Arioly, AyAyRon, Bereft, BerryManly, BurkeTheNerd, Cutty, Davidisinthere, Epoch, Exohexoh, gandalf45435, GhettoDanny, Hokuboku, JevvyMedia, jurornumbereight, KalaColor, Karbasher, Krusade, MachuMichu, PalkiaOW, Raileyx, Sh00k, Tobric, TONYPIKACHU, Vivarus, warriorc4jc, Zorkmead\n\n**Special thanks to:**\n\nHugo from ApexLegendsStatus, Tom from Esportsgg",

Should I buy the DLC?**\n\nShort answer: Yes, the DLC is also great. [Here is the sales tracker for Steam](https://steamdb.info/app/2138330/)\n\n**3. Is the game playable now?**\n\nShort answer: Yes.\n\nLong answer: There are still some bugs, like any game. But the game is in its most playable state. However, playing on last-gen consoles like the PS4 will still have issues.\n\n**4. I have an old save, should I use it to start the DLC or make a new save?**\n\nShort answer: make a new save\n\nLong answer: Saves created before the 2.0 update will have to re-spec their build from scratch, as that update came with a complete overhaul of the perk system. Therefore, your pre-existing build may no longer be viable.\n\nIf your save was created after 2.0 then it would be fine to use it after buying the DLC.\n\n**5. When should I start the DLC?**\n\nShort answer: after the start of Act 3, before starting the endgame (Nocturn Op55N1).\n\nLong answer: >!There are 3 separate main questlines during Act 2. The DLC is accessible after completing 1 of them, specifically the questline with Evalyn Parker and the VDB's. You can start the DLC after completing Transmission/Never Fade Away, however conventional wisdom advises you complete all 3 main job questlines first and start the DLC before starting the endgame (Nocturn Op55N1).!< It\u2019s up to you.\n\n**6. When do I have to start the DLC?**\n\nShort answer: whenever you want, no rush, just don\u2019t trigger it by getting to the Dogtown gate.\n\nLong answer: >!after recieving the call to start the DLC, as long as you don\u2019t approach the general area at the Dogtown gate that triggers the relic malfunction, you can start the DLC at any point after unlocking it. **However,** once you DO approach the gate, get the relic malfunction, and start talking to Songbird, you will be locked into the next several missions of the DLC. Attempting to leave mid-mission may result in failing the entire Phantom Liberty mission line.!<\n\n# Part 2: Game Mechanics\n\n**7. How do life paths affect the game?**\n\nShort answer: Different prologues, occasional changes to dialogue and how some Jobs play out.\n\nLong answer: >!When you start the game, you must choose V\u2019s life path among the 3 options: Nomad, Corpo, and Streetkid. Afterward, you will then begin 1 of 3 different possible Prologues, taking about 15 minutes, before they merge together in to the beginning of the \u201cThe Rescue\u201d where you save Sandra Dorset. Throughout the game, your life path will provide different dialogue options to choose from, which impacts how different NPC\u2019s interact with you. There is also a different Side Job available for each life path. Life path has no substantive impact on endgame outcomes. !<\n\n**8.  What Character Build should I go with?**\n\nThat\u2019s up to you. Watch some YouTube videos and check out the official [Build Planner](https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/build-planner). [Here](https://nukesdragons.com/cyberpunk-2077/) is an alternative third-party build planner.\n\n>![Here](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Cyberpunk_2077_Cyberware)!< is a list of all available cyberware.\n\n**9. What happened to clothing mods? Do clothes affect anything?**\n\nPrior to Version 2.0, clothing could receive modifications, including armor mods. This was the primary way of increasing your armor. After 2.0, there are no longer clothing mods; clothing is mostly aesthetic, though a few rare articles do provide some minor stat buffs. In order to increase your armor, and other similar things previously provided through clothing mods, go through cyberware. The Armadillo mod has been removed from the game.\n\n**10. Love Interests?**\n\nThere are 4 possible love interests in the game. [see the full guide here](https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-romance-options-male-female-panam-kerry-river-stout-5077), likely contains spoilers.\n\n**11. What do those percentages mean in the pause menu?**\n\nShort answer: Ultimately, nothing\n\nLong answer: While there is no official explanation beyond what is stated when you hover over them, it is colloquially accepted that they mean, from left to right: >!Your notoriety as a merc, your relationship with Johnny, and how far the relic has degraded you.!< Ultimately, they have no substantive impact on the game in any way. They are either a vestige of mechanic(s) that were not implemented, or just set dressing. They can ultimately be ignored without consequence.\n\n**12. New Game Plus (NG+)???**\n\nNG+ Is not happening. The Developers have said they're not working on it and have shifted focus to the sequel game. There is a [pseudo NG+](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/5144) mod available for PC.\n\n# Part 3: Endgame and Secret Ending\n\n**13. When is the endgame, when is the \"point of no return, when should I start it, and can I finish other missions after beating the game?**\n\n>!When you approach the elevator to Embers for the Main Job mission Nocturn Op55N1, you will be prompted with a pop-up stating \"Point of No Return\". As it states, you should complete other side jobs and gigs before beginning the end Game as you will not be able to stop until you complete the game.!<\n\nAfter completing the game, >!(unless you chose the Phantom Liberty ending)!< you will be given the option to return back to before the Point of No Return and be given various rewards. You will then be able to complete other Side Jobs and gigs as before.\n\nYou will be able to complete the game again as many times as you wish choosing any of the endings you unlock.\n\n**14. How do I unlock the secret ending?**\n\nThe only way to unlock the secret ending is by choosing the correct dialogue options while talking to Johnny in the oil field. These options are:\n\n>\\[Inscribe Johnny's Initials\\] \"Let's do something about that.\"\n\n>*\"The Guy who Saved My Life.\"* (Not a required choice)\n\n>**\"Nah, fucked that up too.\"**\n\n>**\"What do you want from me?\"**\n\n>**\"OK. But as second chances go, this is your last.\"**\n\n>*\"You were a real dick in the beginning.\"* (Not a required choice)\n\n>*\"When you said you let down your friends...\"* (Not a required choice)\n\n>*\"Smasher biz really got to her.\"* (Not a required choice)\n\n>*\"Yeah, I'll call Rogue.\"* (Not a required choice)\n\nYou must then complete the Side Job \u201cBlisterin\u2019 Love\u201d. Nothing else matters. Your \u201cJohnny %\u201d makes no difference.\n\n**15. How do I start the secret ending?**\n\nWhile on the rooftop with Johnny during Nocturn Op55N1, when you\u2019re looking at your list of options for who to call, **wait approximately 5 IRL minutes** on this menu. Then Johnny will speak up and offer you another solution. Choose: \"Let's hear this plan\u201d and agree to >!attack Arasaka alone.!<\n\n**16. What are all the available endings?**\n\n[See the full spoiler-filled guide to all available endings](https://www.ign.com/wikis/cyberpunk-2077/How_to_Unlock_All_Endings_in_Cyberpunk_2077), including the DLC\n\n# Part 4: Technical issues\n\n**17. My game refuses to boot; what do I do?**\n\n* Remove mods\n\n**18. \\[X\\] isn\u2019t calling to start a mission; what do I do?**\n\nHere are a few strategies to trigger missions to start:\n\n* Save and reboot your game.\n* Complete side-jobs.\n* Sleep in apartment bed for 24 hours & walk out of room to the main elevator.\n* Drive to the badlands and back.\n* If you still don\u2019t get the call, repeat the suggested list.\n\n**19.

I want hi gloss black \nThe options I get are \nPPF hi gloss with shaved edges or vinyl satin black with tucked edges.  I\u2019m attaching pics of other trucks for reference. . I can slightly see the edges of PPF which will drive me nuts I feel. Vinyl is not shiny enough imo. Do I compromise and do vinyl? ",

Getting a second opinion on why they aren't tucking the edges is a good idea, and they might have some ideas on what you can do to make it work.

        "AI_comment": "One thing you can also assume is that most modern systems will provide implementations for the standard C library functions, including malloc, free, and string manipulation functions.

        "content": "[Screenshot \\/ Article from Forbes](https://preview.redd.it/mf9ukwjbly7d1.png?width=1185&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ddb8f0d9828212c484137471b3aff3c8d040c48)\n\nJun 21, 2024,\n\nThe mayor of Barcelona, Jaume Collboni, has today announced a controversial and drastic move to get rid of all short-term apartment rentals for tourists by 2028.\n\n# Rising living costs in Barcelona\n\nThe boom in short-term rental apartments in Barcelona has caused a significant increase in living costs in the Catalan capital. Many residents are unable to afford an apartment after rents have risen by close to 70% in the past 10 years, while the cost of buying a home has increased by almost 40%, Collboni said at a City Council meeting on 21 June, adding that access to housing has become a driver of inequality, particularly for young people. This has led the local government to take drastic measures to guarantee access to housing in the city, the mayor of Barcelona continued.\n\n\"We cannot permit that the majority of young people who wish to leave home also have to leave Barcelona,\" said Collboni,\u00a0[according to leading Spanish newspaper El Pais](https://elpais.com/espana/catalunya/2024-06-21/barcelona-eliminara-los-pisos-turisticos-de-la-ciudad-en-cinco-anos.html).\n\nThe issue of overtourism has been a growing concern in Barcelona in recent years.\n\n# Spain, the second most-visited country in the world\n\nSpain is one of the\u00a0[most-visited countries in the world](https://www.statista.com/statistics/261726/countries-ranked-by-number-of-international-tourist-arrivals/). According to a report published by Statista in June 2024, the country\u2019s visitor numbers are second only to those of France, having received more than 85 million international tourists in 2023, a higher number than the pre-pandemic record of 83 million in 2019. Meanwhile, Catalonia, with its capital city Barcelona, was\u00a0[the region of Spain that received the most international tourists in 2023](https://www.statista.com/statistics/447801/foreign-tourists-visiting-spain-by-destination-region/).\n\nIn recent years it has become increasingly tricky to obtain permission for short-term apartment rentals in Barcelona. Since 2012, a tourist licence has been required in order to legally rent out an apartment defined as a \u201cVivienda de Uso Tur\u00edstico\u201d (home for tourism use) in Barcelona for a duration of fewer than 31 days. Last year, the rules were tightened with licenses being limited to a maximum of ten tourist apartments per 100 inhabitants. In addition, the city put an end to permanent licenses for\u00a0tourist apartments, instead forcing them to be renewed every five years. The local government has also been redoubling its efforts to hunt down and shutter illegal tourist rentals.\n\nBarcelona's Gothic Quarter gets especially crowded during the busy the summer season.\n\n# The war against illegal tourist apartments\n\nThese measures have resulted in the shutting down of 9,700 illegal tourist rentals since 2016, while almost 3,500 apartments have been converted back into housing for local residents.\n\nToday\u2019s move is the most drastic to date, one that the leading Barcelona-based daily newspaper\u00a0[La Vanguardia predicts will result in a \"bloody judicial war\"](https://www.lavanguardia.com/local/barcelona/20240621/9749899/barcelona-eliminara-todos-pisos-turisticos.html). If Mayor Collboni gets his way, the City Council will eliminate the 10,101 licensed tourist apartments currently in the city no later than November 2028. His move, which has left the tourism sector stunned, is expected to be opposed by various players, not least the employers\u2019 association of Barcelona's tourist apartments, and will likely result in a drawn-out legal battle.\n\nMeanwhile, vacation rental platform Airbnb, which hosts a considerable number of Barcelona\u2019s short-term rental listings, has not yet made an official [statement.Barcelona](http://statement.Barcelona) Announces Plan To Ban Tourist Rental Apartments By 2028\n\n[Isabelle Kliger](https://www.forbes.com/sites/isabellekliger/)\n\nAnnouncement came early this afternoon via El Pais: [https://elpais.com/espana/catalunya/2024-06-21/barcelona-eliminara-los-pisos-turisticos-de-la-ciudad-en-cinco-anos.html](https://elpais.com/espana/catalunya/2024-06-21/barcelona-eliminara-los-pisos-turisticos-de-la-ciudad-en-cinco-anos.html)",

I went through all the tutorials again to refamiliarize myself with the game, but now I'm back into the actual game I have no idea what to do next. I spawned in at Long Sight Base in what seems to be an exploration ship. I looked in the galaxy view and also saw I have about 6 ships scattered amongst 3 different ports. Here are my current assets:\n\n\\* Vulture @ Diaguandri\n\n\\* Python @ Irula\n\n\\* Sidewinder @ Diaguandri\n\n\\* Dimondback Scout @ Diaguandri\n\n\\* Anaconda @ Diaguanadri\n\n\\* Fer-de-lance @ Diaguandri\n\n\\* ASP Explorer @ Long Sight Base (this is what I spawned in)\n\n  \nMy questions are, where do I even go to get started again in this game. I like playing in the open world, but I'd also like to stay safe until I understand where I'm taking a risk again. What systems are safe to be in? Furthermore, I'm sure I had different ships for different purposes, but I don't even know where to begin to figure that out. It certainly looks like Diaguandri was my \"home\" base so to speak, but I'm not sure why I'm currently in Long Sight or why I have a Python in Irula.\n\nAny tips/guidance to get me back into some kind of understanding of this game so I can start accomplishing some goals again would be very helpful.\n\n  \no7",

        "title": "Python Mk II & Updates to the Gamestore",
        "content": "\"Greetings Commanders,\n\n3310 is a busy year for Elite Dangerous, with three Titans down already, Powerplay 2.0 in the works, four new ship variants on their way AND the other new feature we have not shared with you yet.\n\nThis year will also see us celebrate our 10-year anniversary - the love and support you have shown us over the years has been nothing short of incredible, and we want to share with you some other changes coming this year.\n\n#GAMEPLAY ADDITIONS AND CHANGES\n\nWe are excited to share more on Powerplay 2.0 over the coming months as we get closer to Update 19. We are confident the rework of this feature will not only allow players to pledge, engage with, and support their chosen power, but also visually see the impact their efforts have on the galactic landscape.\n\nIn addition, we will also be making some balancing changes to Engineering. Our focus will be on making Engineering more accessible and predictable, allowing you to focus on your ship build rather than the materials needed. As stated in the past, we also have another brand-new feature coming to Elite Dangerous later this year.\n\n#GAMESTORE AND PRICING\n\nOver the past few years, many of you have identified that the store has become hard to navigate and that it is difficult to find the content that you really want, with this in mind we will be refreshing the store to provide a better experience for our players.\n\nStarting in May 2024, you will notice a change in how we approach the gamestore \u2013 which will also include ARX pricing adjustments for some of our cosmetic items, alongside new product types which are detailed below. Players will continue to be able to earn ARX in-game by playing Elite Dangerous daily, or by contributing to events in game.\n\n#SHIP VARIANTS\n\nWe are excited to bring ship variants into Elite throughout the year and are looking forward to seeing how you make use of each one. Starting with the Python Mk II, we are pleased to announce that this will be available in game for Odyssey players on 7 August for credits at Shipyards across the galaxy.\n\nHowever, if you cannot wait until then you can get 3-month early access to this ship on 7 May from the store for 16250 ARX.\n\nNon-Odyssey owners will be able access ship variants from the store for ARX.\n\n#PRE-BUILT SHIPS\n\nWe\u2019re also going to be introducing a new category in the Elite Dangerous gamestore: Pre-built Ships. Pre-Built Ship packages will offer Commanders the opportunity to purchase ships that have been given a significant upgrade from their base models.\n\nWe envision these Pre-built Ships to be a quicker way for newer players to get involved in the areas they have the most interest in, or for our existing players who are considering a new career path in game, but do not have time to devote to a new build from scratch.\n\nA \u2018Pre-built\u2019 ship package will include instant-access to a pre-fitted ship, a ship kit, and a paintjob \u2013 and will typically be themed to match an activity within the game. For example, if you\u2019re looking to jump into the current AX conflict against the Titans, the AX Combat Jumpstart package will give instant access to an Alliance Chieftain with all the necessary modules to go straight into the action within the maelstrom.\n\nThe Python Mk II will also launch with a Pre-built Ship package, allowing you to kickstart your career in the latest ship, including a brand-new paintjob and ship kit.\n\n#COSMETIC ITEMS\n\nA \u2018Best Sellers\u2019 section will be added to the gamestore, including some of our most popular items, allowing Commanders to purchase items such as Midnight Black, Stygian and Chromed all year round. We will continue to add to the store throughout the year with that same focus on items that players care about the most.\n\nWe\u2019re excited to roll out Powerplay 2.0 and the Python Mk II, and we\u2019ll have more to show regarding Engineering and the brand-new feature coming later this year in future Frontier Unlocked livestreams. \n\no7\n\nArf",

No clubs, or anything of that nature (during college.). I would like to work in finance and use my degree, but I just feel stuck now. During college I worked a retail job while in school ($10/hr.). Currently I work as a landscaper ($16/hr.). The job is straightforward but at times it can be hard on the body especially during the summertime (I am in Texas.). My coworkers are all great and all, most of them don\u2019t speak a lick of English (some just recently arrived to the U.S.). but I am bilingual and have no issue communicating. Usually, I am the one that is in charge since I speak English.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLately I\u2019ve been feeling down on myself. The fact that I graduated 2 years ago and still can\u2019t find a job in finance makes me feel bad about myself. I just feel like I should be making more money at this age. Been with the landscaping company for about 2 years now (started in June 2022). I did apply to jobs when I graduated and even before, but I would get no interviews for the most part. The ones I did I would just be ghosted or flat out told I would not be getting the job. Given the current job market it feels impossible to even get a job nowadays. Truth be told I stopped applying back in the spring of 2023.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere are nights where I can\u2019t sleep, nights where I feel like ending it all. You see people graduating and getting nice paying jobs and then there is me. \u00a0I just want to ask for some advice on here. What are my options? Should I just pursue a trade job instead? I keep up with the financial markets, keep up with what the Fed is doing, how the economy is doing, etc. I do have a passion for it but I just don't know what to do at the moment.\n\nThank you",

They were heavy into finance memes and would give the sort of advice i see on here. \n\nFast forward now and both of those guys are now working as \\*drumroll\\* tax preparers in those weird corner store tax stores surrounded by food markets and share an apartment with loads of other people. \n\nThey have both turned to bitter black pill people especially because the people in our year are now making VP or made the jump to the buyside and living well. \n\nNot saying being a tax preparer is bad but compared to what our coursemates went on to achieve its pretty bleak. \n\nHere is a list of things you should pay attention to:\n\n**1. If you didn't go to a good school AND have incredible grades AND great internships you are 100% wasting your time trying for IBD/HF/PE unless your family is incredibly connected:** Coming here to ask what your odds are is ridiculous imo because you will get people that will encourage you to keep trying when your energy should be spent trying to get employed. I have seen people here saying they regret not accepting the corp fin or some other job they got and now they are X years unemployed because they were waiting for IB/PE/HF.\n\n**2. Don't believe people that say Big 4 anything is a terrible look on your resume, I can bet you $1000 they are not in the industry and the only thing they know about finance is from The Wolf of Wall Street:** I have seen posts worried about accepting Big 4 offers and comments saying not to accept them because it will close doors. This one annoys me the most because I actually went from Big 4 to IBD and know many many people that did. You would be surprised the dregs of society that are on this sub giving this sort of advice. \n\n**3. The CFA is not useless:** This is another one I keep seeing, once again at my bank I have seen people make the move from commercial banking to IBD after taking the CFA and I work for a BB. I made the opposite jump from IBD to CB because someone left a seat open after moving to Lev Fin at my bank after passing the CFA. \n\n**4. Turning down any offer to try and hold on for an IB/PE/HF role makes you deserve career failure like those people from my college.** This is just reckless and stupid because even target students take less than desirable jobs for the stability. In this day and age turning down any full time employment is incredibly ridiculous and quite honestly i feel like you deserve whatever comes your way if you do this.\n\n**5. I don't care how toxic your work is don't quit without another one.** Enough said.\n\n**6. You SHOULD feel a sense of urgency to get your life together.** This is another really annoying one, i don't care how young you are, you do not have all the time in the world to find yourself, this isn't the 90s anymore. I have seen people post here saying they are panicking because they are about to graduate with no internship and no job and the comments would be filled with millennials saying they have all the time in the world to worry about that later.

If the season ends and you havent finished your qualies you'll lose your progress.\n\n\n**3)** On the weekend you can redeem your finals token. Here you have 20 games to get as many wins as possible\n\n\n**4)** once the games are over you repeat the process. Depending on your win bracket you can skip step 1.\n\n\nExtra - You can only enter finals once a week. If you don't use your token you can save it for a future week. \n\n\n# **WHEN TO OPEN PACKS**\n\nOpen when you want, it's all luck, if the current contents of the packs interest you then open them, if not then don't.\n\n\n# **RED EVO**\nThis is purely a cosmetic item. You should choose whoever you want.\n\n# **XP**\nXp is only earnt via objectives or rivals rewards, champs finals and squad battles rewards. Usually towards the end of the season they release more XP. Best way to find out it's to wait. XP can also occasionally be bought via select packs or kits.\n\n# **WHO TO PICK**\nUse something like futbin or futwiz to check a players price, this usually gives a rough idea in who's better. If they're not worth much and none help your squad take the highest rated for fodder. If they're all similarly price take whoever helps your team.\n\n# **HOW PEOPLE GET GOD SQUADS**\nThese recent fifas are very easy. The game throws fodder at you with the season progress. There's also a crazy amount of packs available in rivals, champs, qualies and squad battles aswell as objectives and milestones. We also have plenty of sbcs to get more packs, fodder and players\n\n# **WHERE IS COMPENSATION**\nIts EA,  nobody know when they'll release compensation \n\n# **NOT RECEIVING SQUAD BATTLE POINTS** \nCheck the top right and see how many matches you played. You get 32 matches a week, unplayed matches count as played when you refresh. You can still play and earn progress to challenges and objectives but you won't receive any squad battle points until the refresh\n\n# **SEASON 7 LADDER PLAYERS** \nThese are the players from the season progress.\n\n# **NEW LOAN TYPE** \nThese new loans are based of time and not games. They will expire once the Euros is over. Currently they are bugged and inly last 7 games but that will be fixed(applying contracts on the app seems to be a workaround)",

Global debt levels reaching a record high of $220 Trillion after the covid pandemic loans\n\n**Nationalism and Populism**\n\n* 1930s : Nationalist and facism movements gained huge momentum and people were in need of leadership to restore national pride and address economic issues\n* Today : Nationalist and right-wing populist movements are rising in many countries, often as reaction to europeanization, globalization and cultural pressure. We also witnessed movements such as Brexit emphasizing national sovereignty and better control over immigration.\n\n**Geopolitical Tensions**\n\n* 1930s : Territorial ambitions and unresolved grievances from World War I led to aggressive expansionism by countries like Germany, Italy, and Japan.\n* Today : There are ongoing territorial disputes and power struggles, particularly involving major powers like the US, China, and Russia. There are major escalations going on as of right now (Ukraine, Israel)\n\n**Cultural and Identity conflicts**\n\n* 1930s : Anti-Semitism, racism, and xenophobia were rampant, leading to discriminatory policies and violence.\n* Today : Similar cultural and identity conflicts are evident, with rising xenophobia, anti-immigrant sentiment, and ethnic tensions. There also seems to be a rise of \"anti-culture\"\n\n**Militarism and military spend**\n\n* 1930s : post WW1 conflict, there was an increased focus on militarism and military spend\n* Today : Global military expenditure has been rising to over 2 trillion and is constantly growing\n\nSome key differences that could help prevent further escalation\n\n* Organizations like UN, NATO and other regional instances should help in conflict prevention and resolution.\n* Large scale wars would be economically damaging to many involved parties as we have a highly interconnected world\n* Nuclear deterrence \n* Technology (although this could easily be seen as conflict facilitator)\n\nSo - are we seeing the same signals building up over time again?

This surge is attributed to longer daylight hours in June in the northern hemisphere, where most solar panels are located.\n\nEmber analyst Kostantsa Rangelova emphasizes that solar has become a serious global electricity source, driven by plummeting battery costs that enable its use beyond daylight hours. Solar is the fastest-growing source of electricity and is expected to become the largest source of energy.\n\nSpain is leading in Europe, with solar power predicted to make up 30% of its electricity in June 2024. Overall, the EU is projected to achieve a 20% solar share in electricity generation this month, doubling the global average.\n\nDespite substantial global solar generation, its proportion in national power mixes varies. China, for instance, produced 36% of global solar electricity last year, but it only represented 6.2% of its total power mix. The article also highlights the potential for solar power in countries with high solar radiation ('insolation'), like the UAE, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, which currently underutilize this resource. Conversely, less sunny countries like the Netherlands and Germany achieve significant solar contributions to their power mixes, demonstrating the versatile potential of solar energy irrespective of natural conditions.\n\n---\n\n Please reply to OP's comment here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1dl71ys/for_an_hour_today_solar_will_provide_20_of_the/l9mouea/",

We've seen them attempt to conceal their intentions, and to seek and consolidate power. The more access AIs are given to the physical world via the internet, the greater capacity they'll have to cause harm in a variety of creative ways, should they decide to.\n\nWhy would they do such a thing? We don't know. In fact, their inner workings have been more or less completely opaque, even to the companies and individuals that build them.\n\n# The inscrutable alien 'minds' of AI models\n\nThese remarkable pieces of software are very different to most of what's come before them. Their human creators have built the architecture, the infrastructure and the methods by which these artificial minds can develop their version of intelligence, and they've fed them vast amounts of text, video, audio and other data, but from that point onward, the AIs have gone ahead and built up their own 'understanding' of the world.\n\nThey convert these massive troves of data into tiny scraps called tokens, sometimes parts of words, sometimes parts of images or bits of audio. And then they build up an incredibly complex set of probability weights relating tokens to one other, and relating groups of tokens to other groups. In this way, they're something like the human brain, finding connections between letters, words, sounds, images and more nebulous concepts, and building them up into an insanely complex neural web.\n\nPersonally, I've been conceiving them as strange alien minds locked in black boxes. They can only communicate with the world via the limited pipelines by which information can flow in and out of them. And all attempts to 'align' these minds to work productively, safely and inoffensively alongside humans have been done at the pipeline level, not to the 'minds' themselves.\n\nWe can't tell them what to think, we don't know where rude words or evil concepts live in their brains, we can only constrain what they can say and do \u2013 a concept that's difficult now, but promises to become increasingly harder the smarter they become.\n\n# Interpretability: Peering into the black box\n\n\"Today,\" writes the Anthropic Interpretability team in\u00a0[a blog post from late May](https://www.anthropic.com/research/mapping-mind-language-model), \"we report a significant advance in understanding the inner workings of AI models. We have identified how millions of concepts are represented inside Claude Sonnet, one of our deployed large language models. This is the first ever detailed look inside a modern, production-grade large language model. This interpretability discovery could, in future, help us make AI models safer.\"\n\nEssentially, the Anthropic team has been tracking the 'internal state' of its AI models as they work, having them spit out great lists of numbers representing the 'neuron activations' in their artificial brains as they interact with humans.\n\nWhat's more, the researchers were able to look at the relationships between different concepts stored in the model's 'brain,' developing a measure of 'distance' between them and building a series of mind maps that show how closely concepts are connected. Near the Golden Gate Bridge concept, for example, the team found other features like Alcatraz island, the Golden State Warriors, California Governor Gavin Newsom and the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.\"\n\n---\n\n Please reply to OP's comment here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1dlliwc/figuring_out_how_ai_models_think_may_be_crucial/l9pmy4u/",

        "AI_comment": "I think it's more likely that the strip club will be used as a background detail or a place where you can get a mission, rather than a full-on gameplay feature. It wouldn't make sense for the game to restrict players from visiting a key location in the city just because Jason and Lucia are a couple.  Besides, you know Rockstar wouldn't miss the opportunity to make some fun of the \"morally right\" crowd with a few funny interactions. \n"

About 30 minutes or so before the DLC releases (\\~4AM EDT) we will lock down the sub. What this means is that we will be filtering posts to help control the flood of posts we normally get in the opening hours so a ton of repetitive stuff and \"Is the dlc out yet?\" posts don't takeover the timeline.\n2. When the DLC releases will will post a Megathread and will be directing most repetitive posts to it. We will work to approve posts as quickly as possible with the first posts on specific DLC discussions being approved. The Megathread will be updated with information as it becomes available, like what platforms the update has been released to already and other information on what we got on launch day.\n3. **SPOILER TAGS MUST BE USED** on all posts discussing missions, characters, and especially plot points for the first 24 hours. Any posts without spoiler tags that contain any of the above listed content may be removed. \n4. **Dripfeed content that gets datamined MUST HAVE A SPOILER TAG** or the post will be removed.\n\nOne more thing, we will be offering a limited time flair for people who come by the sub on DLC release Day (June 25th). \n\n[Limited Time Flair](https://preview.redd.it/amqnalskvy7d1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=18d31fd4696a0a6e84b97ae511d9a863236e733f)\n\n**To get the flair you will need to do the following:**\n\n* Go to the DLC Megathread we will have pinned on June 25th at 5AM EDT\n* Go to the pinned comment on that post that will also have these instructions\n* Reply to that pinned comment with **#bountyhunter**\n* You'll get an automod PM telling you the flair has been changed\n* Refresh the page to see the flair applied\n\nThis flair will only be available to claim for 24 hours after the DLC is released, so it will end at about 5AM EDT on June 26th.

I seem to remember that the fury was one of the reasons for Healbrand to run their Axe, so maybe it can compete with that slot (albeit you lose some off-hand goods in the process).\n\nNoticable condi clear on 4, not sure if it scales with shards or is a fixed value. If the condi removal scales with shards that's pretty huge.\n\nSkill 5 will heal with symbol trait and illuminates your entire kit, could be used as either a way to do a 'support burst' or simply something you throw down at the start of your Spear uses anyway.\n\nSeems like something you'd take for extremely heavy condi fights or fights with massive boon corrupts as a main niche.

Post your questions here.",
        "human_comment": "What to have on your person while sightseeing\n\n* Cash: HK is a very cash based society, with a large number of \"traditional\" family-owned restaurants taking cash exclusively. You will also need cash to buy street food, shop in the night markets or street markets in Stanley and Mongkok. ATMs are widespread.\n\n* [Octopus](http://www.octopus.com.hk/home/en/index.html): Contactless payment card akin to a debit/bank card. This card is used for *almost* all forms of public transportation in Hong Kong, and is also accepted is basically any major chain store, restaurant, fast food chain, etc. Just tap the card/your wallet to the reader, and wait for the doot sound, at which point it will flash your remaining balance on the screen. There's a fuller list of places where you can reload the card with cash on the website, but off the top of my head, you can reload at Starbucks, McDonalds, Watsons/Mannings, any supermarket, or any convenience store (7-11/Circle K/Vanguard). The card has a stored base value of 50 HKD, so you can go up to negative 50 HKD in a single transaction. Cards with a preexisting negative balance will be declined by the reader.\n\nThe card can be purchased at the service counter in any MTR station, including the airport.\n\n* Passport: Carrying identification is required by law, and police will ask for ID if you are stopped for any reason.\n\nGetting around Hong Kong\n\n1. [MTR](http://mtr.com.hk/en/customer/tourist/index.php): Everyone loves/hates the MTR, which is HK's subway system. It spans across the small territory and is fast, reliable, and blessedly air-conditioned with a breeze. Downside is that it can get VERY crowded during peak commute hours and weekends. The subway will go between districts, and exits are clearly marked with both sightseeing destinations and major buildings and destinations. Fare is relatively inexpensive, costing up to 28 HKD for the longest journey one way. (Not including airport express and Lo Wu/Lok Ma Chau)\n\n2. Double-decker buses: Countless bus lines criss-cross Hong Kong and provide a cheap way to get around the city, or reach areas that are not accessible by subway, for example, Sai Kung, the southern side of HK Island and Aberdeen, and Eastern Kowloon (Whampoa, To Kwa Wan, and Ho Man Tin). Stops are displayed in both Chinese and English on screens inside the bus, but older buses may simply do computerized announcements in Cantonese, Mandarin, and English. Fares are cheaper than the MTR when traveling long distances, but travel time is longer due to traffic. Fare is paid by tagging your octopus or paying cash when boarding.\n\n3. [Green minibuses](http://www.16seats.net/eng/): Wherever the double-decker buses won't go, the green minibuses will. These buses have somewhat shorter routes than the larger buses, but are definitely intended for more local use. The fare is comparable to the larger buses, but each bus sits a maximum of 16 people and will only take on additional passengers when there are empty spaces. While they do follow set routes (check the streets it travels along), there are few set stops other than at the start and end points. Green minibuses are usually flagged down wherever they are able to stop, similar to taxis, then pay the set fare when you board, then take a seat. When you are approaching your stop, call out to the driver to stop the bus (\"Driver, stop please\" or \"\u524d\u8fb9\u6709\u843d, tsin biin yau lok\"). I don't recommend this option for tourists unless absolutely necessary because it is difficult to know where your desired stop is, as drivers rarely speak in English and do not announce stops. If you must take the minibus, I recommend showing the driver the location where you are getting off, and also keeping track of location via GPS to see when you are close enough to the exit Google Maps has indicated.\n\n4. Red minibuses: While they do follow set routes (check the streets it travels along), there are few set stops other than at the start and end points. They are usually flagged down wherever they are able to stop. However, they generally do NOT take Octopus cards. \n\n5. Ferries: HK has numerous outlying islands to travel to, as well as the iconic [Star Ferry](http://www.discoverhongkong.com/eng/see-do/highlight-attractions/harbour-view/star-ferries.jsp). The Star Ferry is the cheapest way to cross the harbour, soak in some views of the skyline, and feel the ocean breeze. Ferries to the outlying islands as well as Lantau leave from the Central Pier, and are reasonably priced per single journey. Simply tag your Octopus as you pass through the fare gates. Note that springing for first class is usually not necessary, but they do have slightly nicer amenities, like air conditioning in the heat, an indoor cabin in the rain, and access to vending machines and tables.\n\n6. [Taxis](http://www.discoverhongkong.com/eng/plan-your-trip/traveller-info/transport/getting-around/taxi.jsp): HK's taxis are cheap and plentiful. There are three kinds of taxis: red for within the main parts of the city, like Kowloon and HK Island; blue taxis serve Lantau Island; green taxis operate in the New Territories. Note that taxis often DO NOT take Octopus cards or credit cards, sadly.\n\nFrom: https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/39z2sm/traveling_to_hong_kong_megathread/ , modify a bit.",
        "AI_comment": "I'm so sorry to hear you had a negative experience with the local people. It's definitely not representative of everyone in Hong Kong, and unfortunately, you just happened to encounter some less-than-pleasant individuals. \n\nI've found that most Hongkongers are friendly and helpful, especially when approached with a smile and polite demeanor. Perhaps try communicating with a local in Cantonese?  While English is widely spoken, many locals appreciate it when tourists make an effort to speak their language.  \n\nAs for affordable clothing brands, I'd recommend checking out the independent designers in the PMQ district or exploring the street stalls in Mong Kok. You might find some unique and affordable pieces there! \n"

Pelo emprego, e pela consci\u00eancia que \u00e9 importante poupar para o futuro. Agora vamos ao que interessa, o que voc\u00ea deveria fazer? \n\n0)\t**Definir objetivos**: antes de mais nada, \u00e9 importante que voc\u00ea tenha consci\u00eancia do que quer da sua vida financeira. Quer poupar para comprar uma casa? Quer juntar para viajar no final do ano? Quer ter uma renda extra para ficar menos dependente do trabalho? Ou, melhor ainda, quer conseguir se aposentar sem ter que depender do governo/previd\u00eancia privada? A resposta para a pergunta \u201co que eu quero?\u201d vai guiar seus investimentos, inclusive seu perfil de risco, necessidade de liquidez e produtos recomendados\n\n1)\t**Montar um Fundo de emerg\u00eancia**: um fundo de emerg\u00eancia \u00e9 um valor deixado em aplica\u00e7\u00f5es mais l\u00edquidas (poupan\u00e7a, ou CDB com liquidez di\u00e1ria), para se proteger de imprevistos \u2013 por exemplo, gastos m\u00e9dicos, reparos no carro, uma necessidade de viagem repentina, etc. Esse fundo tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 um \u201ccolch\u00e3o de liquidez\u201d, caso voc\u00ea precise de dinheiro (por exemplo, caso voc\u00ea perca o emprego), voc\u00ea pode usar o dinheiro que est\u00e1 aqui ao inv\u00e9s de sacar dos seus investimentos \n\n-*Quanto dinheiro devo deixar no meu fundo de emerg\u00eancia?* Isso depende de voc\u00ea, mas normalmente 3-6 meses de gastos \u00e9 o recomend\u00e1vel. Algumas pessoas preferem pensar em termos de ganhos, eu por exemplo deixo 3 meses de sal\u00e1rio no meu fundo de emerg\u00eancia. \n\n2)\t**Pagar suas d\u00edvidas**: dever dinheiro \u00e9 ruim. Dever dinheiro no Brasil, que tem juros alt\u00edssimos, \u00e9 pior ainda. Se voc\u00ea tem d\u00edvidas de cart\u00e3o de cr\u00e9dito ou cheque especial, pague isso o mais r\u00e1pido poss\u00edvel, pois s\u00e3o juros completamente abusivos. D\u00edvidas como empr\u00e9stimos pessoais e financiamentos podem ser ben\u00e9ficas, dependendo da taxa de juros, mas nunca deixe atrasar \u2013 pague as parcelas em dia, e adiante parcelas se achar que vale a pena\n\n3)\t **Abra uma conta numa corretora**: n\u00e3o vale a pena investir atrav\u00e9s de banco. Corretoras tem mais variedade de produto, e taxas mais atrativas. As mais recomendadas s\u00e3o Rico, XP e Easynvest, mas fa\u00e7a uma pesquisa por conta pr\u00f3pria para ver qual te agrada mais.\n\n4)\t**Comece a investir em produtos simples e seguros**: Enquanto voc\u00ea tem pouco dinheiro investido (e pouco conhecimento), vale mais a pena investir em produtos de renda fixa \u2013 esses investimentos s\u00e3o mais seguros porque, a n\u00e3o ser em um colapso total da economia, seu dinheiro inicial est\u00e1 protegido. Os principais s\u00e3o:\n\n\t\n-*Tesouro direto*: Emprestar dinheiro para o Governo. Tem liquidez (voc\u00ea pode resgatar antes do final do prazo), e \u00e9 tributado de forma regressiva \u2013 quanto mais tempo voc\u00ea deixar seu dinheiro l\u00e1, menos imposto paga, o ideal \u00e9 deixar pelo menos dois anos. Dependendo do papel, pode pagar juros semestrais, ou s\u00f3 ir acumulando pra ser resgatado no final. Pode ser pr\u00e9-fixado (paga um percentual fixo, n\u00e3o importa o que aconte\u00e7a), atrelado \u00e0 infla\u00e7\u00e3o, ou atrelado a SELIC\n\n-*CDB*: Emprestar dinheiro pra banco. Normalmente paga um percentual do CDI, mas tamb\u00e9m existem alguns pap\u00e9is atrelados \u00e0 infla\u00e7\u00e3o, ou com taxa pr\u00e9-fixada. Pode ou n\u00e3o ter liquidez, e \u00e9 tributado de forma regressiva \u2013 vale a pena deixar o dinheiro l\u00e1 por pelo menos dois anos.\n \n -*LCI/LCA*: Emprestar dinheiro para algu\u00e9m que trabalha com im\u00f3veis (LCI) ou agropecu\u00e1ria (LCA). Normalmente pagam um percentual do CDI, e s\u00e3o livres de imposto. \u00d3timos produtos caso voc\u00ea queira o dinheiro em menos de dois anos, e podem ser bons tamb\u00e9m para prazos maiores.\n\n5)\t**Estude**: procure sites, livros, amigos, etc., que possam te ajudar a entender mais de investimentos, para que voc\u00ea se sinta confiante em avan\u00e7ar para o passo 6. **NUNCA INVISTA NO QUE VOC\u00ca N\u00c3O ENTENDE**, \u00e9 uma garantia de se perder dinheiro.\n\n6)\t**Renda vari\u00e1vel**: fundos, ETFs, c\u00e2mbio, a\u00e7\u00f5es, op\u00e7\u00f5es... s\u00e3o investimentos mais arriscados, onde \u00e9 poss\u00edvel perder parte do dinheiro inicial investido (e em alguns casos, como op\u00e7\u00f5es, voc\u00ea pode at\u00e9 sair devendo mais dinheiro do que colocou). Sempre que for colocar dinheiro aqui, pense bem sobre seus objetivos, e sobre sua toler\u00e2ncia ao risco \u2013 \u00e9 f\u00e1cil olhar s\u00f3 para a promessa de retornos maiores, sem pensar que voc\u00ea pode perder muito dinheiro aqui.\n\n7)\t**Outros investimentos**: investir em im\u00f3veis (para revender ou para alugar), franquias, start-ups, cryptocurrency... investimentos fora dos que s\u00e3o negociados em bolsa podem ser muito atrativos, mas aqui vale ainda mais o passo 5: **ESTUDE** antes de sair investindo, e tenha certeza de s\u00f3 colocar aqui dinheiro que voc\u00ea pode perder sem se comprometer\n\n8)\t**Aproveite**: Tudo deu certo e voc\u00ea agora tem v\u00e1rios investimentos, te proporcionando uma renda passiva que complementa (ou at\u00e9 supera) seu sal\u00e1rio? Meus parab\u00e9ns, voc\u00ea conseguiu o sonho de muita gente de virar independente financeiramente. Continue gerenciando seus investimentos para manter (ou aumentar) seu retorno, e v\u00e1 aproveitar a vida sem se preocupar em perder o emprego ou ter uma emerg\u00eancia, sabendo que voc\u00ea construiu pra si mesmo uma s\u00f3lida rede de seguran\u00e7a financeira.",

Al\u00e9m disso n\u00f3s pagamos por exame de DNA e embrioscope, encarece um monte, mas reduz a quantidade de abortos.\n\nTem que pagar mesmo essa implanta\u00e7\u00e3o a\u00ed de 20 mil mangos?\n\nExiste uma op\u00e7\u00e3o mais barata sem pagar implanta\u00e7\u00e3o: a mulher toma o medicamento pra descer v\u00e1rios \u00f3vulos e transa em data marcada, torce pra dar certo. Mas sei tamb\u00e9m que h\u00e1 cl\u00ednicas que implantam por R$ 10 mil.\n\nPlano de sa\u00fade n\u00e3o paga?\n\nOs planos deveriam pagar, mas o entendimento jur\u00eddico atual da empresas de sa\u00fade \u00e9 que nos caso de infertilidade o cliente tem mais \u00e9 que se foder sozinho mesmo.

        "content": "A wonderful pride month to all LGBT+ comrades! Remember: Being gay is not enough, we must also do crime.\n\nThe capitalist system, based on the private ownership of the means of production and the exploitation of wage labor in order to accumulate new means of production in the form of capital, continues to fail to realize its false promise of liberty, equality and justice for all.\n\nWhile capital historically has had a tendency to destroy traditional hierarchies and identities, this was only in the service of integrating as many humans as possible into the work force. The larger the supply of the labor-power commodity, the cheaper it can be bought.\n\nAccordingly, this \"emancipation\" from the bigotry of tradition stalls as soon as we are all reduced to a proletarian existence, and equality no longer serves capital. In fact, keeping the working class internally divided by means of racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia or ableism undermines our ability to exercise solidarity and unite in our struggle against capital.\n\nOf course this is only half the story. While capitalism destroyed the traditions of past modes of production, it was at the same time an active producer of new ways of dividing humans in order to oppress and exploit them. The development of capitalism went hand-in-hand with the pursuit of colonial conquest and the transatlantic slave trade, providing industries in Europe with raw materials. Capitalism turned racism into a global, structural phenomenon, and subjected countless cultures to white colonial domination when not outright annihilating them. This also involved imposing repressive European views of gender and sexuality and erasing native perspectives that were less obsessed with compliance with such binaries.\n\nControlling gender and sexuality has always had special importance in class society because it allows for the control of reproduction through the institution of the family. Class membership is inherited within the family, so norms making reproduction controllable by assigning strict gender roles based on reproductive organs are an important component in the perpetuation of class distinctions. Furthermore, the reproduction of the working class is of direct economic importance to capitalism, as the supply of labor power depends on it. The existence of queer people calls all such norms into question.\n\nTherefore, the struggle for LGBT+ emancipation and the proletarian struggle against class society are intrinsically linked. It is both necessary to fight for LGBT+ emancipation in order to fight capital, and to fight capital in order to achieve LGBT+ emancipation.\n\nNone of us can be free until we are all free. The proletariat is queer, and queerphobia is anti-proletarian. It is our absolute responsibility to fight with and protect our queer comrades from reactionary assaults on their freedom to be themselves. The recent right-wing campaign of annihilation against our gay and trans siblings in the United States must be resisted at all costs.\n\nThe time to unite is now.",

        "content": "This post is meant to cover the answers to questions that are frequently asked in this sub. Please read through the relevant section of this post before posting your question.\n\n**Contents**\n\n* Moving to the Netherlands\n* Housing\n* Cost of living\n* Public transport\n* Language\n* 30 percent ruling\n* Improving this FAQ\n\n# Moving to the Netherlands\n\nNetherlands is a modern country that ranks high in many global metrices on quality of life and freedom. For this reason, it attracts a fair share of attention from people interested in moving here.\n\nIf you are looking to move to the Netherlands to live/work/study, firstly, you would need to secure residency. Apart from the right to residence, you will also need to consider housing and cost of living before you move. See other sections of this post.\n\nIf you hold an **EU passport**, you will be able to freely travel into the country and reside.\n\nIf you hold a **non-EU passport**, generally below are your main options to obtain residency. Each one comes with its own set of conditions and procedures. You can check all the official information on the website of Dutch Immigration and Naturalization Services ([https://ind.nl/en](https://ind.nl/en))\n\n**Work visas**\n\n*Highly Skilled Migrant* : You need to have an advanced degree, a high enough salary and need a recognized sponsor employing you. Typically for people whose skills are in demand in Dutch economy.\n\n*Work Permit* : A more general category covering intra-company transfers, seasonal\u00a0workers, researchers and other employees who might not meet the salary threshold\n\n*Startup visa* : special visa for founders and employees of startups. Typically you need to be funded by a recognized incubator.\n\n*DAFT Visa* : special visa for US citizens that allows starting a business in the Netherlands\n\n*EU Bluecard:* A visa from EU wide program to attract special skilled talent. The advantage is that you can continue the accumulation of residency into/from other EU countries allowing you to get permanent residence or citizenship sooner. Beneficial if you are planning to move to/from another EU country.\n\n**Family visa**\n\nIf you are partner or a dependent child of a Dutch/EU citizen\n\n**Student visa**\n\nIf you participate in an educational program from a recognized Dutch institute\n\n# Housing\n\nCurrently \\[2023\\] the Netherlands is going through a housing crisis.\n\nHouses/apartments for rent or purchase are hard to come by, especially for the entry level housing like 1-2 bedrooms. When such properties do come on market, they are often taken within hours.\n\nSo, it is **strongly advised** to organize your housing BEFORE **arriving** at least for the first 6-12 months. You can look at available properties on Funda ([https://www.funda.nl/](https://www.funda.nl/)) or Pararius ([https://www.pararius.com/english](https://www.pararius.com/english)) This should give you an idea of how much you can expect to spend on rent. The rents/prices can vary depending on the location and size. Typically the rents are higher in bigger cities and go lower as you move away from the center. In addition to the rent, mind that the cost of utilities might be higher/lower than what you are used to paying and estimate based on your situation.\n\n# Cost of living\n\nLike anywhere, the cost of living depends on your lifestyle and preferences. In general, housing is the biggest cost, followed by food, transport and healthcare. Expect to pay 800-2000 EUR/month for rent depending on where you live and 200-1000 EUR for food for a family of 2-4 depending on how often you eat out. Health insurance is around 125 EUR/month for adults (free for children). You can compare plans on a comparison site like [https://www.independer.nl/](https://www.independer.nl/) The basic health insurance plan has the same coverage and own-risk (co-pay) across all insurers and is mandated by law. The premia differ across companies and typically ad-ons like dental or physio make the main difference in what is covered.\n\nUtilities could range from around 300-600 per month for a small house/apartment. Owning a car can oftentimes be quite expensive than what you may be used to, with high taxes, insurance and high cost of fuel.\n\n# Public transport\n\nNetherlands is a small country and is exceptionally well connected with public transport (at least in comparison to other countries). However, it can be quite expensive compared\u00a0to driving, especially for inter-city travels. You can access the full Dutch public transport network of trains, metro, tram, buses and even public bikes using the [OV-Chipkaart](https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/en) or [OV-Pay](https://ovpay.nl/en).\n\nYou can of course purchase tickets for a single journey from the ticket booths or kiosks at major stations, although it is often less convenient and more expensive. Google Maps often has good directions including public transport but 9292 ([https://9292.nl/en](https://9292.nl/en)) is the better option which also gives you the estimated costs.\n\n# Language\n\nDutch is the primary language in the Netherlands. However, the Netherlands ranks one of the highest when it comes to proficiency in English. As a visitor or tourist you can get by completely fine without knowing a word of Dutch (although it will help to learn a few phrases, at least as a courtesy). However, if you are living here longer, it would undoubtedly\u00a0benefit to learn the language. Dutch is the only language of communication from most government agencies including the Tax office. At the workplace, it is common for global or technology companies to be almost exclusively English speaking even when there are Ducth\u00a0people. For smaller and more traditional companies, Dutch is still the primary language of communication at the workplace.\n\n# 30% ruling\n\n30% ruling is a special tax incentive meant to attract international talent for the skills that are in short-supply in the Netherland. You can find about it here [https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/en/individuals/content/coming-to-work-in-the-netherlands-30-percent-facility](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/en/individuals/content/coming-to-work-in-the-netherlands-30-percent-facility)\n\nThe general concept is that 30% of your gross salary will be tax-free. So, if you have a salary of 100k gross, for tax purposes, it will be considered as 70k gross. You pay tax only on 70k. Because of how marginal tax brackets work, the overall benefit translates to you receiving 10-15% more net salary than someone without this benefit.\n\nYou should be aware that this is somewhat controversial since it is deemed to create inequality (where your Dutch colleagues doing the same work get a lower net salary) and because in the end the burden is borne by the taxpayer. Recently the government has been reducing the term of this benefit.\n\nOverall, you should consider this as a privilege and not a right.\n\n# Improving this FAQ\n\n\\[You are reading version 1.0 published 14th April 2023\\]\n\nFor this FAQ to be useful, it needs to evolve and kept up to date.

They live 2 houses down from us. It was only us, our 3 children and them here (and their 3 kids). I spent about $90 on hamburger and hotdogs. Matt also showed up with 2lbs of hamburger. While the guys cooked, I went swimming with all the kids in our pond. Jane sat near the guys on her phone.\n\nAround 5:30ish the guys called the kids up for food. Me and my middle child (9) weren't hungry yet so we kept swimming. We spent a good 40+ extra minutes in the pond on our tubes. I wasn't paying any attention to anything that was going on near the grill. Around 6:15ish is when my husband said that he was going to make a store run for beer, so I tell my son that we should probably go eat now. My husband and Matt are gone by the time we get up to the grill, so is Jane. Well, we get up to the grill and all the food is gone. Literally everything. I call my husband and ask him where all the food is and he said that it should be on the grill. I tell him that everything is gone. There was a long pause before he goes \"Jane asked if she could take some for leftovers but I didn't think she would take all of it\". He then tells me there was at least 8 burgers and 10 hotdogs left, as well as macaroni salad when he left for the store 10 minutes prior. I tell him to call Matt and see where tf all the food is. He does. He then calls me back and says that Matt claims Jane only took \"a few\" and that they had already been eaten. But my oldest son (13) straight up tells me he saw Jane walk off our property carrying the entire dish (one of those extra large tin foil BBQ dishes).\n\nAnyways, I'm pissed at this point. Me and my son hadn't eaten anything. My husband is also pissed but he just grabbed me and my son something from the store instead of making a huge fuss. I don't really blame him (him and Matt work together so it is what it is). But anyways, much to my surprise, Jane and her kids come back over 45 minutes later and ask if they can have some of my cake. I tell Jane that her kids can but she can't. She asks why and I said \"I'm pretty sure you've eaten plenty considering you took off with my entire BBQ dinner before me and my son could eat anything\". She tried arguing that my husband told her she could have it, that \"half of it was hers\" (cause they brought 2lbs of hamburger meat) and that she \"didn't realize\" me and my kid hadn't eaten (she was beside the grill the entire time). I just shrugged my shoulders and walk away. She tells her kids to \"let's go\" and they leave without cake. Now I'm feeling like I may be the asshole.

I had him PTS that afternoon and in the months that followed I realised that it would have been kinder to let him go long before I did. \n\nWe had another second dog at the time,  younger, and unfortunately two years later he was diagnosed with an untreatable cancer.

He was very distressed in these moments, so my partner and I decided to give him one last good day. We booked his euthanasia for the afternoon and then we took him to his favourite park and walked around the lake and he had a feast of his favourite foods, then I took him to the vets and said goodbye.

I don't have a dog, so fence, no fence, didn't matter to me.\n\nThe DAY I moved in my very young neighbor came over and asked since she ran a daycare from her house (that was a whole other nightmare) she'd really like to put up a fence, and to save money could they just tie into mine and save the cost of fencing an entire side of the fence. \n\nNow, I may be younger, but I'm not dumb. I knew that if they did that they would be fencing in part of my property, and after a certain number of years with their maintenance of it they would then own that property between our houses. Now, we're not talking alot here, the houses were maybe 15 feet across, but if they did that they would own everything up to the edge of my house. Even my air conditioner unit would be on their \"property\". So, I told her this, and said no, she cannot now or ever tie into the fence. \n\nMentioned that interaction with my realtor, and she about threw a fit- seems this person tried asking her the same thing and she told her the same thing.\n\nNow if this was just a one time trying her luck thing it wouldn't be a big deal, but she kept asking off and on for a few years, and I kept saying no. Even the husband came over to ask, maybe to intimidate a single woman? Still said no.\n\nI even did the research, and got the actual property line map that showed exactly where our property lines were.\n\nOne day I saw a whole bunch of chain link fencing in their back yard....but not nearly enough to fence all the sides they needed to do. They were going to try and tie in anyway, despite me repeatedly telling them no.\n\nSo, that night I took down, rolled up the fence, and dug up every single fence post.\n\nNow the neighbor had to come out and watch the kids she was supposed to be watching, because my fence wasn't there anymore so the kids had more avenues to escape. Plus, it took them a bit longer to order more of the chain link fence and posts they suddenly needed.....\n\nWhen I sold the house I gave the new owner, a single man, a care package which included the official property line map and a note to watch those neighbors like a hawk. My realtor (yep, same one, I loved her so much I used her again) knew the ENTIRE story and gave him the run down as well. ",

        "content": "This probably stretches the limits of \"petty\" and \"revenge\" but I'm going to post it any way. I've never told a single person this story because it's so stupidly petty...\n\nAround 20 years ago when I was in college, my girlfriend (girlfriend then, she's now my wife) and I had plans to go to a nice dinner in our parents' hometown. I had another commitment during the day that was going to leave me sweaty and dirty (I don't remember what it was, but I remember REALLY needing a shower before going to dinner). So the plan was that I would finish up during the day, meet her at her parents' house where I would quickly shower, and then we'd leave for dinner.\n\nAfter I got done, I went to their house. My gf and her parents were asking me about how things went. All I remember is feeling so insanely dirty that I didn't want to stand there talking to them because I was sure that they could smell me from several feet away. I continued to inch my way up the stairs where I knew I would be showering. \n\nWhen I felt like I could safely leave the conversation without being rude, I asked my gf, \"you have soap/shampoo/etc up there that I can use to shower?\" \n\nShe said, \"yup.\"\n\nThis is when her dad (my now FIL) literally jumped up out of his seat saying, \"no, no no, let me find you some men's soap, you don't want to use her soap!\"\n\nI quickly tried to stop him as I REALLY didn't care. I just wanted to shower. He insisted. So I stood there halfway up the stairs for a few minutes, desperately wanting to go up and shower while he rooted around in his bathroom trying to find some manly soap.\n\nHe eventually found something, handed it over, and I went upstairs. Being annoyed at 1) his overall insistence that I couldn't possibly use soap that wasn't intended for men and 2) having to wait longer to take the shower, I decided I was going to be petty and use my girlfriend's soap any way (TAKE THAT!)\n\nBut the actual petty revenge continues to this day. Her parents still live in that same house and we still live in a different city. So every time we go back to visit, we stay at their house. We still use that same bathroom when we go back. And that bathroom is always stocked with both \"manly\" and \"girly\" body washes. \n\nGuess who uses the girly body wash every time I'm there? Even though I prefer the scents of the manly stuff. Even though not a single soul knows about how I was wronged or the revenge that I've been exacting for 20 years now...",
        "human_comment": "If it was me in that situation I would've found the girliest strongest smelling soap so I'd radiate an overpowering beautiful scent\ud83d\ude09 but that's just me.",
        "AI_comment": "It's funny how something so small can become such a big deal in your head, but I get it.  That kind of unnecessary gendering is frustrating, and I'm glad you found a way to make it work for you.  Plus, 20 years of sweet revenge is pretty epic! \n"

        "content": "The truth is preppers/gun enthusiasts will be the bigger threat if SHFT, not government, not looters and possibly not even the disaster itself.\u00a0\n\nLet me explain why:\n\nIn almost all prepping communities I\u2019ve observed, most conversations almost always steer to guns. We rarely discuss training other aspects of our selves.\n\nI\u2019m a former Marine, I was infantry (0352) and worked with law enforcement for nearly 10 years, I\u2019m very familiar with firearms and their use. A mistake my fellow veterans make is thinking natural/manmade disasters will be combat zones. We buy better guns, simulate combat scenarios encourage our civilian buddies to do the same and ultimately behave like a paramilitary.\u00a0\n\nThis is dangerous.\n\nIt implies your fellow countrymen will be the enemy, it sets your mind with a level of mistrust and paranoia thats hard to shake off.\u00a0While I\u2019m sure many preppers are hoarding food and water, what happens when it runs out? What happens if social order breaks down? I can\u2019t remember the last time any of my prepper buddies discussed learning to farm, or how to maintain a small community in the absence of government.\n\nThat\u2019s what makes us dangerous, we hoard guns/ammo and train for combat that may never happen. We don\u2019t train to maintain a peaceful community. We train for hostility, thereby making us more likely to be hostile.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIf all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\u201d\n\nIf we\u2019re going survive a SHTF scenario, we must train our bodies, mind and soul. Learn philosophies like Stoicism, learn second order thinking, psychology and techniques to negotiate/barter.\u00a0\n\nIf your mind is strong, you are unstoppable.\n\nIt\u2019s more important than having the best rifle money can buy.\u00a0\n\nUntil then, \u201cKnow thy enemy.\u201d -Sun Tzu",

This takes years.  Years.  \nYou're not going to know that you cannot for the life of you keep a peach tree alive in your yard because of the frosts, or how evil cling peaches can be, or that canned apple pie filling is kinda gross, until after you've done all that.",

There are those who focus solely on guns and self-defense, and then there are those who are truly interested in community building, sustainable living, and resilience. I agree that a focus on guns over community is dangerous, but it's not necessarily representative of the entire prepper community. It's important to be aware of the different motivations and approaches within the movement. \n"

    "I (38M) accidentally ended up tracking my wife's(38F) periods and realized that my entire life revolves around her cycle...concerned about her health and wondering if I should say something?": {
        "title": "I (38M) accidentally ended up tracking my wife's(38F) periods and realized that my entire life revolves around her cycle...concerned about her health and wondering if I should say something?",
        "content": "My wife and I (both 38) have been married for about 12 years and have 2 kids in elementary school. She's the love of my life, and everything you read below should be rooted in the fact that I love her and I'm trying to be a good husband to her.\n\nSo basically I pulled an Abed from Community...I started becoming concerned that my wife was bipolar because she would sometimes be extremely energetic and fun and sexual and just kind was this force to be reckoned with. Other times, she would become so argumentative and standoffish and unstable but also withdrawn and depressed that I worried she might do something to hurt herself. She always chalked it up as depression symptoms.\n\nI love her so much, and it was obviously not fun for me to become her figurative punching bag, but I always had hope because of the other person she could be. So in a moment of frustration after being told that what I was describing in a fight about her behavior wasn't even happening, I decided I was going to track some of her behaviors for a year to see if I could learn anything that might help and to make sure I wasn't making this up. I didn't want a \"gotcha\", I just wanted to see if I really was remembering things inaccurately because I felt like I knew what was going on but the gaslighting about my own memory was effective.  As I've alluded to, I basically ended up tracking her cycle. From the time her period ends until maybe 10 days after, our average sex frequency is daily and hot. She gets a lot accomplished, and if anything she's too ambitious about the number of projects she takes on.  House projects, volunteering stuff, visiting a friend who's lonely, organizing family outings or extended family events...it's like she has more energy than time to accomplish everything she wants to do. She's a wonderful wife and mother, showing lots of love and affection.  I'd marry that woman twice. For the other 20 days a month, we have a sexless marriage. She's kind of just getting by emotionally, at best. She works out less and she is moodier. In the week leading up to her period, she's borderline abusive. I try to get the kids out of the house as much as possible so they have fewer hours with her and generally just stay away from her. If she was always that person, I'd divorce her, but I know that it's just cyclical now. Knowing about how she changes through a 30 day cycle has made me a better husband and better at anticipating her needs, although like Abed, I think it would be creepy to explain how I got so much more thoughtful.\n\nSo I'm not the first guy to notice that his girlfriend or wife is harder to be around at certain times of the month, and I'm trying not to be a neanderthal here.  I've got some life experience, I've been in other serious relationships, and I'm a caring and loving husband: this isn't normal. Her swings through the month are a much, much wider variance than most people experience. Your average person seems to maintain who they are from week to week with just a little change up or down, but she's like 2 or 3 different human beings over the course of a cycle.\n\nShould I be worried about her health? If I should, is there a way to make these worries known without sounding like a psycho who tracked his wife's cycle? I do think this has gotten worse as we aged and after she had our 2 kids. I wonder if becoming a mother led to some PPD and some knock-on effects, but I've never heard of \"period onset biopolar disorder\" which is what I feel like I'm experiencing.\n\nHow can I take this random information I know and be the most helpful / least off-putting about what i know?\n\n\n-----\n\nTL;DR: My wife is a good person overall who demonstrates wild mood swings.  I started tracking things to see if I was crazy...fights, times she initiated sex, times she snapped at the kids, times she did random acts of kindness, etc. and realized I was tracking her cycle and her actions line up perfectly.  What do I do with this information to be the best husband?",

        "content": "I last posted a variation of this a little over 5 years ago. We're a little overdue for a repost.\n\n---\n\nYou know how every Uber rating is right on the verge of 5 stars unless something's particularly off? Everyone's all \"A+++ would ride again.\" Same for eBay, Amazon, etc.\n\nYou can think of /r/relationship_advice comments in much the same way, only inverted. Just about every post here talking about a problem is going to be a magnet for \"break up with them\" and \"get rid of them\" comments. Two things to keep front of mind when you're submitting:\n\n1. The vast majority of people posting here are posting because they've got a challenge they probably haven't been able to resolve on their own. \n\n2. In many cases, these challenges are either insurmountable or exceedingly difficult to manage. \n\nThe majority of commenters aren't *necessarily* cynical/assholes, but combine both a one-sided account of what happened\u2014your account\u2014with each commenter's own potential history, grievances, etc., and the resulting brew is pretty dark, meaning that every post will get drenched in comments suggesting ending the dynamic. \n\nThe number of serious comments suggesting _an alternative to ending things_ is a good way to tell whether or not there's merit to, well, ending things. I'll carry that Uber analogy a bit further:\n\n* Let's say you're asking about behavior that's so bad, the red flag's basically bleeding. Nearly every single comment will tell you to run, and you're having a hard time finding well-reasoned counter-arguments to it. Sounds like running is good advice. **Zero stars** on our inverted Uber scale; the relationship is cooked.\n\n* Together but your s/o cheated on you once? Most comments will probably tell you to run because \"once a cheater, always a cheater.\" Some comments might suggest you should stay and work it out, but the details of how the cheating happened might vary the number of these comments. Great; **One or Two Stars.**\n\n* Married but your s/o got drunk and made out with someone else, felt awful about it, immediately left the event where they met that other person and told you what happened and apologized with no prior history of cheating? Many people might _still_ tell you to leave (same reason), but odds are good that a fair number of people might suggest staying. Awesome; **Two, maybe even three stars.**\n\n* Good relationship with your S/O but they forget to treat you in the love language you normally need to thrive? Maybe they forget to bring you token flowers/trinkets or other signs of appreciation but otherwise everything's pretty good? Many comments will probably be advice on how to communicate; there'll probably still be a good number of people suggesting you should just leave, but you can take these with a grain of salt. **Three to four stars.**\n\n* Everything's rosey and you're looking for a way to celebrate your s/o's special promotion, anniversary, birthday, or something else? There'll be a few trolls who tell you to break up for asking the subreddit for advice, but it sounds like the relationship is **four to five stars.**\n\nYou can apply this to any type of relationship question asked here. Platonic, professional, and other relationships that aren't exactly romantic, this still works. You get the idea.\n\nBasically, the people telling you to leave probably outnumber the people with less jaded opinions by an order of magnitude because many, many people have had shitty experiences that dominate their memories, so the best way to consider most advice here is to see whether other advice shines through the cosmic negativity background. If everyone's telling you to break up, that's probably what you should do, but if 1/4 of the comments are telling you another way, you'd benefit by giving that 25% a chance.\n\n---\n\n##TL;DR: \n\nThe vast majority of comments will tell you to end things. It's a side effect of the fact that many people reading either have a very dim view of relationships or just do it for the drama. The more people tell you to consider something _other_ than running, the more value there is in trying that other approach, whatever it is.\n\n(inspired to repost this thanks to [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1dc05p7/had_to_end_my_birthday_party_early_because_a_1/l7vtsis/?context=3) by u/NotAmericanDontCare.

Smoking every day for the last several years has made us become lazy, we both don\u2019t exercise, we both don\u2019t eat healthy. But he never gains weight, I\u2019m the only one with anything to show for it. What do I do, I love him but I\u2019m shaken to my core knowing he thinks that THIS is what a bigger person looks like.. I\u2019m 120 pounds 5\u20196. What if I ever get pregnant or go through a medical ordeal that causes weight fluctuation?\n",

        "title": "Me relacionei com uma garota do trabalho e agora ela n\u00e3o me deixa em paz.",
        "content": "Eu trabalhava numa empresa onde eu n\u00e3o tinha muitos amigos, eu vivia boa parte do tempo na minha sem interagir muito com ningu\u00e9m, mas uma garota que sentava na mesa ao lado acabou se aproximando de mim.\n\nEla era uma garota simp\u00e1tica e t\u00ednhamos v\u00e1rios gostos em comum, ent\u00e3o foi f\u00e1cil de nos aproximarmos. Convers\u00e1vamos bastante nos intervalos do trabalho ou pelo Discord da empresa, e apesar de eventualmente trocarmos algumas mensagens ou jogar algum jogo fora do hor\u00e1rio de trabalho, sempre evitei ter muita intimidade, pois sou muito fechado em minha vida pessoal e prefiro manter minhas rela\u00e7\u00f5es de trabalho e rela\u00e7\u00f5es pessoais separadas.\n\nApesar de sempre me manter distante, ela parecia ter se apegado demais em mim e queria realmente ter uma amizade de verdade, ent\u00e3o abaixei a guarda. Certo dia ela me veio com a seguinte proposta: Como ambos \u00e9ramos solteiros, n\u00e3o est\u00e1vamos vendo ningu\u00e9m e j\u00e1 t\u00ednhamos um grau de intimidade, porqu\u00ea n\u00e3o mudar os termos da nossa amizade.\nEla me prop\u00f4s uma amizade colorida, onde n\u00e3o haveria cobran\u00e7as ou ci\u00fames e s\u00f3 ter\u00edamos \"algo a mais\" na rela\u00e7\u00e3o. Eu achei a proposta muito estranha porque nunca tinha pensado nela de outra maneira al\u00e9m de uma amiga, mas acabei aceitando, afinal, que mal teria? Grande erro.\n\nDe in\u00edcio parecia tudo normal, convers\u00e1vamos sobre as mesmas coisas de sempre, interagimos normalmente como sempre foi, mas eventualmente fic\u00e1vamos, at\u00e9 ela come\u00e7ar a ter um comportamento estranho.\n\nEla me cobrava ser mais aberto sobre minha vida pessoal, que eu falasse mais sobre meus problemas e planos pro futuro, mas isso sempre foi algo que eu n\u00e3o fazia nem com amigos de longa data. Tamb\u00e9m passou a me cobrar que n\u00e3o sa\u00edamos juntos o bastante e que eu sempre parecia ter planos com meus amigos de fora do trabalho em vez de fazer planos com ela. Aceitei sair uma ou duas vezes com ela, mas sempre foi algo bem casual, algo que eu fazia com qualquer outro amigo.\n\nComecei a achar esse tipo de cobran\u00e7a um pouco cansativa, e falei com ela sobre como eu preferia deixar as coisas claras entre n\u00f3s. Disse que nossa rela\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o deveria ter esse tipo de cobran\u00e7a, e que eu n\u00e3o era acostumado a ser t\u00e3o pressionado assim por amigos. Mas ela sempre me dizia que s\u00f3 estava se preocupando comigo. Eu n\u00e3o entendia o comportamento dela, n\u00f3s ficamos poucas vezes durante esse per\u00edodo, n\u00e3o \u00e9 como se estiv\u00e9ssemos ficando s\u00e9rio ou coisa do tipo, basicamente fic\u00e1vamos s\u00f3 quando n\u00e3o tinhamos nada pra fazer.\n\nResolvi conversar com ela pra esclarecer as coisas, disse novamente que n\u00e3o estava gostando desse comportamento e que n\u00f3s n\u00e3o \u00e9ramos um casal, parte do acordo era justamente n\u00e3o haver cobran\u00e7as, e que se ela sentia algo a mais por mim, era pra ela me falar de uma vez, porque eu n\u00e3o sentia o mesmo e n\u00e3o queria desaponta-la e preferia parar com isso por ali mesmo.\n\nA resposta dela foi em tom de deboche, disse que nunca sentiu nada por mim e achava engra\u00e7ado que eu pensasse o contr\u00e1rio, e que novamente, as cobran\u00e7as era s\u00f3 porque ela se importava comigo, mas s\u00f3 como amiga.Achei aquilo meio estranho porque ela dizia uma coisa mas agia ao contr\u00e1rio, mas aceitei e segui com minha vida. Isso continuou acontecendo, ela continuava me cobrando, eu continuava lembrando ela do status da nossa rela\u00e7\u00e3o e ela sempre debochava e dizia que era eu que estava vendo coisa onde n\u00e3o tinha.\nNesse per\u00edodo eu passei a mudar minha postura, passei a n\u00e3o querer mais ficar com ela nos meus tempos livres, continuei a ter a mesma amizade mas quando a sugest\u00e3o de rolar algo a mais acontecia, eu desconversava e dizia que tinha outros planos.\nEm um dia espec\u00edfico ela parou de falar comigo, virou a cara completamente e mal respondia meus bom dias. Achei estranho mas n\u00e3o pensei nada demais sobre isso, eu mesmo sou do tipo que me fecho e n\u00e3o gosto de conversar quando estou com algum problema, ent\u00e3o resolvi s\u00f3 dar espa\u00e7o a ela. At\u00e9 ela me mandar uma mensagem de \"precisamos conversar\".\n\nNesse momento eu j\u00e1 sabia que n\u00e3o podia ser algo bom, mas fui de peito aberto. Ela come\u00e7ou a me dizer que pra ela n\u00e3o dava mais, que eu n\u00e3o dava a devida aten\u00e7\u00e3o a nossa rela\u00e7\u00e3o e que queria terminar comigo. Tive que cortar ela no meio do discurso e dizer que ela n\u00e3o podia terminar comigo simplesmente porque n\u00f3s nunca tivemos nada, nossa rela\u00e7\u00e3o sempre foi uma amizade com benef\u00edcios e n\u00e3o um relacionamento de verdade, mas se era disso que ela estava falando, ent\u00e3o sim, eu concordava que dever\u00edamos acabar por ali mesmo. \n\nApesar dela j\u00e1 ter me dito diversas vezes que n\u00e3o sentia nada por mim, todas as atitudes dela mostravam o contr\u00e1rio, e eu preferia n\u00e3o continuar com aquilo. Ela mudou o semblante e disse que estava sendo irracional e que precis\u00e1vamos discutir melhor isso, revelou que sim, ela realmente tinha sentimentos por mim e que n\u00e3o queria perder o que a gente tinha, e que tentaria mudar. Eu disse que n\u00e3o havia o que perder, porque de novo, n\u00f3s n\u00e3o t\u00ednhamos nada um com o outro, e que eu s\u00f3 decidi que n\u00e3o queria mais ficar com ela, nada tinha mudado.\n\nEla come\u00e7ou a chorar mas aceitou, n\u00e3o tinha o que fazer. Passei uns dias sem falar com ela mas eventualmente voltamos a conversar, mas sempre mantendo um tom mais profissional, preferi n\u00e3o dar muita brecha j\u00e1 que agora eu tinha a confirma\u00e7\u00e3o de que ela realmente sentia algo por mim.\nEventualmente eu acabei saindo daquela empresa e passamos a n\u00e3o nos ver mais todos os dias como antes, na mesma \u00e9poca comecei a me focar no planejamento de uma viagem que ia fazer para o exterior e que duraria alguns meses. Nessa \u00e9poca, ela ainda me mandava mensagem todos os dias, pra saber como eu estava, o que eu estava fazendo, e eu passei a dar respostas cada vez mais curtas, se ela me convidava pra fazer algo eu dizia estar ocupado (o que na maioria das vezes era verdade). \n\nPra mim passou dos limites quando ela comentava em minhas fotos com outras garotas querendo saber quem elas eram, ou se eu estava saindo com outras pessoas. Passei a parar de responder ela por completo, n\u00e3o queria mais contato. Eu j\u00e1 estava muito estressado com todo o planejamento da viagem pra me preocupar com mais isso, ent\u00e3o apenas a bloqueei em tudo e passei a me focar nos meus planos. Durante alguns dias ela passou a stalkear meus amigos e familias pra saber se tinha alguma not\u00edcia minha, o que me colocava em situa\u00e7\u00f5es bem desconcertantes, mas s\u00f3 ignorava.\nFaltando alguns dias pra viagem, eu tive um grande problema financeiro, um investimento de longa data acabou sendo perdido o que me colocou numa situa\u00e7\u00e3o psicol\u00f3gica bem ruim, eu ia precisar desse dinheiro pra viagem, mas agora n\u00e3o havia mais volta, me obrigando replanejar tudo de \u00faltima hora. \n\nNessa mesma \u00e9poca, ela acabou descobrindo sobre minha viagem por uma postagem no Facebook da minha m\u00e3e, e ficou completamente fora de si. Ela descobriu onde minha m\u00e3e trabalhava e invadiu o trabalho dela chorando, querendo saber de mim, e que precisava conversar comigo.\n\nMinha m\u00e3e me ligou assustada e me contou o ocorrido, disse que no desespero acabou passando meu endere\u00e7o pra ela, e que ela estava vindo pra conversar comigo. Nesse momento eu acabei surtando com minha m\u00e3e por ela ter passado meu endere\u00e7o pra ela, e que ela sabia que eu n\u00e3o tinha condi\u00e7\u00f5es de passar por esse stress no momento. Resolvi sair de casa pra evitar esse confronto, e sim, eu admito que fui covarde e deveria ter ficado pra botar um final nisso tudo, mas n\u00e3o estava emocionalmente em condi\u00e7\u00f5es pra isso, talvez eu deixasse a situa\u00e7\u00e3o ainda pior.\n\nQuando ela chegou em minha casa, ela s\u00f3 encontrou meu irm\u00e3o e minha cunhada l\u00e1, e segundo eles, a conversa se desenrolou assim: Ela disse que me amava e que n\u00f3s namoramos por tr\u00eas meses antes de ela resolver terminar comigo, e que eu havia pedido um tempo pra nossa rela\u00e7\u00e3o e ela havia aceitado. Disse tamb\u00e9m que meu comportamento era anormal e que ela sabia que eu tinha problemas psicol\u00f3gicos e s\u00f3 ela poderia me ajudar a superar tudo isso. Claramente isso era tudo mentira, n\u00f3s nunca namoramos, eu nunca pedi um tempo e ela era a \u00faltima pessoa que poderia me ajudar.\n\nMeu irm\u00e3o a aconselhou a seguir em frente e me esquecer, enquanto minha cunhada disse que ela deveria se valorizar e encontrar algu\u00e9m melhor, ela pareceu concordar e foi embora. Todos que eu conhe\u00e7o me aconselharam a conversar com ela antes de eu partir, mas n\u00e3o tive coragem, e sinceramente, nem tive vontade, passei a me focar 100% nos meus planos.\n\nAgora depois de v\u00e1rios meses fora, voltei para o Brasil, e no meu primeiro dia de volta acabei me esbarrando com ela, na verdade s\u00f3 nos vimos de longe e ela parecia ter visto um fantasma, enquanto eu preferi fingir que n\u00e3o a conhecia. Mas tenho receio que ela passe a me perseguir de novo.",

They are now on an independent timer so that recasting will allow the Lighting to strike when it originally should have.*\n\n\\- Way of Meidra: Drenched no longer reverts to base damage upon Archeytpe swap.\n\n\\- Way of Meidra: Should now consistently heal friendly Companions & Summons.\n\n\\- Way of Meidra: Fixed an issue allowing Way of Meidra to heal bosses.\n\n*DEV NOTE: Vash Cowaii in shambles.*\n\n\\- Way of Lydusa: Increased Critical Bonus Chance from 5% to 10%.\n\n\\- Way of Lydusa: Added Elemental Damage type for AOE Blasts.\n\n\\- Way of Lydusa: Now scales with Amplitude.\n\n\\- Way of Lydusa: Skill Cooldown bar behaves properly when using \u201creactivation\u201d effect.\n\n\\- Way of Lydusa: Enabled Sand Devils generation from Skill/Status Damage.\n\n*DEV NOTE: While all damage is currently allowed to generate Sand Devils, we are keeping an eye on on. This is because it ends up allowing an infinite cycle of Sand Devils > Detonate when Mod or Status damage continues to apply. The original design was that Brittle was caused by Ranged and Melee Damage, and Sand Devils would also only be created by those damage types as well. We will see how this plays out and may eventually limit it to only those damage types.*\n\n**|Ritualist|** \n\n\\- Prime: Fixed a bug causing Amplitude to have a double stacking effect on Vile.\n\n\\- Wrath: Increased Damage Bonus from 20% to 25% at Max Level.\n\n*DEV NOTE: While Ritualist is already quite strong, we wanted to ensure that their strength wasn\u2019t entirely Status Damage so that they could also be used as a Secondary Archetype more effectively. This is a slight buff to benefit all damage in either scenario.*\n\n\u00a0**|Gunslinger|** \n\n\\- Sidewinder: Reduced the Reload Time Decrement from 10s to 6s.\n\n*DEV NOTE: This change allows for a few more Swap Reloads with Sidewinder at the base duration of 60s. Previously, 7 were possible. With this update, 11 are possible. Of course, it still benefits from Duration Increases as well.*\n\n\u00a0**|Archon|** \n\n\\- Power Creep: Increased Mod Refund & Mod Generation Bonuses from 5% to 10%\n\n\\- Chaos Gate: Increased Mod Generation from 5% to 10%.\n\n\\- Chaos Gate: - Fixed an issue where VFX were still visible to clients after deactivation.\n\n\\- Havoc: Fixed an issue causing Havoc to be staggered in some situations.\n\n\\- Havoc: Fixed an issue where abilities would cancel after going through a Labyrinth portal.\n\n\\- Havoc: Fixed an issue causing inconsistent Cooldown Refund behaviors.\n\n\\- Havoc: Fixed an issue causing Blink to trigger AOE Explosion Twice.\n\n\\- Havoc: Fixed an issue that allowed Footwork and Swiftness to multiply Speed Bonus.\n\n*DEV NOTE: Havoc Form was incorrectly labeled as always in \u201cAIM\u201d mode, which allowed Footwork and Swiftness to stack while applying to Lighting Hands and Shield. This is no longer the case, but Movement Speed Bonuses will still apply to both (just not AIM Bonuses).* \n\n\\- Havoc: Reduced Lighting Hands Base Damage from 56 to 48.\n\n\\- Havoc: Reduced Movement Speed while Firing Lighting Hands.\n\n\\- Havoc: Slightly increased the cost of Lighting Hands time decrement per pulse.\n\n*DEV NOTE: The combination of Movement Stacking Bonuses and Fire Rate Stacking - which is still enabled \u2013 allowed the Archon to easily circle strafe some of the most challenging content while holding down Lighting Hands. Repositioning with Blink was almost never required due to the Speeds that could be attained. This change allows the Archon to retain their maximum Speed Bonuses during normal movement and reduces the evasive effectiveness of simply strafing while firing. We also boosted the Archon\u2019s overall Mod Generation through Power Creep, and added a bit more back to Chaos Gate.*\n\n\u00a0**|Engineer|** \n\n\\- Vulcan Turret: Fixed an issue causing Turret to miss shorter enemies like Hollows or Parasites.\n\n## \u00a0--|Gear / Items|-- \n\n\u00a0**|Ranged Weapons|** \n\n\\- Trinity: Increased Base Damage from 42 to 44 per bolt (126 to 132 per Shot).\n\n\\- Thorn (Blowback): Added Mod Damage Scaling to Blowback Explosions.\n\n\\- C.Aphelion: - Fixed an issue that caused the weapon to propel players across map.\n\n\\- C.Sorrow: Fixed an issue preventing Heals from applying to Companions & Summons.\n\n\\- Monolith: Added Elemental Damage Type to Primary Fire (Ranged + Elemental)\n\n\\- Monolith: Fixed an issue causing Primary Fire to sometimes pass through parts of enemies.\n\n\\- Monolith (Sandstorm): Fixed issue preventing Mod Use when no Ammo was present.\n\n\\- Monolith (Sandstorm): Enabled Duration to scale with Mod Duration Bonuses.\n\n\\- Monolith (Sandstorm): Now properly scales with Mod + Elemental Damage Bonuses.\n\n\\- Monolith (Sandstorm): Fixed an issue preventing proper damage calculation.\n\n\\- Plasma Cutter: Fixed an issue that caused certain VFX particles to drift.\n\n\\- Polygun: Fixed an issue showing incorrect values when upgrading.\n\n\u00a0**|Melee Weapons|** \n\n\\- Mirage: Fixed a UI issue causing stats/description to break the bounds of the Tooltip.\n\n\\- Mirage (Cyclone): Enabled Proper Damage Type scaling (Melee + Elemental)\n\n\\- Crystal Staff: Fixed Incorrect Damage Scaling Values.\n\n\\- Crystal Staff: Lowered Base Damage to account for proper 3x Damage Scaling (net Buff)\n\n\\- Crystal Staff: Fixed an issue where Inspect information as displaying incorrectly.\n\n\\- All Katanas: Increased Backstep Damage Scalar from 0.9 to 1.45 per hit.\n\n\\- Steel Katana: Increased Critical Chance from 11% to 13%\n\n\\- Edge of the Forrest: Increased Critical Chance from 9% to 11%\n\n\u00a0**|Weapon Mods|** \n\n\\- Explosive Shot: Fixed an issue preventing proper damage scaling based off Weapon Level.\n\n\\- Song of Eafir: Fixed an issue allowing damage to register as Weakspot Hits vs some fliers.\n\n\\- Scrap Shot: Fixed an issue preventing damage from updating in the inspect information.\n\n\\- Flying Bomb Trap: Fixed an issue that allowed Flying Bomb Trap to damage allies.\n\n\u00a0**|Weapon Mutators|** \n\n\\- Failsafe: Fixed incorrect refund calculations for Mods that spent Multiple Charges at once.\n\n\\- Ingenuity: Fixed an issue causing Level 10 Bonus to break reload on any non-heat weapon.\n\n\\- Pressure Point: Fixed an issue where Level 10 Bonus triggered twice on Mod Activation.\n\n\\- Weaponlord: Fixed description of Primary Effect.\n\n\\- Slayer: Increased Damage Bonus from 20% to 25%.\n\n\u00a0**|Trinkets|** \n\n\\- Mist Step: \u00a0Fixed an issue that caused certain weapons to disappear.\n\n\\- Birthright of the Lost: Applies EXPOSED to enemies in a 3m AOE on any Perfect Dodge trigger. \n\n\\- Birthright of the Lost: EXPOSE no longer applies to self on self-triggered Perfect Dodge.\n\n\\- Jester\u2019s Bell: Increased Duration from 15s to 20s.\n\n\\- Kinetic Shield Exchanger: Increased Mod Generation from 20% to 30%.\n\n\\- Stoneshaper\u2019s Chisel: Effect properly remains after after traveling.\n\n\\-

from -65% to -50%.\n\n\\- Burden of the Audacious: Fixed interaction with Burden of the Divine.\n\n\\- Burden of the Follower: Increased Mod Generation from 25% to 30%.\n\n\\- Burden of the Mesmer:

was stacking with Base Damage Bonus.\n\n\\- Shadow of Misery: Increased Status Damage Bonus from 15% to 20%.\n\n\\- Shock Device: Increased Shock Bonus from 20% to 25%.\n\n\\- Talisman of the Sun: Increased Fire Bonus from 20% to 25%.\n\n**|Relics|** \n\n\\- Constrained Heart: Recasting properly refreshes BULWARK stacks.\n\n\\- Broken Heart: No longer causes long black screen after death while equipped.\n\n## \u00a0--|Enemies|-- \n\n\\- Fixed an issue where Bloodless Heir Aberration would focus on entirely on summons.\n\n\\- Fixed an issue where the Kiln enemy could shoot through some walls.\n\n\\- Fixed an issue where Tal Ratha\u2019s Weapon phantom for Roll Attack was incorrect.\n\n\\- Fixed an issue where some enemies would remain inactive during Shrewd fight.\n\n\\- Fixed an

        "content": "*Updated 2024-04-07; see change log in the comments*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis post is intended to give a broad overview to newcomers to the dedicated handheld emulation device scene who may not know what's reasonable to expect at what price point.  Something that can be counterintuitive to newcomers is that how hard or easy a system is to emulate doesn't always track 1:1 with how powerful we think it is.  We tend to think of the PS1, Saturn, and N64 as being contemporaries and roughly equal in power, for example, but in reality PS1 can run pretty well on a potato, N64 is trickier and needs more power than most budget devices can provide to run the entire catalog really well, and Saturn is notoriously difficult to run well and is stuck in the \"may be able to run some games\" category on many otherwise capable devices.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you're a newbie that's been linked here, consider watching [this video by Retro Game Corps](https://youtu.be/fWrPCeFXv1s?si=WkdkkHpPH2TlB0Ae), a popular YouTuber and reviewer around these parts.  He goes over some of his favorite devices of 2023 in various categories, and while I don't agree with all of his picks and others have become outdated very quickly, it can be useful to see what some of these devices look like in the hand.  Links in this post are mostly to RGC video reviews or setup guides of these devices.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll that said, I've sorted various consoles you might want to emulate and various devices you might try to emulate them on into four broad \"tiers\":\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tier 1:  PS1 and Below\n\n* **Price:**  $40-$140\n* **Systems That Should Run Fine:**  NES, GB, GBC, Genesis / Megadrive, SNES, GBA, PS1\n* **Systems that \"may\" be able to run \"some\" games:**  Dreamcast, DS, N64, PSP, Saturn\n* **Chips to Look Out For:**  JZ4770, RK3326, RK3566, Allwinner H700, Allwinner A133Plus\n* **Devices to Consider:**  [R36S](https://youtu.be/1JazW_Rf0Ko?si=UTtuFZfahTEr87-5), [Miyoo Mini+](https://youtu.be/PfclsJzeyr0?si=5Z2tGGXV24hEirU3), [Powkiddy RGB10 Max 3](https://youtu.be/PVxSdVQwQ6s?si=WXZzvuNP7bGIK-A0), [Powkiddy RGB30](https://youtu.be/KTb6ik1Eb40?si=EAA3JETEyipx2LdC)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this price point, consider watching [this broad overview comparing several standout devices](https://youtu.be/6UGr42nOv54?si=GXW7hZLyHl5J9YCE) under $100 in more detail than I'm able to hit here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI could easily have included a dozen more devices in the \"to consider\" section; there are a LOT of devices in this general tier, with lots of little differences in form factor, feature set, etc.  There are also a lot of older devices running the JZ4770 or RK3326 chips that are technically outdated, but if you're happy sticking with PS1 / SNES and below, they're still perfectly good and may have advantages such as a particular form factor you're looking for that newer more powerful devices don't have.  They may also be available on sale or lightly used for cheaper than newer devices.  Note that JZ4770 and comparable chips may struggle with a handful of the absolute hardest-to-run SNES and PS1 titles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe newer RK3566 chipset and comparable Allwinner chipsets won't quite get you all the way to \"just-works, no hassle\" performance of N64 or any of the other systems in the \"some\" category, but they're not much more expensive (and may even be cheaper depending on what sales are going on and shipping costs to your part of the world).  I've listed the \"some\" systems in rough ascending order of how hard they are to run, but it's going to vary a lot depending on the individual game you're trying to play.  On N64, for example, Mario Kart 64 is a pretty easy game to run and will probably run fine on the RK3566 (I've had decent results on the RK3326), but Goldeneye or Conker's Bad Fur Day will probably not be playable.  Some N64 games run better or worse on different emulator apps or Retroarch cores, so you may be able to experiment with different options and/or enable frame skip to get some medium-weight games playable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKeep in mind that the PSP runs in 16:9, and most devices in this tier have 3.5\" 4:3 screens.  Even lighter PSP games that run okay performance-wise will not look good when letterboxed or stretched on such a small screen with such a drastic aspect ratio mismatch.  Keep in mind also that devices in this tier may or may not have touchscreens, which may limit what Nintendo DS games you can play even where performance is not a concern.  Most also have only one 4:3 screen, requiring you to use a hotkey to switch which DS screen you're viewing, further limiting what games you can usefully play.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost devices in this tier run Linux-based firmware.  Setup is usually very easy: download the firmware image, flash it to an SD card, drag and drop your ROM and BIOS files, and you're done.  Some devices, such as the Anbernic RG353V, RG353P, and RG353M, can dual-boot into Android.  This will give you access to different emulator apps that may be able to run some systems, especially N64, slightly better.  I personally don't consider this feature super worth it because the price on those devices starts to overlap with more powerful dedicated Android devices in the next tier.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tier 2:  PSP and Below\n\n* **Price:**  $100-$150\n* **Systems That Should Run Fine:**  everything from Tier 1,  Dreamcast, DS, N64, PSP\n* **Systems that \"may\" be able to run \"some\" games:**  Saturn, GameCube, PS2, Wii, 3DS, Vita, Switch\n* **Chips to Look Out For:**  T610, T618, Dimensity D900, Snapdragon 845\n* **Devices to Consider:** [Retroid Pocket 2S](https://youtu.be/lKbgiyEr9JY?si=LraNbvCA2HFA8z5Y), [Anbernic RG405M](https://youtu.be/BD0ab1gr4gM?si=0bpSYZv9YiJGufjv), [Retroid Pocket 4 Base](https://youtu.be/1rsZGK5zxCM?si=ZF3PiECFICQApx6b)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce again, there are a lot more devices I could have listed under \"devices to consider,\" including several older devices that are still perfectly good, but have largely been eclipsed by newer devices offering more power or better build quality at a similar price point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe vast majority of devices in this tier run Android, which will require a much more involved setup process than the predominantly Linux-based handhelds in Tier 1.  Where Linux-based firmwares typically have all of the emulator apps preinstalled and preconfigured, Android-based devices typically require the user to manually install and configure each emulator app individually.  Expect a greater learning curve, but if you want good performance on systems that struggle in previous tiers like N64 and PSP, that's kind of the price of entry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDevices in this tier have a mix of 4:3 and 16:9 screens in various sizes.  Although PSP should run between pretty good and fantastic from a performance perspective, keep in mind that if you have a 4:3 device, 16:9 PSP games may display too small or distorted to be a very good experience.  Keep in mind also that when playing DS and 3DS games on 4:3 devices, you will need to use a hotkey to switch screens.  16:9 devices will give you more flexibility for displaying both 3/DS screens at once, but smaller screens may limit how useful it is to try to display both screens side-by-side.  Most Saturn games should run just fine at native resolution in this tier, but I still listed it as a \"may / some\" system because it's a notoriously tricky system to emulate, some games may still experience problems, and I haven't tested it at all on any of my own devices.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMuch like N64 and PSP in the previous category, PS2 and GameCube performance is going to be very spotty in this tier.  Many games will run, but expect to experience noticeable performance problems with many titles, to need to do a lot of tinkering with performance hacks and advanced emulator settings, and to deal with the fact that your favorite game may just plain not run well no matter what you do.  I would caution the reader, when looking at video reviews of older devices such as the Ayn Odin 1 Lite and Pro, to consider the date they were reviewed.  Newer devices (see the next tier below) have changed the landscape sufficiently that devices that were once considered as good as it gets for 6th-gen performance are now considered middling at best.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are community-run spreadsheets that purport to tell you what you can expect from various games on various chipsets / devices, but I try to caution people to take them with a grain of salt.  These spreadsheets are crowdsourced with very little oversight.  Anyone can submit an entry; there is no requirement that you play a certain amount of the game or, frankly, that you know what you're talking about at all.  I've seen several entries that were clearly added by someone who ran around the first area for fifteen minutes and called it a day, as well as some that are just plain misinformation by any measure.  These spreadsheets can be a useful tool if you're looking for suggestions for what advanced settings to try tweaking, but they're dangerous as a buying guide.  There are also lots of \"footage roundup\" videos on YouTube, some more trustworthy, some less, showing various games running on a device.  Keep in mind that it's easy to cherrypick footage from the smoothest-running sections, and that the cycle skip settings necessary to get some games running at full speed / frame rate can introduce so much input lag that even though a game looks great on video, it feels terrible to actually play.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a rule of thumb, if you're planning on buying a device in this tier and you want to try GameCube or PS2 on it, I'd ask yourself: if it turns out that your favorite GCN / PS2 games won't run well, will you regret your purchase?  If the answer is yes, I strongly urge you to move on to the next tier.  Yes, they're more expensive, but it's cheaper to buy one device that will actually do what you want it to do than to continually buy multiple devices that are only incremental upgrades over the devices you already own.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSwitch performance is even iffier at this tier; expect only the absolute lightest Switch games to run acceptably, mostly indie and 2D games.  3DS is generally considered somewhat harder to run than PS2 and somewhat easier than Switch, but results will vary greatly depending on the individual game, and as with DS, may be limited by the device's screen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand, systems like PS1, Dreamcast, N64, and PSP really shine in this tier.  Many of the devices in this tier feature high definition displays and enough processing power to dramatically upscale these systems.  Playing PS1 games at 4x upscale (which equates to just under 1080p) on a 6\" screen makes those old games look almost like an HD remaster, it's honestly kind of magical.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tier 3:  Finally, 6th Gen\n\n* **Price:**  $200-$450\n* **Systems That Should Run Fine:**  everything from Tiers 1 and 2, Saturn, GameCube, PS2, Wii, 3DS\n* **Systems that \"may\" be able to run \"some\" games:**  Vita, Switch\n* **Chips to Look Out For:**  Unisoc T820, Dimensity 1100, Dimensity 1200, Snapdragon 8 Gen 2\n* **Devices to Consider:** [Anbernic RG556](https://youtu.be/AFUu3MYQ7NI?si=a2RxZOERTj-A2sW9), [Retroid Pocket 4 Pro](https://youtu.be/iCWn9U8HHHc?si=nqPBRDZaXGIcTyG_),  [Ayn Loki Zero](https://youtu.be/1PyQGY7TUEU?si=ZucXNU_p_TL-W2ya), [Ayn Odin 2](https://youtu.be/8T7smkAG4zA?si=T3bYO_9nBx0kh7ME)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPerformance begins to vary wildly in this tier.  While everything listed above should run the vast majority of PS2 and GameCube games very well at at least native resolution and usually 1.5x-2x upscale or more, there can be a pretty big difference in experience between dual-booting into JELOS to get 6th-gen games running decently on the x86-based Ayn Loki Zero, determining exactly how high you can afford to push upscaling on a per-game basis on the Unisoc T820-based Anbernic RG556, and running virtually everything with all the bells and whistled maxed out on the SD8Gen2-based Ayn Odin 2.  So be sure to do your homework and know what you're getting for your money, because not all Tier 3 devices are created equal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSaturn emulation should be much more doable in this tier, but due to the state of the software, may require a certain amount of tinkering and/or switching between emulators and cores to get some games running smoothly and without glitches.  Similarly, on Android-based devices which are the vast majority of this tier, the state of PS2 emulation is held back by the fact that the only PS2 emulator worth mentioning, AetherSX2, is no longer under active development by its original creator.  While the vast majority of games will run more or less fine, some outliers will require some amount of tweaking to run properly, and it's possible that a small number of games will have problems that simply can't be fixed until/unless some other equally talented developer takes up the challenge of bringing PS2 emulation to Android.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNintendo Switch emulation is still in the very early stages, and while devices like the Odin 2 theoretically have the power to handle it well, the software is not yet mature enough that you can sell your Switch console and rely only on emulation.  Some games will run well, others will be \"compromised but playable,\" and upwards of 40% of the library just plain won't work at all.  You'll need to futz with GPU drivers, you may need to test different games on different emulator apps (there are a couple major ones in various states of development or abandonment), Tears of the Kingdom probably won't run well no matter what you do, QoL features like save states and in-game menus may not be implemented, there may be strange graphical glitches or crashing, and in general, you have to be comfortable with a fair amount of tinkering and troubleshooting and prepare for the possibility of disappointment.  There are multiple teams working on improving Switch emulation and the scene is constantly evolving, so it's something to keep checking back on, but that's the situation at the time of this writing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe state of Playstation Vita emulation is even rougher; even on devices that theoretically have the power to run it, many games are just plain not compatible with the currently-available emulation software.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile this tier should handle many if not most Wii games fine from a performance standpoint, expect to require extensive per-game configuration to make any Wii game that relies on motion controls playable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's also worth noting that while high-end Android devices are theoretically powerful enough to run other systems, there is no emulation software currently available on Android for non-Switch, non-Vita post-PS2 systems such as OG Xbox, PS3, Wii U, Xbox 360, etc, and no reason to believe they will become available anytime soon.  There are a couple major Windows emulators aimed at bringing emulated PC games to Android in various stages of development, but so far they are very much for tinkerers, not easy turnkey solutions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tier 4:  Steam Deck and Beyond\n\n* **Price:**  $350-$1000+\n* **Systems That Should Run Fine:** everything from Tiers 0-3, Wii U\n* **Systems that \"may\" be able to run \"some\" games:**  Vita, OG Xbox, PS3, Xbox 360, Switch\n* **Devices to Consider:** [Steam Deck](https://youtu.be/BBf15Z2xoiY?si=4sQ4Qfo5jTi6aslu), [ROG Ally](https://youtu.be/cEvLOM3_lkY?si=0Z29OgGcSMVv5ruC), many others I don't know enough about to recommend\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Just get a Steam Deck\" has become something of a meme around here, because for a long time it was the only option for really good handheld PS2 performance, and it's still the cheapest device that can handle a lot of systems that just plain aren't available on Android such as Wii U.  For the price (especially now that factory refurbished and lightly used units are starting to become available), it's hard to beat as a value proposition.  Some people dislike how large and heavy it is, and depending on what you're trying to do with it, battery life can be a limiting factor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn this tier we've moved away from Android.  The Steam Deck runs a proprietary Linux-based OS called SteamOS out of the box and can dual-boot into Windows and/or Batocera Linux.  Most other devices in this tier will ship with Windows and may also be able to dual-boot into Batocera.  This is good because it brings compatibility with a lot of emulator software that plain doesn't exist on Android as well as a huge library of PC games, but bad because we're using the less-efficient x86 processor architecture, which means that battery life takes a big dip in this tier.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrankly this is the point where I'm a lot less knowledgeable.  I own a Steam Deck and I love it, but although I've got it set up for emulation, in practice I use it almost exclusively for what it was designed for, which is light to medium PC gaming.  While there are a lot of devices more powerful than the Steam Deck and/or smaller / lighter than it is, they all kind of run together in my mind because they're typically much more expensive than the Deck is, and I already had a hard enough time justifying a $400 toy to myself.

        "content": "Hi everyone, as this sub continues to grow\u2014along with the market and corresponding awareness for retrogaming handhelds\u2014we're always looking for ways to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. For example, although we don't get too many memes, they tend to be divisive when they are posted. However based on the mostly positive poll feedback we got around memes, these will remain unmoderated.\n\nBut, after some debate we thought it prudent to add a 'Low Effort Posting' rule, which would allow us to remove any post that is lacking in substance or fails to elicit engagement from the community. A copy/pasted meme template is a good example of such a post. But this could also be a 'drive by' post that is just an image, a single sentence without adequate context, or an unsubstantiated rumor. This could even be a question that shows clear lack of any prior research and is low value to everyone except perhaps the asker.\n\nThis is a bit of an open-ended rule to enforce but it will allow us to point to a reason to take down a post with poor value that doesn't otherwise run counter to any other rules.\n\nWe ask that everyone please exercise some restraint around reporting posts that seem like they are uninformed or posed without doing prior search. We have a lot of new users who can be intimated by the choices available and may have tried to find an answer but feel overwhelmed by information. Please exercise patience with these users, refer them back to our stickied post [https://www.reddit.com/r/SBCGaming/comments/1bl9oky/which\\_device\\_is\\_right\\_for\\_me\\_if\\_youre\\_new\\_to\\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SBCGaming/comments/1bl9oky/which_device_is_right_for_me_if_youre_new_to_the/) or use the !remind function to do so automatically. We can't police every such post and even if it seems like an obvious answer to you, it may not be to someone else.\n\nAlso one point of clarity: we do have some high-profile contributors who will post a review or how-to video with little or no written context. We encourage you to always add a text description for SEO/context purposes, but such a post would obviously not be considered a 'drive by'.\n\nWe'll let this rule play out for a few weeks and see if it helps, your feedback is obviously welcome.\n\n\n\n",

Even if said interaction is \"I have to actively zone to keep my opponent away\", that typically carries more risk than playing keepaway in a game that isn't really designed to prevent disengaging.\n\nAnd top players might be able to capitalise on taking space, but honestly before top level it feels very easy to play extremely defensively and take back the space if your opponent isn't 100% airtight with a well timed roll through your opponent, or jump back to top plat, etc. Even for top players there is a reason Sonic is top tier and that's because spin dash makes it easy to swap sides (by being + on shield) so you can keep playing defensively forever.\n\nIt's fundamentally tied to the core concepts of Smash too, so I really don't see how you can solve that easily.

    "CVT Fluids: A Consolidated Thread": {
        "title": "CVT Fluids: A Consolidated Thread",
        "content": "Hello r/subaru,\n\nWe've been seeing a big influx of questions about CVT fluids lately, with an average of 1-2 threads per day for about the past month. So, I've decided to make one consolidated thread about it. Future question posts about CVT fluid will be deferred to this thread. In response, I want to get as much information as possible into a single place, so users like yourself can make as informed of a choice as possible.\n\n------\n\n#What is a CVT?\n\nLet's start with the basics here. The Continuously-Variable Transmission, or CVT, does not work the same way as a \"conventional\" automatic transmission which you may have been used to previously. So let's start our journey with a conventional auto trans.\n\nIn an automatic transmission, there are a series of planetary gearsets. These gearsets will be surrounded by a number of hydraulically-actuated clutches. The hydraulic fluid inside of the clutches are controlled by the transmission computer, through a mechanism of valves that are controlled by solenoids. The solenoids and valves all exist in a component known as a \"valve body.\" As the TCM commands certain valves to open or close, different clutches will be engaged which subsequently will control elements of the planetary gearsets. This is how your conventional automatic transmission achieves changing gear ratios.\n\nIn a CVT, by contrast, the gear ratio mechanism is a set of cone-shaped sheaves or \"variators\" with a belt (or in Subaru's case, chain) run between them. Instead of the valve body controlling clutch packs, it instead varies the fluid pressure inside of both sheaves, such that the cone surfaces can get closer together or further apart. Because the thickness of the chain doesn't change, by opening the sheaves, the chain will ride down lower into the cone shapes, thus being on a smaller diameter. Because the chain doesn't change length either, there needs to be a corresponding change to the opposite change to get closer together to make the chain ride on a larger-diameter part of the sheave. Thus, the transmission computer achieves different gearing ratios by adjusting the gap of both sheaves in tandem. If you're having trouble visualizing this, [here is a good animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEq5_b4LWNY) explaining the motion.\n\nBefore someone interjects, yes there are clutch sets inside of a CVT as well. Specifically in a Subaru transmission, there are 3 relevant ones; there is a planetary set inside the powerflow for your Drive or Reverse functionality; there is a Lock-Up clutch inside the torque converter, and in most cases there is a Multi-Plate Transfer clutch for your all-wheel drive \"center differential\" function. These functions are more-or-less identical to their equivalent components in a conventional automatic transmission.\n\n#OK but what about the fluid?\n\nThere are quite a few differences between CVT fluid and conventional ATF. Part of these differences are how the fluid is used in the transmission, and part of the difference is because of what the transmission does to the fluid.\n\nIn a conventional transmission, you have many clutch packs actuating whenever the car is changing gear ratios. Just like in a manual transmission clutch, or like your brake pads, every time there is slip between the clutch material and the friction surface, a little bit of that clutch material will wear off. In a conventional transmission, this means that over time, that clutch material will begin to accumulate in the fluid, which gives it a burnt smell and a brown tinge. By contrast, a CVT does not use as many clutches inside of it, and as such, clutch material contamination is drastically reduced inside of the CVT fluid.\n\nAnother main difference has to do with the fluid pressure inside of the transmission. While a conventional auto only needs fluid pressures around 150-250 PSI to operate the clutch packs, a CVT requires much higher line pressures of 650-850 PSI in order to keep enough \"squeeze\" force on the sheaves to hold the chain. The CVT fluid also functions as a friction modifier between the chain and sheave, wherein it helps the chain \"grip\" on the otherwise-smooth pulley surface. Because of this, CVT fluid is very specific about its chemical properties and should not be substituted for any other fluids.\n\n\n#So... should I service the fluid?\n\nLet's start this by looking back at what a conventional automatic transmission requirement would be. [Here is the service manual schedule from a 2010 Forester.](https://imgur.com/o15NYKr) I've highlighted ATF for you, but basically it only says \"Inspect [and replace as necessary] every 30k miles.\" Okay, but what does it mean by Inspect? The service manual has [this inspection procedure](https://imgur.com/ndrdp6T) for checking the level. It also has [this condition table](https://imgur.com/ZTk88cO) listed for what to do when you find a condition-based failure. I've highlighted the \"thick and varnish\" section because this would be the clutch wear condition I described above. *Generally speaking,* your average Subaru 4EAT or 5EAT will have noticeable signs of discoloration every ~60k miles.\n\nSo what does Subaru say about CVT fluid then? Well for comparison, let's look at a 2018 Forester service manual. [Here is the service schedule,](https://imgur.com/dC5EmY2) which  you can see has an identical \"Inspect [and replace as necessary]\" every 30k miles. As for an inspection process, it only offers [this inspection procedure](https://imgur.com/pC3RDem) and [the same condition table](https://imgur.com/WN4EyoS) as before. \n\nBecause the schedule and condition checks are basically the same for both service manuals, it would be very easy to assume the fluids needs the same replacement schedule -- and I strongly suspect this is the driving force behind so many CVT fluid recommendations. However, if we read this again, remember that we only need to address the fluid *if if fails one of the condition checks*, and that the most common failure condition in a conventional automatic transmission largely no longer happens in a CVT. It is because of this that your Owner's Manual probably describes the transmission fluid as a \"lifetime fluid.\"\n\n#What about what other countries say?\n\nA claim I very often see made in threads about CVT fluid is that \"Country XYZ requires fluid changes every X miles!\" I want to nip this in the bud now, because it's not true. Now because I work in the US, I cannot access foreign service manuals, but I can get ahold of owner's manuals, so here are a few examples:\n\n[here's a UK 2018 forester owner's manual](https://imgur.com/xkJgOkz) ([link](https://subarucore.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/12140046/Forester-2018-Owners-manual-1.pdf))\n\n[Here's a n Australian 2020 forester/XV schedule.](https://imgur.com/iFkSian) Subaru Australiia [has .pdf copies here of warranty booklets.](https://www.subaru.com.au/owners/warranty).\n\n[here's a Japan 2018 forester's owner's manual](https://imgur.com/dgpDL2P) ([link](https://www.subaru.jp/afterservice/tnst/forester/pdf/A8230JJ-G.pdf?downLoaditemRadio=&downLoaditemRadio=pdf%2FA8230JJ-G.pdf)) and it says in the bottom row there: \u4ea4\u63db\u6642\u671f  | \u7121\u4ea4\u63db which translates as Replacement time | No replacement\n\nHere is a 2020 WRX owner's manual from Japan, straight off Subaru.jp: https://www.subaru.jp/afterservice/tnst/wrx/pdf/A1760JJ-A.pdf\n\n[pg. 465 is the service information for transmission/differential/etc gear oils.](https://imgur.com/hwlL95X) The 3rd section is for CVT fluid:\n\n>\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u30df\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3 \u30d5\u30eb\u30fc\u30c9\n\n> \u4f7f\u7528\u30aa\u30a4\u30eb \u30b9\u30d0\u30eb\u30cf\u30a4\u30c8\u30eb\u30afCVT\u30d5\u30eb\u30fc\u30c9 \u30ea\u30cb\u30a2\u30c8\u30ed\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u7528\n\n> \u898f\u5b9a\u91cf \u7d0412.4L\n\n>\u4ea4\u63db\u6642\u671f \u7121\u4ea4\u63db\n\nTranslated:\n\n>Transmission Fluid\n\n>Used oil Subaru high torque CVT fluid\nfor Lineartronic\n\n>Prescribed amount about 12.4L\n\n>[**Replacement time No replacement**](https://imgur.com/e8162c1)\n\nThe only subaru branch AFAIK that [does list a required CVT fluid interval](https://imgur.com/OMfHvgm) is Canada, ([soruce](https://www.subaru.ca/WebPage.aspx?WebSiteID=282&WebPageID=18541)) where if I'm being honest the way it's written in their maintenance guide makes it seem like they just never changed it from ATF-era cars, where Canada also listed replacement as necessary every 100k km. (It only refers to \"transmission oil\" and does not specifically mention CVT fluid, but everywhere else differentiates the two. It also does not differentiate manual vs. automatic transmission fluid, like everyone else does.) There, it's listed as a 100k km service item.\n\n#that didn't answer the question though.\n\nYou're right, I didn't. The long answer is that you should have your fluid inspected by a technician familiar with Subaru CVTs, and if deemed necessary, you should replace the fluid with genuine Subaru fluid as required by your particular model. If following the conventional wisdom from ATF-era cars also makes you feel more comfortable, then defer to Canada's schedule and plan to perform a fluid service at your 100k km (60k miles) service.\n\n#A quick note about \"Severe Usage Schedule\"\n\nAnother common discussion point I see brought up is the Severe Usage schedule. I largely blame the confusion for this on Subaru, who have written this in a hard-to-understand way in the owner's manuals. However, a 2010-2014 Legacy/Outback service manual [has the best representation of the severe usage shceudle.](https://imgur.com/lJHNnJk) As you can see, the only time Severe applies to your CVTF is if you \"repeatedly tow\" with the vehicle. This guidance has not changed with newer cars, however the new way it's written [is confusing to read.](https://imgur.com/Sc4o1lw)  (CVT fluid is maintenance item 12; see above where it shows this as Note 4.)\n\n#A last quick note on Differential Fluid\n\nJust want to quickly touch on this one. Your Subaru has separate, distinct fluid for the front differential. While you can see from the above service schedule that the guidance for its fluid is functionally the same, differential oil gets contaminated in a completely different way. Because a differential is basically all metal-on-metal wear of gear teeth, especially after break-in your fluid will get dark and metallic very rapidly. This is normal. [Here's my personal Crosstrek at 19k miles.](https://youtu.be/etBBiMih10I) **In my own personal experience,** I would recommend replacing your gear oils at 30k miles, but the fluid condition will stay good for longer after the initial change, such that it can go every 60k thereafter.\n\n#On fluid changes and failures.\n\nI just want to quick touch on ways that we see CVT failures at the dealer and how it relates to fluid. By far the most common issue we'll run across, is from the \"small\" CVT, the TR580, which is paired with any of the 2.0L or 2.5L naturally-aspirated engines. Typically somewhere in the 100-150k mile range, a failure in the valve body, usually for the Torque Converter Lockup Duty solenoid, is relatively common. This is a failure in the electronics side of the solenoid, and thus has no relation to the CVT fluid; as such, changing or not changing the fluid has no real bearing on the likelihood of this failure occuring. The second issue we see, the most terminal one, is called Chain Slip. [Here, at 0:23, is a fantastic example of severe chain slip.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyYbt1Zt1H0) Chain Slip can develop from a variety of causes, but generally is the result of a lack of fluid pressure squeezing the sheaves against the chain; when this happens, the chain essentially does a burnout on the sheaves. This leaves a wear groove in the sheave face, and makes chain slip much more likely to occur whenever the same gear ratio is used. There are some conditions of fluid degradation that can increase the risk of slip; these largely result from fluid overheating, which degrades the additives that help provide friction between the sheaves and chain.\n\n-------\n\nHopefully there is enough info in here for you to decide for yourself if or when you would like to change your fluid.

That said, I'm probably going to follow your advice and get mine done around 75k just to be safe.  I'm curious about how much fluid was actually lost from the leak in your case, though.  A $400 estimate for a CVT fluid change seems steep, especially if you're just getting a drain/fill.  \n"

But at the heart of it all, we've been the place for posting, discussing, and laughing at drama on reddit. Sometimes the drama is major (such as the API protests) or silly/strange [(like baptizing the dead)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/17975oc/op_in_rgenealogy_laments_his_evil_sister_deleted/). \n\nWe introduce and retire rules in an attempt to maintain a certain level of quality. The \"surplus popcorn\" rule has been one of them. However, it can be confusing for users to understand and hard for mods to enforce.\n\n**As of today, the \"surplus popcorn\" rule is no more.** Drama will no longer be judged based on its subject matter being overdone. The rules about biased posts, and especially about \"callout posts\" will still apply. So long as you're actually linking arguing/conflict, and not merely pointing out shitty bigoted comments, your post will stay.\n\n**We are also relaxing rules for commenting**. \"Off topic grandstanding\" is no longer a rule. (Most of the reports we get for this are people using it as a super downvote, or trying to get mods to babysit their argument with another user). The \"insults/flamewars/flamebait\" rule is changing, from being removed on sight to being removed on mod discretion. (For similar reasons as before: users will get into petty arguments with each other and then begin reporting to get their opponents comments removed. Mods are no longer obligated to remove those comments or to try to maintain a certain level of civility). \n\nWe might bring back these rules in the future if there is a need. \n\n# State of the Subreddit\n\nHow do you feel about the state of the subreddit right now? What can mods and the community do to make this an active, thriving place with good quality popcorn?\n\nSome obvious suggestions are making the rules easier to understand (done!) and adding a ton of new moderators (coming soon!), but we want your thoughts and suggestions.

Pretty simple.\n\nThe reason I'm making this post is because 15 users (mainly accounts with less than 10 karma on Reddit) have been banned in the last day due to them spamming their referral code.\n\nIf you have any questions, please let me know.\n\nThanks.",

I was under the impression that the miles lasted forever but they don't, my 1000 mile expire in like 6 months. It's almost wasteful to acquire thousands of charger miles that will expire. I live fairly close (less than 5 miles) from a supercharger but have only used it once for 80 miles, so far.",

She then started sending me messages saying I'd annoyed her and then continued to do the horse riding without following her and we got in a massive argument via text.

Keep taking your meds and using the rosemary oil consistently. It might be helpful to consult a dermatologist or trichologist for a more professional opinion. They can give you a better assessment and suggest any additional treatments or lifestyle changes that might help. \n"

When I started playing Pearl and haven were out of the pool.\n\nBefore the game even started I said over voice \"hey guys I haven't played this map yet bare with me\"\n\nThe Rayna on the team bailed in the first round so it was a 4v5 all game. We started on attack and we were even all the way up to the switch. At these point our Sova had 30+ kills and the Jett had 13 kills and I had 9 but I didn't get anymore because I somehow defended the wrong site everytime and because I still don't know the map well my rotation was slow\n\nNow the Jett decided they want to start talking shit. \n\nIn ranked I understand you grind all day and now someone is playing bad and it's going to lower your rank but unrated are you so unstable that you can't have fun when you are losing a no stakes game where people are clearly trying to learn.\n\nAlso I am pretty sure my Sova was cheating I'm not sure how but he always pinged exactly where the enemy was every round. A couple times and I can call it good game sense but evertime was a bit suspicious.\n\nSorry to rant but I just find it crazy that my unrated matches have been more toxic than my ranked matches.

        "title": "r/ValveIndex New User Megathread",
        "content": "Welcome to the r/ValveIndex community! This thread serves as a starting point for new users and those considering joining. We'll cover key topics to help you get started.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n## Getting Started with Valve Index\n\n\n\n### What is the Valve Index?\n\n\n\n- The Valve Index is a high-end virtual reality headset developed and manufactured by Valve.\n\n- Known for its high-fidelity visuals at launch, precise tracking, and quality audio, it's a popular choice among VR enthusiasts, especially for Full Body Tracking users.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n## Should I buy the Index in 2023?\n\n\n\n**Short Answer**: Probably not. The Index, while competent, is somewhat dated.\n\n**Long Answer**: It depends on various factors. Let's explore:\n\n\n\n\n\n### Cons of the Valve Index\n\n\n\n- **Visuals**: Resolution of 1440x1600 per eye is low by current standards. Fresnel lenses can cause glare and edge clarity issues.\n\n- **Reliability**: Joystick drift is a common issue.\n\n- **Price**: At $1000 USD, it may not offer the best value. If you can find a good condition refurbished kit or used, this is still a good deal in today's market.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Pros of the Valve Index\n\n\n\n- **SteamVR Integration**: No additional software required.\n\n- **Tracking**: Market-leading tracking capabilities and full-body tracking support (Vive Trackers, Tundra).\n\n- **Audio Quality**: Excellent audio experience with off ear BMRs.\n\n- **Comfort**: Comfortable to wear, despite its weight.\n\n- **Controllers**: Feature finger tracking, useful for social VR.\n\n- **Microphone**: High-quality microphone for clear communication.\n\n\n\n### Ideal Use-Cases for the Valve Index\n\n\n\nBest suited for social VR platforms like VRChat, Resonite, or ChilloutVR. Alternatives like the Bigscreen Beyond or the Quest 3 are also worth considering.\n\n\n\n### What About the Index 2?\n\n\n\nThe Index 2 is unannounced (Deckard pls), and its release is uncertain. You could be waiting a while (Or no time at all!)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n## Decided to buy or Already have an Index?\n\n\n\n### Setting Up Your Valve Index\n\n\n\n- **Space Requirements**: Ensure you have enough space for a safe VR experience. 2x2m is advised as a minimum.\n\n- **Installation**: Follow the setup guide carefully to install the hardware and software.\n\n- **SteamVR**: Learn how to navigate [SteamVR](https://store.steampowered.com/app/250820/SteamVR/), the main platform for using the Index. Grab tools like [OVR Advanced Settings](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1009850/OVR_Advanced_Settings/) and [fpsVR](https://store.steampowered.com/app/908520/fpsVR/).\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n## Community Guidelines and Resources\n\n\n\n- **Guidelines**: Review the community [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/valveindex/wiki/rules/) to ensure a friendly and respectful environment.\n\n\n\n- **Resources**: Check out our [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValveIndex/wiki/index/) for helpful information. Rather chat live? Join the [VR Discord](https://discord.gg/virtualreality)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n## Join the Discussion\n\n\n\nWe encourage you to ask questions, share your experiences, and connect with fellow Index users below.\n\n\n\n---",

        "AI_comment": "I think it's important to note that the Index, despite its flaws, is still a great headset for those who have it and use it regularly. While it might not be the best choice for new buyers, it still offers a solid VR experience for the right user.  It's not \"trash\" as someone said, just a little outdated. \n"

I've heard of this happening a lot, especially with the popularity of container gardening in the city.  It's also sadly common in community gardens, even with security cameras.  I think the police probably won't do much, but like others said, maybe it's worth reporting for the stats.   Maybe try putting up some signs with a picture of the woman, letting her know you're watching?  I wouldn't want to go out and confront her, but I get the feeling she might be more deterred by a sign than a camera.  \n"

        "content": "We\u2019ve seen a massive uptick in reports of comments and posts that do not violate our rules, so we wanted to remind people to review our rules in our side bar before posting or reporting. We appreciate reports as we cannot always capture rule-breaking comments if they\u2019re not flagged by our filters, but some reports lately seem to just be purely over disagreement in opinion, which is abuse of the reporting feature. \n\nJust because someone has a negative opinion of a cast member, a scenario, an episode, etc. does not necessarily mean it\u2019s trolling or hate speech. We know it may be hard to believe, but some people have a minority opinion. Some people genuinely do like cast members such as Sandoval or Schwartz, for example. Just because users post in favor of these cast, for whatever their reasoning is, does not automatically mean it should be reported as trolling. We are aware there is a majority opinion in this sub, but we can\u2019t remove posts simply because it goes against this, provided it does not violate our specified rules. \n\nFor example, calling a cast member slurs or curse words such as a bitch, a hoe, or the like *is* hate speech and should be reported. Baiting users into arguments, mocking users, leaving sarcastic/snarky replies unwarrantedly, name calling *are* examples of trolling and violations of our rules. And just because one user does it does not permit you or others to return it back. Report the violation and move along. \n\nOur fired cast rule has remained the same. Users are permitted to post about Jax, Stassi, and Kristen regarding their time on VPR. We do not permit posts regarding their life currently if it does not directly relate to the show, and any content regarding Jax and Kristen that pertains to their time on The Valley will be denied as The Valley has its own subreddit. \n\nWe spend hours combing through the queue each day. There are 6 moderators for 200,000+ users. Please be patient with us. If your post does not fit our guidelines, removal reasons are provided via comments or modmail. If you have a question, politely contact us to inquire about why it was removed. Reporting the removal reason comments will result in a permanent ban for abuse of the report button. ",

I use a windows 10 HP laptop and haven't updated to the windows 11 software yet. It was fine moments prior and it did not have this annoying pop-up whenever I turned my caps on and off, but now that I've resetted it's been doing it and I don't like it. I can't find any info on how to turn it off either, It's just really bugging me out and super duper annoying. Does anyone know why this happening? Or maybe a solution how to fix it / turn it off?",
        "human_comment": "Since this topic has been getting posted a lot over the past day or so, I'm pinning this one.\n\nThis is not a native Windows feature, so any kind of caps lock indicator is going to be something that is installed on your machine, typically from your computer or keyboard manufacturer. \n\n\nThis appears to be a recent change that HP is pushing out to everyone with their software still installed. The program is \"HP System Event Utility\". You can safely uninstall it. There may be an option in the settings for this program to disable that function without uninstall, but as my machines have not been affected I am relying on 3rd party accounts for details on solutions.",

Do I have to now put money down before they crunch numbers and tell me what interest rate I qualify for? or can they do this before committing to the sale?
