Recently, I experienced a situation where emotions ran high, and a rash reaction seemed imminent. However, I chose to pause and listen before responding.\n\nHere\u2019s the valuable lesson I learned: reacting impulsively often escalates tensions and can lead to regrets later on. By prioritizing understanding and empathy, we not only diffuse immediate tensions but also pave the way for meaningful dialogue and resolution.\n\nWhether it\u2019s a disagreement with a friend, a challenging family dynamic, or a conflict at work, remember this: taking the time to understand the other person's perspective can foster mutual respect and strengthen relationships. It\u2019s a proactive approach that promotes healthier communication and ultimately, a more positive outcome.\n\nSo, next time you find yourself in a heated moment, pause, listen, and respond with understanding. It's a life skill that can make a world of difference in how we navigate conflicts and build meaningful connections.",

I didn\u2019t care that it was rural, I cared that it didn\u2019t rain. It took me a long time to get a job somewhere else. I loved the base mission, I loved the people I worked for, I love the noisy jets. But the town wasn\u2019t ever home and I haven\u2019t missed it once in the 18 months I\u2019ve been gone. If there was any way to keep that job, but do it from a swamp, I\u2019d have done it. \n\nI thought I could feel better if I did a little more nesting, but I wound up buying 6 humidifiers and staying indoors.  \n\nI wanted to love it there, but I would get so depressed just being outside.

But what I've found is that even in people who have chosen to live in a certain place, everyone hates where they live. You can even google \"why does everyone hate where they live\" and find multiple articles about this exact thing.\n\n\nThis isn't about accepting a place that doesn't align with you when circumstances allow you to leave. It's about looking up and around you and seeing that there are people who can't or don't want to leave who are actively working to make their city/town a better place. There is shitty things about every place, every where. But when you start to look behind the scenes, you might just find like minded people trying to make their city a better place to live.\u00a0",

It just falls out of the sky! Enough to form freshwater seas and curse you with a lawn that needs mowing every 5 days.\n\nSeriously though, I left the area at 18 and spent my 20s working on the road, doing HVAC and plumbing wherever the money was flowing. Any time there would be a major disaster, be it flooding, fires, tornado, hurricanes, earthquake.... I'd head that direction and start making calls to line up work/network with other money chasing tradies. Once the work dried up I'd move on to the next prospect that came along. Saw a lot of the country and never found one that got it's hooks in me, despite trying to fake it a couple different cities. \n\nEventually I stopped to visit my folks one Autumn and never left. There's places that I really love visiting, but no place I've found competes big-picture. Being fewer than 100 miles away from Cleveland, Columbus, and Pittsburgh means there's not a lot you can't find. When it comes to things like zoos, sports, and museums it means you have 3 to choose from. \n\nThe Cleveland Museum of Art punches WAY above it's weight, it's impressed me time and time again. \n\nRegarding Pittsburgh specifically: \n\n1) Get used to taking the wrong exit and ending up 3 bridges away from your intended destination before getting turned around. It's not a failing, it's Pittsburgh.\n\n2)Check out the national aviary and say \"hi\" to the toucans for me\n\n3)Spend $4 round trip and ride the Duquesne Incline with your husband some evening when the weather's nice.

I grew up in Buffalo during a time when it'd been in the dumps for decades (it's only recently started to have a resurgence in the last decade). I think the culture comes in part from the blue-collar heritage, the major mixing of immigrants due to the original building of the Erie Canal (here in Buffalo, at least), and the shared experience of watching a city you live in decline for decades. I think that shapes the worldview of the long-term residents.\n\nOn the negative side, there's a lot of professed hate toward the city.

I\u2019ve lived in Phoenix for over 50 years, and it\u2019s so superior to a cold climate, it\u2019s not even close. Trying to do outdoor activities in the cold is ridiculous. Go outside in warm clothes, start to exert yourself, open your jacket because now you\u2019re sweating. Jacket\u2019s open, but now you\u2019re getting cold. Now you start to get a headache from the cold. It sucks. In the desert, you go out and get blasted by the heat, and that\u2019s as bad as it gets. Keep drinking water, don\u2019t insist on wearing inappropriate clothes, and you\u2019re fine. Also, don\u2019t insist on keeping your residence chilled down to the low 70s or high 60s. That temperature differential is a recipe for migraines and nausea. People in cold climates don\u2019t heat their homes to 80F in the winter for the same reason. As others have noted, it\u2019s not really bad until the temperature hits ~110F. And the dry heat thing is a myth. From mid June until the end of September we have dew points over 55 with temperatures in the 100s.",

If you've lived in Phoenix for 50 years I'd say you don't really have the experience of winter to say it's superior. \n\nI fucking hate life over 95 degrees, give me average temps of 65-75 so I can play soccer, go running, play tennis/volleyball outside. 3 1/2 months with temp over 100 would do me in.

I love the difference between spring with budding trees and flower, the summer heat and greenery, fall's leaves and cool weather, and a snow filled winter. Wearing a light jacket and sitting by the fire pit during the fall when its in the 40s is wonderful, the same goes for wearing cozy clothes and having a hot drink as you watch the snow fall, grilling in the summer, etc.\n\nFor some people, its not a big deal, but for me it is. I want my winters to be in the single digits and full of snow and I want my summers to hit the 90s(even though I hate dealing with the heat I still enjoy it).",

If it\u2019s in direct shot of a vent and you\u2019re in an area not in direct shot of the vent, it will turn off and wait for the cool air to disperse more and then kick on again a bit later. \n\nIf you set it to below where you want it will take longer to reach that temperature at the thermostat meaning more cool air would have dispersed to possibly where you\u2019re lounging. \n\nSo while technically true the A/C flow is the same, or given that you\u2019re standing at the thermostat, not necessarily true for many homes especially ones with poor vent design or closed registers.  \n\nAlso a reminder to make sure ceiling fans are on direction to push air down on you.",
            "This is true on paper with many common systems but untrue in reality for almost every system.\n\nWhether or not your system is multi-stage or variable-flow, even if it\u2019s a simple on-off, the thermal capacity of the building and all its contents must be taken into account along with the air mix rate and the location of the thermostat and its hysteresis logic. It is more than the simple BTU capacity of the system.\n\nSay your room is at 75F. You want it to be 70F, so you turn on your A/C and set it to 70F. The system will cool until the average air temperature at the thermostat is at 70F (maybe 68F for some programming) for some small amount of time then it will cut off. Then, as the walls and furniture and interior structure that are still close to 75F continue to transfer energy into the air and it warms back up, the thermostat will cut the system back on at, for example, 72F. This cycle can happen several times as it approaches your target range asymptotically. Often thermostats are mounted to a wall, which retains heat, and in transients the temperature at the wall boundary is going to lag behind the temperature of the bulk air.\n\nI\u2019m not advocating this, but if you set it at, say, 64F, initially then it forces a greater temperature differential between the ambient air and the latent heat of the mass at the boundaries. Heat transfer will be faster, and the entire system will reach your desired steady-state temperature a little faster.\n\nIt\u2019s not that big a difference, and it\u2019s wasteful from an energy perspective, but it will be faster.

If the time to resoak makes it into the hours territory, you could find the resoaking failing to reach previous levels because sun direction may have changed, it may be evening and thus cooler etc. Of course, the degree of heat soaking depends on the thermal properties of the room, \n\nAlso, while it may not cool the room down faster, if the AC is on you, it certainly cools *you* down faster. Heat transfers more effectively the colder the breeze, as heat transfer is more efficient the larger the difference is between two temps.

            "I\u2019m going to paste my reply elsewhere here:\n\nThis is true on paper with many common systems but untrue in reality for almost every system.\n\nWhether or not your system is multi-stage or variable-flow, even if it\u2019s a simple on-off, the thermal capacity of the building and all its contents must be taken into account along with the air mix rate and the location of the thermostat and its hysteresis logic. It is more than the simple BTU capacity of the system.\n\nSay your room is at 75F. You want it to be 70F, so you turn on your A/C and set it to 70F. The system will cool until the average air temperature at the thermostat is at 70F (maybe 68F for some programming) for some small amount of time then it will cut off. Then, as the walls and furniture and interior structure that are still close to 75F continue to transfer energy into the air and it warms back up, the thermostat will cut the system back on at, for example, 72F. This cycle can happen several times as it approaches your target range asymptotically. Often thermostats are mounted to a wall, which retains heat, and in transients the temperature at the wall boundary is going to lag behind the temperature of the bulk air.\n\nI\u2019m not advocating this, but if you set it at, say, 64F, initially then it forces a greater temperature differential between the ambient air and the latent heat of the mass at the boundaries. Heat transfer will be faster, and the entire system will reach your desired *steady-state* temperature a little faster.\n\nIt\u2019s not that big a difference, and it\u2019s wasteful from an energy perspective, but it will be faster.

And if I turn it up to 74\u00b0, the air coming out is less cold. It\u2019s still cold, but not as cold.\n\nEdit: I just googled this and while I don\u2019t have complete understanding, it looks like lots of cars have a \u201cvariable displacement compressor\u201d for the AC. This allows it to adjust how much load it\u2019s putting on the engine. But it means it can make the coils more or less cold depending on what the temperature is and what\u2019s being called for. So it will, in fact, make the air coming out colder if you turn the temp down lower.\n\nEdit 2: it could also be that the car is mixing the cold AC air with unconditioned air to get the temp right (kind of like a thermostatic valve on a shower mixing hot and cold water to get the right output temp). Maybe different cars do it differently. Maybe the coils never actually get colder or less cold. Idk. The point tho is that in cars, changing the temp being called for actually will cool the car down faster.

            "Regular air cons blow at 100% and turn off once the desired temp is reached \n\nLast I checked when I messed around troubleshooting a mini split, I was able to get different temperatures based on the remote it has. You set a temp like 68 75 or whatever and the processed air blows said temp. It's what makes them so efficient. Because they are variable flow it uses less electricity. It's like a car in the sense that you can burn a bunch of gas giving it 100% throttle, or save a good chunk feathering the petal. \n\nIt's also the reason you don't see them have a liquid line gauge port. Since it's variable flow, the liquid line is always pressured completely differently to a normal unit unless you have the system running at its coldest setting (usually like 60\u00b0 from what I've seen) it's what throws me off with these systems as I can see how high the pressures are with a traditional system but not mini splits",
            "I don\u2019t know the exact algorithm of it but the larger the difference in the current temperature to what you want to set it as, it\u2019ll turn up the fan speed and blow colder air until that difference starts to close up. At 1-2 degree difference, it\u2019ll start to go down into maintenance cooling\n\nI don\u2019t have central cooling or heating, just a heat pump unit with a couple of mini-splits. That\u2019s how they seem to work",
            "If the unit is a variable flow compressor that most mini splits have today, it will blow the 70\u00b0 air that you set it to, and will continue to blow 70 no matter what. The way you are thinking is more like a multi-stage system where the compressor has two speeds, when in high demand it runs on the fastest speed, and when trying to maintain a temperature it runs on the slower speed. Systems will also do this if they have multiple compressors on their condensers",
            "Very true! \n\nBut many people still get confused and drop the temp all the way down thinking they will get maximum air performance most likely because that's how the car aircon works, when in reality it just makes the system run longer. Regular air cons like the single stage ones I work on always run at 100% even if the thermostat goes 1 degrees too hot",

            "I live in Japan, and my AC definitely has stages, so setting it to a lower temp WILL steepen the gradient of stages, so it doesn't take ages to cool down. I don't know if the stages affect power usage of the compressor, it might just be a fan noise thing, but if I set the AC to 24, it will push out air much more slowly, than if I set it to 16. In either case, it ramps down as it approaches the set temperature.\n\nSo, it's quicker to set the AC to 16, then back up to 24, than it is to set it to 24 in the first place. The AC works harder because it thinks it needs to get to a lower temperature in a reasonable time.\n\nThis is a pretty standard feature on the ACs I've seen here.  \nI'm not rich, anyway, else I'd be living in a tax-haven lol.\n\nThat said, my toilet also automatically opens as you approach and has a robotic arse-washing mechanism, so I suppose it might be a \"Japan thing\"",

Because the material has inertia, it won't immediately jump to the overshoot level, it takes its time, and then the reverse polarity will stop it.

AC=control voltage, crystals turning=the air getting cool, the thermostat=desired end point. You set the desired end point(thermostat) over or under the point you want to get to, so the voltage(AC) will work longer and all the crystals in the screen(temp of air) are getting to the desired point. When you set 18 degrees, only around the thermostat will you have 18 degrees, not in the whole room. So you make the AC go lower and then manually turn it off. You overshoot.

            "> To a point though.  Maybe setting it to 65 vs 67 bumps up the fan but lower than that and it doesn't matter\n\nNo, I\u2019m saying it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the fan (or that there\u2019s more to it than just the fan blowing more). \n\nIn my car, the fan speed and temperature setting are independent. Without changing the fan speed at all, I can make the air coming out of the vents more or less cold by changing the temperature being called for. It has nothing to do with fan speed, in that case. \n\nAlso, on the topic of fan speed, all things being equal, the air temperature generally is a little higher as you increase the fan speed, because that means more air is blowing faster over the coils, giving the air less time to be cooled and dehumidified. It will likely cool the car a little faster by moving more CFMs, but by moving less cold air faster. \n\nYou\u2019re right that in a house, it shouldn\u2019t make any difference (although now that I think about it, with a variable speed blower, it is possible that calling for a lower temp could make the fan speed jump up to higher which could possibly cool the house faster. I have no idea tho. Just speculation. I only have a single stage air handler, so no experience with that).",
            "That\u2019s just wrong. That may be true in some (especially older and/or cheaper cars), but, in a car, calling for a lower temperature will cool the car faster. \n\nWhat you\u2019re saying is how standard central AC in houses works. Changing the thermostat won\u2019t change how fast the house cools, only how long it runs. \n\nThe AC in most car is different.",

However, unless you buy a high SEER, top of the line system, your traditional central air or heat pump will not be affected by lowering the tstat more than the desired temperature.",
            "Car AC is not the same as home AC.\n\nThe temperature gague in a car is actually controlling the output. It will mix cold air from the AC with outside air in order to get the desired temperature.

            "Car AC is on demand, Home central AC is suppose to be ambient, it shouldn't ever have to move temps more than a couple degrees at a time. Not designed to blow a ton of cold air quickly.",
            "Because your car's AC blends in heat to warm  up the air coming out of the air conditioner to achieve your set temperature. It doesn't make it cool faster or slower. \n\nHome HVAC will never cool and heat at the same time.",
            "Variable speed units don't change output based on the thermostat setpoint, but rather based on the heat exchanger tempearture sensor. Their goal is to reduce or increase cooling output to keep the heat exchanger at a fixed operating temperature. So it doesn't matter if you set the thermostat setpoint at -100 or at 20 or whatever, the variable speed unit will always try to achieve the same temperature on the heat exchanger and how much it needs to change the compressor speed to do that depends entirely on the actual temperature in the room.\n\nSo with the exact same setpoint on the thermostat your variable speed AC will be working harder if it's 40 degrees in your room than it would if it was only 30. And the only thing a lower setpoint will achieve will be that the system will try to cool down beyond the temperature you actually want to achieve, but during the entire cooling process up to that temperature it will have the exact same output as it would if you had set it to the actual temperature you wanted.\n\nThe only exception are systems which have fresh air intakes (like in a car) since depending on the control system setting the setpoint lower might also decrease the quantity of fresh air going in and thereby speed up cooling, but in cars it's better to simply push the \"recirculate air\" button to force the same effect, since even if you drop the setpoint the car will still mix in some outside air unless you specifically tell it not to.",

There is still a single on or off for the AC unit.\n\nSo what you're doing is tricking the thermostat. That has to do with the air holding heat and not circulating evenly. And the settings on the thermostat on how much it overshoot and when it triggers.\n\nNot the same as an lcd panel.",

It's because the *size* of the first two containers matters more than the speed at which you pour them does. \n\nThat's why HVAC systems are rated by the volume of air they can effectively heat and cool, not by the speed at which they heat/cool it.",
            "Even in cars it's true to some extent. There is a max on your car AC. Once the max fan is running, you aren't getting any more cold than that.",
            "I think you're just trying to argue. OP could have specified that it was specific to home AC units.",
            "What do you mean set the voltage higher? You can't set the AC voltage higher. It would burn out the compressor.",
            "> It is the same (enough), you set the voltage higher to trick the crystals\n\nlol what",
            "Okay, good point. Mybad.",
            "okay, but no manufacturer would have a thermostat that set the temp of the outlet air, this would confuse very person who owned one",
            "Japan is fairly rich by global standards to be fair, I have never been to Japan or anywhere in Asia but the window unit AC, particularly just standard AC units, not reversible heat pumps are still quite popular in the US. They are cheap and easy to install. \n\nI'm honestly not sure, I kind of just became accustomed to window units and haven't actually checked how much a through wall install is. \n\nA quick Google says it will likely at least double the cost.  So from around 400-500 USD for a 12000 BTU basic  unit, and then about the same in labor maybe more.  So like 1000 USD or more. \n\nI do know in some places the window style units are banned because of risk of falling on someone from above.\n\nThere are also portable air conditioners which are basically just window units on wheels with vents to the windows.  These are popular in some places but they are less efficient.\n\nIn my experience, which really amounts to living here, through wall installations are not super common here in the US, Texas specifically . Most people have dedicated central HVAC or window units,but the mini-split and heat pump  systems are very popular for new installs instead of a central HVAC  for those who can afford the increased cost.",
            "Except it\u2019s air, and air can absorb heat. cold air blowing on you rapidly will cool you faster than cold air blowing on you slowly.  \n\nMore air movement in a home also displaces more hot air.  More air exchanges means more comfortable home when trying to cool it.",
            "What?\n\nIf you have a tub of cold water and the volume at which you dump the second tub of warm water is slow it will obviously take longer to reach equilibrium because there's less water at any given time then mixing it all at once\n\n\nAs you said yourself the volume of air matters ,so if the ac fans are spinning faster that means more air is getting displaced into your house",
            "I don't think that's correct in this context",
            "It's not even true for all home AC systems. Window units and multistage home AC are more examples where the actual output changes as a function of the temperature setpoint. The title is misleading at best and mostly false if you actually spend a minute to think about it. I think you're just trying to defend a bad generalization.",
            "Yeah, I'm not exactly sure, I saw videos on it long ago, whether the LCD screen sets the voltage higher to overshoot, or holds it longer. In either case, I stand by that the room with the ac, the thermostat and the air in the room is loosely analogous to the voltage, target color of pixel, and actual color of pixel",
            "Isn't that how HVAC systems work? The thermostats we install are basically next to the return air so the hottest point would be there. And if the temp is say 76 then the rest of the conditioned space is technically 76 or cooler (unless it's warmed by windows and such)",
            "I see, I guess Japan was just an early adopter of the through-wall thing, because even my 1984 social housing apartment had pluggable holes built-in.\n\nSo for us the through-wall cost about 400 USD incl. delivery and installation.\n\nIf I owned my own property I would just do the hole myself, but if you rent, and your building doesn't have the hole, I can see that being an issue.\n\nThinking about it though, although I don't feel Japan is a very rich country now, it certainly was in the 80s and 90s lol",
            "Do you think water *can't* absorb heat?\n\nAnd what you're talking about is evaporative cooling, which only works by moving air over skin. It's not *actually* changing the temperature of anything, it just *feels* cooler because of how humans perspire. \n\nAlso, you're not *creating* more air. Any HVAC system simply sucks air in, cools it, and then pushes it back out somewhere else. There's a finite limit as to how much air can be cooled, regardless of how much air can be moved.",
            "Making a fan spin faster doesn't make \"more\" air, it just moves the existing air faster. Your HVAC system can only *make* a certain volume of cold air at a time. Setting it to a lower temperature isn't going to change how much air it can or can't cool. \n\nIt's like filling a pool with a garden hose. Just because you put your thumb over the edge to make it spray \"faster\" doesn't mean the pool is going to fill up any faster.",
            "No, the title is generally true. \n\nThe part of the AC system that does the cooling is either running or not. When it's running, it's running as hard as it can. When it achieves the set temperature, it shuts off the cooling equipment. \n\nThe fan may run at different speeds but the compressor motor is either running or not. Bringing in your car's air conditioning (in which the compressor is *also* either running or not) is just needlessly muddying the issue and you're confusing yourself.",
            "A thermostat is an on and off switch with a temperature threshold. \n\nThe voltage is either high enough to be interpreted as \"on\" or not. The level of voltage doesn't actually matter.\n\n>  I stand by that the room with the ac, the thermostat and the air in the room is loosely analogous to the voltage, target color of pixel, and actual color of pixel\n\nIt sounds like you \"stand by\" something you don't understand and can't explain, because this sentence doesn't make sense.",
            "HVAC systems blow cold air to cool the room to the setpoint.  If you blew 72 degree air the room would never get to 72 degrees.  Variable speed systems will throttle down to blowing warmer air by slowing down the compressor to save energy, but the air will always be colder than room temp (unless it's cold outside I guess, which I assume will make it eventually turn off).",
            "It\u2019s changing the temperature of ME and that\u2019s the entire purpose of having a fan or running AC on a hot summer day.  \n\nIt\u2019s about keeping people comfortable.  \n\nMoving more air and displacing more air.  Not about creating air. wtf you on about.  \n\nIf you\u2019re cooling a home and can rapidly remove the hot air to replace it with somewhat cooler air, that\u2019s going to improve comfort for anyone inside the building.  \n\nThat\u2019s why some folks will open a window on a hot day. To encourage air movement because even if the air is hot, movement of air will improve the comfort of people.",
            "That's true if you're only controlling the output but if your ac can change the fan speed then the correct analogy would be turning the tap to get more water no?\n\nOtherwise why have a high fan speed if you get the same amount of cooling?",
            "That's true if you're only controlling the output but if your ac can change the fan speed then the correct analogy would be turning the tap to get more water no?\n\nOtherwise why have a high fan speed if you get the same amount of cooling?",
