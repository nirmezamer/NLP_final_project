            "Less of a vent, but unsure if it needs its own thread either: \n\nAny suggestions for puppy boredom? I adopted a rescue from a friend about a month ago, upcoming vet visit next week for spay and a DNA test since we have no clue about her breed, and the friend who found her already took care of shots and puppy vaccinations. \n\nBut also she seems to want to chew on just about anything BUT her toys. she will gnaw on soft toys for a few minutes, I step into my office for a zoom call and come back out to find she\u2019s move on to something not a toy (shoes, couch pillows, the tv remote).  Shes doing great with crate training, sleeps through the night without any fuss, and I\u2019ve even seen her go in there on her own and just chill while I\u2019m doing whatever random house chore is happening. \n\nI work from home and have the ability to take walks throughout the day. Our schedule basically is \n\n- morning wake up, breakfast\n- walk to nearby park (1 mile)\n- morning game of fetch or rope tug of war until she gets tired\n- walk home (another mile)\n- lunch, shorter walk through the neighborhood\n- after work repeat morning park and play walk\n- get home, an hour or two of back yard play with neighbor\u2019s dogs while he and I decompress from our work days on the back porch, dinner, short pee and poop walk\n\nAll in all she gets lots of daily activity on a very consistent schedule since I wfh and have flexibility during the day, I also got some toys that claim to give doggies some mental stimulation, a maze food dish (to also help with her tendency to eat too fast and then puke) and one of those motorized weasel balls she can chase around while I\u2019m working. \n\nThey work for a few minutes, she\u2019ll get plenty of praise for playing with her toys, I step away for a 30 minute zoom call, come out and see she\u2019s somehow stealthily found something I tried to put out of reach and scattered it all about the apartment. \n\nOther than working our way through the puppy years, how else can I provide some positive reinforcement and mental stimulation so she\u2019s not so bored to ignore doggy toys and not tear up other things?",
            "Had to give up my new dog, having a hard time.\n\nMy family adopted a dog about a week ago. She was a stray rescue from the local humane society. She was a 1 year old German shepherd/husky mix.\n\nShe seemed to really attach to my dad and I, whenever one of us would leave she would whine. This got better after a few days having her, however she was still always slightly anxious.\n\nNow the problem, my family also has 4 cats living in the house. We set up a kennel and a fence to give the dog her own area. However, whenever the cats came near she would growl. We call local trainers and they said to put a curtain up so they can\u2019t see each other. We did this and it seemed to be working. We were setting up training classes and started clicker training her at home. But then we had a few close calls with the dog jumping over the fence and lunging at the cats. We had a couple close calls but there was one call that came too close for comfort. We decided we were going to try and put her in my room. However she wouldn\u2019t calm down, it seemed as if she was having panic attacks. All of the cats were terrified, the dog was stressed, my family was fighting over what to do with her.\n\nWe talked to another trainer and said that her breeds have very high prey drives and that while training could help control it, there\u2019s always a risk and that the cats may end up being hurt.\n\nIn the end we decided it would be best for all the animals if we gave her back and that she go to a home with no cats.\n\nWe talked with the humane society and they completely understood and agreed that she was not a good fit for our house. We made sure that she would not be getting put down and they even said now that they know this they can find a better match. \n\nI guess the part that bothers me the most is that I feel like I failed her, she trusted me and she doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening. I keep getting sick thinking about it. I just really hope we did the right thing for her because she is an incredible dog and deserves to live in a house stress free.\n\nAnyways, sorry for practically writing an essay but I just needed to get it out. \n\nTLDR: I had to give away my new dog because she was aggressive toward our cats and I\u2019m just having a hard time.",

            "Gosh I hate it when the other people blame my cute little dog just because they find cat poop in front of their doorsteps every single morning. I mean, my dog is scared going outside and wanna stay inside our room all day because of the aircon. And for some reason I find it so dumb that they can't even tell that it is Cat poop not dog.",
            "Sometimes I feel guilty when I have to do errands or go to work.  When I want to spend every second with my dog. \n \n[2016](https://i.imgur.com/jlDExDy.jpeg)\n\n[2024](https://i.imgur.com/OlD46Pc.jpeg)",
            "Trying to adopt a new puppy... OMG when did this become so hard. The rescues are all crazy. I have spent 1-2 hours filling our adoption forms for rescue and they say \"we will not contact you if you are not accepted\". If you are interested in multiple dogs you have to fill out MULTIPLE applications. Some of them want an application fee PER puppy you are interested in. Like what? 1 1/2 hours to fill your form out, pay you money and you won't even call me to tell me if I am chosen or not. \n\nI have EVERYTHING they want: Own my home, fully fenced yard on .66 acres, not one but 2 people work from home, experienced dog owner, former foster mom with a rescue, complete vet history... I am a complete package and I can't get the time of day from rescue. Who ARE they adopting to?\n\nThis is a huge issue: \n\n1. The lack of response from these rescues creates a situation where you have to use a shotgun approach to hope to get a dog. Apply to many dog rescue in hopes they will adopt one to you. \n\n2. Creates a sense of urgency leading to FOMO when you see a dog you like... Oh I better get an app in now... Leading to a less thoughtful approach. You are less likely to turn down a dog you might not be vibing with because you feel like you can't get anything else... \n\n3. It means that people who have the money may move to a \"Sure thing\" like purchasing rather than jump hoops without any feedback.\n\nI have adopted from and been a foster for a stringent rescue. I don't mind the hoops... but this process bothers me. In the past the rescues I worked with would contact you. It was \"you get approved, we help find you a dog\" When did we go to this \"our dogs are rock stars and only one lucky person will get a back stage pass\". You need to get past our security staff attitude? I am willing to wait if I know they will adopt to me when the right dogs comes... but doesn't this whole thing make it take longer? EACH dog they have to start the adopter pool at zero with home visits etc? \n\nAnyway... I now am going to a shelter adoption event tomorrow, where I better be in line early, in the hopes I can get a puppy from them.",
            "This totally sucks, there is no getting around that. But kudos for recognizing and taking action to find a home that suits her better. I had a foster that I fully intended to keep but after a few months I realized he was too much for me to handle alone at that point in my life. I found the most amazing couple who gave him a life I could never had provided. We stayed in touch over the years and it was so heartwarming to see how he was meant to be their dog. I don't know if this is possible, but maybe see if your info can be given to the dog's new adopters, or have a letter that is passed along. It may not help in this particular moment but can help you be confident in your choice later on.",

            "Not sure how a megathread works, but here we go:\n\nFor context, my Dad and I went to a nearby shelter to adopt a puppy. We saw her picture on the website and thought she\u2019d be a good fit for the family. I was 15 years old when we brought her home. She was a black and white mixed breed and was with us for 14 years. Yesterday, we had to say goodbye. It happened so suddenly. She was her normal self and then by the evening, became extremely lethargic. I monitored her into the early mornings hours until she violently vomited and fell over. I woke my dad and told him we needed to take her to an emergency vet. After being checked over, turns out she had a spleen tumor that ruptured. She had internal bleeding (hemoabdomen) and either needed emergency surgery or had to be put down. The third temporary option was to give her a Chinese herbal supplement known to slow/stop internal bleeding. We decided to go that route because we needed time to process this heavy news. As the hours went by, she was bedridden, could not get up, and was breathing/panting extremely hard. We were hoping for a miraculous turn around, but at this point, we knew she was suffering. We believed she was too old and weak for surgery.\n\nI\u2019m 28 years old now and I moved back in with my parents because I lost my job. They are divorced and have been for most of my life. My dad never remarried, so this dog was everything to him. He soon retired after getting her, and spent most of his retirement with her by his side. They moved to three different states and she\u2019s been there through many phases of life. I loved her too and while I wasn\u2019t with her as much, I\u2019m grateful I had this past year to be with her under the same roof.\n\nMy heart hurts not only because I miss her, but for my dad. He struggles with depression and I\u2019m worried for his wellbeing after this tough loss. I guess the purpose of this winded post is for words of encouragement and positive vibes. We\u2019ve lost pets before, but he had such a strong connection to this one. It\u2019s the day after and the house feels so empty. It\u2019s the little reminders everywhere\ud83d\ude2a"

The other one liked to pull the sled. \n\nOne visit the less joyfull one came over to me and put her paw on my arm so I started to pet her. Then I told my brother \u201dsee\u2026 she like me\u201d. She wouldn\u2019t let me stop either and put the paw on my arm again and again. \n\nThen the dog crapped on the carpet. She was desperately trying to tell me she needed to go out.",

            "One is that she's 11 months old.  I've found that some teenage dogs have a \"Mooommmm, stop it!\" attitude about cuddles.  \n\nI had a smooth collie girl, Zeffie, and one of her nicknames was  \"Spock Collie\".  She was a serious dog but she showed her love very subtle ways.  Such as laying close to, but not touching, me.  If she didn't love me, she would have gone down into the basement where it was cooler. I was deeply moved by this show of affection.   \n\nZeffie also showed her tight bond with me by being incredibly reliable.  I showed her in obedience/agility/herding and she made me look good.   I also showed Dino and Pablo with less success.  They needed my clear headed, calm handling or they would mess up. Unfortunately they had me.  \n\nI'm a crappy handler and I would often get ring nerves.  Tension runs down the leash and if I was nervous, Dino or Pablo would fall aapart.  \n\nIf I my brain glitched and not likely to get back online, Zeffie would, figurative, look up, realize that \"Pablois4 has gone bye-bye\" and proceed to get the job done.  I called Zeffie my obedience guide dog.  I recall two judges - one said \"fantastic working dog, too bad about the hander\" and one looked at me directly and stated \"that dog saved your bacon.\"\n\nMy friends said that it was Zeffie was the one who needed to look at the agility course map.  I'm a worse handler in agility than obedience and that's saying something.  So in the agility ring, I'd  run in circles, waving my arms like a demented windmill and yell \"tunnel! I meant teeter! Left! The other left!\".   After one run, my instructor asked me what I was thinking.  That's the trouble, I wasn't.  \n\nZeffie, somehow,  was able to decipher my bug eyed babbling and a remarkable number of times, did the course correctly.  She even got placements. \n\nMy boy collies have been lovey, dovey sweethearts and never cared if I don't know what I'm doing half the time.  My girls looked at me with clear eyes, and even with all my faults and foibles, still loved me.  Or maybe they just accept that this was their lot in life and had to make the best of it.",

I'm going to miss him dearly but my wife will miss him more -- she's been the steadiest, most constant, most dependable companion she's had her entire adult life.\n\nI want to know how I can best support her I'm her grief. I've lost dogs before, but not like this. They've never occupied the kind of role on my life that this dog has occupied in hers. To make matters worse, she's ashamed of how she's been treating him lately, as he's had more and more frequent accidents in the house, and his anxiety has become a constant strain on our lives. As we adjust to the busiest, messiest phase of our lives, he's been a frequent source of frustration lately, and I know her grief will be compounded by the guilt she feels for getting frustrated with him lately.\n\nHe's been a really special dog, and my wife is really special to me -- I'm at a loss for how to support her through this because it just feels so enormous. I want to show up for her in a big way -- how can I do that?",

            "Make sure you're with them when he goes. Listen to your wife and offer reassurance. Don't try to make her feel better, just listen and commiserate with her. Let her grieve and get her feelings out.\n\nGet her a gift. It doesn't have to be expensive. I have a bracelet with a photo of my old dog lazer engraved on it which was quite cheap. Etsy has some nice dog memorial items.",
            "Be there, pay attention to how she grieves and give her what she needs, not what you think she should need. Take care of other things so she can take a bit of time for this. Do the formalities, not just for the dog, but also with the family.\n\nThe kindest thing my husband did when my old dog died was keep the kid off me for a couple of days and notify everybody, tell them how we're handling it, so I didn't have to deal with that. It was as if a human family member had died for us, so everything but the funeral (the urn is at home). \n\nI'm sorry for your loss.",
            "My deepest condolences to you both. I just had to say goodbye to my dog in April\u2014she would\u2019ve been 17, and we had been together since I was 14 (will be 31 next month, and she was 10 weeks old. She was with me through high school, college, all of my 20s\u2026my worst depression & eating disorder, the passing of my parents, and through all the good times too. The pain is super unique having grown into a full adult person alongside your best little furry friend.\n\nBe with your wife when the vet comes. If she hasn\u2019t yet taken care of arrangements or paperwork, be there for that and see if she\u2019s able to verbally tell you what to fill out while you actually fill it out. This was super hard for me to do by myself.\n\nGet her a memento to remember her best friend with. Could be a nice box to keep the collar, a favorite toy, a blanket, etc. I had actually gotten my dog\u2019s paw print tattooed years before, which was memento enough for me, but jewelry is a common gift.\n\nLet her sob and cry, and remind her to drink water. I didn\u2019t eat or drink for days after my girl passed. I\u2019m grateful for the friends who sent me DoorDash gift cards, texted to check in, and reminded me to eat/drink.\n\nIf it\u2019s feasible to you, let her control when you start to go through and get rid of belongings. For me, it was helpful to keep what meant a lot to me and clear my space of the rest so I didn\u2019t have constant reminders. (I also live in a small apartment so extra space is crucial for me.) it definitely helped me to not constantly have reminders of my pups empty bed and bowls, or her toys everywhere.\n\nAnd lastly, if she\u2019s open to it, a therapist or support group to help process. I was able to bring this to my weekly therapy sessions and it really helped to have an objective ear to listen.\n\nMuch love to you both \ud83d\udc9b",
            "The absolute best thing I can recommend is having a vet come to the house when its time. It makes all the difference in the world, and two of my only regrets in my life is not doing it for my first two pets, because I had no idea it was an option at the time.",
            "Be there when they euthanize the dog. \nGive them love and tell him how great a companion he was for you and your wife. Be sweet \n\nA year ago our Rakker, a cocker spaniel mix, was terminally ill at 11 yo. Our son got the dog as puppy at the age of 12. He was very distressed but appreciated being there at the vet.\n\nAlso the vet and assistants were very respectful.\n\nWe have a TV always on with pictures of memorable moments, including all our previous dogs.  Sometimes we renemeris on old times. And it feels good to remember",
            "If you can, offer to have the vet come to the home. The dog will be in a comfortable setting and less afraid.  It's more expensive, but it was so worth it when we put our baby down a few years ago. So much better than being in a badly lit vet office where the dog likely experienced anxiety at times in his life.",
            "I fostered a dog, that I got really attached too and it had to be put down for behavior. It's been 2 months and I still break down a lot. I'm gonna tell you, take a ton of videos, get a ton more pictures. See if you can get some of the pictures without her knowing when she's smiling/glowing around the dog. The foster offered to get us the dogs ashes and a paw print which I also think helped me and my wife. Definitely be there with her and the dog when it's time (bring tissues). If she gets upset and wants to talk just listen (no advice just an ear). I'm somebody who has had a number of loved ones pass in my life and I grieve and feel normal pretty fast. I was actually surprised about this dog hitting me so hard and the length is beens. Be prepared if she reacts like me for her to get more emotional for longer. Don't rush to get a new dog either, you could overly compare the dogs and not like it because it's not the dog you're missing. I have 2 of my own dogs,  I catch myself like why can't you do this like him (I love my girls so I stop this behavior pretty fast when I do it). Hope this helps",
            "I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this.  I had my two GSDs from age 20 to age 33/36 and the relationship was like what you described of your wife and her dog.  I was with my now husband when the second one passed.  He loved her just like I did until the end.  He doted on her, put her first, spoiled her, and most importantly recognized and supported how important she was to me.  He grieved with me also which helped.  I don\u2019t know what\nTo say about the frustration aspect except that you\u2019re right.  The guilt will compound on her grief so I\u2019d try to\nSupport her and the dog as much as possible until the end.  \n\nWe also put her down at home which is as peaceful and I\u2019m so glad we did.",
            "Seconding everything that has been said already...I lost my girl 2 years ago and I still cry for her, it's hard! I will add one thing. My husband was SUPER supportive and did all the things.  I had a huge dog shaped hole in my heart and I couldn't stop grieving so I insisted on getting another dog 2 months later even though I had swore I would not. It was a mistake, it helped at first but she wasn't my Molly and I wasn't ready to love her for her own sake. It wasn't my husband's fault of course, he wanted me to be happy again but I wish he had gently but firmly insisted we wait. It's wonderful you want to support your wife, there is no time limit on grief \ud83d\udc94",

            "When my dog had to be put to sleep at 15 years old, my boyfriend was there for me. He just held me why I cried, laid next to me in bed why I cried myself to sleep every night for weeks.

            "Wildflower seeds she can grow in his memory may be a healing idea if it\u2019s feasible for you. A picture frame she can display his photo with will be so meaningful as well. Be patient and supportive while she navigates the grief. \n\nI lost both of my dogs back to back last March and April. My 14 year old sheepdog I got when I was 17, followed by my 12 year old gal who had been terminally ill. A flower arrangement that was sent to me made me feel so much love and support from my friends. Only time will heal, truly. I have two gardens for both of my girls with their ashes, and it\u2019s an ongoing way I still deal with their absence. \n\nI will add since another poster said they got a dog right away and it was a bad idea. I knew my girls would be gone soon, and I swore I needed a year before getting a dog. But once it happened, my heart told me I needed one much sooner. I adopted my puppy from the shelter two weeks after my second passed, and it was absolutely the best decision of my life. I had two females so I adopted a male, and he\u2019s helped me through the grief better than anything or anyone could. For some people, it works. I was able to grieve the loss of my two best friends while also loving a puppy in their honor, giving him a full life of fun that my girls taught me. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss.",

            "My partner was around when I had to put down my childhood dog, it was rough. It\u2019s been well over half a year now and I still cry occasionally when I really think of her. \n\nThe biggest thing is to just be present. I cried a lot and I felt bad because for the first few days, I basically just spent all our time together crying. He would just sit or lay down with me, bring me water or tea, sometimes food, sometimes a sweet a really like. Overall he was just my biggest support by just being present, and helping me get things like food and water. \n\nAnd while not necessarily for me, he commissioned a portrait of her for my parents and I think we all cried when they opened it.",
            "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. \n\nPick up the slack in whatever way you can for at least a few days. Handle easy dinners, take primary baby duty, clean the kitchen each night, etc. \n\nAlso, you know your wife best, but don\u2019t feel like you have to stay entirely strong or hide your own grief. He was your dog for a long time too, and your wife will probably feel strange if you don\u2019t seem affected by his loss as well. \n\nI turned both of my previous dog\u2019s ID tags into Christmas ornaments. If you celebrate Christmas, that might be a nice idea.",
            "We had to put down our 11 year old in 2013, who was my childhood dog. It's not easy but here's some things I suggest:\n\n- if you can, maybe get some sort of memorabilia. a lock of the fur or you can dip the paw pad in ink and press it on some paper to frame. \n\n- get some final pictures of the dog\n\n- go with her during the euthanasia and take her out to eat afterwards if she even wants to eat (or just get her a nice drink or snack, something you know she likes)\n\n- gather some photos of the dog and make a little photo album\n\n- be patient and understanding during her moments of grief, it could last a few weeks, a few months or even a few years\n\n- take some of her chores and do them for her for a bit, take some stress off of her plate (like if she cooks and does laundry usually, do that for a few weeks)",

            "Be with your dog the moments when he is being euthanised. Please don't leave him a lone. And I think just care for your baby / give her time off and care for your baby while she is grieving. Also during those frustrating moments I like to think, there will be a day when that is no longer. Just think even elderly humans do those things, being messy, no longer going toilet in the toilet spot, more reactive etc. Her dog's love has been unconditional, animals don't keep record of wrongs or have grudges like us, just pure love and only eyes for you and your wife.",
            "Right now, if it\u2019s not too late, I\u2019d say make sure she has the chance to spend some quality time with the dog, even if it\u2019s just for half an hour with no distractions. \nI can\u2019t imagine how hard it has been for your wife with your new baby to look after too - I\u2019ve come here as my dog is in a similar position but at least my son is a teenager now. \nKnowing grief, the most horrible part of it is feeling regret and you say your wife is feeling bad about it already. If you can help give her some happy memories and a chance to give him some special time with her, maybe it will help your wife in the long run?",
            "OP, I just went through this situation in April and my partner was actually on their way to breaking up with me soon after (about a month \u2018officially\u2019) and I can tell you the things that I had wanted so bad from my partner that I never got:\n- I wanted my partner there more than anything, especially after. This would\u2019ve required her to pick up our own dogs after work and drive the two hours to my hometown. She made a whole bunch of reasons why it didn\u2019t make sense for her to do that and then proceeded to make me feel like crap because I was frustrated with her calling. I was frustrated because I wanted her there.\n- That night I got home late. She didn\u2019t bother to call me on my two hour drive home to check on me, talk to me, etc. when I got home, she was already in a separate room sleeping and all I wanted was to sleep near each other that night.\n- Things like flowers, a note, a way to remember my family dog, checking in on me, going out of their way to do anything special, etc we\u2019re all things that would have been SO nice to receive during the after time.\n\nI still feel like I never had a chance to grief properly because of this and it\u2019s really affected me. My advice is to ASK, but also even if she acts annoyed or frustrated, understand where she is coming from and don\u2019t stop being there for her.",
            "I say bring up the good times more. You might think bringing him up will make her sad but she\u2019s already sad. Not bringing a deceased pet up can make a grieving pet owner feel crazy and ashamed. Like we\u2019re grieving something that barely existed to anyone else. \n\nAlso, ask her. It\u2019s good you asked us but you really need to ask her. Only she can tell you how to best support her.",
            "Just understand that grieving is going to be a long process.  Dogs have a very special place in our hearts, and when they go they take a piece with them.  Encourage her to see a grief counsellor, if she needs.",
            "I was the primary carer for our last dog when he could no longer walk due to FHO operation and arthritis.  I had to carry him outside and it was emotionally wrecking, during the last year of his life and after.\n\nThe most important thing my wife did for me was:\n\n1. When we had to take him to the vets because he was not really conscious and responsive, I had a hard time because I blamed myself for not knowing more to ease his pain / make him better. I know on one level, the logical one, that we (wife, daughter, and I) did literally everything to give our dogs the best life they could have .  \n\nEmotionally, I was torn. Keeping him around was probably keeping him in pain and being selfish. Letting him go felt like I was responsible for doing you-know-what to our daughter's last carer dog.\n\nShe talked to me and assured me I was not being a bad parent (human or dog). There was no one who gave more to their dogs than I did. \n\nShe held me. She allowed me to cry when I needed to.

We\u2019d had the end of life discussion that very night.  We both thought she still had quality of life.  We thought we still had a few options to try.  We thought we had months, we had no idea we had only hours.\n\nI\u2019m totally gutted.  There\u2019s nothing anyone can do for me.  I have regrets.  What did I miss?  How could I have made this more peaceful for her?  What more could I have done?\n\nThere are no answers.  Nothing will ease my pain.  I need time.  That\u2019s what I need.  \n\nFor all my husband\u2019s wants to lessen my pain, he can\u2019t.  \n\nI just need time to come to grips with the quiet of the house, the girl that won\u2019t greet me at the door, the baby girl that won\u2019t be at my side as I work.\n\nI just need time. There is nothing anyone can do for me.\n\nBe patient, know that she needs to work through this pain.  It\u2019s not on you, & you can\u2019t fix it.",

He told me that he was coming with me to that horrible appointment, that he was driving, that he would stay in the waiting room or go in with me (he came in, got on the floor with us & cried too). He drove me home the slow scenic way, held me while I cried & then informed me he would be picking up the ashes, that it was something I shouldn\u2019t do. I\u2019ve never been supported like this & my love for him grew even stronger as a result of his empathy & thoughtfulness.

            "I went through this last year with my heart dog who was with me for 12 years since law school and was my one constant through so many pivotal, chaotic, tragic, and transitional parts of my life. I could not gave gotten through it without my fianc\u00e9. As other posters have said, the most important thing is just to be there to provide space and support for your wife as she grieves. Don\u2019t add to the burden by asking her what she needs constantly - do your best to anticipate and just provide what you can -make sure she always has a fresh glass of water, take care of the chores without asking, provide food you know she likes so she doesn\u2019t have to think about it (I didn\u2019t eat the first few days and then basically ate all my emotions for months) - don\u2019t force anything on her. If she cries, just be there to sit with her and hold her and make sure she feels comfortable going through those emotions around you, rather than a burden. My fiance would just put an arm around me or hand on my arm or leg, depending on where I was sitting, and just be with me as I would cry, and occasionally would just say how great a dog my pup was. That\u2019s all I wanted to hear, just needed him to acknowledge what I was going through and give space to my grief and my pup.\n\nOther little things that helped: the first time we had a drink after she passed, my fiance roared to my pup. We\u2019ve toasted to her every single time we\u2019ve had any kind of drink, no matter where we are or who we\u2019re with, since then a year and a half ago (even if it\u2019s just a whisper to each other). It keeps her a part of our regular life. I have a digital frame linked to an app on my phone that I\u2019ve loaded with photos of our life together, many of my pup, and photos rotate every ten minutes through the day; just catching a glimpse of my pup as I go about my day puts a smile on my face and again, keeps her spirit alive. A very lovely gesture my fiance made was having a tree planted in a national forest in my pup\u2019s name - I have a framed certificate and a map of the plot where the tree is. It felt like such a lovely way to make her feel a part of this world again, a lasting part. He also served as a buffer between me and our friends and family, sharing the news with those I hadn\u2019t yet when it was necessary, like when friends would invite us out he would separately inform them of what was going on so I didn\u2019t have the burden of constantly talking about it, but also people could understand if I wasn\u2019t responsive or my usual self. He always gave me space to decide what I was up for and what I wasn\u2019t. It was incredibly thoughtful and helpful to just take so much off my plate and clear space for me without me asking.\n\nIndividually, working with a grief therapist was another saving grace. I was in therapy within a week, and was simmering I desperately needed, both the therapy in general but also just knowing that I had time set aside each week to give space to my grief and honor my pup helped with coping through my daily life the rest of the week. \n\nAnd of course, give yourself time to grieve as well. Therapy, journaling your feelings, setting aside time to grieve and do nothing else\u2026you are experiencing a loss too, on top of having to witness your partner suffer. \n\nThis is such a beautiful request for help. Your wife is lucky to have such a thoughtful and compassionate partner. My condolences to you both.",
            "I\u2019m so sorry. Losing a dog is one of the worst feelings in the world and I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done without my partner when I lost my boy last year. He was old and sick. He was my childhood dog. My partner was the one who made the call to have him put down the day he was clearly not doing well/was dying naturally anyway. I always thought that him making that call and going with my dad to the vet was such a final act of mercy and kindness to my boy. He\u2019s a big guy and my dog was a BIG dog so it helped that he could carry him in/out of the car since my dog couldn\u2019t walk well. Then that whole week he was just there for me. At night, he held me while I sobbed and screamed. He let me talk about my dog whenever I needed to. He didn\u2019t make me go out or socialize if I didn\u2019t want to and he stayed in with me to just be with me. When I needed a distraction from my grief he was there to provide that. He was honestly really great about just letting me grieve how I needed to and providing what I needed in a given moment.

            "If the house isn\u2019t an option bring their comfiest bed/blanket as a home comfort. This can make the world of difference. We wanted my elder dog to be put to sleep in our home but the home vets could only come to us in several days and time was not on our side so my sister asked a dog group for tips and they suggested to bring her bed into the vet. She was relaxed and comfortable and we are so glad for it.",
            "I'll never not have a pet put down at home again if I can help it. It made all the difference in the world, and I regret not knowing it was even an option for my first two pets. Taking them in was just...brutal on my soul. \n\nMy 24 year old cat I'd had since she was 3 months old was time until the one day she wasn't, and we both knew it was time, begged my husband to ask the vet if there was literally any other option besides coming in, and she came to the house right after her offices closed for the day, on her own time. She didn't even charge us extra for coming to the house...I don't know why. \n\nMaybe it was simply because she'd been my Lily's vet for years and knew exactly how hard this loss was going to be on me. \n\nRegardless of why, thank gods for my vet, because I don't know how I'd have coped if I'd had to take my old girl in at the time. I was completely wrecked as it was, but us lying in bed together when it was time, her spending her last moments snuggled with me in the place she loved most was worth anything and everything"

He's generally a happy dog and is friendly to any and everyone. He's a very confident dog and even enjoys going to the vet and the groomers. He absolutely loves going to doggy daycare and pretty much has the ability to make friends with literally anyone. He gets along well with cats, he does have a slight habit of chasing after squirrels but outside of that he is such a well behaved dog. Everyone always have positive things to say about him.\n\nHe has been away from home a maximum of about a 7-10 days but he never seemed to suffer from any seperation anxiety. These instances were due to work related trips I'd have to take or vacations. He's just always a happy dog. I honestly don't know how he'd behave if were away for any longer than that. He has never shown a sign of sadness a day in his life so I truly don't know how well he'd take to me being gone...for good.\n\nI should also add he's a very large dog, he's a mutt but I'd imagine he'd be considered a giant breed dog.

            "Honestly my advice is wait a little longer. Getting a dog in college is probably the worst time in your life to get one. Your schedule changes lots from year to year, and once graduated you often don\u2019t know what life will look like. \n\nI currently have a dog as a college student, but I got her when I was in middle school. Now I have to deal with putting off big life decisions because she comes first. I am limited in what classes I can take because I have to be done by certain times to take care of her. I have to limit what events I attend, what housing is going to be, etc. \n\nDogs are also a huge expense \u2014 especially standard poodles as their grooming typically starts at $100 a groom and needs to be done around every 4-6 weeks. Even stretching it at BARE minimum your dog would probably need to be groomed 4x a year which is $400+ this is if you are willing to slave over their hair brushing every day for about an hour once they get very long.\n\nJust think. Once you graduate you will need to find a job, possibly end up in a completely different area than you are now. You won\u2019t know what your income is going to look like etc. it\u2019s just a constantly changing point in your life, having a dog makes these changes A LOT harder on both you and the animal.\n\nI\u2019m not saying NEVER get a dog, definitely go for it, but when the time is right. When life is stable.",
            "I wouldn't leave any dog in a crate 7 hours Monday to Thursday unless you are planning on serious exercise before 7?40 am, like .. more than 30 minutes.\u00a0\n\n\nI mention this since it's important to you that the dog knows how to stay in its crate and not be destructive, as well as be very eager to please.",
            "Agreed.\n\nCrating for 7 hours straight is pretty...ruff.\n\nThis is for any dog, but especially one that is eager to please --> meaning they need lots of/constant human input."

            "When I was younger my grandfather would take our very large malamute to 7-11 every night for his 6pack of old style tall boys. I never thought much of it. Until one night I walked the mile to the store by myself. When I got there the clerk asked if my grandad was ok, I said he was in hospital but is coming home soon. He then let me know that Con (our dog). Has shown up every night for a week, lays next to the door until the man opens the door and tells Con \" he is not hear you have to go home\". Con would then Walk home and sneak back into the yard. We never knew he left..the same dog would walk us kids to school, soon as we hit where the crossing guard was. Id say, thank you Con now go home. He would and if my mom let him out at 230 he'd meet us at the same spot. Now I would never do that now and yes I see all the wrong decisions we made. But 30+ years ago I think pups had a bit more independence. As a adult I never even let my children (even teenagers) take our 100+ lb dogs out without me. But when I was a10 year old girl. That 150lb malamute walked right next to me all over the south side of Chicago. As long as we were home when the street lights came on. lol my mom figured I'd be safe.a d I always was",
            "The one time my current dog has gotten out, my neighbors across the street were in their driveway and immediately came and rang the doorbell. He gave them a few scolding barks for coming up to the house and then just waited with them for me to answer the door lol.\n\nI don\u2019t know what he\u2019d have done if not for that. I sincerely hope he doesn\u2019t decide to take himself on one of our usual walks. We do looong walks (often 5+ miles in the summer, even longer in the winter) in all directions from our house. Who knows where he\u2019d end up. His favorite place to visit is four miles from our house and he knows the route, but he\u2019d have to cross four major roads and the railroad tracks to get there. I\u2019d rather he not attempt that alone. \n\nIf my previous dog got out he\u2019d come to the front door and bark to be let in. Smart man.",
            "Mine takes off along the same path if he gets out, but that's because he knows where the cats and rabbits typically hang out.  If he sees anything then it's game on for a chase.  I can usually find him because he's a hound and yells loud enough to alert the whole neighbourhood that he's out unsupervised.  If he can't find anything he comes home.  \n\nFortunately I usually find him before he causes too much mayhem.",
            "My dog escaped once (at a new house I was house sitting, let her out and didn\u2019t realize the fence was left open).

Needless to say, we've adapted, preventing this from happening any more.\n\nBut, when it happens she ends up on the other side of town at her best doggie friend's place.",

Oh, there's cat food in a bowl here outside this house. Nom nom nom. Three long blocks of houses to check out!  People! They'll pet me! They'll say how handsome I am! Can't stay, places to pee! \n\nThis occupies about three, maybe four hours. At which point he circles back home and if I can get within six feet of him, he'll let me put a leash on him and take him home, happily. If I call his name outside that range, he grins and takes off running.  Unless he's too tired and sore, in which case he just gives up. \n\nThis is why when he goes out in the yard I watch him like he was a toddler next to a pool, because he won't start trying to put a nose under the fence if I'm standing right there.

I got a call a couple of minutes into my drive from my bf, saying he found him trying to find a way to get into the dumpster behind the Chinese restaurant across the street from my house. Those 2 incidents happened pretty close to each other, so I made some reinforcements and some changes to our routine.

So when S would get loose (which was not a rare occurrence, she was a Houdini dog) she would always go across the street to the neighbor\u2019s house and 9 times out of 10 she would be in her backyard. Sometimes we would even open the neighbor\u2019s screen door so S would think we were going in the house to see the cats and come to us. S was a goofy lab who did not have one mean bone in her body.

Now she just sits right outside the front door and waits for me to grab her leash. To be fair, none of her escapes have happened when there are birds within eyesight of the house. There is no stopping her once she sees a duck, turkey, or the local wood stork. \n\nHuge change from my last dog, who would tear through the neighborhood looking for cats.

He will jump in the car if I offer a car ride and open the door.

One person stood to keep him close and the other (me) had to book it around the block since the rest of the area nearby is also fenced in property. The other time he got out, part of our fence fell, he went into the front yard, and apparently decided the front yard sucked so went back to the door to come inside.

This is what I was thinking as I was screwing the curtain support in of course. \n\nBy the third day I was certain I had locked it properly but she still got out. \n\nSo on the fourth day I latched it, then tightened every side of the kennel with rope. Despite this, she still got out and now the kennel had to be bent back into shape. How? Dunno. \n\nFifth day I strapped even more rope to it, and she still got out. \n\nBy now the curtains were torn and the supports couldn't be screwed.into the wall any more because the drywall was fkd.\n\nOver the weekend I got new curtains, new supports, screwed a wooden ledger board above the window to support the new curtain. \n\nOn Monday I put her in the smaller, but still good for her size, kennel. I tied the entire thing up in my very possible way I could think of. On my lunch break I drove home to check on her to see.the curtains had already been pulled down on one side. When I got inside the kennel was upside down and partially collapsed. \n\nOn Tuesday I asked if I could bring my dog to work with me because it seems.she may have a tinsy but of seperation anxiety. \n\nShe was.the office dog for about a year and a half. Then covid happened and we went to a wfh paradigm. \n\nThe first question I got from coworkers when on zoom was, \"can we see your dog? Can you put her on camera? We miss her!\" Lol",

But Harry just goes and finds people to hang out with. He's really charming, so all we have to do is find whatever group of people he's decided to chill with.

Away from traffic or other houses that might have a loose dog, etc.   It works, because it's always the way every dog has headed off in when they are loose and on the run.   \n\nMy first girl, Lou, definitely taught me not to judge anyone for having a dog loose.  She was a lady in the house and on the leash, but once she was loose there was no end to the bad names we could come up for her \ud83d\ude02  And no catching her until she was ready to come back inside.",
            "I have two dogs. One will be gone like the wind if she realizes her leash has been dropped or detached. There is no catching her. It maybe easier now since I\u2019ve worked on her recall training for years. The last time one of my kids left the front door open she got out and before she got to far I asked her if she wanted to \u201ceat eat\u201d and she turned around and came back in. I was glad. I wasn\u2019t in the mood to chase her down. \n\nMy other dog won\u2019t leave my side. Even if I drop the leash or it gets unclipped. In fact he will keep looking back to make sure I\u2019m still following him lol.",

No dog, however, should have anything that could be described as a \"standard escape routine.\" \n\nI happen not to think that we should talk about the family dog escaping in the same fun/ flippant tone that we talk about them knocking the kitchen trash over or getting into the underwear drawer. \"Haha lol they went on a lil adventure again\" isn't something anyone should find even halfway funny or take for granted. Frankly, if people (in general, not you specifically) took escape prevention more seriously, far fewer escapes would happen. \n\nHave you seen an escaped dog \"on an adventure\" get hit by a car? I have. Escapes should be treated like the stakes are very high, because they are.",

            "Agreed. I mean, I knew it wasn't going to be a popular thing to hear. But the average person really is letting their dog escape their control way more often than it should be happening. While freak accidents happen, if they're happening every 6-12 months, you need to reevaluate something. \n\nI want people to treat this subject as if an evil genie cursed them with a prophecy that the next time their dog ends up on an out of control joyride down the street, they WILL get hit by a car. Not might - will. \"They can't they can't prevent it, it was just a mistake\", etc but watch how many mistakes would happen if they were actually given this prophecy. Would it inevitably change behavior patterns and cause them to be drastically more careful? Yup. \n\nAt the very least, we can just not treat it like a cute/ naughty/ inevitable thing that dogs do."

Lately I\u2019ve had more time on my hands and I\u2019m looking for ways to strengthen the bond between me and my puppy and add a little fun for both of us. I do some obedience training with her every day for all of 10 minutes before she loses interest and clocks out. She likes fetch and tug of war sometimes but only when she initiates. She likes to be pet only when she feels like it and she\u2019s not a big cuddler. Much of the time I spend with her it seems like we just sit in each other\u2019s presence, which is nice but not quite fulfilling.

They go out and play and all that stuff, but they just want to be close by. I just take them out on short little walks ,.go out the back yard with them for a while just to change the environment. My gsd would have died a death of boredom from that level of work/play, but some of these guys that have been hungry and cold or in a bad house somewhere are just really happy to chill.\n\nE: what you want to watch with these guys is they do t develop separation anxiety if you spend all day together. Different, appropriate environments are always good.",

Find something both of you guys enjoy doing together and do it often.  Mine loves to eat food and I like making him do cute poses, so he now knows a lot of cute tricks.

            "My pomeranian was a 100% outside dog the first 8 years of his life.  He socialized with people maybe 5 minutes a day.  He lived next door.  The man did not like small dogs and the woman was fond of him but never housetrained or worked with him.  He was outside whether it was 2 feet of snow or 110\u00b0 heat or a storm...\n\nHe kept running away to my house, and the neighbors gave him to me eventually.   I housetrained him with belly bands and groomed him and tried to get him social to people, but for the most part, he just seemed to do his own thing in his own adorable way.  It went on this way many months.\n\nThen, one day, there was a thunderstorm, and he was shaking.  I held him securely, talking to him gently and combing his fur, and he looked up at me with this trusting, vulnerable expression, and our bond snapped in place.  Ever since then, he comes to me frequently and nuzzles his head into my chest, and I hold him close.   He's 15 now.  I dread the day he leaves me.",

I\u2019m sure she is feeling safe with you but still taking things slowly due to prior situations. Not sure if you know her history but if she\u2019s been taken back more than once that might explain it. Sounds like you are doing everything right bonding wise! Long hikes & pup cups won my girl over \ud83d\ude06",
            "Play with the dog the way the dog wants to play. Set boundaries, but if it wants to play fight, then play fight. Dogs like wolves learn and bond through play. You can also train through play as well, which in my experience is way better than using treats. (Source: all my dogs have been rescue dogs, some were abused, all have had an extremely strong bond with me)",
            "Huge one for my dog was teaching him leash skills! I was big on teaching him how to heel on walks and now that he has it down I give him more freedom to walk around as he pleases and he constantly checks back on me and now will wait for me if I\u2019m far behind him. It\u2019s been my favorite thing ever feeling like he wants to be near me on walks!!",
            "I think, like any relationship, you kind of have to feel what she likes and find what works for both.\n\nMy dog wasn't really into cuddles when I got him, but little by little I approached him and he's more affectionate now (not so clingy, but he does always want to be near me). He's not so much into food, but I'm trying to learn what he likes to eat besides dog food. He likes carrots. He loves talking walks, hates cutting nails. I let him on my bed sometimes. Sometimes he wants to touch and be cuddly, but sometimes he just wants to be close by.\n\nJust feel the vibe, go with the flow. You'll catch the little things about her, then it starts clicking.",
            "My new one and a half year old rescue was shy at first. I spent one to one time with him. Showed him like the rules and how to sit, etc. He was clearly happy and like getting used to everything.\nWhen I started doing things he really liked more, he became more physically invested. So lots of rides and visits to the dog park and treats were the way to his heart. Now we will be at the park and he will be so happy that he runs to me and leaps and I have to catch him so he can give tons of kisses. He cuddles a lot at home with me and my senior dog.

If she gets nervous during thunderstorms or 4th of July fireworks, swaddle her in a towel and play calming music. Lavender essential oil is also meant to calm humans and doggies. Learning new tricks engages her brain and helps keep her mentally fit.\n\nLots of kisses and loving words, though if she's not a cuddler, work up to hugs because that can feel restricting to some dogs. And time. If she leans on you while you're hanging out or sleeping, that's a great sign.",

I bet you guys will love it! \n\nI think the activity that has been the most enriching for both of us has just been going on super long walks/hikes together. Never anything too crazy or strenuous, just kinda wandering and letting him sniff til his nose falls off.\n\nI'm lucky enough to live near a park that has a creek, and that was where I had the most beautiful, unexpected \"breakthrough\" moment with my rescue dog. He was always super unsure of the water and never wanted more than a careful sniff, but one day, for whatever reason, he got in! And now when we go to that park he damn near pulls my arm off trying to get to that creek for a dip, haha. He never \"needed\" to like the water and I know he'd be just as happy without it, but it was so amazing to see my fearful boy realize a new joy in life \u2764",

            "Training sessions are supposed to be pretty brief (think commercial breaks during live TV). You just do it many times a day. So, checking out after 10 minutes is actually a pretty long time! \n\nI\u2019ve always enjoyed adventuring with my pups. Going to see things that are new for both of us. I also really enjoyed doing agility - we were never any good, but figuring things out together about how to be a team and rely on each other was huge for my pup and me.",
            "So much of the above but have you taken your dog for a hike maybe a run? My dog learned what living was when we started doing that. Our bond became even stronger when we did that routinely. Also training became easier. \n\nWhat kind of breed/ mix is your pupper?",
            "OP: Bonding cans be different for all dogs, depending on the age and what their situation is (a rescue dog that\u2019s been in a shelter for some time, a rescued dog you may be fostering who is coming out of a bad situation and also a pup you might\u2019ve swooped up from a home with a clean slate). Bonding can be different for all of those situations as some of them often don\u2019t know how to feel safe until they are actually safe. \n\nMy bonding looks like: hand feeding, cuddling, sharing snacks, pets, soft grooming that they may tolerate like hair brushing, playing with toys, watching kid movies with them that are interactive with noises (usually find out if a dog will take interest in it or if they just sleep through it - I\u2019ve had dogs that love watching tv so long as I am with them and other who just plop on me and sleep through it) and of course napping/sleeping together. Other ones would be taking them on drives and or to the park. Spending time with them. Of course you don\u2019t want them to grow to have anxiety so you would start very early on leaving home without them for a few and then increasing that. I definitely am not a fan of kennels, never used them and I don\u2019t like them. I\u2019ve always taught my dogs to respect the home and used the gate system to slowly increase their area around the house. My dogs have free range of the house and I like that so much.",
            "Food puzzles, sniffy walks, scent training. Work on a trick that's just for fun. Massage or grooming if they like it. Give them a job like carrying something that feels important. Go for a drive. Check out new parks.",
            "Sometimes it saddens me that so many people view training their dog as a utility when, in fact, it is 100% you and your dog learning a common language. More than just feeding and being the one who walks her, teaching your dog things, then routinely using that training creates close engagement with her, and engagement is what creates a bond. \n\nKnow, too, that when you use what you\u2019ve trained, when, say, finding a scent target you\u2019ve taught her, you\u2019ll be watching her search, and will be reading her body language. She, in turn, will be checking in with you, reading in your subconscious body language that you\u2019re paying attention, and will continue sending you curs. This feedback loop, when fostered, creates tremendous dog/handler satisfaction, and deepens the relationship/bond in ways it\u2019s hard to articulate. \n\nNever stop learning/training with your dog; THAT forms the deepest bond you can imagine.",
            "Try nose work. You can make it very simple or join online classes. Fenzi Acadamy is very reputable. Agility is great, too, and there\u2019s more interaction between a dog and a handler if that\u2019s what you feel is missing from your relationship.",
            "I would squat down and press my boy Dexter\u2019s head to my chest while scratching his neck and ears while sometimes reaching to scratch his belly. He wasn\u2019t affectionate either but he seemed to really like it. He was about 2ft in height so it worked. I wish I had more time with him.",
            "I read to our dogs. So does my wife and our (now) adult daughter. \n\nMy wife started doing this two months before our daughter was born. A Schippereke/ Spitz mix dog showed up at our doorstep and velcroed herself to my wife. Actually, the dog velcroed herself to my wife's pregnant abdomen. My wife and I had been reading to our as yet born child and my wife included our dog .\n\n\nThey seem to like it. One of our rescue dogs (a lab / sheep dog mix ?) loves to lie down beside me, then move onto my lap, and then kind of spills over to the other side when his sister, a rescue shepherd mix?,  sits where her brother was.\n\nAll this time, I am reading, telling them they what good dogs they are, and how lucky we are to have them living with us forever., and giving them all the rubs they want. (We've had our shepherd mix 3 months and our lab/sheep? mix a month and a half.)\n\nUsually, he falls asleep half on me and half off me, at least for a short while. She usually gets up and makes her rounds to check on the rest of the household members before grabbing a chew toy and lying on one of her beds.\n\n\n Hope this helps or gives you an idea",
            "Most dogs can only tolerate about 10-15 minutes of training, so you can do two sessions each day if you have time.

My dogs liked training classes and practice, it\u2019s like a game where they win cookies.\n\nYou have a teenager, that doesn\u2019t help. It\u2019ll pass though.",
            "Do more of what you want to do and allow her to be in your space. That\u2019s what I started doing. I actually didn\u2019t start liking my dog until she hit around 14 months because she also isn\u2019t affectionate, has an attention span the size of a crumb, and prefers to be up all day instead of resting (which is anxious energy imo), so I switched things up. I slowed tf down and added more structured walks to our day. During structured walks, we heel basically the entire time, aside from using the bathroom, to really focus on engagement. After those walks, we chill. She\u2019s pretty active, so she\u2019s gotta get some sort of rough play in during the day, which I\u2019ll usually do in the evenings when it\u2019s cooler, but other than that \u2014 I really just started chilling. And ignoring her more lol. Sounds horrible, but I can\u2019t show up as a good \u201cmother\u201d if I\u2019m tired. So I draw more boundaries now. If I wanna sit on the couch and watch tv and you have been fed, walked, and have used the bathroom, I\u2019m sitting my ass on the couch and watching tv lmao, feel free to join me haha",
            "I find the most rewarding thing for me, and I think for my girls too (Ukrainian rescues) is both working on and enjoying walks. There is training involved, in that I am working on loose leash walking as well as things like learning to come back around a tree and then continuing to sniff, i.e managing their own leash. Untangling themselves from their leash too. And then also some low key parkour, so I'll cue a Hup Hup for jumping over a log in the forest or up on to a wall, or going up the ladder on a kids play structure. And often I do the thing too, so I'll climb up on top of a stump or a table and then call the dog up (if they don't just jump up) and then maybe we walk down the log. Just lots of small physical challenges that we take on together. And the \"training\" is treats on occasion but mostly it's just a verbal calm Thank You or excited Well Done! I think dogs basically smell the emotion and 20,000+ years of selective breeding means dogs generally want to get that approval from humans.  \nWe also do lots of Dog's Choice walks, where we will come to an intersection and I will let the dog decide which way we go. Or even I will turn for home and the dog will basically balk gently, and I'll take the hint that she isn';t ready to go home yet. Lots of sniffing too, to the point where I will often let the dog take me off into the rough so she can sniff what she wants.  \nAnd I am in a flat on the 8th floor, and we have been working on things like getting out of the building calmly (easier for one than the other) and both are getting better at running down a single flight of stairs, then turning and stopping (with or without a Wait, depending on the dog) and then as I get to the landing I tell them OK! and they run down to the next landing. It becomes a game for the dog to run, then turn and check in and hold until the next OK! and I really love the checkin at each landing. Then we often take the elevator back up, and my crazy Tasmanian Devil has learned to just offer a down as we wait for the elevator and again inside. Given her history that choice almost brings me to tears, but the point is we just have lots of opportunities every day.  \nThe point being, there's a lot of opportunity on a walk for each to do things the other appreciates, and to show that appreciation, and that's all great bonding time. And often I see things I would have missed. Paths I might not have taken, wildlife I never would have noticed. Or there's moments where Mia is just scenting the wind and all I can do is wonder what she is gleaning from that wind that is so interesting. But she loves doing it and I love noticing how much she loves doing it, so woot!",

            "Apologies if this has already been mentioned. You mention she clocks out after 10 minutes of obedience training. An easy-peasy way to keep her more engaged is to shorten the sessions. Go for 5 fabulous fun minutes, but drop several sessions in throughout the day. Short and fun keeps her wanting more. Positive training, of course. I don\u2019t know your skill level at training, but you will want to make sure you are clear in your mind first on the words to use (minimal), body language (make it clean and precise), when to mark and reward (timing truly is everything), and all that good stuff. Lots of great videos on that, and it really helps keep the dogs from getting frustrated. \n\nOnce she gets the hang of it she\u2019ll realize \u201cHey! Training is FUN, and I don\u2019t want the fun to stop!\u201d Don\u2019t be greedy - you never want her to lose interest. Learning to learn is actually a skill in itself.\n\nIt\u2019ll also help to mix up the things you\u2019re working on. Some dogs, very smart ones in particular, are easily bored. Don\u2019t spend your five minute session on one skill. I might work a handful of downs, then switch to sits, come back and do another down or two, etc. Best wishes!",

            "I think just spending time with your dog! playing, going for walks. \n\nwhen I lived alone on my off days I would take my dog to this park near my apartment and we would walk the trail. I loved walking across the long bridge and looking at all the turtles in the water. But, we would find a bench that was near that bridge and both just sit and watch the water. My dog always seemed happy to go on these walks so I guess that strengthened our bond! but, my dog also loves just laying on the couch with me while she chews on her toys.",
            "Parallel play. Haha. My dog will ask for attention to get me sitting on the ground, and then go off and do his own thing. And then mope when I go back to the couch. I make sure to hang around him when he's playful, even if he doesn't want my attention or to play with me, because I know he's wanting to be around me. \n\nHe will lay right by me frequently, but doesn't like pets or much attention. Isn't much of a cuddler and only prefers butt scratches sometimes.  \n\nI love him. I do find that walks and training sessions in the yard or living room are nice for bonding.",
            "I've had my rescue 2 years now, and he was about 1 year old when we got him.\n\nAt first he wanted almost nothing to do with us, just to play with our other dog or go to the dog park.\n\nHe wouldn't even sit on the same couch as us lol\n\nHes still not a great cuddler (he tries? But just stand over you, or lays down and gets up again over and over)\n\nBut over time I've come to find he bonds best through playing, and the park lol (he is a dogs dog through and through)\n\nI think every dog is different, but especially rescues. Haply tail says alot. Over the last year my guy has started doing that dopey, open mouthed dog smile a lot more",
            "I take her with me as much as possible. Going to my family\u2019s house? She\u2019s coming too. Going to a cafe? Yeppp she\u2019s keen. Going to pick up my partner from work? Also coming on the lil adventure. Obviously all these things within reason, she doesn\u2019t come with if I\u2019m expecting it to be busy because she\u2019s gets over excited and stops listening which is a problem with a 40kg brick but for the most part, her tagging a long results in her getting to practice her skills in different environments, lets her interact with other people and things, I talk to her quite a lot when I\u2019m driving and she likes to check in with me when she finds something interesting. All the while, I\u2019m her security, I have snacks for her, I get to have fun with her and all it\u2019s putting me out is having to convince her she doesn\u2019t need to be lifted into the car lol.",
            "when he's napping in his bed at my feet, I sometimes get down next to him to give him kisses. He wakes up, sees it's me and immediately turns onto his back for a belly rub.  Also, I noticed he loves giving hugs and lick my ear and bite my hair. It's not something you'd let him do right before you're off to work, but sometimes in the evening I get on the floor so he can slobber all over my ears.",
            "I remember one dog we adopted that was pretty aloof at first. I got her engaged in play finally by putting treats inside a bottle and sort off investigating it with her. I think trying different things to see what really sparks her interest is a good start. And dare to be a bit silly, be enthused about what you are doing. Usually that will get the dogs curious. 10 minute training sessions is long enough for most dog. A good tip (that I'm bad at following myself) is ending the session before the dog loses interest. Ending on a high is always better. \n\nIf she likes fetch and thug it might be a good idea to use play as reward in training. Run through a command or three, than do a game of thug or throw the ball. If you're using treats as rewards, switch up how you give the treats. Having the dog chase you for a treat a bit, or throw it on the ground so the dog has to go search. It's often more engaging for the dog than just being hand fed. \n\nGood inside activities in addition to trick/obedience training are snuffle mats, treat search, food dispensing toys. It's important that it's not too challenging for the dog, so it doesn't give up. These activities don't require that much collaboration between dog and owner. Regardless, I'm convinced that being the one who gives them out and being there to cheer the dog on helps strengthen the relationship.\n\nOn walks it can be fun training some balancing trick. Like getting the dog to jump up and walk along a ledge, jump up on and sit down on a bench etc. That type off training in combination with a ball in my hand means I've got my dog's undivided attention for as long as I can be bothered to train her.",
            "Everyone here will frown on this  probably, but I have Thursday night fights. I wrestle with my dogs for a few hours. Afterwards we lay on the floor together and watch Survivor and share nachos.",
            "walk and hike, get out and do it together and you will form a bond.",
            "I let my puppies snuggle up on either side of me while I read them a book at bedtime. They each have their own blankie they get tucked in to (courtesy of my wife) and once they're comfy I read to them until they fall asleep.\n\nRight now we're on chapter 8 of *The Time Machine* by HG Wells. *Robinson Crusoe* is next. After that, I'll probably take them through *One Thousand and One Nights*. \n\nThey get really restless if papa doesn't read to them at night. There have been a few nights where I get home after their bedtime and when I sit down to read they climb into my lap and just about melt.",
            "My dog and me just chill. We go for walks and take our time, and when I'm in the house and sitting on the couch, I ask him if he wants to come cuddle and he genuinely comes to curl up next to me and I can give him all the pets and scratches, and then I resume whatever I'm doing and he just sleeps peacefully next to me. That's just me tho, and I also play with him like the pause and then sudden movement and pause again he loves that.",

She spent the first few months of her life in a shelter after an irresponsible owner didn\u2019t keep her intact dogs separate and ended up with unwanted puppies. Then she had three different foster homes with several dogs each in the course of two months. Flash forward 10 months after adoption and she seems to understand now that we\u2019re her forever family. Minus some separation anxiety which we\u2019re still working on, she\u2019s the happiest little girl. I don\u2019t think her tail has stopped wagging since we brought her home!",

Unfortunately, in my area, the hiking trails aren\u2019t exactly safe for a young woman and her tiny dog. I\u2019ve been trying to get my brother to come with me, but our schedules have yet to line up.\n\nShe does love running though! Specifically, she loves chase games where we take turns chasing each other in the backyard. I\u2019ve ran with her on our walks a few times and she\u2019s loved that too! Running works!!",

            "This is a great tip! A lot of the time when I\u2019m training her, I\u2019m focusing on one thing. I thought the consistency would help her get it down, but it may be the reason she loses interest so fast! Never thought of it that way! As far as the shorter more frequent training sessions, I\u2019ll have to try that as well! I\u2019m new to dog training, as my only other dog came to us pretty much trained already. Thanks for the tips!!",
            "Yeah the tail is telling you she\u2019s already bonded. She found her person. \n\nI feel closely bonded to dogs I share a bed with. Those soft moments in the morning when you\u2019re kinda sleep cuddling are the best. I adopted a 16 yo deaf poodle that was pretty rough off and once I got her clipped and cuddled her in bed it was like I\u2019d had her all 16 years. She was cleaned up and squared away, and she could sleep right up against me if she wanted. Generally I have very small dogs (<10lb) so I put a cuddle bed on top of my bed so they have their own space, but current dog prefers to sleep under the covers against my calves. Not sure how she breathes under there but she\u2019s not dead yet. \n\nAgility is another very cool idea. You can get a cheap kit from Amazon if you can\u2019t start classes yet. It\u2019s thrilling when they figure it out.",

        "content": "\\*\\*Introduction\\*\\*\n\n\n\n1)Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?\n\n\n\n\\* This will be my first dog that I will have full responsibility over. Grew up around hunting dogs and schnauzers\n\n\n\n2)Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \\[reputable breeder\\]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?\n\n\n\n\\* Rescue dog for certain. Financially and ethically correct.\n\n\n\n3)Describe your ideal dog.\n\n\n\n\\* My ideal dog is one that I feel lucky to have. A sweet, loving dog that is down for whatever. My gf and I currently have a cat who is a rescue (and unfortunately completely declawed), so a dog that works well with a cat is preferred. I want a dog that can roam the countryside as our house is on a large plot of land (15 acres) and get along with the other small dogs that live outside our neighbors house.\n\n\n\n4)What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?\n\n\n\n\\* I really want a large breed of dog. I can deal with medium just fine. I despise most small breeds of dogs. I want a dog with character, one that can react well with my future children. \n\n\n\n5)What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?\n\n\n\n\\* Basic tricks. Not tooo concerned with tricks. \n\n\n\n6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?\n\n\n\n\\* As much as a sport of walking around and playing fetch is. I'm a professional btw.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Care Commitments\\*\\*\n\n\n\n  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?\n\n\n\n\\* Lots of inside play definitely. Probably 1+ hour a day \n\n\n\n8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  \n\n\n\n\\* Exercise 1+ hour a day. In the nice weather it will likely be outside for 2+ hours daily.\n\n\n\n9)How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?\n\n\n\n\\* I'm okay with weekly brushing. Our cat needs almost daily brushing. I would prefer weekly but twice a week works okay too. I'm open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, and cutting nails at home. \n\n\n\n\\*\\*Personal Preferences\\*\\*\n\n\n\n10)What size dog are you looking for?\n\n\n\n\\* Likely medium to large\n\n\n\n11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?\n\n\n\n\\* Shedding is ok (just want lighter haired dogs haha), barking minimal at night, slobber is preferred not to be a water faucet.\n\n\n\n12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?\n\n\n\n\\* Highly important. This would make our life so much easier if we didn't worry about our dog running away.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Dog Personality and Behavior\\*\\*\n\n\n\n13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?\n\n\n\n\\* Personal space works, but okay with cuddling with it at night.\n\n\n\n14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that\u2019s more eager-to-please?\n\n\n\n\\* do its own thing for sure\n\n\n\n15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  \n\n\n\n\\* My dog should alert any to any stranger or coyote (we only have one neighbor that they would be close to. out in the countryside.) I want my dog to greet non-suspicious people with neutrality or friendliness. Non-aggressive for non-suspicious (not sure if thats too much to ask. not the biggest priority tbh)\n\n\n\n16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?\n\n\n\n\\* I would like it to not be aggressive to other dogs. A stalwart dog in the face of trouble would be nice. \n\n\n\n17) Are there any other behaviors you can\u2019t deal with or want to avoid?\n\n\n\n\\* I dislike dogs that are aggressive, anxious, biters, and growlers\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Lifestyle\\*\\*\n\n\n\n18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?\n\n\n\n\\* We both will work full time jobs in the near future. So 7:30am-5:30am on average\n\n\n\n19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? \n\n\n\n\\* They want a family dog. They like golden retrievers. I like golden retrievers but something a little more interesting I am more akin to. Their involvement will be just as much as mine.\n\n\n\n20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?\n\n\n\n\\* We will have a declawed rescue cat front and back :( that is around 3 years old. Very chill cat who is timid to strangers and other animals. Opens up eventually to them. A long haired almost mainecoon esque cat. Always interrupting conversations, dinner, etc...\n\n\n\n21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?\n\n\n\n\\* Eventaully, yes\n\n\n\n22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?\n\n\n\n\\* No plans on renting\n\n\n\n23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?\n\n\n\n\\* USA baby. no restrictions probably\n\n\n\n24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?\n\n\n\n\\* Summer is 80-105, Winter is 40-60. We have snow storms and below freezing weather. We are in a very dry area. No humidity. Plenty of thunderstorms but overall pretty sunny and dry.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Additional Information and Questions\\*\\*\n\n\n\n25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.\n\n\n\n\\* We will be living in a trailer house on 15 acres of land.

            "To summarize, it sounds like you want a friendly, relaxed, confident, independent dog that's cat-friendly. It also needs to be lower-energy and lower-maintenance, based on the amount of time you plan to spend with them, the amount of exercise you plan to provide, and the fact this is the first dog you'll be fully responsible. Finally, you would like the dog to be comfortable spending a fair amount of time outside. (I hope you have comfortable shelters outside, and that you'll bring the dogs inside for extreme weather like summer heat.) \n\nAre you planning on getting a puppy or adult? Puppies are A LOT of work, and can be incredibly overwhelming for first-time dog owners. Puppies are also very needy and need a lot of time/attention (way more than the 1-2 hours a day you've described) for at least the first year. Based on what you've written here, I'd advise against a puppy. \n\nAs for specific breeds: labs and retriever mixes could be a good fit, as long as they're mature (when young, they often need more exercise and attention). A medium-sized schnauzer/mix could also work if they're cat-friendly (my schnauzer is wonderful and confident and fairly independent and LOVES spending time outside, but she's got a strong prey drive and will chase cats). With adult rescues and mixes, it's more about the individual dog's personality than the specific breeds in the mix, so I'd recommend not ruling out any dogs on breed or mix alone;  instead, focus on age and specific behavior/characteristics.",
            "Honestly, an inside dog would be awesome. I hate not being able to see my dogs while I am inside doing work, hanging out, etc...\n\nA 1-2 Year old dog would be a good fit. No puppies here. \n\nI have ADHD and having a dog that can adapt to my situation will help me feel like I have loved and cared for it enough. \n\nI will take your advice of matching a dog's personality/age to my needs, rather than a specific mix. I like the lab/retriever breed, especially a mix to make sure it is a healthy (er) dog. \n\nThank you for the lengthy reply. It makes finding a dog that would suit my situation much easier."
