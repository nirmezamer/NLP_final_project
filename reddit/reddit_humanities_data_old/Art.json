The commonality of the reports seem to be that they have been trying to use the Android reddit app to post. So if this problem has been bugging you, please report it to Reddit in the android app store. Until it's fixed you can post your art in the web browser on a computer.\n\nAnd yes, we know the app seemingly allows posting on other subs, and not on /r/Art. But the iPhone app works fine (tested myself). It probably has to do with the title requirements that this sub has, it uses a thing called regex, and I suspect this title requirement is causing the android app to not function correctly.",

EVERYTHING- not just reddit or this sub] \n\n -- ANYWAYYYS, ahh thanks for the notifying!! I was recently having (still am actually), completely unexplainable and unrelated troubles with my phone, my internet/data (not allowing me to go on normal websites IE googles homepage even or YouTube, and Cashapp not working or contactless payments in general etc)\ud83e\udd74\ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab\ud83e\udd74\ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab at the exact same time when I tried to make a post and it wouldn't allow me.\nNeedless to say I- understandably so; thought it was correlating to this much larger issue with my phone & have been in constant contact with Google support, Cashapp, Android Customer Service, etc-- long story short...\nUpon the 17th time explaining my situation and the billion random albeit super debilitating issues with my phone & account/inaccessibility to yet another CS rep (different one each time)- he told me that the only explanation that he actually has was that he doesn't have one and has no idea himself why this was happening to me and was just as stumped as i, myself.. AND I'm a web[3]/software engineer & dev so its been even more frustrating..\nBut the same man from India (as he explained later), also told me that he can assure me that he was recently trying to utilize the art sub-reddit and couldn't post either & we actually connected & had a 15 min additional, non-issue related, totally comforting conversation via our similar online presences & intrigues and come to find out he was also a NFT artist & had actually, outbid me on a Low Effort Punk a couple weeks ago.\n\nRandom issue entirely, random conversation, random coincidence, but it made me a little less hostile & angry at my phone and life in general that I'd be able to rest assured my issue/glitch with the sub-thread (Reddit in general really), was at the very least; not just my own frustration and experience and that it would handle itself eventually. \nAnd it has.

I'm sure it's real but it kind of feels like an intentionally confusing AI art prompt where separately things make sense but altogether it makes little to no sense.

            "I love the attention to detail in the eyes!! It looks really good especially since you\u2019re new to oil pastels. I could never lol",

            "That\u2019s a cool interpretation of my carving, going for more of a naturalism while having fun with forced perspective, but I do love sci-fi. This sub only allows one picture and no miscellaneous objects in them, so I\u2019m showing sculpture front and back with the two Jay carvings. Might be fun to get weird with painting the backside with circuitry and such.",

            "Harpy-eagle (harpia harpyja) on the branch of brazil nut tree (Bertholletia excelsa). Watercolor.\n\nThe harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) is a sight to behold. With a height of up to 3.5 feet and a wingspan reaching 8 feet, it is one of the largest birds of prey on Earth. Females are significantly larger than males, weighing between 15-20 pounds compared to the males' 9-11 pounds. Both sexes boast a striking appearance with a prominent crest of feathers that can rise when the bird is alert. They have incredibly strong talons, even larger than those of a grizzly bear, capable of lifting prey as heavy as a sheep.\n\nThese eagles are masters of their environment, perfectly adapted for hunting in dense rainforests. Their diet consists mainly of arboreal animals like monkeys, sloths, and other birds. They are incredibly strong, able to lift prey over three-quarters of their own weight! Harpy eagles are ambush predators, relying on short, swift attacks and a combination of powerful wingbeats and gliding to navigate the forest canopy.\n\nHarpy eagles are monogamous, mating for life. They build their nests high up in the tallest trees, sometimes over 130 feet above the ground. These majestic birds play a crucial role in the rainforest ecosystem, but sadly, they are facing a growing threat due to habitat loss. Deforestation for agriculture removes the large trees they need for nesting and hunting.\n\nThe harpy eagle is a powerful symbol of the beauty and fragility of our natural world. We must work to protect this magnificent creature and its rainforest home for future generations."
