Thank you for joining us!**\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally changed the relationship kids have with social media, which has become a space that teenagers increasingly turn to for socializing, trying out emerging identities and seeking advice. As the risk of mental health problems has risen with the time youth spend online, we looked at ways that parents, experts and young adults themselves have suggested to navigate better between digital and non-digital worlds. ***Join us today, June 18, at 12 p.m. ET.***\n\n**Who is here:**\n\n* Expert: Dr. David Bickham research director at Boston Children's Hospital's Digital Wellness Lab. Bickham\u2019s research explores media as an environmental factor that can influence children\u2019s physical, psychological, social, and academic well-being.\n* Barbara Ortutay, a technology reporter at the AP.\n* Jocelyn Gecker, an education reporter at the AP.\n\n**More from the series:**\n\n* [Keeping children safe on social media: What parents should know to protect their kids](https://apnews.com/article/social-media-kids-teens-instagram-tiktok-parents-safety-45df57c32384207ffedc463870b8a6d2)",

Do you think laws banning or limiting teenager access to these platforms could even be effective, let alone a good idea in the first place? I'm strongly of two minds on this subject, would really like to know what you think!",
            "As a millennial, I\u2019ve been able to be right in the middle of social media\u2019s exploding popularity and was caught up in the \u201csocial status\u201d of it growing up. I was worried about friends/followers/what I posted and how people would view me. \n\nAs I got older, I got out of that thought process and began to avoid it like the plague. It began to seem like a rat race to me that I wasn\u2019t interested in and looking back, can definitely see some of the mental health effects y\u2019all wrote about. \n\n*My question is, with it still being in the infancy of what we know about the long term effects, what can be done to address its impacts?* I just saw something recently about wanting to pair a warning with negative effects of social media just like smoking. \n\nI just turned 30 and have eradicated most social media. I recently got back on IG and the reels reel me in sometimes. *But more than anything, what I realize now is that the former want to check social media and what\u2019s new has proliferated into everyday life. I\u2019ll check my phone constantly now, that has minimal social media, like you check the fridge over and over again hoping something you want is in there* \n\n*Are there plans to look at long term negative effects down the road of social media/technology and its impact on teens as they grow older?*",
            "Q to **Dr. Bickham**: Are you comfortable with the title of this post, which makes it sound like the AMA is with two AP beat reporters? Were you involved in this decision? (If not, would you have preferred a title that focused more on the expertise that you can uniquely provide?)",
            "How many of the negatives are so ingrained into social media from the start? I haven\u2019t used some popular sites social media in over 10 years and the dark patterns definitely existed then. Can social media where most interactions are with people we don\u2019t know be healthy while still \u201cfiltering\u201d content to be what we\u2019re interested in?",
            "Any general suggestions to parents? What to look out for, what to do when the topic comes up with younger children, or even just general best practices?",
            "Do you see evidence or believe that certain major events or daily interactions would have been/be drastically without the presence of social media? Do the kids you talk to ever consider this? \n\nFor example, the recent campus protests. Protest happens, but did the drive to make content change the nature of SOME (not all but some) of the protesters to possibly go to greater lengths to stand out on social media? And what about more every day interactions? Do teens feel that arguments/incidents being filmed and posted are keeping people in check or do they see how it may distort the full version of what happened? I guess this is just a \"how much of social media do they see as real life\" question?",
            "At what point should society as a whole ban these types of applications because of the visible damage they do?   Can you picture a social media app that wouldn\u2019t have detrimental effects, and what might that look like?",

            "In our surveys of young people, they are pretty positive in terms of the perceived impact of social media on different aspects of their lives.\u00a0 They especially see it as enhancing their friendships and peer relationships, but even with issues related to mental health (we asked about their mood) more say that it is helpful than say it is harmful. \n\nThere are a couple important exceptions. Many young people said social media makes them feel worse about their body and worsens their attention span.\u00a0 Also more than 50% said they were at least \u201csomewhat addicted\u201d to screen media. 58% said that they use an app or tool on \\[their\\] phone or tablet that tracks how long \\[they\\] use it. So they seem to be working to be aware of their use and potentially reduce it. \n\nIn other studies and conversations it is clear that they are very thoughtful about the impact of these platforms on their lives. They can often give specific examples of pretty negative experiences (at least ones that they witness even if it doesn\u2019t happen to them), and they tend to want to find the types of online social spaces that are civil and not toxic.\u00a0 I\u2019m optimistic that the youth themselves will help drive change in this area as they move toward the types of places that give them the types of experiences they are looking for.\u00a0\n\n\u2014 DB",
            "This is a great question. Kids know that too much social media is bad for them. In our interviews with teens, we have found they agree with research that says too much time spent online makes kids feel anxious or depressed or lonely or sad. We have spoken with several groups of pre-teens and teenagers, and they all say they find it hard to put down their phones but they wish they didn't spend so much time online. Kids agree that there should be limits because it is too hard for them to control the amount of time they spend online.\n\nIf you want to know more, we let many teens and young adults share what they wish they\u2019d known about social media, here: [https://apnews.com/article/influenced-social-media-mental-health-advice-620e277528728498c1202690d0512f85](https://apnews.com/article/influenced-social-media-mental-health-advice-620e277528728498c1202690d0512f85)\n\n \u2014\u00a0JG",
            "like asking drug addicts themselves what they think about the drugs and efforts around understanding its dangers. Asking them what are there ideas around reducing usage; what are their thoughts when presented with info on negative mental and physical health effects of drugs? and if they buy it?",
            "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a single answer for what apps are more harmful than others. Kids we spoke to had different answers. For some, it\u2019s TikTok because of its endless scrolling and addictive algorithm. For some it\u2019s Instagram, where posts from influencers promote unrealistic beauty standards. For some, especially boys, the answer is video games, or YouTube. Even location-tracking apps can raise concerns \u2013 for instance, is it healthy for teenagers in a relationship to constantly track each other\u2019s location? At the same time, kids also spoke about finding positive messages about body image on Instagram, about finding new hobbies through TikTok and YouTube. So the answer can vary from person to person.\n\n\u2014BO",
            " When talking about social media apps, while the platforms may vary, some of them share features which would be more or less cause for concern. For example, your question mentioned scrolling through videos vs messaging, which is a great comparison to start with! Some researchers call these active and passive social media use, and active social media use, like engaging directly with content and friends, might be more beneficial than simply scrolling through videos on something like your For You page. However, there have been recent criticisms of this model, like that it doesn\u2019t necessarily consider other factors like individual differences between users and of the content they see (examples of articles that challenge the active/passive hypothesis: [Does Passive Social Media Use Harm Well-Being?: An Adversarial Review: Journal of Media Psychology: Vol 35, No 3 (hogrefe.com)](https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/full/10.1027/1864-1105/a000358); [Social Media Browsing and Adolescent Well-Being: Challenging the \u201cPassive Social Media Use Hypothesis\u201d | Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication | Oxford Academic (oup.com)](https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/27/1/zmab015/6413702?login=true)). \n\nThinking about content specifically, some topics may affect some users in more harmful ways \u2013 scrolling through cat videos might cause very different feelings than scrolling through videos of influencers with the \u201cperfect\u201d body; Our research shows that almost half of teens feel like social media can make them feel worse about their bodies. However, messaging with friends and making connections online can have great positive effects for young people, and in the same Pulse Survey, 69% of teens said social media at least sometimes made them feel supported by their peers ([Adolescent Media Use: Attitudes, Effects, and Online Experiences - The Digital Wellness Lab](https://digitalwellnesslab.org/pulse-surveys/adolescent-media-use-attitudes-effects-and-online-experiences/)). This can be especially important for those who might not feel like they have a strong support network in \u201creal life\u201d ([\u201cI'm Kinda Stuck at Home With Unsupportive Parents Right Now\u201d: LGBTQ Youths' Experiences With COVID-19 and the Importance of Online Support - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X20303116)).\n\n\u2014DB",

            "There has certainly been a shift in the last few years, especially since the COVID lockdowns accelerated teens\u2019 (and parents\u2019) technology use, and because there has been more attention from the public, the media and lawmakers about the dangers of social media. Young people we spoke to were very aware of the addictive nature of scrolling through TikTok or Instagram, about the negative self-views and social comparisons they invite, although nearly all of them still said this didn\u2019t stop them from using it. Some said they just couldn\u2019t.\u00a0 Older teens tended to be more concerned and more likely to try to put limits on their own social media use. Experts told us that tracks with young people\u2019s brain development, which is why they say 13 is probably too early for kids to get on these apps.\n\nThere is also a growing cohort of parents who are trying to limit \u2013 or even ban \u2013 social media until their kids are older, as Jocelyn explored in her[ story](https://apnews.com/article/influenced-social-media-teens-mental-health-e32f82d46ea74b807c9099d61aec25d5).\u00a0 But they are in the minority. There is an economic disparity in that families who earn more money and parents who have higher education levels tend to be more concerned about children\u2019s technology use. \n\nOne college student I spoke to pointed out that parents who work multiple jobs or are immigrants have a harder time giving kids social media lessons and teaching them how to place limits on technology. But there are a growing number of nonprofits that are trying to even out the playing field. Julie Scelfo, the founder of \u00a0Mothers Against Media Addiction, told me this: \u201cWhat I find is in talking to families who are poor, they want their child to have every advantage. And the perception is that technology is an advantage. And so they don't want their kids \u2018left behind.\u2019 But the work we're doing at MAMA is to try and sort of explode that myth.\u201d \n\n\u2014\u00a0BO",
            "On Monday, the U.S. Surgeon General called on Congress to add cigarette-like warning labels on social media. Pediatricians, parents, educators, even kids themselves have been asking lawmakers to regulate these platforms for years. After all, we have safety standards for toys, car seats \u2013 even the food children eat. And yet, the last federal law aimed at protecting children online was enacted in 1998, six years before Facebook\u2019s founding. It has become clear that tech companies, whose profits depend on keeping their users on their platforms as long as possible in order to make money from ads, are not going to self-regulate in a meaningful way.\n\nBut I am not sure bans and limits are the answer. Kids always find a way to get around bans \u2013 just ask them, or their parents. I talked to kids who say their schools ban phones, so kids get fake, old or broken phones to turn in in the morning. Then they keep tabs on their actual phone from their pocket or backpack or an Apple watch.\u00a0\n\nAge verification on social media can run into all sorts of privacy issues, and parents will still start accounts for their kids when they ask for it and lie about their ages. Some experts say it makes more sense to have platforms designed with kids\u2019 safety and mental health in mind. For instance, why can\u2019t Instagram shut off access to minors after 10 p.m.? Meta has limited how adult strangers can contact minors on its platforms (adults over 19, for instance, can\u2019t message kids who don\u2019t follow them). But there\u2019s a lot more to be done on this front, and there\u2019s general agreement among experts that regulation would help with that.\n\nAnother point that people forget sometimes is that there isn\u2019t some magic switch at 18 that turns people into responsible technology users. Adults, parents, have a lot of issues with social media overuse as well. So if we don\u2019t prepare our kids to live in this world, what happens when they turn 18 and suddenly have unlimited access to everything? I wrote about this[ here](https://apnews.com/article/influenced-social-media-teens-mental-health-5d6bcdccd154acd631ab09023e81b369).\u00a0\n\n\u2014BO",
            "There is considerable scientific research being conducted to better understand the impact of social media and other forms of technology use. Some of it is longitudinal: it follows the same people over time. The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study ([https://abcdstudy.org/](https://abcdstudy.org/))\u00a0 is looking at brain development during adolescence and has some measures of technology use (although it would benefit from measuring more details of this use). \n\nSome early findings show how some types of screen use is related to sleep disturbances: [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352721823000347](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352721823000347)\u00a0\n\nThere are other people who are doing shorter-term studies and looking more deeply into how different types of social media use and experiences impact mental health and development. Even this work, however, makes it hard to really understand if it is the use that causes these outcomes.\u00a0 It could be that underlying issues (like existing risks for depression or ADHD) lead to both more use of technology and worse outcomes.\u00a0 \n\nAll that said, we have enough information to start encouraging certain behaviors that are likely to reduce negative impacts.\u00a0 Using social media to connect with friends and develop relationships is likely a positive use.\u00a0 Being a critical and intentional user, has the potential to avoid some of the biggest pitfalls. We also work closely with the tech industry to translate our research findings into recommendations about design choices that can encourage healthier use.\n\n\u2014DB",
            "I\u2019m happy to be here to help support the AP team and chime in with some thoughts based on my research and experience! I tend to leave the job of writing post headlines and similar things to the journalists who are definitely experts in that kind of thing.\u00a0\n\n\u2014\u00a0DB",
            "Social media is not only constantly evolving, the definition is broadening. Sites like YouTube or TikTok might not look like typical social media, but they play key roles in how young people interact online.\u00a0 We just did a study on social gaming, which really needs to be considered more in this conversation in general since so many young people interact on these sites.\u00a0 So it\u2019s hard to say negatives are ingrained in anything since there are so many different platforms using widely different approaches to engage users. \n\nThere are even social media platforms that are designed to encourage authenticity and positive, encouraging posts.\u00a0 I would say that interactions with known friends are likely the type that hold the most potential for positive outcomes, so places where that is limited or not enhanced through design should be considered carefully. There are likely more and less healthy ways to utilize sites that are directing you toward content determined by algorithms.\u00a0 Being aware of the potential negative/extreme bias of this type of content and its associated comments can help people critically think about what they see.\n\n\u2014\u00a0DB",
            "You might have seen that yesterday, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called for social media platforms to have warning labels, like cigarettes do, saying that social media use can harm to teenage mental health. That would require Congress to pass a law.\n\nIn the meantime, experts have a variety of suggestions for parents. Many experts suggest parents delay giving kids smart phones and social media until middle school. And when kids are given access to social media, to start slowly. In other words, allow one platform, not all. And to set time limits.\n\nMany experts also suggest that phones not be allowed in bedrooms at night to ensure better sleep habits. Some suggest when kids are doing homework to keep phones at a distance, because of the constant distraction posed by notifications.  \u2014JG\n\nHere is an AP article with more tips for parents: [https://apnews.com/article/social-media-warning-murthy-tobacco-061a97b8ee95da1296fb2b7e09607c0a](https://apnews.com/article/social-media-warning-murthy-tobacco-061a97b8ee95da1296fb2b7e09607c0a)",
            "First, there are really good tools available that allow you to engage with how your child uses different platforms. These settings and tools are sometimes built into the device (e.g. the phone operating system like Apple\u2019s Family and Screen Time functions), and sometimes part of the platform.\u00a0 Unfortunately, they can sometimes be difficult to find and tricky to implement, but it\u2019s worth digging into, especially at key moments like a child\u2019s first phone or setting up a social media profile. Second, remember that children\u2019s media use is learned from watching how other people in their lives use it.\u00a0 Set up household expectations about use by modeling that use. Remember that adolescents are building autonomy and independence and will push against limitations to those. So be sure to include them in the discussion about what your family sees as healthy and beneficial ways to use technology, best to start these well before they are teenagers.\u00a0 Then create rules that are consistent with these discussions and, whenever relevant, follow those rules yourself (kids are much likely to break rules they consider unfair). Overall remember that the most beneficial approach to parenting is consistent, enforceable rules/expectations combined with an environment of love and support. Applying that approach in general is shown to lead to more positive and less risky online behaviors.\u00a0\n\n\u2013\n\nThe conversation can start when children are young, but might look different and focus on different aspects of social media as they grow.

            "Many of the teens and young adults we spoke with say they realize social media portrays life in a way that is altered or not real. They say they know that the beautiful faces, the thin bodies they see on social media posts could be filtered and altered. But they also say it is almost impossible not to compare themselves to what they are seeing online. Even the older teenagers we spoke with talked about how they are aware that what they're seeing is not real with 20-20 hindsight, yet it's hard to distinguish in the moment what is real and what's not. That wisdom also comes with age. Younger kids in elementary and middle school are not yet exercising the same amount of critical thinking. The kids we have spoken with say that social media also stirs a degree of drama at school and among friends that would not take place otherwise. Kids are more mean on social media than they would be in person. That said, social media also offers an outlet for marginalized groups that might not exist in their real-life communities. Kids who identify as LGBTQ+, for example, say they have found communities online that they don't have at school. \n\n  \n\u2014JG",

A middle ground might be an AI system that can at least identify whether an image is pornographic before automatically removing it.  But that would still be subject to abuse.  What is to stop an activist from going to pornhub and (using multiple accounts to avoid detection) flagging EVERYTHING as a deepfake?  It's still porn, so it would pass the initial plausibility check, and that creates the difficult task of identifying exactly who is in it, whether they are a real person who has consented to be in it, etc.  Unless you are meeting in person with someone, or at least doing a video conference with both the accuser and the uploader to make sure that nobody is using a filter/AI to make it appear that they are the person in the video, it isn't a straight forward issue to say who is telling the truth.\n\nAll this is to say that the goal of the legislation is good, but that there are potentially unintended consequences that could have a very chilling effect.",

It's better to just stay away from it in order to play it safe which is what schools are  made to be --safe spaces. \n\nThe problem is that this then results in widespread ignorance about basic legal concepts such as why there are explicit free speech protections for otherwise obscene language and imagery when it is in the context of parody or satire. It's not the content that matters, it's the intent. This is something that most people cannot begin to comprehend because they're taught in the safest manner possible because, again, the real function of schools in the US is to be safe spaces for daycare and has little to do with actual education which is dangerous and inappropriate for a school setting.",

Handley (2008)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Handley?wprov=sfla1), Christopher Handley was prosecuted for **possession** of explicit lolicon manga. The judge ruled that two parts of the act that were broader than the Miller standard, 1466A a(2) and b(2), were unconstitutionally overbroad as applied specifically to this case, but Handley still faced an obscenity charge. Handley was convicted in May 2009 as the result of entering a guilty plea bargain at the recommendation of his attorney, under the belief that the jury chosen to judge him would not acquit him of the obscenity charges if they were shown the images in question.\n\nA later ruling in [United States v. Dean (2011)](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-11th-circuit/1559738.html) called the overbreadth ruling into question because the Handley case failed to prove that 1466A a(2) and b(2) were substantially overbroad on their face; Dean was convicted under the sections previously deemed unconstitutional due to the fact that the overbroadth claim in Handley was an as-applied overbroadth challenge, and was **therefore limited to the facts and circumstances of that case**, whereas in Dean the defendant was charged under 1466A a(2) for possession of material constituting actual child pornography, which does not require a finding of obscenity, and was read to fall within the language of the relevant statute. The facts of this case precluded Dean from satisfying the substantive due process requirements to satisfy a proper facial challenge against the relevant statutes.\n\nSo as long as the courts can prove \"obscenity\", which should be pretty obvious in the case of deepfakes. Then the PROTECT Act can stand.",
            "That's going to be up the jury. But I'm going to lean to yes. \n\nLet's say you were on the jury and were handed screenshots of a text convo between the kid that made the deepfake and a group of his peers. In the convo is the deepfake, and a whole bunch of obscene texts saying things like \"ooh I'd love to fuck her\", \"wish I could stick my dick in that\", \"HOTTT AF\", etc.\n\nWould you consider this a sexual situation? Would you determine this as obscene?\n\nPornography is about context. A personal picture of a naked woman at a nudist colony is not the same as a picture of a naked woman on pornhub.\n\nEDIT: This is the legal definition of child pornography.\n\n>(8) \u201cchild pornography\u201d means any visual depiction, including any photograph, film, video, picture, or computer or computer-generated image or picture, whether made or produced by electronic, mechanical, or other means, of sexually explicit conduct, where\u2014 (A) the production of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct; (B) such visual depiction is a digital image, computer image, or computer-generated image that is, or is indistinguishable from, that of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct; or (C) such visual depiction has been created, adapted, or modified to appear that an identifiable minor is engaging in sexually explicit conduct.",

Free speech isn't really just \"speech\" it's freedom of opinion and creation and the right to share it with whoever wants to listen.\n\nFreedom of speech applies to drawings, artwork, books, music, even actions like flag burning. If (theoretically corruptible) people have to decide on a case by case basis if every piece of art created is porn or not porn, and people can get criminal charges for it, upholding the first amendment becomes way more complicated.

Because not only is 16 the age of majority in most US states, it's also the age of majority when adjusted by population (~16.7, actually). So now you need to prove that the person watching/distributing the animated pornography is aware that the character is 15 years or younger. Which is a pretty high bar to meet. It would be all too easy to make the claim that they thought the character was older based on X (for example, the 1200 year old dragon trope).\n\nI could be wrong on this, but this was my understanding.",

More importantly, wouldn't that just mean that any fictional character that had similar physical characteristics to any real life adult could be said to look like an adult? It's just a fact that there are people that look far younger or far older than average for their age, and realistically there are many characters that look obviously young but aren't outside what the extremes of real people can look like either."

If you have more growth, a stable profit margin is ok.  You can't go backwards or stay still.  If you are making x amount of dollars from employee y, then you can't increase their pay without increasing the revenue you receive from said employee.  If you increase what you are billing your customers, you will lose total sales/revenue.. and that's the only thing that is making your narrowing profit margin seem reasonable, so you can't lose sales.. since you can't lose sales you can't increase pay.\n\nWhat the MBA misses is that that person leaves and you hire someone else for 20% more and still charge the client the same amount of money.  Which pushes your margins even narrower, which forces you to react by trying to increase revenue.  It's a death spiral and I swear every company I've been a part of has been in this death spiral.

In previous eras when you purchased a form of media, say a book or a VHS Tape or a Music CD; legally you did not own the right to the work itself but you were granted ownership of the copy you purchased.

Congress refuses to push nearby California or Arizona on this, Congress refuses to underwrite plants with national security loans, and Congress refuses to outright buy last-gen plans so the US govt itself can operate them as the TVA has done successfully for fifty years. We need TVAs for the San Joaquin, Pecos and South Platte rivers amongst others. This is the only way the US govt can reliably build NPPs now. It'd also let us stop giving farmers our water for free, encouraging more sustainable agriculture and killing mcdonalds.",

Neither party really champions nuclear energy at this point, and the general population still has some lingering uneasiness around the concept.\n\n\nCracking open the door for technology research without directly funding new plants is a good way to start the conversation without tripping over any latent fears people have. Easing into it gives time for people to become more informed and maybe lose that fear.",
            "The economic problems are caused by excessive regulation.\n\nWe want the safety regulations, those are good. The problem is that the regulations go far beyond safety to the point of being impossible to comply with, and then any projects get stuck for decades battling bad faith lawsuits intended only to delay and bankrupt the project.\n\nPhysically building a nuclear power plant only takes a few years. Fighting court battles is what takes 20+ years.",
            "The reporter is just wrong about this. The economic hurdles are very much a direct result of the NRC being... kind of a caricature of a regulator.",

They decided to go with the current concept - instead of one of several alternatives, some of which had already been proven viable - because they had invested money in it and saw no reason to try something different.\n\nThat's an attitude that is all too common. Especially when your business is essentially guaranteed by the government. Once times change, you are stuck with a bad design and now it's almost impossible to change course.\n\nIt's obviously an oversimplification but there was plenty of arrogance and stupidity going around when nuclear energy was the next big thing. (Again, you can see the same in many industries.)",
            "Yeah, but we can do something about that.\n\nWe *can't* do anything about the fact that they always end up being much more expensive to build than claimed and have much worse uptime than anticipated, which is noted later in the article.\n\nPeople always demand to know why we don't use \"cheap, clean nuclear,\" but the answer is that it isn't cheap, and when something goes wrong, it sure as hell ain't clean.\n\nI'm pretty pessimistic about all of it, TBH. \"Renewables\" only seem cheap when you play accounting games, and they fail frequently, in addition to taking up insane amounts of land.

But to be classically \u201cbase load\u201d, you have to be cheap. Cheapness compensates for being slow to ramp.\n\nYes, you need storage. Solar is still cheaper if you include battery storage. And that ramps instantly.\n\nUnless something changes nuclear is relegated to special cases like aircraft carriers.",
            "I get it from over a decade in the industry from government/commercial, utility scale and residential. \n\nPeople do care about power density because you need to either use land at utility scale (or transmit far) or you need to put it on a roof. \n\nRooftop- You can power a Walmart on solar because there\u2019s a lot of roof space. You can\u2019t even begin to touch a factory, You can\u2019t cover 100% of a home either unless it\u2019s both a mild and sunny climate. \n\nUtility scale- please enlighten me how you cheaply solve intermittent nature or storage. Storage is not cheap at utility scale. Then you\u2019d have to deal with land use too. A 1GW coal plant requires 1,000 acres and can generate 8.7 billion kWh a year. To generate that with solar you\u2019d need over 21,000 acres covered with panels. Then transmit it from wherever you found 21,000 acres. \n\nTo my point, best action is to raise the price of coal because it kills people and the planet or subsidize nuclear which is emission free so it becomes viable.",
            "I mean, you pay for the land, right? That\u2019s part of the price. That\u2019s why density doesn\u2019t matter - it\u2019s already in the price. Maybe it\u2019ll eventually raise the price of solar but not as of now. Even then, the price of the panels is still dropping fast whereas the piece of nuclear has been rising.\n\nSo is the 40% from some study somewhere that you can link to? What\u2019s the source of the limit?"

            "Currently there's still some degree of user agency on Windows, but you need to jump through a lot of hoops to get to a state where the intrusive bloatware is absent. \n\nI strongly recommend downloading and running O&O Shutup 10 on personal Windows installations, although the sheer number of settings can seem daunting, that's because theres *so much telemetry and advertising* in Windows now.",
            "Besides the constant one drive popups which I managed to kill, and recently a few popups for that stupid win AI Copilot that I do not want. I haven't had many issues. \n\nThat said when I installed windows I unticked everything, so likely switched a lot of things off. Also don't use the start menu for anything so miss on what's going on in there.",
            "Have not had an issue with ads but the automatic updates have practically bricked my laptop. My HP Spectre worked great when it was on Windows 10. Once it was forced to upgrade to 11, it began to BSOD on a regular basis. Every time I thought I fixed it (clearing/updating drivers, updating bios, reverting settings, redirecting memory usage, etc), another automatic Windows update would happen and it was go right back to blue screening.",
            "> At this point, I have lost count of the number of times that I've left my perfectly working Windows computer at the end of my work day, only to return to a completely broken computer that won't boot the next morning.\n\n\nOk I know that \"Windows update broke my PC\" is something of a meme, but in my decades of building my own PCs and buying laptops I have never had a single thing break because of a Windows update. Seriously has this actually happened to anyone here?",
            "Windows hasn\u2019t felt like mine since XP. That\u2019s why I changed to Linux.\n\nI can absolutely recommend the lightweight Linux distributions. They\u2019re fast and it\u2019s easy to backup the entire system.",

Uninstall and reinstall of the driver fixed it. \n\nWindows update has never interrupted what I was doing. Never had an auto reboot. Never had an update fail, or needed to rollback anything. \n\nThis whole article just smells of a hit piece to drive people towards linux and mac.",
            "I was going to ditch Windows, tried a Linux distro and didn't switch on this PC build because of some small obscure apps I use, mostly niche. Learning more about Wine now because it seems jumping off is inevitable with all the stupid things that are happening. Mac doesn't seem worlds better to me but the laptops are pretty great, so I guess it's just a matter of time.",

Plus one for the Xbox subscription on initial install. Not seen a single other ad.\n\nNow on prebuilt and laptops I\u2019ve seen tons but these aren\u2019t from MS they are from the computer builder.\n\nApple does the same trying to sell you Apple care and iCloud subscriptions.

            "The moment I realized that I couldn\u2019t upgrade to Win11 - even though it was still performing perfectly - was the moment I switched to Mac (2020), as I also got into photography/videography. Never looked back ever since and seeing how bad Windows has gotten I am very happy about my decision.",
            "Godforbid I connect my laptop to a nonmetered connection, because the moment I do , I wave goodbye to it for the next 3 hours. Windows will hijack the cpu, bandwidth, and ssd at full. System? Telemetry? Edge? some random service that just decides to update? You name it.",
            "Yup. A lot of people will soon be jumping ship from Windows to Linux or MacOS. I only have one laptop in the house that runs Windows 10, and that's my wifes', who is Linux phobic. I totally gave up on Windows after Windows 8. I have had both Linux and Windows boxes running at the same time for years. But I've converted everything to Linux now. If, in a very rare and unlikely situation, I need to use a Windows program, I have Windows 10 running as a virtual machine inside Linux. I'll never go back to Windows.",

            "Agree with the article. Started with Microsoft DOS, several versions. A runtime of Windows1 to run GEM - Graphic Environment Interface in order to use Ventura Publisher). Then most versions from Windows 3 to Win 10. Except for Win 10, they've all been reliable OPERATING SYSTEMS **that I could install the software programs that I wanted to use on MY computer.** Win 10 has got a lot of crap I don't want and don't have the option to remove. \n\nWin 10 has evolved into a Microsoft marketing system for Microsoft rather than a user friendly transparent operating system. Yes, have issues with updates occasionally. A common one after update is trying convince Win 10 that I don't have a headset and get the speakers working again. With all the bloatware on Win 10 I'm not very interested going Win 11. I'd have a couple of conditions for building a new computer for Win 11 or 12 - if I won some lottery and there was an excellent game that I couldn't play on Linux or PlayStation. A Mac might be an alternative as I've used them before. Microsoft isn't listening to customers anymore. Don't need an AI assistant, don't need the bloatware.\n\nI already have one Linux Mint system running for several years. On Win 10 End of Life, one of my Win 10 computers will be switched to Linux. The other Win 10 will go offline since it has a lot of software I use frequently that won't need upgrades.",

            "They are trying to remove it. That's why they pushing ARM so hard, they want a locked down OS like unrooted Android/iOS and ARM and the Pluton chip (hardware attestation, similar to Play Integrity) will give them the ability to lock you into only being able to use Windows\u00a0",

            "Been using it since sometime last year, while my experience wasn't as extreme, I did constantly run into issues and have done several clean installs since it was easier than trying to fix some things in my current install due to compatibility issues, update errors and settings being overwritten. My work computer has fared better but for my personal use Linux has definitely been the answer (and made most of my games run smoother which was an unexpected plus) the worst part with Windows is you can get total luck of the draw on which update circle you're in if you don't explicitly opt into one which is where I've seen most people's issues arise. If you limit it to security updates only it mitigates the vast majority of the issues for those that can't or don't want to make the jump",

            "These people are ridiculous. They think that you should change out your entire operating system and make your computer far less compatible and much more difficult to use as opposed to... going into the windows settings and pressing one fucking toggle to switch off whatever dumb ad they're seeing. \n\nAlso, this shit is blown so out of proportion it's laughable. You get some dumb links on your lock screen... that you'll see for a fraction of a second before you click or press enter. Most of the time they're gone before my monitor even wakes up. You get some dumb candy crush ad... that you can just right click and unpin or uninstall. Takes literally 2 seconds and never comes back. \n\nNow, should Windows have ads in the first place? No. However, they're also not really that big of a deal.",
            "Well I wouldn\u2019t imply you\u2019re dumb. But if you can\u2019t appreciate there is a difference between windows 10 and 11 and that Enterprise is a very different product.",
            "I've heard this argument since 2003...",
            "> A lot of people will soon be jumping ship from Windows to Linux or MacOS\n\nYou vastly over estimate how many people outside of a very vocal and technical minority give a shit about any of this. Most people don't install their OS at all or even know there are other options. Until the average joe can walk into a bestbuy and walk out with a pre-installed linux desktop/laptop after being convinced to choose that over the options they are already familiar with, work for them, and have decades of prior experience with, the needle isn't going to move at all.",
            "Haven't we been saying that with every new generation of software and services since web 2.0? Still waiting for this reality to eventuate.",
            "I've been hearing that since windows 95 mate. Linux is at 4% now so I can safely say, no that's not going to happen.",
            "Guess what you'll have to do when you install Linux... Customize it yourself! You know, like what you can do with Windows. It's like Linux people are allergic in doing on Windows what they do regularly on Linux.",
            "Mac OS has its own share of issues. All the files on desktop of MacBook Air disappeared without warning due to their stupid iCloud integration with no means of getting it back. The so called recover options on iCloud don\u2019t work. I\u2019m surprised so many Redditers are oblivious to this.",
            "Same here, I don't understand where all these people are coming from. Never had any serious issues with Windows, except the NT, that was shit.",
            "Regular people not giving a shit is not an indicator all is well.",
            "Yeah, but they are dropping support for it in a years time.",
            "It doesn't break security updates though, so that's actually a feature!",

            "Over the last couple years I have been moving my business off windows to the Mac. Windows is such a mess and only use it for one special task, I have a work around and will ditch ms all together once the last computer dies. \n\nWhy, for my application the M2 chip is way faster, battery on the laptop last forever.",

            "Maybe you got lucky... I wouldn't try install one of the later builds of Win 11.  It's bloat city. \n\nOne of the things about Win10/11 is there's a lot of differences between builds, and the more recent the build, the more bloaty and infested it is.",
            "I wondered this for awhile too and I think it's just very different definitions of what are actually ads. Like some people seem to consider things like the inclusion of onedrive at all or the temperature widget in the taskbar or the links to the free web version of office 365 in the start menu to be intrusive ads.",
            "Okay, let me fill you in. This is the shit I have to deal with when searching for \"lusrmgr\" on a newly imaged work PC.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/917dQVD.jpeg\n\nNow yes, I am aware you can get rid of it by turning off web results. This is the default, out of box experience.",
            "And you are not reddit?",
            "I think they are overestimating that, but I also think there are things that you\u2019re underestimating.  Something like a steam deck isn\u2019t exactly what you\u2019re describing, but it\u2019s a pretty significant step in that direction",

I have literally never used OneDrive, and yet my \"Documents\" folder got moved into a subfolder at home/OneDrive/Docuemnts. On a fresh Windows install, you get app shortcuts for things like Candy Crush in my start menu. I've had to remove shortcuts to Edge after a WIndows Update twice. And speaking of Windows Update, every few months, Windows boots up to a \"Let's finish setting up your PC\" screen that tries to pressure you into using \"Recommended Internet Settings\" (which switches your default browser to Edge). \n\nI think when people are referring to ads, they're not necessarily talking about a traditional banner ad. And while we do get the \"Daily World News\"-level of tabloid clickbait article shoved into the weather widget, and an actual notification ad for Edge, it's less about traditional ads, and more about constantly being treated like the end-user is supposed to be monetized. \n\nIt's like living with a used car salesman who never stops trying to sell you something.",

            "They almost certainly do",
            "It is, but then I would not say them, because well that would distance myself from it and exclude myself from being part of reddit."

            "Processing power and wattage are tied together pretty heavily. If it takes x computations to complete a given function then it doesn\u2019t matter if you are using an i9 that can do 100 computations a second or a Chromebook which can do 10 (numbers are fabricated for example), the Chromebook using lower wattage will take way longer to finish the same task so the wattage over time is comparable, in many cases the faster processor actually uses a lot more energy in less time to reach those speeds. Furthermore no matter what system you use you can baseline the wattage and then run the task while monitoring power consumption until the completion of the task, then using basic math you can get a number of how much wattage was used for that task. There are several at home free softwares you can do to do this yourself it\u2019s not exactly hard. You can get into an argument over efficiency and how efficient of a computer you could use to conduct the same calculations but as you said it\u2019s not standardized so all we can do is establish a baseline off of what they are using which is neither the most efficient nor the least efficient. This could give a good idea of the average use case power consumption because companies don\u2019t all use the same equipment and neither do consumers. So picking  middling option and an array of different learning modules is best, like they did in their tests. Most people are going to use your average middle of the road hardware which this is a good gauge for at least, and if you factor in your average corporate employee device that lines up as well so really the only thing this might not be an accurate test for necessarily would be back end infrastructure for organizations which any argument for efficiency differences would likely be offset by scale when you\u2019re talking about the footprint in electrical consumption, so it would still be somewhat comparable to the test even if it\u2019s roughly 20% more efficient per device at scale. Once this is rolled out to more standardized hardware like an iPhone we can really start seeing some standardized numbers and get a strictly more scientific test done at least for those devices but the point is this test stands as a proof of concept that a non-negligible to a concerning amount of power is consumed by your average device with these computations.",

If I tell you that every calculation is an estimate, and no estimate will be accurate, and you google a new estimate from a new company then you're not disproving my point at all.  Yes you can find how much one power a task takes on a given system but you cannot extrapolate that information out to a society wide level.

You have been told how much power XYZ computer task consumes using the same spurious math that is in this article. There is no way to know how much power any of these computer programs draw, on a society wide level. \n\nThe math can only be done in relatively tiny segments, i.e. one data center, one mining rig, etc. Even if you knew exactly how much power a data center uses it wouldn't mean that all data centers use the same amount or operate at the same efficiency. There is no way to standardize the calculations and no way to even know how many computers are doing a given task, or how much power that tasks draws. \n\nAgain, use your own computer. Your computer draws X power a different one draws Y power. If you used your computer to do a task, that would use a percent of X power. A different computer will require a completely different amount of power. They don't know how many computers there are, they don't know what tasks are being done, and they don't know how much power a task consumes. So they cannot know how much power in total is being used for these tasks. The best they can do is multiple guesses together AKA make it up.

Ai is adding AT LEAST 600 million homes worth of usage a year based on one companies actual published metrics.

Amazon products are often damaged when I get them, they're often slower than 2-days, and they have re-charged me for returns 7 times over the last 18 months even though I have evidence of delivered shipment (that they of course also have) - they changed their tune really quickly once I got my state's AG involved.\n\nSo yeah, fuck Amazon.",

            "This isn\u2019t a question that would take more than a second to answer.  At this point, I\u2019d take a pay cut to stay remote, my QOL would drop significantly if returning to the office",
            "I find it interesting that Dell\u2019s policy sounds almost exactly my own company.\n\nI\u2019ve been coming into the office as soon as the shutdown was lifted.  The commute time, commuting expenses, leaving early to get to the office, and buying lunch at the cafeteria definitely took a toll on my bottom line.  \n\nBut then again, when it came to yearly reviews, I\u2019ve been getting extremely high bonuses that I was not expecting.  Basically bonuses that is the equivalent of 1/3rd of my salary.  I wonder if the in-office played a huge part of that.\n\nAt my company, no one is happy about the tracking.  It\u2019s ridiculous.  We\u2019re being summoned every week if we missed a few days.  It\u2019s bureaucratically insane",

The people working there were either stressed-out overachievers or drones that wanted to just do their jobs and go home. Most fell within that spectrum, but the whole performance-review culture was built around the idea that everybody had to be an overachiever or risk being fired. During my exit-interview, I told my manager that I really just wanted to do my job and not be constantly fretting about self-improvement, and that aggressively pushing people into more-senior roles was a ponzi-scheme. Not everybody can achieve at that level even if they wanted to, so there was constant churn. It was exhausting.  \nSo, yeah - if there was a way I could have been on a list of \"don't promote me, and just let me do my job...?\" Yeah, I'd have taken it.",

Not sure if they got reimbursed or not. \n\nNeighbor did not have insurance on the boat, so they got nothing on that and it looked like shit ever since. \n\nThe question I asked the utility was: \u201cif a kid had been playing right by the transformer when it blew up, do you think saying it was an act of god would have cut it?\u201d  Never got an answer from them.",

Which means a single disposable Atlas V is like almost 2000 satellites worth\n\nOf course that isn't to say there isn't room for improvement. Like the recent news of japanese testing wooden satellites would probably help reduce the waste",

They basically have data from every business with an app or online presence or connected device (e.g., smart bulbs) and they can easily aggregate that data and figure out who you are, where you actually live, and get your real IP address, real home address, etc. If you pay for your VPN with a credit card like chase, who now sells your purchase history data, Google, and subsequently YouTube, can see you pay for a VPN.

            "Who tf else do you think is going to lead the effort?\n\nYes, it would surely be an international coalition - but it seems obvious that NASA would be at the helm, given their position as the leading space program on the planet.\n\nThe strike path could be wherever - I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to wait for them to build a space program from scratch because they are the target.",
            "Here's a hint, it involves the planet Earth. Turns out the US is located there.  They also are the most well equipped to deal with the situation.  But I guess you're right, if it's not going to hit the US they should just shut up and stay out of it.",

South Koreans are fanatical about discipline and diligence especially technology. Norwegians are on average the smartest people on the planet because their school teachers are the highest trained (need a masters degree minimum and several years teaching experience).
