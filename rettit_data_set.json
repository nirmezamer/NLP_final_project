        "content": "For a couple of weeks we've been getting messages from users not being able to post on this sub: the Post button remains greyed out. The commonality of the reports seem to be that they have been trying to use the Android reddit app to post. So if this problem has been bugging you, please report it to Reddit in the android app store. Until it's fixed you can post your art in the web browser on a computer.\n\nAnd yes, we know the app seemingly allows posting on other subs, and not on /r/Art. But the iPhone app works fine (tested myself). It probably has to do with the title requirements that this sub has, it uses a thing called regex, and I suspect this title requirement is causing the android app to not function correctly.",

When the subreddit started the rule \"Content must be about cats\" made sense, but we do not need to expressly codify this anymore. We're not a small community these days and it has not happened in years that someone posted a bunny rabbit instead of a cat. We will of course still remove off-topic content but do not see the need to clutter up the rules page with something that our community understands to be self-evident. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe will likely make minor edits and additions to this new rule-set in the coming weeks until everything is just the way we like it, but the rules as posted now are the general framework from which we will do so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe have kept our rules broadly worded so they can encompass many topics and so we do not need to codify for every single possibility. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe most important rules are at the top. Our number one rule is to respect each other. This for example includes following rediquette and sitewide rules, but also our subreddit-specific rule of not attacking other posters for not raising their pets to your satisfaction. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur rule about spam, memes and self-promotion includes  accounts that do not directly promote their content, but which nevertheless primarily exist to drive content to their NSFW stores like Onlyfans. Everyone is welcome to post here, but NSFW sellers can do so on a seperate, SFW account. We do not allow memes as they are most often posted as easy karma-grabs instead of genuine engagement. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd so on. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our new ruleset via the link at the top of this thread and give your feedback in a comment below. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you all for helping us make this space the wonderful community that it is and we hope you enjoy your time here. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe r/cats mod team",

Adding milk to eggs binds the proteins in the milk to the proteins in the egg.

I love the actual texture of eggs.. so good!\n\nSo, I use the traditional french method and only add a teaspoon of water for each egg in an omelet.  Water causes steam, like milk, but since it has no protein strands, it doesn't change the texture.\n\nThe extra steam allows the egg to cook a bit faster and more evenly.  \n\nI add water to fried eggs too!  My favorite way to fry them is the way my Dad taught me about 100 years ago.  Add the eggs to the pan when the butter is foaming.  Then pour in a couple teaspoons of water around the edges of the pan.  Add salt and pepper, then pop a top on them, turn the heat to low and leave them alone, checking every few minutes till the tops are opaque and the whites are fully cooked.

He's generally a happy dog and is friendly to any and everyone. He's a very confident dog and even enjoys going to the vet and the groomers. He absolutely loves going to doggy daycare and pretty much has the ability to make friends with literally anyone. He gets along well with cats, he does have a slight habit of chasing after squirrels but outside of that he is such a well behaved dog. Everyone always have positive things to say about him.\n\nHe has been away from home a maximum of about a 7-10 days but he never seemed to suffer from any seperation anxiety. These instances were due to work related trips I'd have to take or vacations. He's just always a happy dog. I honestly don't know how he'd behave if were away for any longer than that. He has never shown a sign of sadness a day in his life so I truly don't know how well he'd take to me being gone...for good.\n\nI should also add he's a very large dog, he's a mutt but I'd imagine he'd be considered a giant breed dog. He's between 90-100lbs\n\nI'd appreciate any helpful feedback or advice!",

He's crate trained and very good about chilling in his crate while my wife and I are at work (so usually about 6-7 hours with our different starting and ending times).

Again, he's very well behaved, and he has never destroyed anything or gotten into anything he shouldn't. He never has any issues with barking or freaking out when we leave, whether he's in the crate or out.\n\nNow I'm debating whether we should keep crating him during work. He's obviously fine with it, but I still feel kind of bad keeping him locked up for so long. Obviously if he still wants the crate, he can go and rest there whenever he wants. What do y'all think?

If you\u2019re willing to put in the work anybody can get good. It\u2019s like Ratatouille (or Racacoonie depending on your universe), anyone can hack!\n\nFirst read a fuckton of introductory online resources. Go to securitytube and watch anything by Vivek. Man knows his shit.\n\nFind introductory courses or buy intro books, some recommendations:\n\n- Linux Basics for Hackers\n\n- Metasploit: something somethjng (forget the full title)\n\n- This next one is challenging and dated but an absolute must read: Hacking the Art of exploitation\n\n- I hear Georgia Weismann\u2019s PenTesting book is good and she\u2019s a nice lady. So is her mom. That\u2019s not a mom joke. I actually met her and she\u2019s very sweet.\n\n- Download and learn how to use virtualbox it\u2019s probably the easiest way to start. It\u2019s a virtualization software that you run essentially an operating system within an operating system. It\u2019s open North Korea\u2019s malware on my machine and that\u2019s why it could not spread absolutely anywhere.. it\u2019s useful for learning other operating systems so install Linux on there. I generally recommend Linux mint or Ubuntu. Parallels for MacOS users. If you want to real challenge, install something like freeBSD and learn how to use that.\n\n- The web application hackers handbook is the Bible Web application hacking I always tell people if you read it from cover to cover and do all of the exercises. You\u2019ll absolutely be a really good web app hacker\n\n- Black hat python by Justin is recommended. Justin is a really good dude and does some really amazing projects. I know he knows his shit. In terms of the actual content, the goal is to learn python so don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t fully understand all of the attacks going on. Although he explains them really well.\n\n- for mobile, hacking I don\u2019t know fuck all about it. So ask somebody smarter than me. Georgia I mentioned earlier I did some work in there so I don\u2019t know fucking ask her.\n\n- If you\u2019re interested in macOS hacking there\u2019s just a little bit of a dated book called the macOS hackers handbook I honestly haven\u2019t read it so I can\u2019t speak to the quality, but is the absolute Jesus of macho ass hacking.\n\n- for more macOS stuff there are some books that are called. I think exploiting the macOS Colonel or maybe it\u2019s just called the macOS Colonel highly suggest those but none of these ones are for the faint of heart.\n\n- Use a lot of resources for courses. Security tube is an amazing resource watch anything by a dude named Vivek know who I\u2019m talking about. He has a bunch of shit on there. If you\u2019re starting out, look for beginners shit, go onto Udemy.\n\n- if you want to pay out the ass, but also get a certification that people actually respect there is OSCP by offensive security, but in my opinion, the shit is a little bit overrated\n\n- For programs, you can literally just download and learn right now and nmap is one of the most important ones for beginners. I think metasploit is really important and there\u2019s a shit ton of material out there on it. Learn how passwords are stored and cracking passwords. Even just knowing what that means is important. So look up hashing and no, it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with smoking hash, though that is an optional step\n\nI did see interest in MacOS so here:\n\n- \n\n\nwill post more soon ",

        "title": "Christopher Nolan's newer films are missing Jonathan Nolan",
        "content": "Let me preface this by saying that I love Christopher Nolan. To me, he's one of the best directors/movie makers, and up until recently, I considered him my #1. Until Dunkirk. It was his first movie after Interstellar, which was (again, in my opinion) a masterpiece. I remember seeing it in IMAX 70mm and had the most unexplainable movie experience of my life. I was silently sobbing by the end of it.\n\nAnd that was after Inception and Dark Knight! So when Dunkirk came out, I had very high expectations, because his films always met those expectations and surpassed them. I remember noticing that his brother wasn't a part of writing it, but I didn't pay much attention to that fact... until I saw the film. Honestly, I considered it a disappointment. It was nothing like his last few movies before it, and it barely impacted me. I thought it was lacking some kind of magic that his films always had. \n\nI was happier with Tenet, and I think that the concept and a lot of the scenes were absolutely amazing! But, again, something about the film was lacking to me. It just didn't hit its mark. It wasn't what I had come to expect from Nolan's films. It didn't have the same heart and execution in its story, and I felt that missing from most scenes. Robert Pattinson was the best part of the movie for me because it's like he got it and he gave it. \n\nThat's when I started to realize that Jonathan Nolan was what was missing. I was giving all the credit to Christopher by considering him my #1 and thinking of Jonathan as only 'helping' him with the scripts. I may be wrong, but I think he was integral to the masterpieces that the films were when they were making them together.\n\nOppenheimer was obviously a fantastic movie, but to me, it was still missing the magic that I'd come to expect from Christpher Nolan. I don't know how else to explain it. There used to be this kind of electricity, heart, and soul. I'm not saying that I think those things were missing entirely, obviously not! Just that I think they were incomplete, and I think it's because he's been making his films without Jonathan for a decade now.\n\nThe writing of Westworld season 1 was like the TV version of what I was missing after Interstellar, especially the writing. I think that Christopher is a master director/filmmaker. But I think he writes great films, not masterpieces. Jonathan IS that missing piece. \n\nI'm not exactly sure why they parted ways, but I hope that they plan to make more films together in the future.\n\nEdit to add: I think that Christopher Nolan fans fall into 2 categories. Those who prefer his films pre-2014 and those who prefer his films post 2014. I want to emphasize that I'm not saying that one side is right or wrong. Just my own opinions. Cinema is about personal preference after all. \n\nEdit again to add: Welp, I don't know how I missed that Chrisophet Nolan wrote all of Inception, which I consider a masterpiece.",

It was wholesome and funny, landing its jokes more than it flopped. It was paced well and most importantly: engaging.\n\nSince Leo was excellent we ended up watching another one tonight: The Sea Beast. This movie had gorgeous animation. I was enthralled for the first 30 minutes. It drug on for a bit too long and basically ended up being \"How To Train Your Sea Beast\", but it was good enough that I don't regret watching or feel like I wasted my time. It got a bit muddled in its messaging in the second half and resolved the whole corrupt kingdom thing far too easily, but overall was fun.\n\nI'm probably going to check out more of the recent Netflix Animated Films.

The thought of engineers designing habitats for Mars or the Moon, combined with the scientific discoveries we could make, is absolutely thrilling.\n\nWhat about you? What aspect of the future of space exploration excites you the most? Is it the engineering challenges, the scientific discoveries, or the possibility of becoming a multi-planetary species? I'd love to hear your thoughts and have a great discussion about the incredible future of space exploration.\n\nLooking forward to your insights!",

Titan, Enceladus, Io, etc.\n\nSecond to that, more drones on atmospheric planets and moons (like Ingenuity did for Mars). While rovers are great as a \"home base,\" being able to send off a handful of drones to take BEV pics and do hi-res mapping will be incredible to see.",

Overall, I could put 9/10 S1 as there was always something happening making you want to binge it so bad. I even remember not wanting to watch this show at night as every episode some new stuff came up and was always so scared.\n\nBut\u2026 what the heck happened with Season 2 though?\n\nYou can really tell the decline in quality. First of all, what happened so far in S2 is, Travis gets lost and they go out to find him, Shauna\u2019s baby shower and baby theme, Lottie\u2019s stupid rituals, search for food, meanwhile in the adult world, Nat gets to know Lottie\u2019s spiritual space (which no longer is a mystery), Tai\u2019s sleepwalking, the Shauna murder case which the police want to know more so they get to know her daughter and Misty wanting to find out where Nat was taken to when we all know where she was taken so nothing intriguing/interesting about it.\n\nHonestly, of all the things I\u2019ve said, Literally the only interesting stuff is Tai\u2019s sleepwalking case and the eyeless man and the symbol. But they develop these themes every 3 eps tbh except w tai\u2019s sleepwalking. They keep shoving uninteresting stuff. Like after ep3 and 4, its costing me to press the watch button on this show.\n\nNothing really exciting is happening and the same stuff happens on the cabin that really gets you nowhere. Honestly, I\u2019ve seen in this subreddit that this tv show was way better than Lost but imo, Lost always had something exciting to look forward to in every episode, even after S5-S6, it still had something.\n\nand this isnt from someone who just wants action.

I know when the episode aired a lot of folks were under the impression that New Vegas looked like it was almost destroyed or falling apart or something. But I mean... have you played the game? The city *is* falling apart. The 3 main casinos (Lucky 38, Ultra-Luxe and The Tops) are in good shape, but Gomorrah and even The Tops have damage on their exteriors and Gomorrah is also a bit damaged in its interior as well. There's rubble walls dividing sections of New Vegas (though this was for optimisation purposes, it's still there in game) and the surrounding areas of Freeside, Westside and Camp McCarran are also dilapidated. \n\nNo doubt that they'll canonize the House ending of New Vegas in some way since that's the only reason Lucy's dad could reasonably be going there. It's also likely that there won't be a strong NCR presence after Shady Sands was decimated, so maybe there could be members of Caesar's Legion running amok. We see some destroyed Securitrons in the outro concept art but apparently that's not to be taken as an indication of anything that is set to happen in the show. So jury's still out on the Securitrons being Mk 1 or Mk 2 versions. \n\nWhat has me curious is when Maximus said his mother was a courier. Couriers had a very important job in New Vegas, it's why you play as one in the game. I wonder if that's just meant as a nod to couriers having important roles in universe or if his mom is THE Courier, Courier 6. Or a previously unknown wife of Ulysses? Wouldn't make sense for Ulysses as a character given the expansion, Lonesome Road, telling us all about his background with the Twisted Hairs and how they were \"assimilated\" by Caesar, but maybe Ulysses survived the encounter with Courier 6 and started a family, potentially with another Courier. Or maybe the player character's Courier is canonized as being female and it was them who married Ulysses. I'm getting sidetracked but New Vegas did so much worldbuilding, I don't feel optimistic the show could live up to every fan's expectations for where it goes after the events of the game but with how well the show handled the universe I'm wanting to have more faith.",

        "human_comment": "\nUkraine war briefing: \n\n>European Union countries have formally approved the launch of accession negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova next week,\u00a0another step in the two nations\u2019 long journey to join the 27-nation bloc. Belgium, which currently holds the EU presidency, said member states had agreed on a negotiating framework. Volodymyr Zelenskiy called the start of the accession talks a \u201chistoric step\u201d. \u201cMillions of Ukrainians, and indeed generations of our people, are realising their European dream,\u201d the Ukrainian president posted on X. \n\n>A Russian guided bomb killed two people and wounded three in a residential area of an eastern Ukrainian town, Donetsk regional prosecutors said. Five five-storey buildings and six homes were damaged by the bomb on Friday in Selydove, about 14km (nine miles) from the frontline, they said on Telegram. \n\n>The Ukrainian military said its drones struck four oil refineries, radar stations and other military objects in Russia\u00a0in an attack in the early hours of Friday.\u00a0\u201cUnmanned aerial vehicles attacked the Afipsky, Ilsky, Krasnodar and Astrakhan oil refineries,\u201d it said on Telegram. Russian emergency officials, writing on Telegram, confirmed three municipalities of Krasnodar came under \u201cmassive attack\u201d. The Russian journalist-run Astra social media channel reported that Yeysk, home to a military airfield, was hit by drones that sparked fires. Nasa satellite fire monitoring indicated fires or hotspots at the airbase. The Krasnodar region sits across the Kerch strait from Crimea. \n\n>Ukrainian drone attacks put two electricity substations out of action in Enerhodar, the town serving the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant,\u00a0and cut power to most of its residents, Russian-installed officials said on Friday. An official at the Russian-occupied plant said it was unaffected. \n\n>Ukraine said it was dispatching reinforcements to Chasiv Yar, an embattled strategic hilltop town in the Donetsk region and a vital flashpoint whose capture could accelerate Russian advances deeper in the industrial territory. \n\n>The US will send the latest Patriot missiles \u201crolling off the production line\u201d to Ukraine instead of other countries that ordered them, the White House said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to reprioritise the deliveries of these exports,\u201d said John Kirby, the national security council spokesperson. It also applied to Nasams, another type of air defence missile. \u201cDeliveries of these missiles to other countries that are currently in the queue will have to be delayed,\u201d Kirby said, adding that deliveries to Taiwan and Israel would not be affected. \n\n>The Pentagon has given Ukraine approval to use US-supplied missiles to strike targets inside Russia across more than just the frontlines near north-eastern Ukraine\u2019s Kharkiv region\u00a0if acting in self-defence. \u201cIt makes sense for them to be able to do that,\u201d said Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary. \n\n>Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced measures to protect Ukraine\u2019s energy system,\u00a0including protection for power plants under Russian fire and the development of alternative and renewable energy sources. Drone and missile strikes have knocked out half of generating capacity since March, according to official figures. Attacks overnight into Thursday hit four regions and cut power to more than 218,000 consumers, the energy ministry said. \n\n>Three men have been arrested in Frankfurt, Germany, on suspicion of trying to collect information on a person from Ukraine\u00a0for a foreign intelligence agency, federal prosecutors said. They were identified as Robert A, a Ukrainian; Vardges I, an Armenian; and Arman S, a Russian. \n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/22/ukraine-war-briefing-zelenskiy-hails-historic-step-as-eu-set-to-open-ukraine-accession-talks](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/22/ukraine-war-briefing-zelenskiy-hails-historic-step-as-eu-set-to-open-ukraine-accession-talks)",

        "human_comment": ">__BARCELONA\u2019S city council has announced it will revoke all licenses for tourist apartments in the urban area by 2028.__\n\n>In a major win for anti-tourist activists, Barcelona\u2019s socialist mayor Jaume Collboni announced on Friday that licenses for 10,101 tourist apartments in the city will automatically end in November 2028.\n\n>The move represents a crushing blow for Airbnb, Booking.com and other tenants and a triumph for locals who have protested about over-tourism and rising house prices for years.\n\n>Announcing the move, Collboni said the rising cost of property in the city \u2013 rental and purchase prices have risen by 70% and 40% respectively in the last decade \u2013 had forced him to take drastic action.\n\n>He said: \u201cWe cannot allow it that most young people who leave home are forced to leave Barcelona. The measures we have taken will not change the situation in one day. These things take time. But with these measures we are reaching a turning point\u201d.\n\n>The deputy mayor for Urban Planning, Laia Bonet, hailed the move as the \u2018equivalent of building 10,000 new flats\u2019 which can be used by locals for residential use.\n\n>Local officials say that tenants will not be compensated because the move, which will have to be passed with political support, has de-facto compensation by giving owners a four-year window before licences expire.\n\n>Alongside the revoking of tourist flat licenses, Collboni announced that new legislation would force building constructors to allocate at least 30% of new homes to social housing.\n\n>The measures are designed to alleviate pressure on a housing market which has seen sharp price rises in recent years, forcing many residents to leave the urban area for the suburbs and beyond.\n\n>Speaking to the\u00a0Olive Press\u00a0at an anti-tourist rally on Tuesday, one Barcelona resident, who gave his name as Alex, said locals were angry at the \u2018massification of tourism\u2019 with \u2018the cost of living and housing forcing many young people to emigrate from the city centre to the suburbs and nearby towns\u2019.\n\n>He added: \u201cThe people of Barcelona, like any city in the UK and elsewhere, have the right to live peacefully in their own city. What we need is a better quality of life, decent wages and, above all, an affordable city to live in\u201d.",

        "human_comment": "*The Supreme Court on Friday recognized a transgender woman as the father of a child she had with her female partner using sperm frozen prior to her transition.*\n\n*It was the first-ever decision by the country's top court on whether to recognize a parent-child relationship in a case in which a biological father had a child after transitioning to a woman.*\n\n\n\n*Friday's ruling by the top court's Second Petty Bench, which was supported by all four justices, means that the child will be guaranteed the right of inheritance from the transgender woman and the right to claim child support from her.*\n\n*Presiding Justice Akira Ojima said that not recognizing a parent-child relationship in the case would go against the child's interest. The previous ruling by the Tokyo High Court had denied a father-child relationship.*\n\n*The petty bench said whether or not there is a parent-child relationship is deeply connected to a child's welfare. Such a relationship not being recognized due to a parent changing gender clearly interferes with a child's welfare and interests, it said.*\n\n*The woman in her 40s had her first and second daughters with her female partner in her 30s in 2018 and 2020. In November 2018, after the birth of her first daughter, she legally changed her gender.*\n\n*She applied to be recognized as a parent of the two daughters, but her application was rejected. A lawsuit was then filed seeking such recognition, in which her two daughters were the plaintiffs and she was the defendant.*\n\n*In February 2022, the Tokyo Family Court dismissed the woman's claims on the grounds that her transition meant that she was neither a \"father\" or a birth-giving \"mother\" as defined by the Civil Code.*\n\n*While the high court in August the same year recognized a father-child relationship between the woman and the first daughter, it denied such a relationship for the second daughter, who was born after the transition.*",
