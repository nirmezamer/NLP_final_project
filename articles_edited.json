    "Duo euthanasia: Why a happily married couple decided to die together": "Dying together: Why a happily married couple decided to stop living\n\n15 hours ago By Linda Pressly , BBC News Share\n\nBBC Jan (70) and Els (71) photographed two days before they died\n\nJan and Els were married for almost five decades. In early June, they died together after being given lethal medication by two doctors. In the Netherlands, this is known as duo-euthanasia. It’s legal, and it’s rare - but every year, more Dutch couples choose to end their lives this way.\n\nSome people might find this article upsetting.\n\nThree days before they voluntarily take their last breath, Jan and Els’ campervan sits on a sunlit marina in Friesland, in the Netherlands’ north. They’re a couple who love being mobile, and have lived most of their marriage in a motorhome, or on boats. “We tried sometimes [to live] in a pile of stones - a house,” jokes Jan, when I visit them, “but it doesn’t work.” He’s 70, and sits in the swivel driving-seat of the van, one leg bent underneath him in the only position that eases his continuous back pain. His wife, Els, is 71 and has dementia. Now, she struggles to formulate her sentences. “This is very good,” she says, standing up easily and pointing to her body. “But this is terrible,” she says, pointing to her head. Jan and Els met in kindergarten - theirs was a lifelong partnership. When he was young, Jan played hockey for the Netherlands’ national youth team, and then became a sports coach. Els trained as a primary school teacher. But it was their shared love of water, boats, and sailing that defined their years together. As a young couple they lived on a houseboat. They later bought a cargo boat and built a business transporting goods around the Netherlands’ inland waterways. Meanwhile, Els gave birth to their only son (who asked not to be named). He became a weekly boarder at school and spent weekends with his parents. During school holidays when their child was onboard too, Jan and Els looked for work trips that would take them to interesting places – along the river Rhine, or to the Netherlands’ islands. By 1999, the inland cargo business had become very competitive. Jan was experiencing serious back pain from the heavy-duty work he had been doing for more than a decade. He and Els moved on land, but after a few years they were again living on a boat. When that became too much to manage, they bought their spacious campervan. Jan had surgery on his back in 2003, but it didn’t improve. He had halted a heavy regime of pain killers and could no longer work, but Els was still busy teaching. Sometimes they talked about euthanasia - Jan explained to his family he didn’t want to live too long with his physical limitations. It was around this time the couple joined NVVE – the Netherlands’ “right to die” organisation. “If you take a lot of medicine, you live like a zombie,” Jan told me. “So, with the pain I have, and Els’ illness, I think we have to stop this.” When Jan says “stop this”, he means - stop living.\n\nJan pictured with his son in 1982\n\nIn 2018, Els retired from teaching. She was showing early signs of dementia but resisted seeing a doctor – perhaps because she had witnessed the decline and death of her father with Alzheimer’s. But there came a point when her symptoms couldn’t be ignored. In November 2022, after being diagnosed with dementia, Els stormed out of the doctor’s consulting room, leaving her husband and son behind. “She was furious – like a steaming bull,” remembers Jan. It was after Els learned her condition wouldn’t improve that she and Jan, with their son, began to discuss duo-euthanasia – the two of them dying together. In the Netherlands, euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal if someone makes a voluntary request, and their suffering – physical or psychological – is assessed by doctors as “unbearable”, with no prospect of improvement. Every person who requests assisted dying is assessed by two doctors – the second checking the evaluation made by the first.\n\nWhere to get help\n\nIn 2023, 9,068 people died by euthanasia in the Netherlands – around 5% of the total number of deaths. There were 33 instances of duo-euthanasia, so 66 people. These are complex cases made even more so if one of the partners has dementia, where there can be uncertainty about their capacity to give consent. “A lot of doctors don’t even want to think about performing euthanasia on a patient with dementia,” says Dr Rosemarijn van Bruchem, a geriatrician and ethicist at the Erasmus Medical Centre, in Rotterdam. This was the position of Jan and Els’ GP. And that reluctance among doctors is reflected in the euthanasia figures. Of the thousands who died in 2023, 336 had dementia. So how do medics assess the legal requirement for “unbearable suffering” in patients with dementia? For many with early stage dementia, it's uncertainty about how things might progress that can lead them to think about ending their life, explains Dr van Bruchem. “Am I going to not be able to do the things I find important? Am I going to not recognise my family anymore? If you can express that well enough, if it is perceivable for both the doctor that is willing to perform euthanasia, as well as the [second] doctor that is specialised in mental competency, the existential fear of what is to come can be the reason to consider euthanasia.”\n\nEls van Leeningen Els, photographed in 1968, was diagnosed with dementia later in life\n\nWith their GP unwilling to engage, Jan and Els approached a mobile euthanasia clinic - the Centre of Expertise on Euthanasia. It supervised around 15% of assisted deaths last year in the Netherlands, and, on average, grants about a third of the requests it receives. In the case of a couple wishing to end their lives together, medics must be certain one partner isn’t influencing the other. Dr Bert Keizer has attended two duo euthanasia cases. But he also recalls meeting another couple, when he suspected the man was coercing his wife. On a further visit, Dr Keizer talked to the woman alone. “She said she had so many plans…!” Dr Keizer says, explaining that the woman clearly realised her husband was gravely ill, but had no plans to die with him. The euthanasia process was halted and the man died from natural causes. His wife is still alive.\n\nDr Theo Boer, professor of healthcare ethics at the Protestant Theological University, is one of the Netherlands’ few outspoken critics of euthanasia, and believes progress in palliative care often mitigates the need for its use. “I would say that killing by a doctor could be justified. However, that needs to be an exception.” What worries Dr Boer is the impact of duo-euthanasia cases – especially after one of the Netherlands’ former prime ministers and his wife chose to die together earlier this year, and made global headlines. “In the past year we’ve seen dozens of cases of duo-euthanasia, and there’s a general tendency to ‘hero-ify’ dying together,” says Dr Boer. “But the taboo on intentional killing - that’s eroding, and especially when it comes to duo-euthanasia.\"\n\nJan and Els could probably go on living indefinitely in their campervan. Do they feel they might be dying too soon? “No, no, no – I cannot see it,” says Els. \"I’ve lived my life, I don’t want pain anymore,” says her husband. “The life we’ve lived, we’re getting old [for it]. We think it has to be stopped.” And there’s something else. Els has been assessed by doctors who say she still has the capacity to decide for herself that she wants to die - but this could change if her dementia becomes more advanced. None of this has been easy for Jan and Els’ son. “You don’t want to let your parents die,\" explains Jan. \"So there have been tears - our son said, ‘Better times will come, better weather’ - but not for me.” Els feels the same. “There is no other solution.”\n\nEls and Jan on their wedding day, 1975\n\nThe day before their appointment with the euthanasia doctors, Els, Jan, their son and grandchildren were together. Ever practical, Jan wanted to explain the idiosyncrasies of the campervan, so it would be ready to sell. “Then I went for a walk on the beach with my mum,” their son says. “The kids were playing, there were some jokes… It was a very strange day. “I remember we were having dinner in the evening, and I got tears in my eyes just watching us all having that final dinner together.” On Monday morning, everyone gathered at the local hospice. The couple’s best friends were there, brothers of both Jan and Els, and their daughter-in-law with their son. “We had two hours together, before the doctors came,” he says. “We spoke about our memories… And we listened to music.” Idlewild by Travis for Els, the Beatles’ Now and Then for Jan. “The final half hour was difficult,” their son says. “The doctors arrived and everything happened quickly - they follow their routine, and then it’s just a matter of minutes.” Els van Leeningen and Jan Faber were administered lethal medication by doctors and died together on Mon 3 Jun 2024. Their campervan still hasn’t been put up for sale. Els and Jan’s son has decided to keep it for a bit, and go on holiday with his wife and children. “I’ll sell it in the end,” he says. “First I want to make some memories for the family.”",
    "Katty Kay: Reality sinks in as Democrats weigh Biden's future": "Katty Kay: Panic and confusion as Democrats weigh Biden's future\n\n19 hours ago By Katty Kay , @KattyKay_, US Special Correspondent Share\n\nReuters\n\nJoe Biden’s surprisingly bad debate performance on Thursday night has prompted panic, confusion and even sadness in the Democratic Party, including among people close to the president. There are now serious conversations taking place at the top of the party, in the White House and in the Biden-Harris campaign about a range of options, one of which is whether Joe Biden should step down as a candidate for president. Democratic officials, political operatives, and people close to the president paint a picture of an anxious Democratic Party that is seriously concerned about the strength of their candidate and whether he can beat Donald Trump in November. Among some of the president's allies I’ve spoken to, there’s been hand-wringing about how the preparation for the debate in Atlanta was handled. These people say Mr Biden was over-prepared and overworked by his campaign team - and that if he had been given more time simply to rest in the week leading up to the debate, he would have done much better. Maybe there were too many voices and perspectives and data points put in his head, one campaign source suggested to me, and that just threw him off. While that analysis may be correct, the claim that the president was tired and overworked will do little to quell the very real fears that Mr Biden’s advanced age may impact his ability to win this election. These fears over the president’s age, mental fitness and stamina - and the insistence that something must be done about it - are far from new. Back in September, the prominent political columnist David Ignatius, who was a confidant of Mr Biden’s, stated that the president should step aside. In February, Ezra Klein of the New York Times said much the same in a column that generated both buzz and irritation among those inside the White House. Until now, those voices have been one-offs. That changed after last night’s poor debate performance.\n\nName-calling and insults - key moments from Biden and Trump’s debate\n\nIn the early hours of Friday morning, a string of high-profile Democratic strategists, pundits, and former officials joined the call for Mr. Biden to bow out. I appeared on Morning Joe, an American political morning show that the president frequently watches. Joe Scarborough, the host of the program and a defender of the president, made the point that while Mr Biden can still govern the country, perhaps he no longer has what it takes to win the election. So where does that leave Joe Biden? First, it is important to remember that the decision of whether to continue is - more or less - entirely his. At this point, if he doesn’t want to step back, it’s virtually impossible for him to be removed from the ticket. One campaign source told me any decision to step down would be made by a very small group that includes the president, his wife and his sister, Val Biden. Second, right now the conversation about whether to replace Mr Biden is happening in public among pundits and former officials but it’s still only happening in private among those with actual influence. Indeed this morning, several of the president’s allies (who are also, awkwardly, being floated as his potential replacements) took to television and social media to defend him. California Governor Gavin Newsom said he was “very proud of the president\". Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro told Democrats to “stop worrying\". Senator John Fetterman put it bluntly, saying: “I refuse to join the Democratic vultures on Biden’s shoulder.” My reporting suggests no changes will be made imminently. The team wants to give the president a chance to get out in public and erase the memory of that debate appearance. On Friday, at a markedly more energetic rally in North Carolina, Mr Biden attempted to put concerns over his age and his debate performance to rest. “I know I’m not a young man,” he said. \"I would not be running again if I did not believe with all my heart and soul I can do this job.” On Saturday, he will travel to the ultra-wealthy Hamptons region of New York for fundraisers with Democratic donors. A source on the campaign tells me that, at the moment, the chance of him stepping aside is only around 5%. But if donors were to abandon him en masse, they acknowledge that could change and prompt a speedier decision about his candidacy.",
    "Germany: AfD conference in Essen triggers violent protest clashes": "Clashes break out near German far-right conference\n\n1 hour ago By Sean Seddon , BBC News Share\n\nReuters Police say 'several' arrests have been made in the city of Essen\n\nPolice and protesters have clashed outside the annual conference of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Tens of thousands of people opposed to the AfD gathered in the city of Essen, local media reported, with police drafted in from around the country in a bid to prevent disorder. Local police said officers had been injured in the violence, which began in the early hours of Saturday morning before the official demonstration had started. The AfD's conference comes weeks after it shocked Germany's political establishment by coming second in European elections, winning 16% of all votes and beating the ruling centre-left party.\n\nEPA Batons and tear gas were used to control crowds outside the venue\n\nDisorder broke out at dawn on Saturday when a group of protesters attempted to reach the Grugahalle music venue where the meeting was due to be held. Delegates were seen being ushered towards the venue by riot police after some protesters attempted to prevent the conference from beginning by blocking the road. The local police force said it had used batons and tear gas to control crowds and had made \"several\" arrests as of midday. Police in Essen reported further clashes later on Saturday and claimed officers had been attacked by masked protesters, though much of the demonstration was peaceful. As many as 100,000 people were expected to take part in the demonstrations over the weekend, German broadcaster DW reported.\n\nReuters It was the first annual meeting since AfD secured 15 seats in the European Parliament\n\nThe two-day AfD event was set to involve around 600 delegates and began as planned at mid-morning on Saturday. The party's co-president Alice Weidel opened the meeting by telling delegates: \"We are here and we will stay.\" She was re-elected as co-leader alongside Tino Chrupalla. Counter-demonstrators marched through Essen on Friday, the eve of the conference, and more demonstrations are expected on Sunday. Authorities in Essen had attempted to block the AfD from meeting in the city but a court ruled the party should be allowed to.\n\nReuters Over the weekend, as many as 100,000 people are expected to take part in the demonstrations",
    "Ukraine war: Marine reveals struggle of defending Kharkiv": "'There was no preparation': One marine's story of defending Kharkiv\n\n15 hours ago By James Waterhouse , Ukraine correspondent Share\n\nGetty Images Ukraine's troops are fighting hard against Russian advances in the Kharkiv region\n\nFor months, Oleksiy has been fighting to hold a thin strip of land surrounded by Russian forces. Now he’s been rushed to defend Moscow’s onslaught in the Kharkiv region, like many other soldiers scrambled from other parts of Ukraine’s front line. It’s a redeployment symptomatic of this war’s new focus. We’ve been in touch with Oleksiy for the past nine months. Now from north-eastern Ukraine, he’s described the difference in fighting as “huge”.\n\nThe ‘forgotten’ mission\n\nDespite limited supplies, minimal gains and mounting losses, Kyiv insists its southern foothold on the occupied eastern bank of Dnipro River is still significant. It’s where Oleksiy had been fighting for the past eight months. We’ve agreed not to reveal his real name. We last spoke with him six months ago, where he described the conditions on the swampy riverside as “hell”. Things haven’t improved.\n\n“We’d managed to maintain the bridgehead, but no equipment has crossed it, and we haven’t once broken through Russian defences,” he says. The marine tells us the area had been reduced to a “moonscape”, with entire villages being razed to their foundations. The Ukrainians have also suffered heavy losses there too. “We destroyed a lot of Russian equipment, and they destroyed a lot of our personnel,” he says. “We’ve left our best guys on the riverside.” Despite minimal progress and mounting losses, Ukraine’s military says it’s pursuing three aims with this bridgehead: To draw invading troops from elsewhere\n\nTo limit Russian artillery strikes on Kherson city across the river\n\nTo eventually cross it in large enough numbers to liberate territory Oleksiy says promised US military aid was gradually starting to arrive, but not all of it was making it to the front line where he was based. Despite partially forcing the Russians back, Ukrainian troops still endure constant Russian fire. “Any movement was immediately covered by artillery or drones,” he explains. “The Russians didn’t seem concerned by our presence there either; we had become a suitcase without a handle. “The troops there can’t leave, and everyone understands that’s useless.”\n\nGetty Images The area near Ukraine's east bank foothold has been turned into a \"moonscape\"\n\nIt’s hoped a new mobilisation law, which came into force last month, will help give troops like those fighting on the eastern bank a rest. “It won’t change anything!” says Boston, a flamethrower unit commander who is still fighting on the eastern bank. Boston is his military code name. He sends us videos of him on patrol in Krynky by the riverside. At one point he shoots a Russian anti-personnel mine hidden beneath the sand. “People should join the army from 20,” he says. “But there is a problem, a lot of men went abroad [to escape the draft]. No-one wants to come back, no-one wants to fight, and no-one wants to die.”\n\n‘Yesterday’s civilians’\n\nWe put their testimonies to Dmytro Pletenchuk, the spokesman for Ukraine’s South Defence Forces. “Compared to Russian losses, ours are significantly smaller,” he explains. “Secondly, we lose soldiers on this part of the front line no more than in other areas.\"\n\nGetty Images Ukraine has lost tens of thousands of men defending against Russia's invasion\n\nBy definition, a conscript will never be as motivated as a volunteer. It’s also easier to inspire troops when fighting is going your way. For Ukraine, and especially on the eastern bank, it isn’t. It’s possibly why Mr Pletenchuk strikes a sympathetic tone when we tell him about allegations of troop disobedience on the eastern bank. “Those who have been forced to defend their country are yesterday’s civilians,” says Mr Pletenchuk with a smile. “They will of course have a different perception of the army.\" Ahead of the arrival of more Western military aid, Ukrainian generals believe Russia is trying to expand the battlefield and further stretch their defending units. Invading troops are more than a month into a north-eastern ground offensive, and while Ukraine has slowed their advances, there’s been no letting up. It’s why Oleksiy now finds himself hundreds of kilometres away from the Kherson region. “Everything happened in a hurry and there was no preparation,” he says. “Everyone is here: marines, air assault forces, the State Border Guard Service, regular infantry, territorial defence and national police.” “There are also more drones in the sky compared to the east bank of the Dnipro.”\n\nGetty Images Drones have become a vital tool for both the Russian invaders and Ukraine's defenders\n\nRussia on the front foot",
    "As dramatic campaign closes, has it actually grappled with UK's massive problems?": "Has frantic election campaign actually grappled with massive issues UK faces?\n\n4 hours ago By Laura Kuenssberg , @bbclaurak, Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nNearly there! The battle buses have revved up for their final journeys. The set piece debates are all over. The parties’ manifestos almost seem like a distant memory. It’s five days until polling day and this time next week, on Saturday 6 July, you can expect the occupant of Number 10 to be gathering together their cabinet. Time to take stock then of the state of play after five frantic weeks. The Conservatives have not managed to narrow the gap between them and Labour in the polls, which was their hope and expectation. Their campaign has been defined by mishaps and mistakes, from its sodden start, to the PM's early D-day departure, to another Westminster saga, where some Tories were alleged to have bet on the date of the election, and are being looked into by the Gambling Commission. Whether these changed voters' minds or not remains to be seen, but each has added up to a sense that the campaign has been lacklustre and poorly run.\n\nGetty Images\n\nWell-known cabinet ministers have been noticeably absent on the campaign trail - a mixture perhaps of running for the hills or scrambling for their own seats. One of their colleagues who has been showing up said “it’s been awful”. In the last few days, Rishi Sunak seems to have suddenly found an injection of energy, emotion and resolve, with his performance at the TV debate and his visible anger about racist slurs about him apparently made by one of Reform's activists on Friday. But what has really stumped some of his colleagues is that he had the advantage of knowing the election was coming. Yet it’s the Conservatives who have looked ill-prepared from the off. “The element of surprise is what you are meant to do to your enemy, not yourself,” one former cabinet minister said.\n\nSign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.\n\nThey have managed to apply some pressure to Labour, particularly on immigration, and tax, but looking at the last five weeks you might wonder, if the Conservatives can’t seem to run a smooth campaign how can they run the country? For Labour the campaign has run more or less like clockwork. They didn’t have 4 July pencilled in as one of the possible dates for the poll but were long suspicious that the Tories would call a surprise spring election, so had spent months preparing. There have certainly been mishaps. Back at the start, the party’s will-they-won’t-they let Diane Abbott back onto the green benches stirred up lots of party members, and looked clumsy. Sir Keir Starmer’s backers had often claimed his willingness to cut out some on the left of the party as a badge of honour after all the angst during Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership. But a boast of “changed Labour” didn’t include mistreating the party’s longest serving black female MP.\n\nGetty Images\n\nAnd while the Conservatives haven’t managed to shift the polls, they have put Labour under pressure on their plans for tax, and tackling migration. There have also been sticky moments when Sir Keir faced questions from the public - derision, even, when he was trying to justify being part of Corbyn’s team and awkwardness when answering questions on women’s rights. Both of the main parties have been regularly reprimanded too by independent number crunchers for not being candid enough over the grim state of the public finances - the reality, the respected IFS and others calculate, is that there will be taxes or cuts on the way whoever is in charge. Let’s be realistic: it's just not likely that any political party that seeks to govern after a few years of a cost of living crisis is going to stand up and say, \"money is tight, by the way, there are more cuts on the way or you’ll have to pay more\". But there is deep scepticism, from the IFS and others, that either of the big parties’ sums really add up.\n\nThat’s been part of the ammunition some of the smaller parties have used to chuck at Sunak and Starmer. The SNP, the Greens, and the Lib Dems - when their leader Ed Davey has not been on a water slide/paddleboard/waltzer or goodness knows what’s next (I’m assured there are more stunts to come) - have been the ones that have claimed all the way that Labour is heading to Number 10 and that they are the ones who can keep them honest, and prevent them just working from a Tory script. The Greens are hopeful of bagging more seats after a couple of years of local election gains; the Lib Dems are sure they are going to make up a decent amount of ground too and hope to become the third biggest party in Parliament again. That would be at the expense of the SNP who, after huge turmoil, are trying to stop a slide. My colleague Gareth Lewis explains here how Plaid Cymru might find winning their two target seats at this election tough; and in Northern Ireland, my colleague Jayne McCormack points out in our Election Essential newsletter that the tussle between unionist DUP and nationalist Sinn Féin to secure the most seats at Westminster shows no signs of abating. She says that this year it is a contest being watched particularly closely because, for the first time since 2005, Sinn Féin looks as though it could outperform its rival. This would be a symbolic moment for Irish nationalism and Northern Ireland more generally.\n\nBut the small party that has made the most noise is Nigel Farage’s Reform UK. For weeks they’ve grabbed headlines for the wrong reasons: from a candidate who suggested the UK shouldn’t have fought World War Two, to misogynistic comments by eight candidates we revealed last week, to the horribly offensive racial slurs used by some activists, which exploded into a race row. The Tories ran their campaign with the intent of defending their vote share from leaching to Reform. In the closing days, Reform UK is the party that’s been having to defend its values. It is likely they’ll still get a decent chunk of support that will slice away at the Conservatives’ vote. As at so many points in the party’s history, a Tory leader has had to grapple with how to manage pressure from the right of the conservative (with a small c) movement. Even during the campaign we’ve seen Conservatives clash over whether Mr Farage himself could ever have a place in their party. He is set on causing disruption, as ever. How much upset he actually causes, we’ll see.\n\nGetty Images\n\nBefore the campaign started there was a common expectation in Westminster circles that a campaign, where the principle actors were Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer might be, well, not exactly a thriller. In fact, from Sunak’s D-day disaster, Farage’s stormy entrance into the campaign, ‘gamblegate’ and in the closing moments, Rishi Sunak perhaps more personal than he’s ever been, it has been anything but dull. But I can’t help wondering if it’s really a campaign where we have seen our politicians grapple with the massive issues that affect us. In the first part of the year, politicians were fond of talking about the dangers the world faces, but they haven’t chosen to make much of foreign affairs. The challenges and opportunities of technology they often love to talk about have been more or less absent too. What about how we care for our vulnerable and elderly with social care? What about what seems to be a crisis taking place behind closed doors in our prisons? Climate change? The true scale of the country’s debts and what that really might mean in the years to come? Of course, politicians match their campaigns to what is top of voters’ lists. Campaign in poetry, govern in prose? Perhaps more like: campaign on a few core issues that appeal to focus groups, and worry about some of the massive issues of governing a bit later on. It is nearly over. Our political parties have been doing their best, or what passes for it, for more than a month to get you to back them. We’re nearly at that magic moment where it’s all of us in charge, not the politicians. It’s not likely that any of the 2024 campaigns will go down as the most inspiring, dynamic, memorable political operations. I’m not so sure that the public would have been in the mood to be romanced and dazzled by any of them anyway after all the stresses and strains of the last few years. But that doesn’t make our decisions in the next week any less important. The choice will affect us all.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak, Pat McFadden, Labour campaign co-ordinator, Daisy Cooper, Deputy Leader of the Liberal Democrats, and Stephen Flynn, SNP Westminster Leader, will be appearing on this weekend’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme.",
    "French elections: PM Attal in final appeal to voters to stop far-right victory": "French PM in final appeal to stop far-right victory\n\n15 hours ago By Paul Kirby , BBC News, Paris Share\n\nANDRE PAIN/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock National Rally boss Marine Le Pen hopes Jordan Bardella (R) will be the next French PM (file pic)\n\nFrance's lightning-quick election campaign is over, and despite last-ditch appeals not to back the far right, voters appear ready to hand the National Rally party a historic victory in parliamentary elections. Prime Minister Gabriel Attal warned it would unleash “impulses of hate and aggression”. But the party of Marine Le Pen and 28-year old Jordan Bardella, who could be the next prime minister, has if anything cemented its lead in the opinion polls. National Rally has fended off a series of accusations of racism, involving party members as much as supporters. The big question now is whether it can win an absolute majority in two rounds over the next two Sundays.\n\nThey have a significant chance, after European elections on 9 June turned most of the electoral map of France dark blue. That was the moment Emmanuel Macron chose to stun the French people with a decision to call a general election in just three weeks. National Rally (RN) is gearing up for a big night on Sunday, with one opinion poll hours before the campaign ended showing support at 36.5%. Its candidates are hoping to win dozens of seats in the National Assembly outright on the night, with more than 50% of the vote. But most seats will be decided in run-off votes on 7 July, between two, three or even four contenders. So opinion polls do not tell the whole story, and a hastily arranged left-wing alliance, the New Popular Front, also has its eye on victory, only a few points behind RN with 29%.\n\nThe Ensemble alliance, led by Gabriel Attal, lies in third on 20.5%, according to the Ifop poll. He argues both the other main blocs are extreme. No area of mainland France backed National Rally in the European vote more than L’Aisne, a rural department in the north with just over 50% support. Since 2022, L’Aisne has already had three RN MPs, and in the historic town of Villers-Cotterêts, they have had a National Rally mayor, Franck Briffaut, for a decade. A party veteran of more than 40 years, going back to its old National Front days under Jean-Marie Le Pen, he feels the path to power has been inevitable, in the same way that Giorgia Meloni won elections in Italy.\n\nFranck Briffaut says his party has evolved over time and victory is inevitable\n\nBut like many in his party, he won’t settle for anything less than an absolute majority in the National Assembly, which would require at least 289 of the 577 parliamentary seats. “I won’t be part of it, because it’s a trap set by Macron. I’m also convinced that if we get an absolute majority, he has to be made to leave. As long as he’s there, we can’t put through the entirety of our programme. Because we need changes to the constitution.” President Macron has promised he is not going anywhere until his term ends in 2027, and it is his task to appoint the next prime minister after the second round of these elections on 7 July. Jordan Bardella, whose campaign posters have “prime minister” written underneath his name, insists he won’t settle for less than an absolute majority. That does leave open the question of who Mr Macron will choose if RN falls short. “There’s no point in Emmanuel Macron naming a prime minister nobody would want,” says constitutional expert Prof Dominique Rousseau. But if there’s no absolute majority, he says the president has room to manoeuvre. It would usually come from the biggest party, but if they refused, he could look for a consensus figure instead, who could pull together what remains of the centre right and centre left. For now, it is Jordan Bardella who is doing all the running, announcing during a TV debate two nights ago that he has some kind of “government of national unity” in waiting. Mr Bardella has promised a government of all the talents, including as yet unknown “sincere patriots who have France’s sovereignty at heart”. However, he did name former conservative leader Eric Ciotti, who alienated most of his colleagues when he struck up an alliance with RN. It may not sound convincing, and the prospect of power-sharing - or “cohabitation” - with President Macron sounds like three highly difficult years in French politics. Marine Le Pen, who shares the party leadership with Mr Bardella, has her sights set on the presidency in 2027 and has already raised tensions by appearing to call into question the president’s role as commander-in-chief of the armed forces as merely “honorary”. The intensity of this election campaign, and its importance, have prompted Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin to warn of the risk that the “ultra-left and ultra-right” may try to sow chaos after both rounds of the election. He has called on local prefects to exercise vigilance.\n\nAway from the tempestuous politics of Paris. a Greens campaigner handed out leaflets to a handful of passers-by in the northern town of Soissons, run by a National Rally MP for the past two years. He complained the RN had done nothing for this ancient and now disadvantaged town since he came to office. In the main shopping street, people still refer to the party as National Front, despite the best efforts of Marine Le Pen to rebrand her party and shed its old image of racism and antisemitism. Jonathan says the RN is no different from its predecessor, but is not unduly worried: \"There are locks in place in the Assembly, in the constitution, so it’s not like they’re going to start a dictatorship here.”\n\nThis mother said she did not expect RN to win such a high proportion of the vote\n\nOne mother said that living as a black family in a nearby village, it was worrying that the RN vote was so high: “It's immense. We didn’t expect RN to win the most votes in L’Aisne.\" She too believes the far right will struggle to change the constitution, but she is more concerned about their rhetoric. One of RN’s key platforms is “National priority”, restricting social welfare to French citizens, alongside tax cuts on energy and income tax exemptions for under-30s. The party also says dozens of sensitive, strategic jobs would not be open to dual nationals in France, who make up an estimated 5% of the population.\n\nSAMEER AL-DOUMY/AFP Former Socialist education minister Najat Vallaud-Belkacem (L) came to France aged four",
    "Dua Lipa Glastonbury review: Star manifested dream moment with hit-packed set": "Dua Lipa manifested dream Glastonbury moment\n\n13 hours ago By Mark Savage , Music Correspondent • Annabel Rackham , Entertainment reporter Share\n\nDua Lipa performs Be The One at Glastonbury 2024\n\nDua Lipa did not come to mess around. The pop star stormed through her first ever headline slot at Glastonbury with an ambitious and dynamic performance that was stacked with smashes from beginning to end. She took to the Pyramid Stage shortly after 10pm, opening with a flawless run of five songs: Training Season, One Kiss, Illusion, Break My Heart and Levitating. Each one had the breathless choreography of an award show performance – and the pace didn’t let up all night.\n\nPA Dua Lipa headlined the Pyramid Stage for the first time.\n\nDua had five costume changes on the night, with heavy studs and leather a constant theme.\n\nShe played 15 top 40 hits, including Don’t Start Now, Physical and New Rules, as well as her collaborations with Elton John (Cold Heart) and Mark Ronson (Electricity). Strangely, however, she chose not to play her Barbie smash Dance The Night, which was consigned to a video interlude during one of the star’s five costume changes. Her raspy mezzo-soprano cut cleanly through the warm Somerset air, particularly on the dramatic ballad Happy For You, and the purring, sensuous Houdini, which closed her set. The 28-year-old even paid tribute to Shakespear’s Sister, one of Glastonbury’s first ever female headliners in 1992, wearing a t-shirt bearing the cover of their album Hormonally Yours. On stage, she repeatedly talked about how she had manifested this very moment, having dreamt of headlining Glastonbury before she even recorded her first album. “I’ve written this moment down and wished for it and dreamt it and worked so hard,” she told the crowd. She recalled one of her first gigs, playing to 10 people who “only came because we offered them free drinks” – and seemed overwhelmed by how much that audience had grown.\n\nDua Lipa was able to create a nightclub-like atmosphere through her choreography\n\nAlmost 100,000 people watched her play, with fans stretching all the way back to Rowmead, an area that used to be reserved for campers, but which has been opened up in 2024 to allow bigger crowds to the Pyramid Stage. “It’s a lot, innit? A lot to take in,” Lipa said. “Little me would just be beside herself right now.” It was a tiny moment of vulnerability in an armour-plated set. No song was left unpolished, no vocal left unharmonised, no hair left untossed. Dua hit every mark with the precision of someone who’d been building towards this moment for years. But if that makes it sound clinical and sterile, it wasn’t the case. Take the moment she ran down to the barriers to join the crowd as they sang along to her early hit Be The One. It wasn’t entirely spontaneous (in fact it riffed on a moment from her last Glastonbury performance in 2017) but the joy on the star’s face as she climbed the fences and stood face to face with her fans was genuine.\n\nGetty Images Dua Lipa was joined on stage by collaborator and Tame Impala frontman Kevin Parker\n\nShortly afterwards, she brought out Tame Impala’s Kevin Parker – a collaborator on her new album Radical Optimism – to sing the band's song The Less I Know The Better. Freed from the iron grip of choreography, she simply vibed out with him on stage, giving a glimpse of the person behind the tightly-controlled public persona. \"Tonight I get to pretend I'm in Tame Impala,\" she beamed. If there was a criticism of her set, it was that such moments were few and far between. The show sometimes felt aimed at the global TV audience as much as the people in front of her, and the aerobic dance routines - while undoubtedly impressive - didn’t allow for much spontaneity. But the audience's attention never wavered. Even the less familiar new material was cleverly sequenced, so that you were never more than 3 minutes away from a certified banger.\n\nNew Rules mash-up\n\nBefore the show, Lipa said her goal was to turn Glastonbury “into a nightclub” and she kept to her word. All the songs were given a sonic overhaul - adding sounds from the 90s rave scene or beefing up her beats with trunk-rumbling sub bass. Her breakout hit, New Rules, was even combined with the festival staple Glue, by Northern Irish dance act Bicep. The result was a show that felt like the VIP room of a gritty European nightspot, only delivered on a gigantic scale.\n\nGetty Images Its not often that a Glastonbury headliner gets their own second stage, but then again not everyone is Dua Lipa...\n\nEven the outfits were planned to complement the club theme, with Dua’s fashion choices blending in with (rather than standing out from) those of her dancers - from a chunky studded belt, to red-and-black flamed hotpants. Notably, she also wore flat shoes to facilitate the dancing - enhancing the feeling that we were joining her on a night out, rather than watching an untouchable pop icon. With fireworks and confetti throughout the set, it felt like she was staking a claim on Glastonbury immortality. And, watching from the front row, she more than succeeded. The other acts at the top of this weekend’s bill – including five-time headliners Coldplay – have their work cut out to match her ambition.\n\nDua Lipa's Glastonbury setlist\n\nTraining Season One Kiss Illusion Break My Heart Illusion These Walls Be The One The Less I Know The Better (Tame Impala cover) Be The One Falling Forever Love Again Pretty Please Hallucinate New Rules Electricity Cold Heart Happy For You Physical Don’t Start Now Houdini\n\nSugababes performed hits including Overload, Hole In The Head and About You Now\n\nOther sets on Friday came from dance collective Jungle, rock band Idles and Jamie xx - who packed out the Woodsies tent, and rewarded fans by reuniting with his bandmates Romy and Oliver from The xx for an emotional performance of You've Got The Love. He was also joined on stage by Swedish pop star Robyn, playing their new collaboration Life. Surprise guests were the order of the night, in fact. Anne-Marie introduced Aitch to The Other Stage to perform Psycho, and Bombay Bicycle Club were joined by Damon Albarn to play Blur's Tender and Heaven – which featured on Bombay Bicycle Club’s 2023 album My Big Day. Albarn also urged people to vote in next week's general election, and appeared to criticise Thursday night's debate between President Joe Biden and Donald Trump, saying: \"Maybe it’s time we stopped putting octogenarians in charge of the world.”\n\nChaotic scenes\n\nDance star Fred Again popped up in the Stonebridge Bar, causing chaos as thousands of fans tried to cram into one of the festival's smallest venues. There were similarly chaotic scenes at the West Holts stage earlier in the evening, as Sugababes brought the field to a standstill. Organisers had to enact a one-in, one-out policy - reminiscent of the band's last performance, which shut down the Avalon Field in 2022.\n\nFontaines DC provided a more nihilistic alternative to Dua Lipa's set",

British explorer Sir David Hempleman-Adams, 67, who lives in Wiltshire, and two friends took off from Presque Isle, Maine, in North America, just after 02:30 UTC [03:30 BST]. But after about seven hours in the air, the crew were forced to land, at 09:40 UTC [10:40 BST] near New Brunswick, Canada, due to weather conditions. A spokeswoman for the crew, who are safe and well, said: \"They will attempt it again but it's too early to say when at the moment.\"\n\nShe added: \"It was a very difficult decision and they are obviously extremely disappointed but safety is obviously paramount.\" The attempt by the Torabhaig Atlantic Explorer crew was being monitored by Flight Control in Bristol. The spokeswoman said that the conditions had required an altitude higher than planned, and that would have needed \"increased ballast consumption\". The crew therefore decided to land the balloon having decided they would not have had enough ballast to make it to Europe.\n\nTorabhaig Atlantic Explorer The team set off in the early hours of Saturday morning from Maine, USA\n\nPrior to the attempt, Sir David said: \"At 67, I'm still young enough to take on a daring hydrogen balloon flight across the Atlantic. \"Age is just a number and the spirit of exploration never fades.\" Sir David has already crossed the Atlantic twice in an open-basket balloon, but this was the first attempt at crossing the Atlantic ocean using a hydrogen balloon. He was accompanied by American balloon manufacturer Bert Padelt and Swedish explorer, scientist and entrepreneur Dr Frederik Paulsen. The attempt was also postponed last year due to bad weather. Sir David had said: \"My previous two Atlantic flights have been solo and my companions for this trip have no idea how loudly I snore. \"May the weather be with us this time as everything else is planned for and ready.\"\n\nTorabhaig Atlantic Explorer The team at Flight Control Bristol will monitor the balloon on its adventure\n\nThe highest level the team flew was at 10,000 ft (2,048 metres) and about 125 nautical miles in distance. They intended to conduct experiments during the journey, with one study aiming to find out how particles from forest fires travel through the atmosphere affecting conditions such as asthma. Clive Bailey, from Bailey Balloons, was at the Bristol base monitoring progress. He said: \"An amazing amount of work took place for over eight hours preparing the balloon for launch, with a tanker used to fill the balloon with hydrogen, while the team sorted all the technical equipment. \"The Flight Control Team have been up all night ensuring the safety of the balloon and crew while tracking progress.\"\n\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Craig Moran: The drugs and guns kingpin who sparked a global manhunt": "The drugs and guns kingpin who sparked a global manhunt\n\n13 hours ago By Jeremy Ball & Greig Watson , BBC News, Nottingham Share\n\nNottinghamshire Police Craig Moran enjoyed the \"stereotypical gangster lifestyle\", according to police\n\nDetails of a major police operation that spanned Nottingham, Manchester, Spain and Dubai can now be revealed after nearly seven years. It centred on Craig Moran, a major figure in organised crime during the time Nottingham was labelled \"gun crime capital of the UK\" in the early 2000s by national tabloid newspapers. Following his release from prison, an upsurge in firearms crime in the city from 2017 was linked to drugs coming from Manchester, via Moran, but a gangland dispute forced him to flee to Marbella in Spain, where he was attacked by rivals. After moving again, this time to Dubai, Moran was arrested and extradited in 2020, and has been convicted as part of the operation that saw a number of trials, the proceedings of which ended this month.\n\nFamily handout Marian Bates was shot and killed in a bungled robbery at her shop\n\nMoran, now 42, started as part of a gang based in Nottingham's Bestwood estate, which was unofficially run by Colin Gunn, a notorious criminal whose influence left the city with a terrible reputation, according to a former chief constable. Gunn's group was behind many of the crimes which, in 2003, led to newspapers describing Nottingham as \"assassination city\" and \"gun crime capital of the UK\". One of the most shocking was the murder of the jeweller, Marian Bates, who was shot dead in a bungled robbery. Moran was jailed for 13 years for plotting the armed raid at the Time Centre in Arnold, Nottinghamshire. He was released in April 2017.\n\nNottinghamshire Police Guns and ammunition were seized around the Bestwood estate as part of Operation Encyclic\n\nNottinghamshire Police's Operation Encyclic began six months later, after a pump-action sawn-off shotgun was discovered in a raid on a house in Leybourne Drive in Bestwood. This proved key evidence, as the firearm was found to have been used in Manchester, and it contained the DNA of Callum Sims, the cousin of Moran. A month later, officers recovered two handguns inside a car abandoned in Morrell Bank in Bestwood - close to Sims's home. The police operation escalated between December 2017 and February 2018, when gunshots were fired at four different locations in and around Bestwood - with one man shot in the leg inside the Duke of St. Albans pub. In April 2018, police executed a warrant at Wendling Gardens in Bestwood, the home of Lee Hudson, Moran's nephew. Officers found 58 cannabis plants, cannabis in bags, and growing equipment. There was also £13,000 in cash, a cash counting machine, two encrypted mobile phones and 131 rounds of ammunition.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Rob Griffin described Moran as a \"gangster\" who posed a significant threat\n\nNottinghamshire Police Assistant Chief Constable, Rob Griffin, said the gun attacks prompted a \"robust\" police response. \"This was the first time in a long while we had seen firearms criminality on the Bestwood estate,\" he said. \"We saw an upsurge in the discharge of firearms at or around the same time.\" ACC Griffin said Moran was identified as a \"significant threat\" because he was arranging the delivery of guns and significant quantities of drugs into Nottingham. \"He is frankly a gangster,\" he said. \"At that time he was the head of the Bestwood organised crime group. \"We very, very, quickly started to connect the recovery of firearms in Nottingham to an organised crime group in Manchester.\"\n\n'Stereotypical gangster'\n\nMoran was found to be leading the Nottingham operation while Jodie Danson, 43, ran it in Salford. ACC Griffin said Moran claimed to work as a fitness instructor and thought he was above the law. \"He had no legitimate means of income but drove an £80,000 Range Rover Sport which cost him over £1,200 a month to lease and had an appetite for designer clothing and expensive hotels,\" he added. \"He made payments exclusively in cash. He lived a stereotypical gangster lifestyle.\"\n\nNottinghamshire Police Police seized heroin and cocaine as part of the operation\n\nMoran already suspected the police were bugging his Range Rover when the breakthrough in Operation Encyclic came in July 2018. The East Midlands Special Operations Unit (EMSOU) intercepted a car driven by Sims, carrying six kilos of heroin and cocaine into Nottingham from Manchester. Detectives intercepted phone conversations, which showed that drug suppliers blamed Moran for the seizure and expected him to reimburse them. Moran then went on the run before several other members of the Bestwood and Salford crime groups were arrested.\n\nReuters Moran was extradited from Dubai to face justice in the UK\n\nAn international manhunt was launched after Moran fled the UK by crossing from Dover to Calais, hidden in the back of a lorry. He established an \"extravagant lifestyle\" in Marbella, but he was still a target for reprisals and was seriously injured in what ACC Griffin described as a \"brutal attack\". He was shot in the kneecaps, and slashed across his face and mouth. A European arrest warrant was issued for his arrest but after he was attacked in Marbella, Moran fled to Dubai. \"He was spending lots of cash, he was living in fancy hotels,\" ACC Griffin said. \"It was eventually a special forces team [in Dubai] that arrested him, and then his extradition followed.\"\n\nColin Gunn was jailed for life in 2006 for conspiracy to murder John and Joan Stirland\n\nThe extradition warrant named Gunn as a \"close associate\" of Moran. Gunn was jailed for life in 2006 for conspiracy to murder couple John and Joan Stirland in a revenge attack over the actions of Mrs Stirland's son Michael O'Brien. Documents also showed that after his release from prison, Moran had lived in a Nottingham house that was owned by Gunn, leading to speculation from some officers that the jailed crime boss was still giving orders from behind bars. But ACC Griffin dismissed claims Gunn still had influence in Nottingham as a \"fable\". \"In my opinion, I don't think that's what was happening,\" he said. \"Craig Moran, I think, stood alone and saw a void in what he saw as a lucrative market. \"I suspect he saw a vacuum in that area, saw an opportunity in the market, and seized upon it.\"\n\n'Shut down'\n\nAfter a series of court cases, the last of which ended on 18 June, Operation Encyclic can now be reported. ACC Griffin says organised crime has a devastating impact on the public and leaves scars on communities. \"It undermines neighbourhoods and it exploits the vulnerable, not to mention the coercive impact it has on the economy,\" he said. \"This investigation shows how persistent we are at ensuring those who cause the most harm to our communities and try and make money through crime will be dealt with robustly and their operations shut down. \"We will use all the investigative tools necessary to ensure we take their so-called drugs empires away from them.\"",
    "First Liberal MP calls on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to quit": "First Liberal MP calls on Justin Trudeau to step down\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau has been in office since 2015\n\nA backbench MP has become the first sitting member of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal Party caucus to call on him to resign, after a disastrous by-election defeat.\n\nWayne Long said new leadership was needed “for the future of our party and for the good of our country” in an email to fellow party members that was obtained by Canadian media outlets.\n\nMr Long, who represents a riding in the province of New Brunswick, wrote “the voters have spoken loud and clear and they want a change”.\n\nIt follows a catastrophic result for Liberals in a by-election on Monday, when they lost a Toronto seat they had held since 1993.\n\nMr Long has served as MP since 2015 and previously said he would not be seeking re-election.\n\nAccording to the National Post, Newfoundland MP Ken McDonald replied all to Mr Long's email, saying: \"well said!\"\n\nIn recent days former Liberal politicians have also called on Mr Trudeau to step down.\n\nAmong them was Catherine McKenna, who served as environment minister under Mr Trudeau from 2015-19.\n\n“The Liberal Party isn't about one person. It's about the values it stands for and it's about improving the lives of Canadians,” said Ms McKenna in a statement she shared with media outlets.\n\n“The prime minister has a legacy to be proud of, but it's time for new ideas, new energy and a new leader.”\n\nFormer British Columbia Liberal Premier Christy Clark made a similar statement on Thursday in an interview with the Toronto Star.\n\nMs Clark said the prime minister “does not have the pull with voters he once had, but more importantly, he isn’t even able to motivate some of the people in the country who are most likely to vote for his party”.\n\nCanada’s next election must take place by 20 October 2025.\n\nAfter Monday’s stunning defeat, Mr Trudeau - who has been prime minister since 2015 - vowed to stay on as Liberal leader.\n\n“These are not easy times,” he said. “And it is clear, I and my entire team have much more hard work to do to deliver tangible, real progress that Canadians can see and feel.\"\n\nThe prime minister has not taken questions from reporters since the loss.\n\nThe Conservatives snatched the Toronto-St Paul's seat by a little more than 500 votes.\n\nMr Trudeau has seen a significant drop in his popularity because of a host of issues including cost-of-living pressures.\n\nA recent Ipsos poll for Global News suggested that as many as 68% of Canadians want Mr Trudeau to step down.",
    "Biden vows to fight on and beat Trump after shaky debate": "Biden vows to fight on, rejecting calls to step aside\n\n17 minutes ago By Bernd Debusmann Jr , BBC News, Washington Share\n\nWhat Biden and Trump said after high-stakes debate\n\nUS President Joe Biden has hit back at criticism over his age, telling supporters in a fiery speech that he will win re-election in November after a poor debate performance fuelled concern about his candidacy. \"I know I'm not a young man, to state the obvious,\" he told a rally in the battleground state of North Carolina on Friday, one day after he struggled in the televised showdown with his Republican rival Donald Trump. \"I don’t walk as easy as I used to... I don’t debate as well as I used to,\" he acknowledged. \"But I know what I do know, I know how to tell the truth [and] I know how to do this job.\" Mr Biden, 81, said he believed with his \"heart and soul\" that he could serve another term, as the cheering crowd in Raleigh chanted “four more years”. While questions over Mr Biden's age are not new, his shaky performance on the debate stage - which was marked by verbal blanks, a hoarse voice and some difficult-to-follow answers - triggered panic among some Democrats who raised fresh questions about his candidacy. Mr Biden's campaign has remained emphatic that the country's oldest presidential candidate is still fit to serve another term. Campaign officials said he would not step aside for another nominee, despite the poor performance. \"Absolutely not,\" Mia Ehrenberg, a Biden campaign spokesperson, said in response to questions about whether Mr Biden would vacate his candidacy. And while several campaign surrogates - including Vice President Kamala Harris - admitted in interviews that the president stumbled during the debate, they reiterated their commitment to the elder statesman and stressed that his answers were more substantive than Mr Trump's.\n\n“The president might have lost the debate on style, but he won it on facts, he won it on decency, and he won it on the ideas people think are important in this country,” campaign co-chair Mitch Landrieu said on CNN the morning after the debate. In the days since the debate, many senior Democrats and Biden allies have made an effort to defend the former president's performance and calm liberal jitters. Former President Barack Obama, who remains one of the party's most popular figures, tweeted that \"bad debate nights happen\". \"This election is still a choice between someone who fought for ordinary folks his entire life and someone who only cares about himself,\" Mr Obama wrote, adding that Mr Trump is \"someone who lies through his teeth for his own benefit\". But Democratic fears about Mr Biden are far from quashed. Party officials, political operatives, and people close to the president who spoke to the BBC's Katty Kay painted a picture of an anxious party concerned about the strength of their candidate. Nancy Pelosi, the former Democratic House speaker, said that “from a performance standpoint it wasn’t great”. Other Democrats, such as Biden’s former communications director Kate Bedingfield, called it “a really disappointing debate performance”. Democratic donors who spoke anonymously to various media outlets were more forthright, with one calling the performance \"disqualifying\". \"The only way it could have been more disastrous was if he had fallen off the stage. Big donors are saying... he has to go,” one Democratic operative told the Financial Times. And on Friday, the New York Times editorial board called on Mr Biden to drop out. It said Democrats should \"acknowledge that Mr Biden can’t continue his race, and create a process to select someone more capable to stand in his place\". Mr Trump, meanwhile, held a rally of his own in Virginia just hours later, where he hailed a \"big victory\" in the debate, which CNN said was viewed by 48 million people on television and millions more online. \"Joe Biden's problem is not his age,\" the 78-year-old Trump said. \"It's his competence. He's grossly incompetent.\" The former president said he did not believe speculation that Mr Biden would drop out of the race, saying he \"does better in polls\" than other Democrats, including California Governor Gavin Newsom and Vice-President Kamala Harris.\n\nName-calling and insults - key moments from Biden and Trump’s debate",
    "Voters say they are concerned about Biden after debate": "'I feel terrible for him and America': Voters worry about Biden\n\n16 hours ago By Ana Faguy , BBC News, Washington Share\n\nBBC\n\nPresident Joe Biden and former president Donald Trump squared off on Thursday night in the first presidential debate of the 2024 election cycle. Voters across the country have expressed concerned about the candidates' ages - Mr Biden is 81 and Trump is 78 - and the debate supercharged that anxiety. Still, with weeks left until the conventions when each party will formalise their choice of candidate, supporters of both major parties feel they are left with few options. The BBC spoke to Democratic, Republican and independent voters who told us they are concerned about Mr Biden's fitness for the ticket. After Thursday's debate, we asked them if his widely criticised performance will sway how they vote. We start with a voter who feels that she has no choice but to support the president.\n\nI didn’t watch the whole thing. I could not handle it, this is the best our country can do? If Hillary would have walked out in her pantsuit I would have been happy as hell. I absolutely despise Trump and everything he stands for - his lying, cheating and lack of morals. Biden is a much better human being, but I felt so bad for him last night and it was such a disappointment. I was thinking State of the Union \"Jacked up Joe\". No, what we got was everything that everyone saying was wrong with him just showed up on stage. I feel terrible for him and America, but we just have to ride it out. Honestly, the debate really kind of disengaged me. I feel like there’s nothing I can do but vote blue, whoever it is.\n\nDominic identifies as a Libertarian and voted third-party in 2016 and 2020, but this time around he's fully backing the former president. I'm a fan of Trump and I'm enthusiastically going to be voting for him. Going into this debate, I thought the Republicans were setting themselves up for failure. I actually am surprised Biden did as poorly as he did, I thought he’d do better. I was moderately happy with Trump. I thought he seemed much more presidential, especially compared to the debates last time around. He was really negative last time. I think he struck the perfect tone last night. The Trump you saw on stage was much different than the one you saw in 2016. The 2016 Trump would have taken a lot more cheap shots at Biden’s age. Biden seemed very defeated in his body language. I think Trump seemed very presidential with how he dealt with Biden's age. I'm enthusiastically going to vote for Trump at this point and I didn’t vote for him in either 2016 and 2020. [Dominic texted a few minutes later] In 2016, you almost could've considered me a Never Trumper. My opinion on him has completely changed.\n\nConnor is Democrat who voted for Biden in 2020. He plans to do the same in 2024, but is concerned about the president's age. I am nervous about a second Biden term. There’s no doubt in my mind that the people surrounding Biden are competent and have the ability to carry out the necessities of the executive branch. There’s also no doubt in my mind that Biden has the best interest of this country at heart. That being said, I am less confident in the ability of Biden to lead this country today than I ever have been. The Biden administration's efforts on infrastructure, rallying our allies, pardoning of those with marijuana offences, investing in clean energy and forward looking technologies, and reducing prescription drug prices are all monumental actions. I think this first term has been fairly successful, which is why it pains me to say Biden may not be the best figurehead for these policies or moment. I don’t think any of this could convince me to vote for Trump. I simply could not get behind a candidate who has reduced faith in our election system dramatically while all his own advisers told him he was wrong. Or a candidate who is clearly lacking in any moral character based on his extramarital affairs that have now been accepted as fact in a court of law and a myriad of other scandals. Or a candidate that enables the worst sort of hatred and politicisation in every facet of our society and government. Or a candidate who I have never heard speak intelligently or in depth about any topic ever.\n\nCrystal is an ardent supporter of Trump who voted for the former president twice before and will again in November. Trump came across very level-headed and presidential and Biden came across very weak. I really did not think it was a good idea for Biden to even do this debate. He actually did not look mentally sound to me. He came across really weak and feeble. It was painful to watch 90 minutes of this debate between Biden and Trump. The fentanyl crisis, border security and of course the economy are my top three concerns, and I did not feel like Biden addressed those issues at all. I'm against abortion and against the abortion pill like Trump. I like that he is pro-life and I like that he sides with Christian conservative values. I think this country respects him and after this debate, I really think he’ll win. This debate solidified that he can win and will win.\n\nShana plans to back Biden in the upcoming election but is not happy with the country's current state of affairs. I was very frustrated watching the debate. I feel that the answers that they were giving weren’t really answers to any of the questions. It was exhausting to watch. I don’t think either of them performed better than the other. Mr Biden looked tired, he looked weak. Even if he did have a cold and he had good things to say, he wasn't getting it out and he wasn’t understandable. That reminds me of how Kennedy beat Nixon in the first televised debate by looking healthier. Trump was being aggressive, going off on tangents. Although he appeared stronger in physicality, I don’t think he did well in content. I believe I'm still going to vote for Mr Biden because I don’t want Mr Trump in office. I would love it if both parties would reconsider their candidates. I know that idea is being thrown around right now, it would do us better. Before Biden announced running for re-election, I was hoping he would step aside for someone else to come forward. But I would rather a Democrat be in office than Mr Trump.",
    "Biden-Trump debate panned by world media": "'A reality show': World reacts to Trump-Biden debate\n\n17 hours ago By Rachel Looker and BBC Monitoring , BBC News, Washington Share\n\nGetty Images A vendor in Hong Kong, China, sells newspapers covering the US debate\n\nA weak Joe Biden self-destructed in front of the whole world, while an aggressive Donald Trump told lies and mangled his sentences in a presidential debate that was like a reality show, according to international media. The verdicts of pundits from around the globe to Thursday night’s televised clash in Atlanta, Georgia, between the two White House rivals was damning. From Beijing to New Delhi and beyond, the reviews were most scathing of President Biden’s performance at the CNN forum, but his Republican challenger did not escape criticism.\n\nRussian media brand Biden 'total failure'\n\nEven before last night's debate, the main evening news shows on Russian TV on Thursday were speculating that Mr Biden would not be able to survive it. \"An hour and a half live on air is a test of mental and physical fitness,\" Channel One said, asserting that Mr Biden would \"find it difficult to withstand this\". Both state-owned Channel One and Rossiya 1 reported opinion polling showing that some 60% expected Mr Biden to be given a stimulant to get through the debate. Afterwards, pro-Kremlin commentators portrayed Mr Biden's performance in the debate as lacklustre. Military blog Rybar branded his performance a \"total failure\"; while the Telegram channel of the Russia in Global Affairs magazine said that Mr Biden had failed to prove that he was in \"proper physical shape\" to lead the country and that his performance \"appears to have frightened his supporters\". Rossiya 1 TV said on Friday morning that voters were concerned about Mr Biden's \"mental health\". It also highlighted Trump's attacks on Mr Biden's handling of the Ukraine war.\n\nName-calling and insults - key moments from Biden and Trump’s debate\n\n'Like a reality show' - Chinese media\n\nChinese media were enthused by the theatrics of last night’s debate, and many outlets highlighted that Mr Biden and Trump didn’t shake hands at the beginning of the debate and went on to launch “fierce personal attacks against each other”. The state-owned Global Times describes the debate as “like a reality show”. Chinese satirical cartoons often depict a fierce, quite literal, battle between the two candidates, but Chinese audiences enjoyed the more quirky aspects of the debate, such as the pair going “off topic to discuss their golf skills”. Generally, Chinese media want to paint a picture for audiences of general apathy and frustration among US voters at both candidates. Global Times says they were both scrutinised over their “age and stamina”; noting that on the campaign trail, Trump was “frequently mangling his sentences” and that Mr Biden “often makes verbal slip-ups”. Some outlets take aim at Trump over “lying” and Mr Biden “mumbling”. China frequently highlights growing divisions in US society and often suggests the US may descend into civil war. The overall message is that both Trump and Mr Biden are “currently facing difficulties”. After last night’s debate, many took to social media to express “concerns about America’s future”, Xinhua news agency says.\n\nIndian media highlight 'aggression' of Trump\n\nProminent Indian media outlets highlighted a \"shaky\" performance by Mr Biden and \"aggression\" by Trump in their coverage of the debate. Analysing the \"key takeaways\", a report on Hindustan Times newspaper's website described the debate as a \"high stake face-off that will turn the tide for rest of the campaign\". It said that Mr Biden appeared to be \"struggling and even froze several times\". Trump showed \"more aggression\" and \"capitalised on Biden’s missteps\" such as during a discussion on immigration, it added. Some media outlets picked up on Trump's claim Mr Biden was getting \"paid by China\". \"'Manchurian Candidate, Paid By China': Trump's Big Charge Against Biden,\" read a headline on the NDTV channel's website. A report on Firstpost website noted that climate change was a topic where India and China figured in the debate. The US election result is not expected to change India-US ties much as Prime Minister Narendra Modi - who's just started a third term in power - shares a good rapport with both Mr Biden and Trump.\n\nIsrael media talks of Biden 'weakness'\n\nIn Israel, media agreed that Mr Biden looked “weak”, and theorised how a Trump presidential win would affect the ongoing Gaza war. During the debate, Trump said if he was president, the 7 October Hamas-led attack on Israel would not have happened. Media highlighted Trump’s pro-Israel credentials as he accused Mr Biden of weakness: “He’s become like a Palestinian. But they don’t like him. Because he’s a very bad Palestinian. He’s a very weak one,” Trump said. Barak Ravid, the diplomatic correspondent for the Walla news site, said that Mr Biden was \"unfocused” on the conflict. \"He failed to explain the extent of his support for Israel and it was possible for Trump to attack him, and present him as someone who is trying to prevent Israel from eliminating Hamas,\" Ravid said. Ynet’s veteran defence analyst, Ron Ben-Yishai, said: \"Trump is now seen as a candidate whose victory in the presidential elections is almost certain, and all the actors and elements, from Russia and Ukraine to Israel and Saudi Arabia, and also Iran, will conduct themselves from now on according to this assumption.\" Ben-Yishai said certain elements in Israel ”are already rubbing their hands with joy” at the prospect of a second Trump presidency.\n\nLatin America media say Biden 'hesitant and confused'\n\nLatin America's media were riveted by what they called the \"tense\" presidential debate, highlighting their rancorous exchanges over immigration, the economy, abortion and global politics. Many media pundits in the region saw Trump succeeding in stoking doubts about Mr Biden's age by pummelling him energetically on issues sensitive to US voters, such as inflation and immigration. \"Trump corners Biden in tense debate,\" was how leading Brazilian daily Folha de Sao Paulo headlined its initial report. Mr Biden’s “hesitant and confused performance… could radically change the scenario of the elections\", Folha added. Posting on X, prominent Mexican journalist Leon Krauze drew a similar conclusion, saying Mr Biden \"stumbled, lost his thread and was incapable of showing up the lies of his rival\". Meanwhile, Argentina’s La Nacion said that \"the Democrat president was not able to dispel the doubts about his age and his health, and he set off alarms in his party\". Colombian daily El Tiempo saw the exchanges between Trump and Mr Biden characterised by \"insults, jibes and few proposals\" in which \"neither of the two appeared to overcome the concerns over their advanced age\". “The debate shows Trump strong and Biden weak,\" was how Brazilian daily O Estado de S. Paulo summed up one analysis. \"Biden self-destructed in front of the American public and the world... Biden debated desperately badly,\" Brazilian analyst Demetrio Magnoli said on the popular G1 news website.\n\nMexican media cite 'nest of rats' comment by Trump\n\nIn Mexico, media tend to be wary of calls from US politicians for drastic measures to stem the flow of migrants and illicit drugs, so reporting on the debate homed in on the repeated clashes over immigration, mostly consisting of Trump slamming what he called Mr Biden's failure to secure the border. Left-wing Mexican daily La Jornada highlighted the debate \"clash over migration and the economy\". \"During the first presidential debate, ex-President Donald Trump criticised the immigration policy of the Joe Biden Government and said that migrants would have to be removed from the country for alleged crimes committed against Americans,\" Mexican daily Reforma told its readers. In its coverage, Mexican news magazine Proceso focused on Trump asserting that the US had become a \"nest of rats\" because he said Mr Biden's immigration policies had \"opened the door to criminals, murderers and rapists\".\n\nTurkish media: New Trump era is approaching",
    "Trump evades debate question on whether he will accept election result": "Trump evades debate questions on accepting election results\n\n1 day ago By Tiffany Wertheimer , BBC News Share\n\nEPA\n\nDonald Trump has refused to explicitly say whether he will accept the result of November's US presidential election. During his first debate with President Joe Biden on Thursday, Trump was asked three times whether he would accept the outcome \"regardless of who wins\", finally answering: “If it's a fair and legal and good election, absolutely.” Trump lost his shot at a second presidential term to Mr Biden in the 2020 election. He has since consistently claimed that the vote was rigged against him, without providing any evidence. During Thursday night's debate, Trump repeated these claims, and played down his role in the 6 January riot on Capitol Hill. Mr Biden hit back, accusing Trump of “continuing to promote this lie\" about the election being \"stolen\" from him. The debate, hosted by CNN in Atlanta, saw Trump remain largely composed and focused, as his opponent struggled to maintain his train of thought and at times finish his sentences clearly.\n\nCNN moderator Dana Bash had to repeatedly ask Trump if he would accept the election results. The first time, he dodged the question by saying he wanted a fair and free election \"more than anybody”. The second time, he ignored the question and instead ranted about the war in Ukraine, saying Vladimir Putin would never have invaded if he was the US president, because \"I got along with him very well... he knew not to play games\". The third time, when told to answer \"yes or no\", Trump finally said he \"absolutely\" would accept the outcome if the election was \"fair and legal and good\". He then referenced the \"ridiculous\" fraud in the last election, for which there is no evidence. Trump's repeated claims about the 2020 vote are related to criminal charges he is currently facing, as federal prosecutors allege he pressed officials to reverse the results and knowingly spread lies about election fraud. Trump then said it would be easier for him to just accept the results rather than have to run for president again. “I doubt whether you’ll accept it because you’re such a whiner,\" Joe Biden said. \"You can’t stand the loss. Something snapped in you when you lost last time.”\n\nTrump evasive on accepting election results\n\nAbortion claims\n\nTrump made several assertions during the debate that either have no evidence or are factually wrong. On abortion, Trump turned to what he called Democratic extremism - that the party wants to \"take the life of the baby in the ninth month and even after birth\". He even got graphic when he said they want to \"rip the baby out of the womb.\" \"That is simply not true,\" Mr Biden said. Trump's comment stems from a popular falsehood with anti-abortion activists that Democrats are in favour of a policy that allows abortions right up to birth. When the debate turned to the 6 January riot, Trump dodged the question on what he would say to voters who are worried about his actions and inactions on that day, and that he might do it again. Instead, he tried to turn the focus to Mr Biden, saying the US went from being respected \"all over the world\" to a laughing stock when the Democrat became president. Trump insisted that he told protesters to be \"peacefully patriotic\". \"What they’ve done to some people that are so innocent, you ought to be ashamed of yourself,\" he said to Mr Biden, who criticised him for refusing to denounce the rioters. Trump has pledged to pardon \"many\" of those convicted of offences over the riot, describing them as \"January 6th hostages\". He also blamed the chaos on Nancy Pelosi, who was House Speaker at the time, saying he offered her 10,000 National Guard but she \"turned them down\". There is no evidence that this offer was ever made, the Select Committee that investigated the insurrection found. It was also refuted by Trump's acting secretary of defence, Christopher Miller.\n\n'Suckers and losers'",
    "Can Biden be replaced as Democrat nominee? Who could replace him?": "Can Biden be replaced as nominee? Not so easy\n\n14 hours ago By Christal Hayes, Holly Honderich & Rachel Looker , BBC News Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nKnives are out for President Joe Biden after his poorly received performance in the first 2024 presidential debate against Donald Trump. Democratic sources told the BBC of panic and confusion within the party and discussions about whether Mr Biden, 81, should step down. The New York Times editorial board - the beating heart of the US liberal establishment - said Mr Biden was a \"shadow\" of his former self and should stand aside. But could Mr Biden back out now? What would happen? And who could replace him? The short answer is that unless he agrees to stand aside, it's difficult and could get ugly. Let's run through the scenarios.\n\nCan Joe Biden withdraw?\n\nYes, if - and it's a big 'if' - Mr Biden decides to retire, it would be relatively straightforward to find another candidate. The party's nominee will officially be chosen at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago from 19-22 August. The Democrats are planning to nominate Mr Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris virtually before the gathering to comply with a ballot certification deadline in Ohio. There, a candidate must win support from the majority of \"delegates\" - party officials who formally choose the nominee. Delegates are assigned to candidates proportionally based on the results of each state's primary election. This year, Mr Biden won almost 99% of the nearly 4,000 delegates. According to DNC rules, those delegates are \"pledged\" to support the incumbent president. If Mr Biden willingly drops out, it could turn into a free-for-all. Democrats would be left with an open convention where they would suggest potential nominees and continue voting until one receives the majority of delegate votes. That could spark a frantic contest among Democrats vying for a shot at the nomination. Mr Biden has so far given no indication that he would consider stepping aside. But if decides to drop out of the race, \"that opens up an entirely different can of worms\", political historian Leah Wright Rigueur told BBC News. \"I think that if he were to get replaced, part of the negotiation for him stepping down would be that he would get the final say in who replaces him,\" she said.\n\nCould he be forced out?\n\nThis is an even less plausible scenario. And if he doesn't want to go, this is where the process gets really tricky. In the modern political era, a major national party has never tried a hostile takeover of the nomination and there is no evidence of any serious plan to do so now. However, DNC regulations do have some loopholes that could, in theory, make it possible to push Mr Biden out. The rules allow delegates to \"in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them\", meaning they could look to someone else. \"It could be an incredibly ugly scenario,\" Ms Wright Rigueur said. Experts told BBC News they doubt there would be a revolt among party delegates. But the DNC can alter party rules at any point. Ms Wright Rigueur pointed to 1968, when President Lyndon B Johnson decided not to run for reelection. The party shifted from an open convention process, in which delegates could cast ballots for whomever they chose, to a bound process, where a delegate was attached to a candidate based on primary results. \"At any point in time, the rules committee can change the rules surrounding how you select a presidential nominee,\" she said. \"Nothing is outside of the realm of possibility,\" she added. Even if Mr Biden were suddenly to exit the race, conservative groups have vowed to file lawsuits challenging the legality of any replacement Democrat's eligibility for the ballot.\n\nCould Kamala Harris replace Biden?\n\nVice-President Kamala Harris would automatically take Mr Biden's place if he were to step down during his presidential term. But the same rules do not apply if Mr Biden pulls out as a candidate for November's election race, and there is no mechanism in place that would give the vice-president an upper hand at an open convention. Instead, Ms Harris would have to win the majority of delegates, just like any other candidate. As she is already on the Democratic ticket, Ms Harris could certainly be favoured. But her relatively low popularity among the American public might dull that advantage. Her net disapproval is now lower than Mr Biden's and Donald Trump's, according to FiveThirtyEight.\n\nWho else could take Biden's place?\n\nMr Biden did face challengers from within his party this election cycle, including Minnesota congressman Dean Phillips and writer Marianne Williamson. But both were longshots and neither is likely to rise to the top of any shortlist. There are some calls for California Governor Gavin Newsom, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer or Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro to ride to the rescue. But none of those candidates has publicly declared any wish to supplant the incumbent.\n\nCould the 25th Amendment be invoked?",
    "Kenya finance bill protests: Was there a massacre in Githurai?": "Was there a massacre after Kenya's anti-tax protests?\n\n15 hours ago By Anne Soy, BBC deputy Africa editor & Peter Mwai, BBC Verify , Nairobi Share\n\nAFP Police opened fire at protesters outside parliament\n\nIn the chaotic context of this week's violence on the streets of the Kenyan capital and a government accused of responding brutally to protests, rumours began to take on a life of their own - feeding into public anger and further stoking a situation that was already tense. On Tuesday citizens watched in horror as a bloody day unfolded in Nairobi. The country’s police watchdog is now investigating allegations that officers shot dead protesters outside the national parliament during a day of demonstrations in which at least 23 people are reported to have died. Within hours many Kenyans began to hear reports of another, even more brutal incident - an alleged massacre of civilians in Githurai, a residential suburb 14km (nine miles) north-east of central Nairobi. The story quickly took hold on social media, where some people claimed more than 200 had been killed. Reports referencing the rumours emerged in the media, followed on Wednesday by statements by reputable organisations calling for an independent inquiry. When protesters returned to the heart of Nairobi on Thursday, many spoke of the alleged massacre in Githurai as a reason. But a BBC investigation has found no evidence of mass killings in Githurai - raising questions about how readily misinformation can spread amid a crisis. Here we unpick how the story unfolded. The first sense of anything significant taking place in the suburb emerged on Tuesday evening. It had been a chaotic day across Kenya, with tens of thousands attending protests in central Nairobi which quickly escalated, leading to the storming of parliament, the shooting dead of protesters, looting and attacks on police. After the shocking violence outside and inside parliament the demonstrators began to disperse, many headed towards their homes on the city’s outskirts. Githurai is a densely populated residential area on the Thika Highway, the main road north from the city centre. It has rows of formal housing as well as areas of informal settlements, home to tens of thousands of commuters who make the daily trip into central Nairobi. As dusk fell many Githurai residents suddenly became aware of a significant presence of police and what many believed were the military. Communications were patchy on Tuesday evening, with internet outages across Kenya and mobile phone signals periodically going down. But as news of events in Githurai emerged, some videos did make their way to social media. BBC Verify has managed to authenticate several videos posted by six different online users and from different locations around the area. They show evidence of heavy and continuous gunfire in Githurai, around the main roundabout on the Thika Highway.\n\nReddit On the video taken in Githurai, security forces can be heard shooting dozens of rounds\n\nIn one video, we see security forces advancing towards the protesters and some can be seen shooting - it is unclear from the video whether at the protesters or in the air, and it is impossible to know whether the guns were firing live rounds, rubber bullets or blanks. We are yet to come across any verifiable video or image of people killed around that time. A graphic image circulating online shows a body with at least eight bullet holes, but the nature of how it was taken makes it challenging to verify because it is taken at very close range and there are no clearly identifiable location points.\n\nX/@mugambi_md People who had been at the demonstration walked with their hands up when they approached Githurai\n\nIn one video clip, which we were able to authenticate by verifying identifiable locations, people can be seen walking towards Githurai. Smoke can be seen rising from the area from a distance as the person filming walks towards the suburb. Those walking alongside the person filming are raising their hands up to show they do not pose any danger. Another video filmed nearby the roundabout shows dozens of people gathered around the area and running away from the scene as gunfire can be heard. In some of the videos, you can see what looks like vehicles belonging to the military or police on the road, and in two of the clips those filming talk about the road having been blocked by protesters. Although the details are hard to verify, it is clear that a major security operation took place in the suburb. But an analysis of social media shows misinformation about what had happened was already starting to take hold. BBC Verify found that old videos filmed in 2022 were being reshared on social media, purporting to show protesters walking along a street carrying flaming torches at this week's protests. The BBC Global Disinformation Unit had previously investigated the clip and discovered that it was recorded in Ghana two years ago. This is not the first time it has been misrepresented. Despite the incomplete understanding of what happened in Githurai, as Kenyans woke up on Wednesday morning reports began to spread of an alleged massacre. It was discussed by radio DJs, reported as rumour by some Kenyan newspapers and widely discussed online. The word \"Githurai\" was trending on social media sites, including X. The state-funded Kenya National Commission on Human Rights said it had \"received unverified reports of scores of residents who were killed by the stray bullets\", which it said it would investigate. And later that day the allegations were given new credibility when they were referred to directly by a leading legal organisation, the Law Society of Kenya (LSK) - a body which represents the country’s lawyers and works to promote the rule of law.\n\nGetty Images The protesters in central Nairobi had been demanding that a finance bill containing new tax measures be withdrawn\n\nResponding to widespread public anger at alleged police brutality outside parliament, LSK president Faith Odhiambo also called for an international investigation into what she called the “massacre” in Githurai. In a press conference, carried by some Kenyan broadcasters, she said: “We call upon the international community to conduct independent investigations on the massacre meted on the residents of Githurai, Nairobi, on the night of 25 June 2024. “I dare ask, is Githurai a protected area? Is Githurai an area that members of the public should not stay, should not live? Why was there a massacre where people are living peacefully? We demand answers to those questions.” She added: “From social media, people have been saying that over 100 people were killed yesterday. So we cannot allow those lives to go uncounted, that the people who caused those deaths to be held accountable.” Ms Odhiambo has subsequently told the BBC that she now accepts she did not have evidence of a mass killing at the time that she gave her press conference and said she was willing to withdraw the allegation a massacre had occurred. In an interview on Thursday, she said the LSK intended to establish a help desk in Githurai to “slowly collect” evidence of what had happened - and said in previous incidents of mass shootings in Kenya, bodies had been buried and only found later. She said: “We need to ascertain the number. We want to set up a team to investigate the concerns that were made, the rumours that bodies were collected.” Asked specifically whether she stood by her decision to make the allegation of a massacre, she said: “Maybe in hindsight I accept that I shouldn’t have called it a massacre.” Other public bodies also spoke publicly about a “massacre” at Githurai. The word was used on Wednesday afternoon in a statement issued by the Police Reform Working Group, an alliance of organisations that campaign for better policing. The statement said: “Reports show that police shot several people in Githurai in Nairobi - one over 40 times - between 10pm and 1am, way after the protest ended. “We believe that the massacre that happened in Githurai was fueled by an inciteful, and insensitive address President William Ruto gave yesterday at State House. Ruto spoke at 9 pm and threatened Kenyans, and the massacre started at 10pm.” A spokesperson for the Police Reform Working Group on Friday told the BBC the organisation’s position was now that the alleged massacre at Githurai was “unverified”, but declined to comment any further on its statement from Wednesday. By Wednesday afternoon the sense of public anger about the incident in Githurai was so significant that the BBC sent a reporting team to investigate on the ground. But by the time the crew arrived, the bustling suburb was largely calm as traders carried on with their businesses. Many of those we spoke to confirmed Tuesday’s violent confrontations between civilians and security forces. A police vehicle was burned. “We dismantled the shell and sold what remained of it as scrap metal,” one resident told us. But no-one we spoke to reported seeing any dead bodies, nor could they identify anyone who had been killed.\n\nEPA Relatives of the victims of the violence in Nairobi went to see their loved ones at Kenyatta National Hospital - the country's main referral hospital\n\nHowever, the BBC did track down a teenager who was shot during the incident in the suburb. Winfrey Wairimu, 16, was hit by a stray bullet as she visited her mother at her confectionery stall by a bus stop when a crowd of people ran by, pursued by security forces. Ms Wairimu’s mother Tabitha Mwaniki, 37, spoke to the BBC about what happened. “Security officers were chasing them, lobbing teargas canisters and firing gunshots,” she said. “She called out ‘Mum!’ and I thought she was just in shock because of the chaos she’d witnessed. “I called her name, ‘Wairimu, Wairimu’, but she didn’t answer.” The BBC has since visited the injured teenager and her mother at Nairobi’s Kenyatta National Hospital, where she underwent surgery on Wednesday for a bullet wound on her waist. By Wednesday evening details began emerging of different allegations from Githurai - of protesters attacking police. In its main evening bulletin on Wednesday, Kenya’s Citizen TV reported that 20 officers had been injured after a police vehicle was attacked - and repeated the allegation heard earlier by the BBC that another police vehicle had been burned. Despite the confusing picture about what had happened, Githurai remained part of the conversation in Nairobi as the week progressed. On Thursday, BBC reporters met several people joining renewed protests in the capital who said news of the alleged massacre had in part inspired them to demonstrate. One woman told us: “People were massacred yesterday at home. I don’t understand why people are not actually talking about what happened in Githurai. “The internet was down, electricity was down. So many deaths were recorded, we were hearing gunshots from wherever. But there’s nobody actually talking about what happened in Githurai. “Nobody is explaining why that number of people was killed there.” “I barely got any sleep yesterday just thinking about how many people died in Githurai,” she added. Asked to respond to the fact that no evidence had emerged of a mass killing in the suburb, she said: “There are videos of people being shot down, but at that time things were down - the internet was down, electricity was down.” Kenya’s Standard newspaper has reported that there were three deaths in Githurai, something the BBC has been unable to confirm and an allegation on which the police have declined to comment. The BBC has asked Kenya’s police about what happened in Githurai but the force declined to comment. A human rights advocate who lives and works in Githurai, Njoki Gachanja, told investigations platform Africa Uncensored that the reports of a massacre were untrue. “All these bodies that people have been talking about – that did not happen in Githurai,” she said in a video posted on Africa Uncensored’s account on Wednesday. She said the organisation she works for, Githurai Social Justice Centre, had been “on the ground since morning”, held community meetings and forums trying to look for these victims or their families, but had found no evidence of killings at the reported scale. “I’d like to confirm that I live in Githurai and there’s no massacre in Githurai.” Ms Gachanja did say they had traced one body with bullet wounds to City Mortuary, the main government morgue. She confirmed hearing the confrontation between security forces and youths in the area on Tuesday from around 18:00 to 20:00 local time with more gunfire heard overnight.\n\nAFP The police response to the protests sparked international concern\n\nMany in Kenya believe the government, police and security forces have serious questions to answer about their response to the protests. Kenya’s international allies and even the UN secretary-general expressed concern about Tuesday’s security response and warned the country to protect the right to peaceful demonstration. Yet it is clear that amid the chaos, not every claim made about the authorities was true. It may be that in time new details do emerge to support claims of police brutality in Githurai. But by Friday evening the respected Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, whose figures have been used by many global media organisations, said its confirmed death toll linked to the protests this week remained at 23, including 19 in Nairobi during the actual protests on Tuesday. And after the alleged massacre in Githurai there is still no evidence of mass killings, with at least some of those who made the allegations now prepared to accept there is doubt over what happened. The story of how news spread of what happened, or rather what may not have happened, in the suburb is a reminder of the power of online communication. Social media has become a significant tool in inspiring and co-ordinating grassroots protests and it has been used in recent weeks in Kenya to make a powerful impact. But as the BBC’s work to assess the evidence in the case of Githurai appears to demonstrate, it has the ability too to mislead and add fuel to an already raging fire.\n\nMore BBC stories on the Kenya protests:\n\nGetty Images/BBC",
    "MIRV: Did North Korea succeed in firing a new missile?": "North Korea says it fired a new weapon - is it lying?\n\n17 hours ago By Tessa Wong , BBC News, Asia Digital Reporter Share\n\nReuters North Korean state media released this image showing what it said was its multiple warhead missile test\n\nA weapons test this week has become the latest point of contention between North and South Korea, with Pyongyang saying they fired an advanced multiple warhead missile and Seoul accusing them of lying. Hours after North Korean state media lauded the \"success\" of their test and ran pictures as proof on Thursday, the South called it \"deception and exaggeration\" and released their own evidence pointing towards failure. Analysts meanwhile remain uncertain about the truth of the North's claims. The dispute underscores the complexities of verifying North Korea's weapons development, which continues to advance despite severe international sanctions. If North Korea's latest claims are true, it would represent significant progress in their missile programme. Multiple warhead missiles are difficult to defend against and the technology is challenging to develop. Currently only the US - which first developed it in the 1960s - as well as the UK, France, Russia and China are known to have these capabilities. Pyongyang is now trumpeting that they are a step closer to achieving it as well. For some time now, experts have floated the possibility of North Korea eventually developing MIRV capabilities. MIRV stands for multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle. The technology involves attaching several warheads to a single missile that would separate after launch. The warheads would then be powered by their own rockets to hit various targets. They can be released at different speeds and in multiple directions, allowing them to hit targets hundreds of kilometres apart from one another. This is what makes these weapons particularly efficient. Pyongyang said on Thursday that it had \"successfully conducted the separation and guidance control test of individual mobile warheads\" the day before. The weapon, it said, used the first-stage engine of an intermediate-range solid-fuel ballistic missile, and deployed three warheads plus a decoy. The missile travelled a \"shortened range\" of 170 to 200km (105 to 124 miles) to ensure safety and measure the flights of the warheads, said state media. The warheads were each \"guided correctly\" to their targets while anti-air radar found the decoy had effectively deployed as well. The test was of \"great significance in bolstering\" their missile forces and was aimed at \"securing the MIRV capability\", which has been set as a top priority.\n\nReuters North Korean state media said this photo showed the decoy separating from the missile\n\nSouth Korea's military however was quick to debunk these claims, saying the \"flight was not normal\" and that the weapon had exploded mid-flight. It released a video it had filmed of the test, saying that the initial stage showed an unstable flight that led to a mid-air explosion. Military officials said they detected a large amount of debris, more than what should result from a successful test. They also said North Korea's pictures purportedly showing the warheads and decoy separating from the missile were actually pictures of an intercontinental ballistic missile test carried out in March. Analysts cited by South Korean news agency Yonhap pointed out that the range of the test was more typically seen in intercontinental ballistic missile tests. They also believed the missile may have had insufficient guidance and control systems. Other experts believe some parts of the test succeeded - though much remains unknown. Yang Uk, a researcher at Asan Institute for Policy Studies, told the BBC that while he believed the flight and separation of warheads had worked, \"North Korea has not revealed evidence whether the warheads reached their targets - we cannot say they succeeded here\". Japan's defence ministry said the missile achieved a maximum altitude of 100km. This meant it did not enter outer space and instead stayed in the Earth's atmosphere. Dr Yang said this also meant that \"the warheads were not tested for the high heat and pressure that follow re-entry into atmosphere, so we cannot know their capabilities\". The weapons test was spotted by South Koreans living by the border, and a video carried by South Korean media taken by a civilian observer showed a visible contrail in the sky.\n\nReuters Residents of South Korea's Yeonpyeong island had spotted the missile launch",
    "Diljit Dosanjh: From Coachella to Fallon, decoding his stardom": "From Coachella to Fallon: Decoding Diljit Dosanjh's stardom\n\n17 hours ago By Zoya Mateen , BBC News Share\n\nGetty Images There is no bigger name in Punjabi music than Diljit Dosanjh\n\nWho is Diljit Dosanjh? The answer to that question would depend on who you ask. To the uninitiated, Dosanjh is an incredibly popular Punjabi singer who last week made his debut on Jimmy Fallon’s The Tonight Show. The 40-year-old proudly sits atop what is known as the \"Punjabi wave\", a new generation of artists melding homegrown Punjabi music with rap and hip-hop. Introduced by Fallon as \"the biggest Punjabi artist on the planet\", Dosanjh - dressed in traditional attire - performed his hits Born to Shine and G.O.A.T in front of a packed audience. \"Few seconds into it and everyone was dancing,\" says Sucharita Tyagi, a film critic who was present at the show. \"You should have seen the faces of the house band - they were mind-blown.\"\n\nGetty Images Dosanjh performed two of his hit tracks at The Tonight Show\n\nBack in India, Dosanjh is also recognised as versatile actor who sings in all his films, as well as an accomplished producer. And to others who may never have seen his films or followed his music, he is a social media star who routinely creates a stir with funny videos on Instagram - a video of him having a hilariously frustrating conversation in Punjabi with voice assistant Alexa is a particular favourite for many. Dosanjh is particularly interesting because his image is the antithesis of the Punjabi hip-hop stereotype, a musician who eschews the music's gritty sound and vocabulary for something more organic and traditional. He is a soulful singer, his rich baritone soaring and quivering with emotion at the right places. At shows, he brings the house down with his energy (and gets Ed Sheeran to sing in Punjabi). And his performances on screen can move people to tears or laughter. For his fans, he is foremost a \"beeba munda\", or a \"good boy\", whose spontaneity, natural charm and relatable persona make him one of the most endearing stars of his time. \"Ask three people in a room why they like the man and they'll give different reasons: his acting, singing or just the Instagram content he makes,\" Tyagi says. \"But they'll all have one thing in common, which is their love for the person he is.\"\n\nGetty Images Dosanjh's humble beginnings as a small village boy are a big part of his story\n\nBorn as Diljit Singh in the Dosanjh Kalan village in Punjab, Dosanjh started his career by singing devotional songs at a local gurdwara. Those who knew him at the time say he was a \"bashful boy\" who \"barely had any beard, but had the rhythm, did bhangra well, and tied a very good turban\". \"He was a very god-fearing beeba boy, who was hungry to learn,\" Rajinder Singh, a song producer who gave Dosanjh his first break, once told The Indian Express. At 16, he released his first album. The songs were less of a sensation at night clubs than at wedding parties, where his wide-eyed innocence and soulful voice instantly made him popular. Soon, he was getting shows almost every day. A few years later, his parents sent him to the city of Ludhiana to live and train with his uncle, a local musician. It was a fertile time for pop music with regional artistes like Daler Mehndi and Panjabi MC of \"Mundian to bach ke\" fame taking Punjabi sounds to the world. In 2006, Dosanjh did his first international tour in Canada and a year later, he released his second album, this time under his new name: Diljit Dosanjh. One thing led to another and by 2010, Dosanjh had also established himself as a popular actor in Punjab's vibrant film industry. Six years later, he made his Bollywood debut. Now, he's a global star.\n\nGetty Images He routinely packs stadiums with his concerts around the world\n\nLast year, he made history by becoming the first Punjabi language singer to perform at the Coachella festival. He also collaborated with pop singer Sia, and joined Sheeran while he was touring in India. In his interviews, Dosanjh has repeatedly said that his success was not by coincidence - that he worked day and night to get here, diligently practising singing even when he was not getting opportunities. But the modesty with which he carries himself makes him seem like a innocent bystander in his own path to fame. \"When a star grows to a certain stature, they usually want to reinvent themselves. But Dosanjh does not give in to personal excesses even as his popularity continues to soar,\" says communication consultant Dilip Cherian. \"By staying this modest good boy, he presses a whole bunch of right buttons with the audience,\" he adds. Yet, Cherian believes there is more than meets the eye - and that some of Dosanjh's authentic persona could perhaps be performative. In fact, Dosanjh himself has said that contrary to his image as a \"pure soul\" who does not care about the hustle, he's constantly trying to overtake competition: \"This is my job and I don't make bones about it.\" Dosanjh has consciously avoided falling into the trap of being \"an edgy bad boy\" - the conventional path followed by most of his peers, Cherian says. Apart from an early phase in his career where his songs featured guns and spoke about male pride, Dosanjh has mostly stayed clear of controversial subjects - ditching the usual tropes of revenge and violence in Punjabi pop for themes like faith, love and tradition. Some of his most popular tracks like G.O.A.T and Born to Shine talk about how he's not here for the money but to make a name for himself and his village.\n\nGetty Images Fans say Dosanjh's honesty make him utterly relateable\n\nHe starts every concert with the declaration, \"Panjabi aagaye hai (Punjab has arrived)\", sings only in his mother tongue and claims he could not care less about speaking English well. \"When you come from a really small place like mine, you want the world to know about it,\" he once said in an interview. Though Dosanjh is aware of his roots - with each song trying to represent some aspect of his Punjabi identity - he is also not constrained by it. He draws heavily on tradition but also experiments with it, blending pop with blustering bhangra beats into songs that make hackneyed old tropes sound fresh and relevant. When it comes to acting, he straddles comedy and serious roles, doing films on insurgency and the drug problem in Punjab such as Udta Punjab, along with light-hearted satires and love stories like Jatt & Juliet.\n\nGetty Images Dosanjh made a successful appearance on Jimmy Fallon's The Tonight Show recently",
    "Mauritania election: Jihadist, migration, slavery the key issues": "Slavery, migration and jihadists - the issues as Mauritania votes\n\n15 hours ago By Aaron Akinyemi & Danai Nesta Kupemba , BBC News Share\n\nAFP Some two million people are registered to vote in the election\n\nAs Mauritanians head to the polls in the presidential election, the country faces a multitude of issues including a legacy of military coups, migration, jihadist attacks in neighbouring countries and a harrowing legacy of slavery. President Mohamed ould Cheikh Ghazouani, who has been in power since the country's first democratic transition in 2019, is seeking a second and final term. Six other candidates are challenging him for the top job. This election is a litmus test of Mauritania’s burgeoning democracy and an indicator of how well it is progressing on its path to greater political openness.\n\nWhen former President Mohamed ould Abdel Aziz stepped down in 2019 after his tenure, it heralded a new era for a country that had endured multiple military coups and authoritarian rule. \"Mauritania has the strongest democratic credentials in the Sahel at present, which given its history of coups is quite surprising,” Joseph Hammond, iDove Fellow at the African Union, told the BBC.\n\nOne of those hoping to be Mauritania's next leader is Biram ould Dah ould Abeid, who came second in the 2019 elections. Mr Abeid's grandparents were slaves and he has spent much of his life campaigning against the practice. He has been arrested and imprisoned over the years because of his work as president of the Initiative for the Resurgence of the Abolitionist Movement (IRA). Slavery remains a sensitive issue in Mauritania, which was the last country in the world to outlaw slavery, in 1981. \"My father fought against pro-slavery all his life. I swore to my father that I would fight without ever compromising. I would fight slavery and those who support it,\" Mr Abeid told the BBC in 2016. It has been abolished in the country three times, but thousands of black Mauritanians still live as unpaid domestic servants, while anti-slavery activists face repression. An estimated 149,000 people are enslaved in Mauritania - about 3% of the population, according to the Global Slavery Index (GSI) in 2023.\n\nAFP President Ghazouani is hoping for a second and final term\n\nMigration is another hot topic issue that will be on voters' minds as they head to the polls. Mauritania is a key transit point for migrants trying to reach Europe from West Africa, with thousands of boats departing from the country last year. In April, the European Union granted Mauritania €210m (£177m; $225m) in aid - almost €60m of which will be invested in the fight against illegal immigration to Europe. Corruption also continues to be a major problem in Mauritania. Former President Aziz was jailed for five years for illicit enrichment and embezzlement and is disqualified from standing in the election. A simple guide to Mauritania\n\nSahel jihadists: West Africa faces up to policing its terror triangle The country is rich in various natural resources like iron, gold, phosphate and is an upcoming market in the oil sector in Africa, yet almost 59% of the population lives in poverty, according to the United Nations. It also has huge potential in renewable energy - particularly green hydrogen. This form of energy could eventually provide a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels and play a role in the country’s carbon-free energy transition. Investors from Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, particularly the United Arab Emirates, aim to make Mauritania an energy hub for green hydrogen production, according to the Africa Center for Strategic Studies.\n\nPresident Ghazouani has also campaigned on the importance of the country's security. Mauritania is in the Sahel region, the semi-arid strip of land south of the Sahara desert, which is a hotbed of jihadist activity, but the country has been generally free of attacks since 2011. Its neighbour, Mali, however continues to struggle with repeated jihadist attacks. Analysts have partially credited President Ghazouani, whose long career in the army and security services has given him a deep understanding of the jihadist challenges facing the Sahel region. President Ghazouani has developed a close alliance with Western partners like France and the US, but has also been careful to keep ties with its military-run neighbours like Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, who have shunned Western influence recently, reports the AFP news agency. Head of the US Africa Command, Gen Michael Langley, said Mauritania has had a “longstanding” role in countering terrorism and preventing violent extremism in the Sahel. Cheikhani Khlil, communication professor at Mauritania's Lebanese International University, told the BBC President Ghazouani has allied Mauritania with the US to combat the attacks. \"There is continued training conducted by US special forces for Mauritanian special forces units to secure national borders, which reinforces the tactical capabilities and combat readiness of our armed forces,\" he said. Analysts say that as an important player in regional security, Mauritania’s ability to continue this leadership role depends to a significant extent on an effective and peaceful transfer of power that leads to a stable government.\n\nMore BBC stories about the crisis in the Sahel:\n\nGetty Images/BBC",
    "FFXIV: Dawntrail a 'starting point for the next 10 years'": "Hitting reset: A new dawn for Final Fantasy's online world\n\n17 hours ago By Tom Richardson , BBC Newsbeat Share\n\nSquare Enix Final Fantasy 14 is the most profitable game in the popular franchise, according to its makers\n\nIt's a June Friday night in Tokyo, and Naoki Yoshida has weekend plans. \"Take it easy, rest up.\" Fairly standard, you might think. But Yoshida-san, the director of Final Fantasy 14 (FF14), knows that it'll probably be his last chance to relax for a while. When he speaks to BBC Newsbeat it's a week until Dawntrail, the latest expansion to the massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), is released. Following a \"disastrous\" launch in 2010, FF14 has gone on to become the most profitable title in the franchise's history, according to publisher Square Enix. The game's turned things around so much that servers struggled to keep up with demand when the previous expansion, Endwalker, launched in December 2021. It's not the only change since FF14 first came out. The industry, and Japan's place in it, has also shifted over the last decade. Final Fantasy is a massive cultural export for the country, and Square Enix has said it wants to focus more on the \"global market\" and its fans worldwide.\n\nThere's evidence of this approach in Dawntrail, a significant moment for Yoshida-san and his team, and one he calls \"the starting point for the next 10 years of Final Fantasy 14\". Endwalker brought a decade-long story arc to a close and Dawntrail opens a new saga. It also adds a graphical overhaul to the game, along with new character classes and other features. It's billed as a \"summer vacation\", with the action taking place in the sunny, Latin America-inspired Tural region of FF14's world. Yoshida-san says Final Fantasy games have previously taken inspiration from Europe and East Asia and his team wanted to try something different. He says Central and South America provide a \"huge area\" with \"a lot of history\" to draw from. Authetic representation of other cultures is something Square Enix has been criticised over in the past, and its recent games have made efforts to address this. Yoshida-san says he's always regarded FF14 as a \"global game\", but agrees that social media's influence has grown and \"it's become easier for people to gather together and make their voices heard\". He admits \"there are risks involved\" in depicting other cultures, but his team has made it a point \"to learn about the culture, read the texts that are available\". \"The world is diverse,\" he says. \"There are people who have many different sets of values, many different religions, many different senses of relationships. \"And so it's really important, I feel, that we understand those points.\"\n\nSquare Enix Yoshida-san says the players who put their trust in his team \"served as a source of motivation\"\n\nFinal Fantasy games have always mixed Japanese sensibilities with Western influences, but some have suggested that the series has had an identity crisis recently. Yoshida-san tells Newsbeat Square Enix makes \"50% to 80%\" of its profit from \"overseas fans\", who are \"really important to factor in when we are creating the game\". But he believes there's a balance to be found. \"We were born in Japan, we were brought up in Japan. So what we were brought up with was parts of Japanese culture,\" he says. \"So if we put too much of a focus ourselves on overseas audiences, we don't have that background and that context. \"If we focus so much on the overseas audiences, then whatever we make wouldn't be successful.\" However, Yoshida-san says the developers can't live in a bubble. \"I think knowing the world is very important for us in our development moving forward,\" he says.\n\nSquare Enix Yoshida-san is affectionately known as Yoshi-P by fans\n\nThere's recently been another significant change for Final Fantasy. Square Enix produces games for many platforms but has a history of striking up exclusive deals to guarantee some titles only appear on certain consoles. Sales of two recent PlayStation 5-only games, Final Fantasy 16 (FF16) and Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth, have reportedly disappointed in Japan. Following their release CEO Takashi Kiryu told investors the company would \"aggressively pursue a multiplatform strategy\" to get its games on more machines. Yoshida-san is familiar with arguments about exclusivity, having released the long-awaited Xbox version of FF14 this year. It's a sign of a wider shift in the industry, where companies are becoming less selective about where their games appear. In Japan, figures suggest gamers are opting to play on mobiles or the Nintendo Switch - which recently became the country's all-time bestselling console. \"We want to have players regardless of whichever device they're playing on,\" Yoshida-san says. \"We want them to play our game and all connect and join in and then play together in the same world.\" Yoshida-san says Xbox CEO Phil Spencer \"devoted a lot of his time\" to getting FF14 on to Xbox. \"Thanks to his hard work, I'm super, super-glad we were able to see it to through to fruition,\" he says. \"But of course, there are platforms which remain.\" When he's asked which those might be, Yoshida-san doesn't hesitate. \"Of course,\" he says. \"It goes without saying that would be Nintendo's platform. \"I'm sure people are waiting for the answer to that question.\"\n\nSquare Enix FF14's international popularity was in evidence earlier this week when Square Enix erected a giant Aetherite crystal from the game in front of London Kings Cross station\n\nFor now, though, there's a more pressing issue on Yoshida-san's mind - giving Dawntrail \"the best possible launch\". After his weekend rest, he anticipates being busy. \"I'm sure that it's going to be sleepless nights, we're going to be just eyes focused on the service status,\" he says. Endwalker's rough beginnings will be on player's minds, but Yoshida-san says he's not one for dwelling too much on the past. \"It's what's already happened,\" he says. \"And that's not really going to take us forward. \"Looking towards the future is our job.\"\n\nDespite this, Yoshida-san says there is one thing important to remember. \"The players who stuck with us, [who] put their trust in the Final Fantasy 14 team. \"They really served as a source of motivation,\" he says. \"They really drove us to get to where we are and we would not be here without them. \"So keeping them in mind, we really just want to do our best for the Final Fantasy 14 community.\"",
    "Islamic State group still a danger, 10 years since its peak": "IS: A persistent danger, 10 years since its peak\n\n15 hours ago By Frank Gardner , BBC security correspondent Share\n\nEPA More than 140 people were killed in an IS attack on a concert hall in Moscow in March\n\nIt is exactly 10 years since the self-styled Islamic State (IS) group proclaimed its caliphate, announced to the world days later by its founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi from the Nuri Mosque in Mosul. Also known as Isis or Daesh in Arabic, the group took over huge swathes of Syria and Iraq, imposing its severe version of Shariah (Islamic law), meting out cruel punishments and murders, then posting the videos online. For the next five years, IS was able to attract thousands of would-be jihadists from all over the world to what it promised was a utopian Islamic caliphate. The reality was a life dominated by extreme violence: severed heads stuck on town square railings, constant harassment by patrolling \"morality police\" and frequent bombing raids by a US-led Coalition. That Coalition, numbering more than 70 nations, eventually drove out IS from its last refuge at Baghuz in eastern Syria in 2019. The physical caliphate was no more, but the ideology remained. So what has become of IS today?\n\nDown but not out\n\nA senior Whitehall official in London describes the status of the group as \"down but not out\". Its dwindling core leadership remains in Syria, but IS has expanded its franchise across several continents. The bulk of attacks carried out in its name are now in sub-Saharan Africa. In Europe and the Middle East, its most dangerous branch is considered to be IS-Khorasan Province, widely blamed for this year’s mass casualty attacks in Moscow and Kerman in Iran. IS-Khorasan Province, or ISKP, is based in Afghanistan and north-west Pakistan, from where it is waging an insurgency against Afghanistan’s ruling Taliban.\n\nReuters The Taliban have been fighting an IS insurgency in Afghanistan\n\nThat may sound odd, given that the Taliban have imposed their own, extreme version of Shariah, banning women from jobs or even a proper education, as well as reintroducing punishments such as stoning to death. Yet the Taliban and IS are bitter rivals - and after 20 years as insurgents, the Taliban are now finding themselves the poachers turned gamekeepers. When IS had a physical base - its caliphate in Syria and Iraq - it was able to attract recruits who found it easy to fly to Turkey, catch a bus to the border and then get smuggled across into Syria. These recruits mostly lacked both military experience or any real understanding of the civil war that was tearing Syria apart. Many had a background of petty crime and drug-taking back home. These included four men from West London, nicknamed The Beatles by their captives, who ended up guarding and torturing Western aid workers and journalists. Today one is dead and the others are in prison, including two now serving life sentences in a US supermax jail. But IS is still inciting attacks via its online media. Its two principal causes right now are calls for revenge for Israel’s nine-month long assault on Gaza and the imprisonment of IS women and children in grim, flyblown camps in northern Syria.\n\nShift to Africa\n\nLike al-Qaeda, which has also not gone away, IS thrives on disorder, despair and poor governance by whoever is in charge. In parts of Africa, there are large pockets of all three. In recent years, the countries of the Sahel belt – notably Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso – have all experienced military coups, leading to increased instability. French, American and EU troops that were helping local governments to keep the jihadist threat at bay, not always successfully, have largely been kicked out or replaced by Russian mercenaries. IS now has five branches in Africa, which it refers to as Wilayaat (provinces), spread across West Africa, the Lake Chad area, Democratic Republic of Congo and northern Mozambique.\n\nReuters IS has declared branches in countries in sub-Saharan Africa, including Chad\n\nHere too, IS is in direct competition - and often confrontation - with al-Qaeda. IS boasts that it is expanding both its operations and the areas under its control. Certainly it appears to be more agile than the governments it is fighting, often mounting surprise deadly raids and ambushes that kill scores of troops or villagers in remote areas. Africa has not turned out to be the geographical magnet for international jihadists that Syria was 10 years ago. There is no pipeline of volunteers flocking there in the way there was to the Turkish-Syrian border or before that, to the Tribal Territories of north-west Pakistan. But the IS franchise still has plenty of recruits, mostly young, local men, who see an almost total lack of opportunities elsewhere. The small, localised but extremely violent conflicts in Africa may be thousands of miles away from Europe’s shores, but as the jihadist threat increases, it will inevitably propel more migrants from Africa to seek a safer life in Europe.\n\nEurope still a target\n\nAt the height of its strength, in the mid-2010s, IS was able to mount spectacular, mass-casualty attacks in Europe, such as the attack on the Bataclan concert hall in Paris in 2015 that left 130 people dead. Killers were trained up and dispatched from Syria, crossing multiple borders with ease and having no trouble in accessing powerful automatic weapons such as Kalashnikovs from the Balkans. Since then, and after numerous attacks in Europe’s cities, intelligence-sharing between police forces and security agencies has improved considerably. UK officials now believe it would be much harder – although not impossible – for IS or al-Qaeda to mount the sort of highly planned and co-ordinated attack like the London bombings of 2005 or the Bataclan in 2015.\n\nReuters The IS attack in Paris in 2015 was the deadliest in French history\n\nInstead, they worry most about solo operators: self-motivated extremists and sociopaths who become radicalised by jihadist propaganda online. In the UK, the vast majority of counter-terrorism work undertaken by the Security Service, MI5, is still directed towards plots inspired by IS or al-Qaeda. Europe is still in their sights - and the March 2024 attack on Moscow’s Crocus City Hall that killed more than 140 people shows that IS can seize an opportunity to strike an enemy when it is distracted, in this case by the war in Ukraine.\n\nLeadership troubles",
    "Photography: How Nik Roche captures life on margins of society": "The photos capturing life on margins of society\n\n8 hours ago By Nicola Bryan , BBC News Share\n\nNik Roche Immersive photographer Nik Roche met Tony on the street and went on to document his unconventional life\n\nOn a wet day a man was shouting and swearing in the street, and passers-by crossed the road to avoid him. But Nik Roche instead decided to approach the man in Swansea to find out what was wrong. It was the start of a friendship between him and Tony that would see the men living together and Nik documenting his new friend's unconventional and sometimes chaotic life through photography. \"I'm a fully immersive documentary photographer, so I make friends, I form relationships and trust and then I make pictures - eventually,\" explained Nik. \"I don't go in to make pictures, I make them eventually if it feels right.\"\n\nNik Roche Nik says Tony kept a fire lit non-stop for a month when he had no gas and electricity in his house\n\nOn the day they met, Nik discovered Tony was distressed because he had gone into a bar, ordered a drink, discovered he did not have enough money to pay for it, had left to go to a cashpoint and could not find the bar again. \"I just strode back into the bar with him, we sat there and two-and-a-half years later we were the best of friends and I ended up living in his house,\" said Nik. \"Tony had a house in the Clydach area of the city, but chose to live in an Arctic bell tent in the woods behind it. \"He would do whatever was in front of him sadly... but I wouldn't have called him a major drug misuser.\"\n\nNik Roche Tony and his dog Diego\n\n\"He needed a few cans to function in the morning. \"Then two or three more and a switch would go off and you'd see drunk Tony - but I wouldn't put him in the same class as many, many, many, many others I've met.\" Nik said Tony never had money for his prepayment gas and electric meter so \"for something like 29 days in November he maintained a fire in his garden that never went out all around the clock\". He said his collection of candid shots of Tony - titled As Far as They're Concerned We Are a Normal Family - only came about once he had \"got across that it was not a performance that I was looking for, it was a friendship and a relationship\".\n\nNik Roche Tony chose to live in an Arctic bell tent in woods behind his house\n\nRoche, 53, a landscape designer, began taking photographs only six years ago. After taking a short photography course in Cardiff he went on to complete an MA in documentary photography from the University of South Wales. He said his work was \"about notions of home and family and love\". \"What interests me is people who find that outside of societal norms,\" he said. \"My work is not about poverty, it is not about drug misuse. \"It's quite easy to dismiss my work and go 'oh, it's poverty porn or it's voyeuristic' - it's none of those things but I can see how easy it can be to dismiss it as that.\"\n\nNik Roche Nik says his work is not about poverty or drugs misuse\n\nNik said he had always \"gravitated towards people who have struggled a bit\". He spent four years volunteering for a homeless charity where he witnessed the same people \"always finding themselves back in this system, back in this loop… no matter how much help and how much support is there\". \"The only thing I could see that connected everybody was a shared trauma, a childhood trauma,\" said Nik. He said his photography was a way of \"looking for some answers\". \"I'm not trying to save anybody or save anything, I'm just trying to have conversations about things,\" he said.\n\nNik Roche Tony's bed in the woods\n\nNik has used his immersive style of photography to capture several people whose lives are affected by addiction, poverty and insecure housing, most of whom he has \"grown to love dearly\". But he became particularly close to Tony. \"I felt more than comfortable working with Tony because I felt like we shared vulnerabilities, I didn't feel like I was tapping into his,\" he said. \"I get anxiety every day, I take antidepressants, I self-medicate in that sense. \"I'm no different, it's just I've maybe got a support network that doesn't allow me to fall that far.\"\n\nNik Roche Nik describes Tony, who died two years ago at 60, as a dear friend\n\nTony died from an overdose two years ago. He was 60. His death has hit Nik hard. \"Tony became my dear friend,\" he said. “I was really hurt, I really missed him, it was very difficult. I haven't made any pictures since hardly.\" Meeting Tony has no doubt changed Nik's life. \"I've been living in a caravan for the last two-and-a-half years because at the first opportunity, when I could, I wanted to experience what it was like to live his life while I was making the work with him,\" he said. \"So I've been living as best I can, or as close as I can, to the life that he lived.\"\n\nNik Roche Tony and his new puppy\n\nHis immersive way of taking photographs sounds all-consuming - does he never want to close the door on his work at the end of the day? He joked: \"I was only doing a short course and then an MA and now I sort of became them [the people he photographs] almost - minus the intravenous drugs obviously.\" He insisted his work was more uplifting than the images may suggest. \"I often work in what appear to be really dark situations but when you're there there's laughter,\" he said. \"We laughed and had more beautiful moments than you might expect from looking at the pictures.\"",

Taylor Swift dazzles on Eras Tour\n\n6 hours ago Share\n\nGetty The long-awaited Eras tour got under way in Dublin on Friday night\n\nTaylor Swift fans are experiencing the sold-out Eras tour in Dublin this weekend. The singer has brought her record-breaking tour to the Aviva Stadium in Ireland’s capital for three nights, beginning on Friday, with more than 150,000 Swifties in attendance. Before Friday, it had been six years since Swift's last show in Dublin. The 152-date Eras tour has become the most lucrative set of concerts in history. And its arrival in Dublin is not the only big event in the Irish capital over the weekend - Pride, Latitude Festival, the GAA football All-Ireland quarter-finals and Shania Twain are attracting their own crowds to the city.\n\nGetty Images Taylor addressed the ecstatic crowd saying \"Dublin we've arrived\"\n\nWhat happened on the first night of the Eras Tour in Dublin?\n\nAbout 50,000 fans filled the Aviva Stadium to see the US musician on Friday evening. Swift kicked off her time on the Emerald Isle with high praise for Ireland and its culture. \"Dublin, we've arrived!\" she said. \"You guys are making me feel so good, it's gone straight to my head. I feel very, very powerful.\"\n\nGetty Images Swift is playing three sold-out shows in Dublin this weekend\n\nThe concert was filled with elaborate production, multiple costume changes and a setlist that spanned more than three hours and included dozens of songs, taking her fans on a chronological journey through her albums. \"Nobody does it like you. You know that right?\" she said, going on to call Irish people \"unmatched storytellers\", with the \"best accents\".\n\nGetty Images A young girl in the crowd receives the '22 hat' and a hug from the US mega-star\n\nIn a now viral segment, Swift's dancer took on the Irish language, hollering \"póg mo thóin\" (which means kiss my butt), during a rendition of We Are Never Getting Back Together. Before the gig, Swift had received a bouquet of flowers from Irish rock band U2, alongside a welcome note. It read: \"Dear Taylor, Welcome back to our hometown…leave some of it standing?!!!!\"\n\nAllow Twitter content? Twitter’s cookie policy privacy policy ‘accept and continue’.

Special measures are being implemented to ensure that there are enough gardaí (officers) to police the city. The policing bill for five Garth Brooks concerts in Croke Park in 2022 came to €380,000 (£320,000), and it is expected policing Taylor Swift’s three nights will cost about the same.\n\nSwifties are travelling from Belfast to Dublin for the concerts\n\nIn Belfast, about 300 fans were preparing to make their way to Dublin on buses on Friday morning. Speaking to BBC News NI, Lucy Glover, 18, said she had been looking forward to the gig “for so long\". \"It's been a landmark and now it's here,\" Ms Glover said. Lauren Shannon said \"it’s like Christmas\". Monique Uprichard, 23, who was wearing a Lover album inspired dress, said: “I had to plan for the outfit, it's Taylor Swift.\"\n\nMonique Uprichard is wearing a Taylor Swift-inspired outfit to the event\n\n'Swiftonomics'\n\nThe economic impact of this global superstar is now known as Swiftonomics. Last year’s US leg of the Eras tour was the first in history to make more than $1bn (£792m). Now, it’s estimated the international tour will increase that figure to as much as $4bn (£3.1bn). The hugely-anticipated UK leg could generate close to a £1bn boost for the economy and the only Irish city on the tour is expecting to be a beneficiary of a boost too. The only similar global star who has had a run in Dublin has been Garth Brooks. An estimated 400,000 fans attended his five-night stint in Croke Park. Dublin Chamber of Commerce estimates that tourists travelling to those concerts provided a €35m boost to the economy. Could Swift do the same?\n\nGetty Images Tickets to see Swift at London's Wembley Stadium started at £110, not far off the Dublin price of €126\n\nDublin Chamber said the real benefit comes from those travelling from overseas. Aebhric McGibney, its director of public and international affairs, said tourism will be the biggest beneficiary of the Eras tour. “You can see people coming from all over the country to visit Dublin, and spend a bit of time here, which is fantastic. \"But the real economic impact comes from those who travelled from overseas and coming from Great Britain, Northern Ireland as far away as United States. And in general, the longer the person has to travel both the more time they'll spend here.” Mr McGibney added that the 2,000 to 3,000 people who have come from the US “could easily spend a few thousand” euro each during their visit. There are still hotel rooms available, some reaching more than €500 (£420) for one night, but there are still more pocket-friendly rooms available too. Businesses around the Aviva and Dublin are planning on a bumper weekend with bottomless brunches, Taylor quizzes, and mug-making among the quirkier offerings.\n\nThe Bridge, a popular bar near the Aviva Stadium, has developed a Taylor Swift themed menu. The manager, Colm Ryan, said they are used to big events but none as big as Taylor. “We always have rugby matches, Six Nations, things like that,” he said. “And obviously a lot of concerts as well. We've had Pink and Rammstein both playing last weekend. But Taylor, she’s something on another level, the amount of people that come to support her is huge. “She’s probably one of the biggest artists in the world right now. “We've designed special cocktails this weekend named after a couple of her songs. So we have a Lavender Haze cocktail, and an Enchanted cocktail, along with slushies, you know, frozen daiquiris, I thought to go with the kind of stuff that hopefully weather permitting will fly out.” Dublin Pottery Studio is running a Taylor-themed mug-making class for two nights, both of which sold out within an hour. Manager Ciara Fullam said the idea came when most of their customers were painting their own Taylor Swift pottery regardless of the concerts. “We noticed every weekend, people were painting Taylor Swift themes anyway,” she said.\n\nHow to get to the Aviva\n\nPA\n\nIf you were lucky enough to have secured tickets, there are some extra public transport services for the Taylor Swift concert. Additional Dart train services, which operate around the Dublin city area, are available on all three nights. Also 60 different bus routes from all over the country that have been approved by the National Transport Authority to provide dedicated services to the Aviva. Translink is also running special return train services from Northern Ireland. The concerts coincide with a number of other events in the Dublin area such as Pride and Longitude, so public transport will be busy. Aviva Stadium is relatively close to the centre of Dublin and for those able to do so, it may make more sense to do that part of the journey on foot.\n\nWhat time do the concerts start and end?\n\nThe event promoter MCD has said gates to the Eras Tour open at 17:00 local time, however, some fans with early entry packages may be let into the venue from 15:00. The shows start at 18:00 with opening act Paramore. Swift then begins her mammoth three-and-a-half hour set from about 19:00. MCD has also warned that briefcases, bags, luggage or purses larger than a clutch bag are prohibited. For those looking for merchandise, it is available at the 3Arena in Dublin's North Wall Quay until Sunday.\n\nWhat else is happening in Dublin that weekend?",

    "Supreme Court's homeless ruling: Cities can ban sleeping outside": "US Supreme Court allows cities to ban homeless camps\n\nThe decision is sure to have a ripple effect on cities across the US wrestling with how to manage the growing homelessness crisis\n\nThe US Supreme Court has ruled in a 6-3 vote along ideological lines that cities can ban homeless people from sleeping rough.\n\nIt is the court's most significant decision on homelessness since at least the 1980s, when many experts say the modern US homeless crisis began.\n\nThe ruling says that local governments can enforce laws against people sleeping in public places without being in violation of the US constitution's limits on cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nThe case started in the small city of Grants Pass, Oregon, where three homeless people sued after receiving citations for sleeping and camping outside.\n\nAt a Supreme Court hearing in April, the city argued that criminal penalties were necessary to enforce local laws banning homeless people from public spaces for \"reasons of cleanliness and safety\".\n\nThe homeless residents said those penalties violated the Eighth Amendment of the US Constitution because the city did not have any public shelters.\n\nWriting for the conservative majority in an opinion issued on Friday, Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote that the city's regulations on camping do not inflict “terror, pain or disgrace”.\n\nHe added that the law does not criminalise the “mere status” of being homeless, and that the ban focuses more on the actions taken by individuals rather than their status alone.\n\n“Under the city’s laws, it makes no difference whether the charged defendant is homeless, a backpacker on vacation passing through town, or a student who abandons his dorm room to camp out in protest on the lawn of a municipal building,” Justice Gorsuch wrote.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, writing on behalf of the three dissenting liberal justices, wrote: “Sleep is a biological necessity, not a crime. Homelessness is a reality for so many Americans.”\n\nSeveral cities issued statements welcoming the ruling. San Francisco said it would help cities \"manage our public spaces more effectively and efficiently,\" and the city of Grants Pass, the centre of the legal dispute, said that city leaders would meet with their lawyers to discuss next steps.\n\nHomelessness is on the rise in the US, fuelled in part by chronic shortages of affordable housing. Around 653,000 people did not have homes in 2023, the largest number since tracking began in 2007, according to US government figures.\n\nThere were also an estimated 256,000 people living without shelter on a given night across the country last year, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nReacting to the ruling, the National Alliance to End Homelessness said it \"sets a dangerous precedent that will cause undue harm to people experiencing homelessness and give free reign to local officials who prefer pointless and expensive arrests and imprisonment, rather than real solutions\".\n\nGrants Pass's population has doubled to 40,000 in the last 20 years, but its supply of affordable or public housing has not.\n\nSoaring housing costs led to a sizeable number of people losing their homes.\n\nTown officials responded by passing laws that fined people for sleeping or camping in public. Over time, those fines stacked up, reaching thousands of dollars for some.\n\nUnable to pay for multiple citations, three homeless people sued the city.\n\nTheir lawsuit reached the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which decided in 2022 that the restrictions in Grants Pass were so tight that they amounted to an effective ban on being homeless within city limits.\n\nThe court had determined four years earlier in a similar case in Idaho that the constitution “bars a city from prosecuting people criminally for sleeping outside on public property when those people have no home or other shelter to go to\".",

    "Jay Slater: New Tenerife search for missing teenager begins": "New search for Jay Slater begins\n\n3 hours ago By Tom McArthur , Mohamed Madi , BBC News Share\n\nHandout Jay Slater, pictured with his mother Debbie Duncan, was on his first holiday abroad without parents\n\nA new search is under way on Tenerife for missing British teenager Jay Slater following calls from Spanish police for volunteer help. On Friday the Guardia Civil asked voluntary organisations and members of the public with expertise in difficult conditions to come to northern Tenerife. Dozens of experienced local firefighters, police and mountain rangers are leading the search, which is focusing on the ravines and trails around the village of Masca in the Rural de Teno national park and started from a local restaurant around 10:00 BST on Saturday morning. Authorities had hoped the operation would be a “massive search” but less than 12 members of the public had arrived at the meeting point before it began. Mr Slater, 19, has not been heard from since the morning of 17 June, after he told a friend he was lost in the mountains and had 1% battery on his phone.\n\nPA Media Spanish Guardia Civil officers have been scouring difficult terrain for the teenager since 17 June\n\nPolice confirmed Saturday's search would be in an area previously explored but it would be more extensive and detailed, to make use of the extra people now involved. Among the volunteers was Paul Arnott, a British climber and TikTok personality who has been searching on the island for the past week. Another volunteer, Tenerife local Livia Karczeysky, said she was taking part because she too had a 19-year-old son and would want people to do the same. \"I think if that something happened to him I would appreciate a lot if other people would help to find him,\" she said. She added that the terrain is \"not easy, you have to be prepared\".\n\nLocal Livia Karczeysky warned you need \"good shoes\" to deal with the stony ground of the area.\n\nSince the teenager disappeared 12 days ago the Spanish authorities have deployed helicopter crews, specially trained search dogs and drones, but no trace of him has been found. Mr Slater had been attending the NRG music festival on 16 June, and his friends said they were out in the tourist hotspot of Playa de las Americas when he was seen getting into a car with two British men he met earlier in the night. The next morning he was tagged in a photo posted on Snapchat at 07:30 BST at an Airbnb in Masca, which was reportedly being rented by the two men. Investigators have spoken to the pair and they are \"not in any way relevant to the case\", the media were told in a press conference on Saturday. Best friend Brad Hargreaves told ITV he received a video call from Mr Slater a short time later. He said during that call Mr Slater appeared to slide off a designated path, with the video showing his feet on rough ground.\n\nHowever, Mr Slater then said he had to go as he was receiving another call. Mr Hargreaves said: \"I don’t know how or what has gone on there but he’s gone off and rang me halfway to their house saying I’m staying here and I’ll be back the next day. \"He's rang me walking down the mountain and he just says he's walking home. \"At the time I didn't think anything of it I just thought he was going to get a bus home or a taxi home because that's what he says he is going to do. \"Next thing you know his phone dies and it's 10 days on now and nothing since.\" Shortly after 08:30 BST he called another friend on the holiday with him, Lucy Law, and said he did not know where he was, needed water and had 1% battery before the call cut off.\n\nSpecially trained dogs have been used in the search\n\nMr Slater's mother Debbie Duncan previously told the BBC her son was on his first holiday abroad without parents. \"He's just an all-round nice, bubbly guy with hundreds of friends who love being in his company,\" she said. \"He's gorgeous, he's beautiful. He's my baby.\" Mr Hargreaves' mother Rachel Hargreaves said she and her son were staying in Tenerife with Ms Duncan for \"as long as it takes\". She said: \"You can’t put into words how you feel. I’m just here trying to support and be strong for her. \"The things she can’t do I am trying to do for her, mother-to-mother.\"",

    "Brain injury survivor volunteers at Glastonbury Festival": "Brain injury survivor volunteers at Glastonbury\n\n3 hours ago By Bea Swallow , BBC News, Somerset Share\n\nWaterAid/ Lucy Le Brocq Mr Blundell said volunteering with WaterAid was an opportunity to raise awareness of a cause that he \"cares deeply about\"\n\nA 25-year-old who was told he had a one-in-three chance of dying has headed off to Glastonbury Festival to volunteer for charity. Less than four years ago, Connor Blundell suffered a four-metre fall while studying abroad, leaving him with temporary paralysis on his right side and in a coma for a month. After spending the last 44-months learning to walk and talk again, he will be joining WaterAid at the Somerset festival to help people stay hydrated. \"I’m pretty gassed to be here as I am today, and for the opportunities that I’ve had, that’s why I want to put myself out there and support others,\" said Mr Blundell.\n\nHandout Mr Blundell was told he had a one-in-three chance of dying, and a one-in-three chance of being in a coma forever\n\nThe charity has partnered with Glastonbury since 1994, supporting services on site while highlighting its work to help bring clean water and sanitation to people living in poverty around the world. While more than 200,000 festival goers will be partying at Pyramid Stage, Mr Blundell will be filling up water bottles at the WaterAid bars and kiosks across the site. “Today, nearly one in ten people around the world don’t have clean water close to home, and nearly one in five don’t have a decent toilet of their own,\" Mr Blundell said. \"Glastonbury is a great opportunity to help raise awareness of a cause that I care deeply about.”\n\n'We take it for granted'\n\nIn April this year, Mr Blundell managed to complete the London Marathon for WaterAid after regaining movement in his right side. He noted that during the run, there was \"more than enough water\" supplied. \"We take it for granted so much, and I can’t imagine what it would be like to live without such a basic thing,\" he said. \"Whether it’s going to a water kiosk to get a drink, or waiting to use a toilet, Glastonbury is the ideal setting for people to start to understand what it might be like for the millions of people who don’t have access to clean water or decent toilets.\" This year - marking 30 years of partnership - there will be more than 700 WaterAid volunteers at the UK’s biggest outdoor music festival. Alongside working the water refill bars, they will be running the women’s urinals, cleaning the toilets and handwashing stations, and supporting the post-festival clean-up.\n\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

    "Gilded wings sculpture to be on display at Glastonbury": "Glastonbury wings sculpture inspired by mental health\n\n4 hours ago By Bea Swallow , BBC News, Somerset Share\n\nEdgar Phillips This year's sculpture is a tall pair of wings reaching up to the sky, gilded in gold\n\nAn artist has been commissioned to create a large stained glass wings sculpture, which will be erected in the stone circle at Glastonbury Festival. Edgar Phillips, who lives and works in Wells, Somerset, has been creating stained glass windows since the age of 11, having followed in his father's footsteps. He has sculptures dotted around the world, with four unique designs displayed at Glastonbury in previous years, the first being in 2017. He said: \"A lot of my art is inspired through my own mental health journey.\"\n\nIf you've been to Glastonbury Festival, you have probably come across a set of magnificent colourful wings, or even had your picture taken in front them. They first appeared in 2017, after Mr Phillips was scouted by co-organiser of the festival, Emily Eavis.\n\nEdgar Phillips Emily Eavis fell in love with the design in 2017 and commissioned Mr Phillips to make one\n\nMr Phillips says since then, they have become \"one of the most sought after pictures opportunities\" at the festival, with crowds queueing up to capture his work. \"This year, they've asked me to put one by the stone circle, which is massive in terms of the spiritual heart of Glastonbury,\" he said. \"To be asked to put one there is really touching.\" The stone circle at Glastonbury is a megalithic monument located at Worthy Farm. They are viewed culturally as gateways between two realms, where one could cross over into a world of beauty and abundance, gaining wisdom, healing, or inspiration.\n\nEdgar Phillips Mr Phillips first Glastonbury sculpture in 2017 was titled 'Wings of the West'\n\nMr Phillips said his vision for the wings was borne from a \"difficult period\" of mental health issues, and now symbolises strength, beauty and resilience. \"I like making windows with a bit of contemporary difference,\" Mr Phillips said. \"I went through quite a low patch in my life, and one of the inspirations that came from that was this vision of these soaring wings. \"It was like a piece of a stained glass window brought down to earth.\" Measuring 5m (16.4ft) by 2.5m (8.23ft), Mr Phillips said: \"They're huge, I always wanted it to look like you could actually fly in them.\"\n\nEdgar Phillips The wings sculptures have become a festival staple, with people queuing up to get the shot\n\nAfter struggling with his own mental health, Mr Phillips said he wants his art to become an outlet for others. \"I'm all about free access to art,\" he said. \"So after the festivals I install them at Wells Cathedral and the Bishop's Palace, in places where people who wouldn't necessarily get to see them, can still interact with them. \"I've gone from 'I've got to get my art out there', to 'now it's my time to give back to the community which looked after me'.\"",
    "Glastonbury: Marina Abramovic leads seven-minute silence for peace": "Glastonbury holds seven-minute silence for peace\n\n21 hours ago By Mark Savage , Music Correspondent Share\n\nGetty Images The seven-minute silence took place just before PJ Harvey's set on the Pyramid Stage\n\nIf there’s one thing Glastonbury Festival doesn’t do well, it's silence. But that changed on Friday evening, as performance artist Marina Abramović led a seven-minute silence from the festival’s main stage. The interlude between musical acts was conceived as a \"public intervention\" to reflect on conflict and peace. \"There are wars, there is famine, there is protest, there is killing,\" Abramović said. \"Here, we will try to do something different. \"We can all together give unconditional love to each other. [It is] the only way to change the world.\"\n\nGetty Images Abramovic said the prospect of the silence failing had \"terrified\" her\n\nFrom the stage, the acclaimed Serbian artist encouraged thousands of festival-goers to close their eyes, put a hand on a neighbour’s shoulder, and be still for 420 seconds. Amazingly, it worked. After a gong sounded, the field fell entirely silent. On stage, 77-year-old Abramović stretched out her arms to reveal a dress designed in the shape of the CND symbol by Riccardo Tisci, the Italian former creative head of Burberry. CND stands for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, which has been supported by the festival throughout its history. Admittedly, the sound of music from the surrounding stages still bled into the silence. Half the crowd hadn't turned off their phone notifications, either. And beside me, there was the tell-tale \"psssht\" of a beer can being opened. But the overall effect was strangely moving. Setting aside the hedonism of festival life for seven minutes, thousands of people paused to contemplate their place in the world.\n\nSome audience members stood in circles and closed their eyes\n\nSpeaking to The Guardian beforehand, Abramović explained the thinking behind her performance. \"We are really facing a dark moment in human history. So what can be done?\" she asked. \"I always think protest brings more protest; hate brings more hate. I think it’s important to turn to your own self. It’s easy to criticise everything else but what can I do in my own self, how can I change?\" She admitted that asking Glastonbury's notoriously rowdy fans to be quiet was \"a big risk\" and that the prospect of failure \"terrified\" her. \"But I want to take the risk,\" she added. \"Can you imagine if we succeed? It will be an incredible moment.\"\n\nThe artist's appearance came after a crowd-pleasing set from Paul Heaton, who played almost 40 years of hits, including Song For Whoever, Perfect 10 and Old Red Eyes Is Back. Heaton also brought out the first surprise guest of the day - in the shape of his former Housemartins bandmate Norman Cook, aka Fatboy Slim. Cook happily swapped DJ decks for a bass guitar to play their 1986 indie anthem Happy Hour, and the audience surged to the front of the stage. Another audience surge was happening simultaneously, two fields away at West Holts, where fans were gathering to watch the reunited Sugababes play a greatest hits set. In a repeat of their packed 2022 performance at the Avalon field, the numbers swelled so much that stewards had to shut the area down, enacting a one-in, one-out policy. Meanwhile, dance star Fred Again made an unannounced appearance at the tiny Stonebridge Bar, high in the hills overlooking the festival.\n\nNorman Cook reunited with his former Housemartins bandmate Paul Heaton",

The officer then returned fire and the assailant died around half an hour later.\n\nMr Dacic said the case had been taken over by special prosecutors and that several others had been arrested as a precautionary measure.\n\nWhile the interior minister suggested the attack may have been part of a larger threat, Serbian Prime Minister Milos Vucevic called it \"a crime of an individual\".\n\nAccording to comments reproduced by the Beta news agency, he described the incident as \"an act of insanity, which cannot be attributed to any religion and any nation\".\n\nThe Israeli foreign ministry said the embassy had been closed at the time of the incident and that no employees had been injured.\n\nThe incident in Belgrade is not the first time someone has seemingly attempted to stage an attack on an Israeli embassy since the Gaza war that Israel began after Hamas's 7 October attack against southern Israel.",
    "Aer Lingus strike: Pilots stage eight-hour stoppage": "Aer Lingus pilots stage eight-hour work stoppage\n\n38 minutes ago Share\n\nPA Media Pilots held banners as they marched at Dublin Airport on Saturday morning\n\nHundreds of striking Aer Lingus pilots have marched at Dublin Airport as part of an ongoing dispute with the airline over pay. The eight-hour strike began at 05:00 local time and ended at 13:00. The pilots, in full uniform, passed the airline’s head office before setting up a picket line at the entrance to the airport for a time. Aer Lingus cancelled 120 flights on Saturday with about 17,000 passengers affected and apologised for the disruption. The Irish Airline Pilots' Association (Ialpa) previously called for a 24% pay rise for members, and pilots began a work-to-rule on Wednesday. Ialpa president Captain Mark Tighe said the striking pilots have \"clearly demonstrated their solidarity, their strength [and] their togetherness\". \"We've seen the company cancel up to 20% of flights, we find that astounding actually,\" Cpt Tighe told BBC News NI. He said a \"very small number\" of pilots work on their scheduled days off, as they are often tired and want to spend time with their families. \"The work-to-rule would cause some disruption but we wouldn't expect it to be anything like this, so questions need to asked,\" he said.\n\nPA Media The pilots passed the airline’s head office before setting up a picket\n\nAer Lingus has now cancelled almost 400 flights up until 7 July as a result of the indefinite work-to-rule and strike action by pilots. The Republic of Ireland’s Labour Court has invited both parties to a meeting on Monday to review the current situation. Cpt Tighe said the union was \"considering an escalation\" before the invitation, but he was hopeful the court would be able to assist in the dispute. He added the union's mandate is clear and that pilots will not accept work practice changes in exchange for more pay. \"The pilots have clearly stated to us that they are not prepared to sell working conditions to finance a pay increase,\" he said. \"They're not going to pay for a pay increase, particularly when their claim was a reasonable one of inflation to protect their pay.\"\n\nAllow Twitter content?

Also on strike, First Officer Chloe Halpin called for reform of the company's pay structure. \"I'm new to Aer Lingus and I'm actually on 10% less pay than our other colleagues,\" she said. \"We should only have one pay scale in Aer Lingus, that's why I'm here.\"\n\nWhat has Aer Lingus said?\n\nAer Lingus’s communications director Olivia Buckley apologised to customers for the disruption. “It’s been damaging from a reputational point of view for the airline and also from a financial point of view,” she told RTÉ. Ongoing industrial action is “making it increasingly difficult” to find a resolution to the dispute, she added. The Aer Lingus website has a list of flights disrupted because of the strike. The website states that if your flight is affected, you will be contacted by them directly by email or SMS message. Or, if you booked through a travel agent, they will contact you to advise you of your options.\n\nPA Media The strike action ended at 13:00 on Saturday\n\nWill my Belfast flight be affected?\n\nThe Aer Lingus website said Aer Lingus Regional services to and from Belfast and Great Britain, operated by Emerald Airlines, will not be affected by any industrial relations action and will operate as scheduled. Aer Lingus Regional flight numbers are EI 3000 – EI 3999.\n\nPA Media Members of Ialpa have marched at Dublin airport\n\nWhat do I do if my flight is cancelled?\n\nThe airline has said passengers with flights booked between now and 7 July have a number of options available. For customers who have booked directly with Aer Lingus, there is the option to change flights online. The company said it will waive the fare difference and any service fees if rebooking for a later date. There is also the option to request a full refund or a refund voucher, which can be redeemed within five years. Aer Lingus say passengers who booked through third party must contact those companies directly.\n\nWhy do the pilots want a pay rise?\n\nPA Media On Thursday afternoon, IALPA President Capt Mark Tighe confirmed talks had “broken down\"\n\nCapt Mark Tighe previously said that the 24% increase is a \"cumulative figure of inflation from 2019, our last pay rise\". Speaking to BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme on Friday, Capt Tighe said in an effort to resolve the dispute, the union had said it would accept less than an inflationary rise. \"We don’t believe anybody should be getting less than inflation, but yesterday in an effort to resolve this, we said we would accept less than inflation.\" However, he added: \"We believe inflation is a very reasonable claim in this current time.\"\n\nHow much are Aer Lingus pilots paid?\n\nCo-pilots can start out at about €36,000 (£30,400), with packages increasing based on actual flying hours. Irish broadcaster RTÉ has reported a captain at the top of the scale can be paid about €287,000 (£242,000). Capt Mark Tighe explained on Thursday that this can take up to 26 years. There are differences for pilots depending on whether flights are short or long-haul.\n\nPA Media Aer Lingus said 120 flights were cancelled at Irish airports, including Dublin, on Saturday\n\nHow did we get here?",

    "General election 2024 poll tracker: How do the parties compare?": "General election 2024 poll tracker: How do the parties compare?\n\n4 hours ago Share\n\nUse our interactive poll tracker to check the latest trends measuring how people say they intend to vote.\n\nWhat do the latest polls tell us?\n\nThere's quite a lot of variation between the polls but they all agree that Labour has a big lead over the Conservatives, writes senior political analyst Peter Barnes. The polls have had quite a broad range of figures over the last few days, particularly for the Conservatives and Reform UK. This is partly explained by how different polling companies deal with people who say they're undecided about how to vote - but there's certainly more variation than at the same stage of the last election campaign in 2019. However, if you look at the poll averages, there's been very little change for any of the parties over the last ten days or so. Labour still has a lead of around 20 points over the Conservatives with Reform UK in third and the Liberal Democrats in fourth.\n\nHow big are the gaps between parties?\n\nAll polls are based on a sample of people interviewed, typically more than 1,000, which is then weighted to be representative of the country. There is always a margin of error, meaning the real percentage could be higher or lower than any one poll suggests. We estimate that the true support for each party lies within the ranges shown here.\n\nWhat is a poll tracker?\n\nEach dot in the chart shows one poll result for a party. We summarise all that information with an average line that makes it easier to understand the trend.\n\nSign up for our Election Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments in the general election campaign. It'll be delivered straight to your inbox every weekday.\n\nWhich polls do we use?\n\nTo get an appropriate range of polls for our averages, we use those conducted by members of the British Polling Council. Its members agree to the same rules on transparency, but the council has said membership should not be seen as a guarantee of quality. The polls we include have come from BMG, Deltapoll, Electoral Calculus, Find Out Now, Focaldata, Ipsos, JL Partners, More in Common, Opinium, Norstat (formerly Panelbase), People Polling, Redfield and Wilton Strategies, Savanta, Survation, Techne, Verian (formerly Kantar Public), WeThink (formerly Omnisis), Whitestone Insight and YouGov. We only include the headline percentages on voting intention, which pollsters calculate by excluding or otherwise adjusting for those people who answered \"don't know\" or \"won't vote\". Most of the polls included cover Great Britain, although some do poll the whole of the UK. People surveyed do not get the option to choose parties which only stand in Northern Ireland. We include data that is in the public domain. Some polling companies will not publish all data for all parties at the same time.\n\nWho pays for polls?\n\nWhere polling companies have stated in their data tables who their client is, we have included this in our table. It is common for polling companies to do their work for news organisations, television programmes and campaign groups.\n\nWhat is the margin of error?\n\nThe true position for the Conservatives and Labour might be within five percentage points of our average. Nine out of 10 polls just before election day have been within that range of the eventual national vote shares in the 2010 to 2019 general elections. The gap has been smaller for other parties which campaign throughout Great Britain, such as the Liberal Democrats, Green party and Reform UK (formerly the Brexit Party) and smaller still for the SNP and Plaid Cymru.\n\nHow do we average the polls?\n\nOur estimate of a party's support is a rolling average of polls. A party's share on any given day is the average of their results from polls taken over the previous fortnight. We only take the most recent poll from each company for that day's averages.\n\nWhy do polling companies have different results?\n\nAll opinion polls will differ a bit because they are interviewing different people. There are also other things that can lead to differences between polling companies. For example:\n\nDifferent companies find the people who take part in their polls in different ways\n\nThe precise wording of the question varies between pollsters, and some pollsters ask more than one question to reach their voting intention figures\n\nPollsters apply \"weights\" to their data to try to make their results reflect the make-up of the voting population. So if a particular poll has a smaller proportion of female respondents than there are in the wider population, their responses will be given extra weight in the final results. But different companies take different factors into account\n\nThe companies have different ways of treating people who initially say they do not know how they will vote, or are not certain if they will vote.\n\nWhat do pollsters ask?\n\nFor voting intention, polling companies typically ask interviewees a question along the lines of: \"If a general election were held tomorrow, which party would you vote for?\" Some polling companies have not given their interviewees the choice of some parties, including them within the \"other\" category. For example, Reform UK, formerly the Brexit Party until 2021, has only been included as an option in every poll featured in our tracker since autumn 2022, while support for Plaid Cymru is included among \"other\" parties in polls released by Techne.

    "When is the UK general election and who can vote?": "When is the UK general election and who can vote?\n\n1 day ago By Jennifer Clarke , BBC News Share\n\nBBC\n\nMillions of UK voters will go to the polls on 4 July. It is too late to register to vote in the general election, or to apply for a postal or proxy vote. However, voters in England, Scotland and Wales can apply for an emergency proxy vote if they discover they can no longer vote in person.\n\nWhat is a general election and how many MPs are there?\n\nThe general election is to elect Members of Parliament - or MPs - to the House of Commons. The UK is divided into 650 areas, called constituencies, each of which elects one MP to represent local residents. Most candidates represent a political party, but some are independent.\n\nWho can vote and how do I register?\n\nAnyone on the electoral register who is 18 or over on polling day can vote if they are a British citizen, a qualifying Commonwealth citizen or a Republic of Ireland citizen with a UK address. All UK citizens who live abroad can register to vote in the constituency where they were previously resident or on the electoral roll. Students can be registered at both their home and term-time addresses, but must only vote in one place. Those who cannot vote in general elections include prisoners serving a sentence in jail, and peers from the House of Lords. The deadline to register to vote in the general election has passed.\n\nHow does voting work?\n\nIn a general election, each person has one vote. On election day, registered voters in each constituency vote for their preferred candidate in their local polling station, which is open between 07:00 and 22:00. Some people vote by post in advance. Under a system called \"first past the post\", the candidate with the most votes becomes the MP for that area.\n\nWhat constituency am I in?\n\nThis election will use new constituency boundaries, redrawn to reflect population changes and to even out voter numbers. Enter your postcode in our tool to find out which constituency you are in, who you can vote for and where you can vote.\n\nIf you want to browse through the constituencies you can use our A-Z page.\n\nBBC experts analyse the party manifestos\n\nHow do postal votes work?\n\nIf you cannot attend your polling station in person on election day - and you had already registered - you could have applied for a postal vote, but the deadline has now passed. For your postal vote to count, you must return your voting pack to the elections team at your local council by 22:00 BST on polling day. Alternatively, you can take it to your polling station on election day before it closes at 22:00.\n\nHow do proxy votes work and what is the deadline?\n\nYou can also nominate someone else to vote on your behalf. You and your proxy must both be registered to vote. The deadline to apply for a proxy vote for the general election has now passed. You can request an emergency proxy vote after this deadline if last-minute work commitments or a medical emergency mean you can no longer vote in person. People whose postal votes have not arrived are not eligible for an emergency proxy vote, the Electoral Commission has told the BBC. You can apply for this up to 17:00 on polling day, Thursday 4 July in England, Scotland and Wales, or if you are overseas.\n\nWhat photo ID do I need to vote at the general election?\n\nSince May 2023 voters in England, Scotland and Wales have had to show a valid form of photo ID at polling stations to vote in person at a general election. You do not need your polling card. There are 22 acceptable forms of ID, including:\n\npassports\n\ndriving licences\n\nOlder or Disabled Person's bus passes\n\nOyster 60+ cards\n\nYou can use out-of-date photo ID as long as you look the same. Alternatively, anyone registered to vote without the correct ID - or who no longer looks like their photo - can apply for a free document called a voter authority certificate. The deadline to apply for a voter authority certificate to use in the general election has passed. However, if you realise you do not have valid ID, voters in England, Scotland and Wales can apply for an emergency proxy vote instead up until 17:00 on polling day. You and your proxy must both be registered to vote. Voters in Northern Ireland have had to show photo ID since 2003. There are nine acceptable forms of ID including:\n\npassports\n\ndriving licences\n\nsenior travel passes\n\nwar disablement passes\n\nVoters in Northern Ireland without correct ID can apply for an electoral identity card.The deadline to get one to use in this election has passed.\n\nWhat happens to Parliament and MPs before the election?\n\nParliament was dissolved - the official term for closing it ahead of an election - on Thursday 30 May. Dissolving Parliament means MPs lose their status, and those who want to return have to campaign for re-election. Government also enters a pre-election period - previously known as \"purdah\" - which restricts ministerial and departmental activity during the campaign.\n\nWhat happens after the election results are announced?\n\nAfter the votes have been counted, the King asks the leader of the party with the most MPs to become prime minister and to form a government. The leader of the party with the second highest number of MPs becomes the leader of the opposition. If no party ends up with a majority of MPs - meaning it cannot pass legislation with just its own MPs - the result is a hung Parliament. At this point, the largest party might decide to form a coalition government with another party or operate as a minority government, relying on votes from other parties to pass any laws. The new Parliament will meet on 9 July, when it will elect a Speaker and swear in members. This will be followed by the State Opening of Parliament and the King's Speech, when the government outlines its priorities for the months ahead, on 17 July.\n\nHow often are general elections held?\n\nThe latest a Parliament can be dissolved for a general election is on the fifth anniversary of the day it first met. For the Parliament which has just been dissolved, that date was 17 December 2024. However, 25 working days are then allowed to prepare for the election. So the next election had to be held by 28 January 2025. The prime minister can call the election at a time of their choosing, within the five-year period. Mr Sunak became prime minister on 25 October 2022 when he succeeded Liz Truss, who took over from Boris Johnson.\n\nWhat questions do you have about the general election? terms & conditions and privacy policy.

    "What is the Chevron deference and why has it been overruled?": "The Chevron deference, and why it mattered\n\n20 hours ago By Anthony Zurcher, Nada Tawfik, Lisa Lambert & Kayla Epstein , BBC News Share\n\nGetty Images The Chevron deference was overturned in a case involving herring fishermen\n\nThe Supreme Court in a 6-3 vote killed a legal precedent that conservatives have attacked for decades, known as the \"Chevron deference\". \"Today, the court places a tombstone on Chevron no one can miss,\" Justice Neil Gorsuch, one of the most conservative members wrote. The deference, set in 1984 in a case involving the oil giant, gave federal agencies wide powers to interpret laws and decide the best ways to apply them. In ending the deference, the conservative-majority court has slashed and severely weakened the powers of agencies including the Environmental Protection Agency. The aftershocks of such a seismic decision will be felt throughout the federal government. Let's take a look at how we got here.\n\nWhat was the Supreme Court case about?\n\nWhile “Chevron deference” may sound like a chess strategy, it actually refers to a landmark Supreme Court ruling, Chevron v Natural Resources Defense Council. The court decided in 1984 that judges should defer to federal agencies in interpreting ambiguous parts of statutes. The idea was that if Congress passes a law where something is unclear - or there is a “gap” - it is up to an agency to fill in the gap. In practice, that gave arms of the federal government such as the Environmental Protection Agency the freedom to create and implement rules without fear of protracted legal battles. Then, in 2020, herring fishermen entered the chat. That year the Trump administration began requiring that they cover the costs of taking federal monitors on fishing trips. The fishing vessels did not have a choice - it was illegal to fish without federal monitors on board to check on the Atlantic fishery, an area that extends from Maine to North Carolina. They previously didn't pay for the monitors. Commercial fishing companies - supported by conservative and corporate groups including the billionaire Charles Koch - sued in two separate cases. In one, a federal judge ruled the National Marine Fisheries Service could legally impose the costs under the Chevron deference.\n\nWho wins in throwing it out?\n\nThis is a big win for conservatives For four decades, they have been working to overturn the precedent. By giving executive agencies more freedom to implement laws, in the conservative view, it vastly expanded the power of the federal bureaucracy. In areas like workplace safety, financial markets and the environment, courts – and, by extension, businesses contemplating legal challenges to regulations - had to yield to agencies' interpretations of laws. The Supreme Court has been paring back agency power in recent years, saying there are “major questions” of policy that Congress must explicitly detail in order for agencies to take action on them. “Chevron deference” as a legal principle, however, had endured, setting guidelines for lower courts to follow. On Friday, the Supreme Court delivered the final blow.\n\nGetty Images The ruling weakens federal agencies like the EPA\n\nWho loses?\n\nThis is a defeat for the Biden administration, which argued that throwing out the Chevron deference would be destabilising. Liberal Justice Elena Kagan said that the ruling elevates the Supreme Court’s power over other branches of US government. The president, Congress and court are supposed to have equal power under the US Constitution, so by her reading the ruling is a loss for the White House, the House of Representatives and the Senate. Advocacy groups and progressives also saw it as a setback for clean water, public health, fair lending, worker safety, and other areas where people rely on federal help. The Asbestos Disease Awareness Organisation, for example, called the ruling \"a monumental setback that will harm all Americans and profoundly impact our nation's environmental safeguards and public health protections\". \"The court has set us on a path towards policy paralysis,\" it said.\n\nWhere do we go from here?",
    "Gareth Jenkins: Five key moments from Post Office inquiry": "What we learned from IT expert at Post Office inquiry\n\n17 hours ago Share\n\nBBC\n\nThe computer expert who helped build the faulty Horizon software has finally spoken under oath about his involvement in the Post Office scandal. Gareth Jenkins is a key figure, having appeared as an expert witness to defend Horizon in court cases, and is now at the centre of an alleged cover-up. His appearance at the inquiry was long-awaited after being postponed twice. He gave evidence over four days - the longest run of questions any witness has faced - and gave his version of events. Here are five key moments from his evidence.\n\n1. He thought Horizon bugs were fixed quickly\n\nGareth Jenkins referred to Horizon's overall reliability throughout his testimony, even challenging findings from the landmark Bates v Post Office case that identified issues with the IT system. He acknowledged \"individual problems\" affecting specific branches but asserted that, as a whole, the system was \"working well\". When questioned about bugs, Mr Jenkins admitted lacking personal knowledge of all known issues, stating he typically became involved when drafted in for problem resolution. When pressed on how he could provide court evidence without full oversight of existing problems, Mr Jenkins said: \"Bugs impacting accounts were rare. Monitoring was in place, and fixes were prompt. Therefore, live system problems were rare, making me confident in its operation.\" He claimed nobody from the Post Office alerted him to unknown issues, and he didn't actively seek information about bugs he wasn't involved in fixing. Mr Jenkins admitted not realising the need for comprehensive knowledge when giving evidence and \"with hindsight would have done things differently\".\n\n2. He was sent expert witness rules\n\nMr Jenkins was an “expert witness” in several prosecutions brought by the Post Office. His duty was to the courts, not the Post Office or his employer Fujitsu. His role meant disclosing any relevant information about the Horizon software – even evidence that could help sub-postmasters' cases. Lawyers should have ensured that Mr Jenkins understood this. When asked about this by Mr Beer, Mr Jenkins stated that he didn’t know about his responsibilities until the end of 2020. But Mr Beer showed him a letter from November 2005, written by lawyers working for the Post Office. The letter mentioned that he was an expert witness and, according to Mr Beer, listed his duties in an “easy-to-understand way”. After initially denying he had received it, Mr Jenkins later accepted that it was sent to him. He said he had “no recollection of having been briefed” on his duties and had “clearly forgotten” about having seen the letter.\n\n3. He knew remote access was possible\n\nThe former \"distinguished engineer\" faced intense questioning regarding remote access – the ability of Fujitsu staff to modify sub-postmaster branch accounts without their knowledge. In his 2010 witness statement for Seema Misra's trial, he stated: \"No external systems can manipulate branch accounts without user awareness and authorisation.\" During the inquiry, Mr Jenkins accepted knowing that remote access was possible but believed it happened infrequently and left a visible trail. He based this view on \"informal chats\" with other Fujitsu IT staff. The former engineer told the inquiry that he only discovered the extent of unrestricted access Fujitsu technical staff had to sub-postmaster accounts during the 2018 High Court battle.\n\n4. He was a 'willing actor' for the Post Office\n\nIn 2005, Mr Jenkins was asked to provide a draft witness statement in the case of sub-postmaster Noel Thomas. The Post Office wanted his thoughts on how the losses could have occurred. One possibility, he said, was some sort of system failure. But the Post Office demanded changes, saying the line was potentially “very damaging\". It got deleted. The inquiry heard he was a “willing actor” in this process. He said he was happy with the changes he ended up with as it still accurately reflected what had happened but used “less emotive words\". The Post Office was applying the pressure, but he never checked with his own Fujitsu lawyers about signing off evidence that had been toned down. Earlier he was asked to explain attempts to “tweak” his statements, but Mr Jenkins believed this was more of a “tidying up” to make them easier to read. He said he pushed back when the changes went too far.\n\n5. He was 'better with systems than people'\n\nFour days of forensic questioning meant plenty of room for big revelations. It also meant Gareth Jenkins had nowhere to hide. It was very revealing about the character of the man who has been mentioned so many times at this inquiry. An IT specialist who spent his entire career at one company, by his own admission, he dealt “better with systems than people”. He would have been happiest engineering and designing, but found himself entangled in something very different. Something, he argues, he didn't fully understand. \"Can't you use the report I have already sent you?\" Mr Jenkins wrote to a Post Office lawyer in 2012. It is clear he was viewing the growing number of legal queries as a confusing frustration, taking him away from the tech front line. It is an annoyance that hasn't gone away. At one point, Mr Jenkins told the inquiry chair he wanted this \"over with\". Given the ongoing investigations, that seems unlikely.",

    "Streamer Dr Disrespect axed by his gaming company": "Streamer Dr Disrespect axed by his gaming company\n\n3 days ago Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe gaming streamer Herschel \"Guy\" Beahm, known online as Dr Disrespect, has had his role at his gaming company \"immediately terminated\" after it said it \"became aware of an allegation\" against him. The decision by Midnight Society - which Beahm co-founded - comes four years after he was abruptly kicked off streaming platform Twitch, where he had a huge following. The reason for his removal then was never made clear - with the Amazon-owned platform only saying it acted whenever users broke the rules. In a social media post Beahm has denied any wrongdoing, but admitted sending messages to \"an individual minor\" in 2017.\n\n\"Were there real intentions behind these messages, the answer is absolutely not,\" he wrote in a post on X, calling them \"casual, mutual conversations that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate\". \"Nothing illegal happened, no pictures were shared, no crimes were committed, I never even met the individual,\" he said. \"Let me be clear, it was not a criminal case against me and no criminal charges have ever been brought against me.” He did though apologise to his \"community and colleagues\" for his actions. \"That's on me as an adult, a husband and a father... it should have never happened\", he wrote.\n\nAbrupt exit\n\nBeahm's departure from Twitch made headlines because it was so abrupt - and largely unexplained. In 2020, the platform told the BBC: \"We take appropriate action when we have evidence that a streamer has acted in violation of our Community Guidelines or Terms of Service\". Two years later, after the threat of legal action by Beahm, he and Twitch agreed to a settlement, where neither party admitted any wrongdoing. He has been streaming on YouTube since his Twitch ban, and has over 4.7 million subscribers. On Monday, Midnight Society posted on X (formerly Twitter): \"On Friday evening we became aware of an allegation against one of our co-founder’s [sic] Guy Beahm aka Dr Disrespect.\" It added: \"We assumed his innocence and began speaking with parties involved. And in order to maintain our principles and standards as a studio and individuals, we needed to act.\" The studio did not go into any more detail about what the allegation was.

    "Einstein atomic bomb letter to go up for auction": "Einstein atomic bomb letter to be auctioned\n\n4 days ago Share\n\nGetty Images Albert Einstein reportedly regretted signing the letter\n\nA letter from Albert Einstein, which encouraged the US to develop the world's first nuclear bombs, is to go up for auction. Written to President Franklin D Roosevelt, in 1939, the note warns that Nazi Germany might be able to create such weapons - and suggests the US begins its own atomic programme. Three years later, America began the Manhattan Project, which led to the first ever use of atomic weapons, against Japan, in 1945. The letter is being sold as part of an auction of artefacts belonging to Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who died in 2018 at the age 65.\n\nBill Gates, who started the company with Mr Allen, said: \"Personal computing would not have existed without him.\" His personal collection is go on sale at Christie's, in New York, in September. There will be a range of items reflecting his interest in - and influence on - computing, but the Einstein letter is expected to be the centrepiece. It has been given an estimated value of between $4m and $6m (£3.2m-£4.7m). It was actually written by Hungarian physicist Leo Szilard with help from other scientists - but it was signed by Einstein because his status as one of the greatest scientific figures of all time made it more likely to get the president's attention.\n\nGetty Images Einstein signed the letter, written by physicist Leo Szilard (right)\n\nDated 2 August 1939 - just weeks before the Second World War was declared - it warns that Germany may have worked out the science to create a nuclear bomb. \"It is conceivable - though much less certain - that extremely powerful bombs of a new type may thus be constructed,\" it says. But Einstein is reported to have later regretted the letter due to its role in making America the only country - at the time - to make nuclear weapons. He was quoted in 1947 as saying: \"Had I known that the Germans would not succeed in producing an atomic bomb, I would never have lifted a finger.\"\n\nGetty Images A PDP-10 computer similar to that which is going on sale\n\nAlso being auctioned is a computer from 1971, a DEC PDP-10: KI-10 model which Mr Allen helped restore. Christie's says this is similar to a model which he would have worked on with Bill Gates when they founded Microsoft. These types of computers were key in the development in early forms of the internet. The computer is expected to fetch between $30,000 and $50,000. And a spacesuit belonging to astronaut Ed White - who became the first American to perform a spacewalk, in 1965 - has an estimated value of $80,000 to $120,000.\n\nGetty Images In 1965, Ed White became the first American to perform a spacewalk\n\nIn 2022, Mr Allen's art collection set a new world record for the biggest sale in an auction, raising over $1.5bn (£1.2bn). It included works by Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali and Vincent Van Gogh. It was his wish that the proceeds would go to philanthropic causes. During his life, he donated more than $2bn to charitable causes, set up art and culture museums and also owned various American sports teams. His net worth at the time of his death was estimated at over $20bn by Forbes.",

The Metropolitan Police’s wildlife crime unit – which has been at the forefront of the fight against illegal trafficking for the past 20 years – is being cut back, the BBC has learnt. The decision to redeploy the unit’s detectives to local policing was described as “woefully wrong” by the animal welfare charity Naturewatch Foundation. The Met told the BBC the force would still investigate wildlife crime and there would still be a centralised “function”, but would not comment on what that would be.\n\nGetty Images It is illegal to deal in items made from elephant ivory, unless they are registered as exempt under the Ivory Act 2018\n\nAlthough small, the unit - first set up in 2004 - has been at the forefront of UK operations against global wildlife crime, which is said to be worth up to £17bn a year and is the fourth-largest international crime, according to Interpol. It often takes on cases following Border Force seizures of illegal wildlife products, such as ivory tusks, rhino horns, primate skulls and animal skins being smuggled through Heathrow airport. Despite its successes over the years, the unit has struggled for resources and been part-funded by animal conservation charities. Kate Salmon, wildlife crime campaign manager for Naturewatch Foundation, said the decision to redeploy the detectives was “woefully wrong”.\n\nGetty Images The specialist unit also deals with crimes committed against wildlife across the London area\n\n“The small unit’s work has an impact far greater than its size,” she told the BBC. “This impact includes the disruption of organised criminality and ending the extensive suffering to both people and animals, which if lost will be shameful to the Met and wider UK policing.” Dr Ruth Tingay, co-director of conservation campaign group Wild Justice, said the decision was “unfathomable”. She said: “This unit has been central to the successful prosecution of a number of London-based individuals who have been involved in the illegal international trade in endangered species. “Closing the unit will send a message to other wildlife criminals that they are free to offend without risk of consequence. It's shameful.\" Border Force officers across the country will still work at entry points into the UK to deal with the smuggling of wildlife and wildlife products banned by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of wild fauna and flora (CITES).\n\n'Crucial frontline defence'",
    "What is the UV index: Levels and tanning risks explained": "UV index: Levels explained and how to protect yourself\n\n23 hours ago Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nUltraviolet (UV) radiation is emitted by the Sun and penetrates the Earth's atmosphere. Some UV radiation is essential for our wellbeing, and the sun's rays provide warmth and light. But balance is key - UV exposure can also cause dangerous skin damage.\n\nIs UV dangerous?\n\nWe need to control our exposure, says Prof Dorothy Bennett, from St George's, University of London. UV is beneficial because it enables our skin to produce essential vitamin D. This is important for the function of bones, blood cells and our immune system. \"But UV is also dangerous because every exposure to UV, especially every sunburn, increases our risk of skin cancer. \"Melanoma, the most dangerous skin cancer, is now the fifth commonest cancer in the UK, the ongoing rise being attributed to sunbathing,\" she said. UV radiation promotes skin cancer by damaging DNA in skin cells. It has also been linked to eye problems, including cataracts. And there is growing evidence that UV light may reduce the body's ability to defend itself against certain diseases.\n\nWhat is the UV index?\n\nLevels of UV radiation vary throughout the day. The highest readings occur in the four-hour period around \"solar noon\", which is when the sun is at its highest spot in the sky - usually from late morning to early afternoon. The UV Index (or UVI) is a standard, international measure of ultraviolet radiation. Values start at zero and can rise above 10. The higher the number, the greater the potential for damage to the skin and eyes - and the less time it takes for harm to occur.\n\nWhat are the different UV levels?\n\nCountries close to the equator can experience very high UV levels in the middle of the day, throughout the year. Nairobi in Kenya can have UV levels above 10 all year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Majorca in Spain, will normally hit nine in June and July. But the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic never usually gets above five in December and January (when it is summer in the southern hemisphere).\n\nAccording to the WHO, extra sun protection is required when levels are: 11+ (extremely high)\n\n8-10 (very high) Protection is required when levels are: 6-7 (high)\n\n3-5 (medium) No protection is required when levels are: 1-2 (low)\n\nCan you tan safely?\n\nThere is no safe or healthy way to get a tan, the UK's national health service (NHS) says. If you want one, Dr Bav Shergill, of the British Association of Dermatologists, says the safest way to tan is \"out of a bottle\" - using self-tan. \"When you tan, ultraviolet light stimulates your skin cells to produce pigment to try and protect the DNA of skin cells - but that protection is minimal - the equivalent of SP4. \"That is not much protection at all - so you can still burn very early,\" he warns.\n\nCan you tan even when it is cloudy and windy?\n\nBBC Weather's Helen Willetts says: \"Your skin can burn just as quickly whether it's 30C or 20C. \"Don't be caught out on cloudy days. UV will still penetrate thin clouds - so even if you don't think it's that sunny, you can still burn.\" The amount of UV reaching your skin is not driven by the daily temperature, Dr Michaela Hegglin, from the University of Reading's Department of Meteorology, says. \"UV levels on a bright and breezy late April day in the UK will be about the same as a warm sunny day in August.\"\n\nWhat about skin ageing?\n\nUnprotected exposure to UV rays plays a substantial role in skin ageing - breaking down collagen and elastin fibres in healthy skin. This contributes to wrinkles and loosened folds. The sun's rays also dry out skin, making it coarse and leathery.\n\nHow can you avoid UV damage?\n\nTips from the NHS, include: Spend time in the shade when the sun is strongest (in the UK that is between 11:00 and 15:00 from March to October)\n\nnever burn\n\ncover up with suitable clothing and do not forget sunglasses\n\nuse at least factor 30 sunscreen\n\nreapply sun screen every two hours\n\ntake extra care with children Global research shows people often miss parts of their bodies when putting on sunscreen, Dr Shergill warns. \"People often forget include side of nose by eye - where I have seen a lot of skin cancer,\" he says. Other areas include the groove by the side of the nose and into the cheek, the temples and the upper chest. As a guide, adults should aim to apply about six to eight teaspoons of sunscreen if covering the entire body.\n\nI have brown skin. Do I need to worry?",

The airline has now cancelled almost 400 flights as a result of an indefinite work-to-rule and strike action by pilots. The work-to-rule means not working over time or carrying out any other out-of-hours duties. An eight-hour strike from 05:00 -13:00 local time is planned for Saturday. Aer Lingus said that due to the “indefinite nature” of Irish Air Line Pilots' Association pilots’ industrial action it “must cancel” additional flights up to 7 July.\n\nRTE Dublin Airport on the first day of industrial action\n\nIrish broadcaster RTÉ had reported that the recommendation for an additional strike was made by IALPA on Thursday. However, on Friday afternoon, Capt Mark Tighe, president of the union, said that Ireland's Labour Court has invited both parties in the dispute to return to them on Monday afternoon. \"We are in the process of discussing that and that of course would have relevance to whether or not we escalate the industrial action,\" he told Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme. \"I’m hoping now that they have noted the seriousness of the situation and that they’ll be able to apply their considerable expertise.\" Talks between it and Aer Lingus to resolve the ongoing pay dispute broke down without a resolution on Thursday.\n\nSchool pupils 'slept on floor'\n\nA group of students and teachers from Shimna Integrated School in County Down who were retuning from a trip to Berlin had their flight home cancelled while they were in the airport. Teacher Luke McWatters, said that their 21:45 flight on Thursday was initially showing as delayed and then, more than two hours after the flight was initially due to take off, they were told it was cancelled. “Trying to ring through to Aer Lingus I was on three different calls to three different agents who, every time I got to a certain way through said: ‘Because you’re a group we can’t do anything for you -you have to contact group Aer Lingus who don’t open until 9am’.” Mr McWatters told the BBC’s Evening Extra programme that he felt they had been “left high and dry”, with no offer of accommodation or food.\n\nLuke McWatters Luke McWatters said support from the airline \"fell short\" of what was expected\n\nHe said the group slept on the airport floor. Mr McWatters said they were offered an alternative flight on 1 July. “At that stage we made the call to try other airlines and split ourselves up as a group,” he added. Half of the group travelled to Edinburgh, while the other half caught a flight to Poland, with both groups booked on flights back to Ireland on Friday. Mr McWatters said that the support for Aer Lingus had “fallen very short of what you would expect from a major airline dealing with children”. The BBC has contacted Aer Lingus for a response.\n\n'Reasonable pay claim'\n\nCapt Tighe said \"passengers are extremely dear to us as pilots. Management don’t meet you, we do every day. \"We’ve been left in a position where our pay is being eroded and all we’re looking to do is maintain our pay.\" Speaking to BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme on Friday, Capt Tighe said in an effort to resolve the dispute, the union had said it would accept less than an inflationary rise. \"We don’t believe anybody should be getting less than inflation, but yesterday in an effort to resolve this, we said we would accept less than inflation.\" However, he added: \"We believe inflation is a very reasonable claim in this current time.\"\n\nPA Media IALPA President Capt Mark Tighe said the Labour Court has invited both sides to further discussions on Monday\n\nAdditional strike action?\n\nIALPA had recommended to trade union Fórsa that the additional strike should be longer than the action planned for Saturday, RTÉ has reported. If sanctioned, Fórsa will have to give seven days’ notice to Aer Lingus before pilots can stop work. Aer Lingus has described the potential of further strike action as \"entirely inappropriate given the request of the Labour Court this week that the dispute should not be escalated\".

The city's subway has been gradually phasing out the old trains since December and replacing them with new wheelchair-accessible modern cars. In total 17 trains have been gradually brought into service during 2024. The new rolling stock is just one part of a £288m upgrade programme to the subway system that will feature platform doors and driverless trains in future.\n\nDriver Julie Baker says she had a lump in her throat because she had driven the trains her entire career\n\nStrathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT), which operates the subway, said the two final trains had completed an estimated 2.6million miles each in passenger service - 400,600 loops of the system. Driver Julie Baker, who took one of the trains out for its last spin, said she was trying not to cry as she had been driving it for 35 years - almost as long as its lifespan. \"I'm actually emotional but its time to change,\" she said. Julie has worked with SPT since she was just 16 and passed her driver's exam in her early 20s. \"There were quite a few girls driving at the time, but it seems to be more men doing it now - the shift's aren't always family friendly,\" she said. \"But it's all I've ever known. \"I'm looking for my big pension and retirement in the next few years when the trains become driverless,\" she said.\n\nSPT The 44-year-old legacy subway trains were introduced in 1980\n\nThe old-style trains were introduced to passenger service on 16 April 1980 as part of the system's second modernisation project, which started in May 1977. This project closed the subway for three years. It introduced 33 Metro-Cammell trains to the system, with eight additional carriages built in 1992 to make all trains three carriages long. One of the legacy carriages has been moved to Glasgow's Riverside Museum as part of its transport exhibits.\n\nThe third-generation modern trains are wheelchair-accessible and include air-conditioning\n\nThe new third-generation trains are the same length as the older carriages, but feature a \"walk-through\" design and are air-conditioned. SPT said the trains should be more comfortable and quiet. The new trains are also the first to be wheelchair-accessible with a dedicated wheelchair space - however only two out of 15 stations on the subway have a lift to aid those with mobility issues. Glasgow's Subway, often dubbed the 'Clockwork Orange' due to its striking orange colour and single loop design, has undergone its third modernisation since 2012. This included a refurbishment of all 15 stations, a new smart ticketing system, new rolling stock (trains), and a new signalling, communication and control-room system being introduced. The third-generation trains also have the capability to be driverless, which the operator aims to introduce in the future. SPT will also introduce platform screen doors to station platforms, as part of the £288m upgrades.\n\nSPT\n\nInterior designer Anna Campbell Jones, who is also a judge on 'Scotland's Home of the Year', designed the seat pattern (moquette) on the legacy trains. Glaswegian Campbell-Jones told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that it was her first design job after graduating Glasgow School of Art. The old chairs featured 100% mohair upholstery and Scottish leather. \"It was in the early 90s when the old carriages were refitted\", she said. \"It's incredible how long they've lasted and I feel incredibly old that something I designed will now be in a museum.\"\n\nSPT The legacy moquette also features striking Strathclyde red",

The airline issued an invitation to the Irish Air Line Pilots' Association (IALPA) on Wednesday after pilots began an indefinite work-to-rule, meaning they are not working overtime or carrying out any other out-of-hours duties. An eight-hour strike from 05:00 -13:00 local time is also planned for Saturday. The trade union is calling for a 24% pay rise for members.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, IALPA President Capt Mark Tighe confirmed at this point \"talks have broken down\". Capt Tighe said during Thursday's meeting the union had moved from its inflationary figure of almost 24%. However, he added: \"The company has not moved from its statement that anything more than 12.25% would have to be funded by pilots' own payments through work practice.\"\n\nPA The pilots' union started an indefinite work-to-rule at midnight on Wednesday\n\nDonal Moriarty, Aer Lingus' chief corporate affairs officer, said the airline had \"engaged constructively\" in talks with the union. \"We tried to discuss items that could actually resolve this dispute, in particular we tried to discuss productivity, flexibility and the modernisation of our collective agreement,\" Mr Moriarty said. He added discussing these are \"essential\" for reaching a pay deal, but IALPA was unable to enter into these talks as it has \"no mandate to do so\". \"We advised IALPA and encouraged them to revisit that mandate in order to put within their power the normal aspect of pay negotiations,\" Mr Moriarty said.\n\nEscalation 'can't be ruled out'\n\nThe total number of flights cancelled as a result of the industrial action, Aer Lingus said, is 270. All Aer Lingus UK regional flights, operated by Emerald Airlines, and Aer Lingus UK transatlantic flights to and from Manchester will operate as scheduled. Speaking on BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme earlier on Thursday, Capt Tighe said \"nothing has changed\" and the union has been \"wanting and willing\" to meet. He explained that the 24% increase is a \"cumulative figure of inflation from 2019, our last pay rise. \"We've had this for 22 months, and until a deal is agreed and brought to the members, the point of agreement between the negotiators and the company, at that point in time the executives would look at stopping the action but until then there will be no stopping the action.\" Capt Tighe added that an escalation of the action \"can't be ruled out\". He said: \"Our passengers are very important to us as pilots, our managers don't meet our passengers, we do every day, we interact with them, they're really important to us, we did not want it to come to this.\" The number of flights cancelled \"beggars belief\", he said, as only a \"small percentage\" of pilots work outside of their contracted hours. \"The rest of us are tired, we need time to rest and time to spend with our families but the company are somehow saying that all of these flight cancellations are due to this tiny number of people who work on their days off. It beggars belief and it's not credible.\"\n\nDublin Airport on the first day of industrial action\n\nIn a statement the airline said: \"Aer Lingus will continue to focus on minimising the disruption caused to customers by IALPA’s industrial action.\" The airline said it \"made it clear that it remains available for discussions both directly and through the state’s industrial relations framework”. Aer Lingus called on IALPA to \"consider the damage that its continued industrial action is inflicting upon passengers, the company and the Irish economy”. A full list of cancelled flights up to and including 2 July can be found on the airline's website. It said: \"The nature of this industrial action may lead to further cancellations and delays and we will communicate directly with impacted customers as soon as possible.\"\n\nRTÉ The pilots' union started an indefinite work-to-rule at midnight on Wednesday\n\nHow much are Aer Lingus pilots paid?\n\nCo-pilots can start out at about €36,000 (£30,400), with packages increasing based on actual flying hours.

    "India heat: What record air conditioner sales reveal about heatwave": "What record air conditioner sales reveal about India heatwave\n\n2 days ago By Soutik Biswas , @soutikBBC, India correspondent Share\n\nGetty Images India is the world's fastest-growing market for air conditioners\n\nGovind Ram, a junk dealer living on the outskirts of the Indian capital, Delhi, bought an air conditioner in May after his children pleaded with him. A fiery heatwave was scorching the city and its neighbourhood, and his school-going children complained of “choking” heat. Using his savings, Mr Ram bought the air conditioner for his children’s bedroom. This relief, he says, has come at a cost – his electricity bill last month soared to seven times the usual amount. “I’ve endured the worst summers under just a fan. But this year, my children suffered so much that I had to buy our family’s first air conditioner,” Mr Ram said. Over the past five decades, India has faced over 700 heatwaves but this summer’s severe and unrelenting heat has to count among the worst, experts believe. Some 97% of Indian households are electrified, with 93% relying on fans for comfort, according to think tank Council on Energy Environment and Water (CEEW). But this year, India’s air conditioning market has surged like never before. “In my 45 years in the air-con industry, I've never seen anything like this. The spike in demand is a complete surprise, with sales likely to more than double this summer compared to last year,” says B Thiagarajan, managing director of Blue Star, a leading cooling and refrigeration company.\n\nEPA Nearly a billion people across 23 states are exposed to heat stress in India\n\nThe sale of air conditioners will possibly see an unprecedented growth of 60% this summer in India - March to July - from the usual 25-30% growth in previous years, Mr Thiagarajan reckons. Around a decade or more ago, he remembers, sales would peak in the last week of May. “Now demand peaks in April.” Companies have sold in three months what they would usually sell in nine. Despite only 8% of India’s 300 million households owning air conditioners, with some having multiple units, India is the world's fastest-growing AC market. Of the 170 million units sold globally last year, China purchased 90 million, while India bought 12 million. The International Energy Agency (IEA), a Paris-based energy think tank, predicts a nine-fold rise in home air conditioner ownership in the country by 2050, outpacing growth in ownership of all other household appliances, including TVs, refrigerators and washing machines. By then, India’s total electricity demand from home air conditioners would surpass Africa’s current total electricity consumption, reflecting the ongoing trends in energy system evolution, according to IEA. “The rising demand reflects, at once, rising aspirations, disposable incomes and extreme weather,” Mr Thiagarajan said.\n\nGetty Images India's high-rise apartments are often poorly ventilated\n\nNotably, 95% of Indian air-con buyers are aspirational middle-class first-time purchasers; over 65% hail from smaller cities and towns; and more than half buy through zero-interest consumer loans. Also, the average buyer is now in their thirties. Most of the sales come from the hotter northern region – since mid-May, for example, daily temperatures in Delhi have consistently stayed around or above 40C (104F). Experts say Indian cities have become “heat traps” due to unbalanced development. Nearly a billion people across 23 states are exposed to heat stress, according to CEEW. Green spaces are scarce. Rapid growth is swallowing up water bodies which help cool the environment. Increasing greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, factories and construction activities are raising temperatures further. India’s high-rise boom has led to mostly poorly ventilated apartments and glass and chrome office buildings, which absorb and reflect heat. All this is making cities hotter and more uncomfortable to live in. But this is only one part of the story. To gauge how people were coping with rising temperatures, a recent nationwide survey by Artha Global’s Centre for Rapid Insights (CRI), a think tank, posed the question: “In the afternoon, when it is hot outside, is the inside of your home comfortable?”\n\nGetty Images A man uses a cooler at his bicycle repair shop in Delhi in summer\n\nAbout 32% of respondents reported their homes as hot and uncomfortable, highlighting India's struggle with extreme temperatures. Among those who can cool their homes, 42% rely on energy-intensive air conditioners or coolers, indicating that managing the heat often demands costly solutions. Also, only one in eight four-wheeler owners found their homes uncomfortable in extreme heat, compared to nearly half of those without any vehicle. Conversely, about 40% of both two-wheeler and four-wheeler owners rely on ACs or coolers for home comfort, while only 16% of non-vehicle owners use these cooling solutions. The data highlights how the poor face extreme heat even indoors, without direct sun exposure, said Neelanjan Sircar, director of CRI. In other words, the \"gap between rich households, who already own air conditioners, and poor households, who are not yet able to buy them, is widening\", according to a study by researchers from University of California, Berkeley and University of Mannheim, Germany on air conditioning and global inequality. Living in windowless slum hutments with poor ventilation and erratic electricity makes staying indoors unbearable. Many slum dwellers literally work next door in luxury condominiums with 24/7 electricity. One told a newspaper recently: “I don’t want to return to my slum. When I work [in an apartment] I feel like lying down under the cool breeze of the AC”. India needs to rejuvenate aquatic habitats – lakes, reservoirs, ponds, wetlands, canals. It also requires building cool houses, using cool roofs – white painted roofs to reduce indoor temperatures – supplying chilled water via pipelines to buildings, and installing more energy-efficient air conditioners.\n\nAFP India needs to rejuvenate aquatic habitats – lakes, reservoirs, ponds, wetlands, canals",
    "Supreme Court rejects plan to shield Sacklers in Purdue opioid deal": "Justices reject plan to shield Sacklers in Purdue opioid deal\n\n2 days ago By Natalie Sherman , BBC News Share\n\nEPA Campaigners and family members of those who have died of opioids outside the US Supreme Court\n\nThe US Supreme Court has struck down a part of the bankruptcy deal for Purdue Pharma that would have shielded members of the Sackler family from future lawsuits over their role in fuelling the opioid crisis. The Sacklers, who owned and operated the Oxycontin-maker for decades, had agreed to pay $6bn (£4.7bn) towards a wider settlement in exchange for sweeping protections against civil claims related to the addictive opioid. But the nation's top court ruled that granting such protections to the Sacklers, who did not themselves declare bankruptcy was not authorised under law. Sackler family members said they would continue to push for a settlement, warning that the alternative was \"costly and chaotic legal proceedings in courtrooms across the country\". The ruling is a victory for the US government and others who had challenged the deal, arguing that releasing the Sacklers was a misuse of the system. But it raises major questions about the future of the agreement, which had won significant, if mixed, support from many who sued the company and saw it as the only practical way to reach the family's billions for drug treatment and other uses. Ellen Isaacs, whose son Patrick Ryan Wroblewski died of an overdose in 2018 at the age of 33, was one of the family members who had opposed the shield for the Sacklers. She said she was not sure what came next, but was hopeful that justice would be done. \"I'd like to see them held fully accountable,\" she said. \"I'm just so grateful to the Supreme Court right now I can't get beyond that.\"\n\nReuters Oxycontin, often an entryway into harder drugs, such as heroin, has been blamed for driving the opioid crisis\n\nPurdue became a household name in the US as the maker and promoter of OxyContin - a prescription painkiller it promoted as safe, despite being aware it was both highly addictive and widely abused. The company declared bankruptcy in 2019, after it was hit by thousands of lawsuits brought by states, cities and families. It later pleaded guilty to criminal charges, including defrauding health agencies and making illegal payments to doctors. The kind of shield granted to the Sacklers in this deal has been a critical feature of other high-profile settlements, including those involving Boy Scouts of America and the Catholic Church. But courts have been divided as to whether such \"releases\" from liability for third parties like the Sacklers are actually permitted. In asking the Supreme Court to take up the issue, lawyers for the US government said letting it stand \"would leave in place a roadmap for wealthy corporations and individuals to misuse the bankruptcy system\" and escape accountability. Writing for the 5-4 majority, Justice Neil Gorsuch echoed those concerns. \"The Sacklers have not agreed to place anything approaching their full assets on the table for opioid victims, \" he wrote. \"Yet they seek a judicial order that would extinguish virtually all claims against them for fraud, willful injury, and even wrongful death, all without the consent of those who have brought and seek to bring such claims.\" The court noted that the Sacklers, who have long denied wrongdoing, \"seek to pay less than the code ordinarily requires and receive more than it normally permits\".\n\nOxycontin, often an entryway into harder drugs, such as heroin, has been blamed for driving the opioid crisis. Since 1999, a few years after the drug became available, deaths from opioid overdoses have surged eightfold to more than 80,000 annually. Court filings allege the Sackler family was long aware of the legal risks, and withdrew some $11bn from the company in the decade before its bankruptcy. They stashed much of the money overseas, while using some of it to pay company taxes, making recovery difficult. When the Supreme Court heard arguments last year, dozens of protesters opposing the deal showed up, holding signs such as \"my dead son does not release the Sacklers\". But many others had backed the deal, willing to accept the terms if the result was billions of dollars for treatment, as well as $750m that would go directly to opioid victims, estimated at $3,500-$48,000 each.\n\nGetty Images",

What are we spending for a week of rentals?’ I could buy some really powerful computers just on one week’s worth of [cloud] spending.” So, he did. Buying hardware and hosting it in a shared data centre costs $840,000 per year. Although costs pushed Mr Heinemeier Hansson to act, other factors were also a concern. The internet is engineered to be highly resilient. “I saw the distributed design erode as more and more companies gravitated essentially to three owners of computers,” he says, referring to the three leading cloud providers. If a major data centre goes down, large parts of the web can go offline. The cloud was pitched, he says, as cheaper, easier, and faster. “The cloud was not able to make things easier to a point where we could measure any productivity gains,” he says, noting his operations team has always been about the same size.\n\nWas using the cloud faster? “Yes, but it didn’t matter,\" says Mr Heinemeier Hansson. \"If you want to connect a hundred servers to the internet, you can do it in less than five minutes [in the cloud]. That’s incredible. \"But we do not need, nor do I believe the vast majority of companies need, a five-minute turnaround on a massive number of additional servers.” He can have new servers delivered and racked in his data centre in a week, which is fast enough. 37signals does use the cloud for experimenting with new products. “We needed to have some big machines, but we only needed them for 20 minutes,” Mr Heinemeier Hansson says. “The cloud is ideal for that. It would be wasteful to buy that computer and let it stay idle for 99.99% of the time.” He still recommends the cloud to fledgling businesses. “When you have a speculative start-up and there’s great uncertainty as to whether you’re going to be around in 18 months, you should absolutely not spend your money buying computers,” he says. “You should rent them.”\n\nGetty Images Cloud computing has created huge businesses like AWS and Microsoft's Azure\n\n37signals is not alone in bringing workloads back from the cloud, which is known as cloud repatriation. Digital workspace company Citrix found that 94% of large US organisations it surveyed had worked on repatriating data or workloads from the cloud in the last three years. The reasons cited included security concerns, unexpected costs, performance issues, compatibility problems and service downtime. Plitch provides software that enables people to modify single-player games, including adjusting the difficulty. It built its own private data centres and repatriated cloud workloads to them, saving an estimated 30% to 40% in costs after two years. “A key factor in our decision was that we have highly proprietary R&D data and code that must remain strictly secure,” says Markus Schaal, managing director at the German firm. “If our investments in features, patches, and games were leaked, it would be an advantage to our competitors. While the public cloud offers security features, we ultimately determined we needed outright control over our sensitive intellectual property. \"As our AI-assisted modelling tools advanced, we also required significantly more processing power that the cloud could not meet within budget.” He adds: “We encountered occasional performance issues during heavy usage periods and limited customisation options through the cloud interface. Transitioning to a privately-owned infrastructure gave us full control over hardware purchasing, software installation, and networking optimized for our workloads.”\n\nPulsant Mark Turner's firm gives companies an alternative to the cloud\n\nMark Turner, chief commercial officer at Pulsant, helps companies to migrate from the cloud to Pulsant’s colocation data centres across the UK. In a colocation arrangement the client owns the IT hardware, but houses it with another firm, where it can be kept securely, at the right temperature and with power back-up. “The cloud is going to continue to be the biggest part of IT infrastructure, but there is a good place for local, physical, secure infrastructure,” he says. “There is a repatriation going on of the things that should never have been in the cloud or that won’t work in the cloud.” Some his biggest clients for repatriation are online software providers, where each additional customer puts more load on the server, increasing cloud costs. One such client is LinkPool, which enables smart contracting using blockchain. It was developed in public cloud, initially using free credits. Business exploded, and the cloud bill reached $1m per month. Using colocation, costs shrunk by up to 85%. “[The founder has] now got four racks in a data centre in the city where he lives and works, connected to the world. He goes up against his competitors and he can move his price point around because his cost is not going to move in line [with customer demand],” says Mr Turner. “The change leaders in the IT industry are now the people who are not saying cloud first, but are saying cloud when it fits,” he adds. “Five years ago, the change disruptors were cloud first, cloud first, cloud first.”",
    "Tata steel: Strike could shut much of Port Talbot plant early": "Strike may force Tata steel closures next week\n\n1 day ago By Mark Palmer , BBC News Share\n\nGetty Images The company had originally planned to shut down one of the blast furnaces by the end of June and the second by September\n\nWorkers at Tata Steel have been told the company is taking steps to potentially cease operations at much of the Port Talbot plant by 7 July because of a strike by the trade union Unite. The company had originally been planning to shut one of the blast furnaces by the end of June and the second one by September. But Port Talbot workers have been told that because of the strike from 8 July, the company can no longer be assured of sufficient resources being available to ensure safe and stable operations. The Unite union said Tata's statement to shut or pause the blast furnaces three months earlier than intended was the latest in a long line of threats and it would not deter them. The Welsh government said it cannot and will not support the closure of both blast furnaces.\n\nLast week the Unite union announced that about 1,500 workers would begin an indefinite strike on 8 July over the company's plans to cut thousands of jobs. Onay Kasab, the national lead for Unite, told Radio Wales Breakfast that the union was due to have a conversation with the company regarding safety during the strike. Mr Kasab denied if the union had given the company an opportunity to shut the site. \"What other option have we got when we are facing 2,800 job losses. We have said to Tata, again and again, 'wait for a general election, wait for a new Labour government'\" he said. Mr Kasab said the union have a letter from the company asking the union to wait until after the general election for discussions to take place. However, the company previously said it would not be changing course in Port Talbot, regardless of who wins the general election. About 2,800 Tata Steel workers will lose their jobs when the company closes both blast furnaces in Port Talbot by the end of September. At the time, the company said if the strike affected the safety or stability of its operations it would be \"forced\" to accelerate closure plans. A spokesperson for Tata said: \"Following the announcement by Unite union to unilaterally call strike action from 8 July, Tata Steel is unfortunately forced to commence legal action to challenge the validity of Unite's ballot. \"In the coming days, if we cannot be certain that we are able to continue to safely and stably operate our assets through the period of strike action, we will not have any choice but to pause or stop heavy end operations [including both blast furnaces] on the Port Talbot site. \"That is not a decision we would take lightly, and we recognise that it would prove extremely costly and disruptive throughout the supply chain, but the safety of people on or around our sites will always take priority over everything else.\" Tata said it is again calling on Unite to withdraw its industrial action and join Community and GMB unions in \"giving consideration\" to the company's proposal, which Tata said includes \"generous employee support packages, training and skills development\". It said it \"understands\" the impact the restructuring will have on many employees and contractors, but that it \"remains committed to a just transition\" and hopes for a \"long and sustainable future\" in the UK. The company plans to build a £1.25bn electric arc furnace to produce steel in a way which is less polluting than traditional blast furnaces but requires fewer workers. Tata said the move would secure the future of steelmaking at the site and the UK government is contributing £500m towards the cost of the project. The plans for the site will see both furnaces shut down. Number five will go off by the end of next week as planned while four is due to go off by the end of September. Preparatory work to shut down five will begin by 1 July if the strike goes ahead. Other elements that will close include the harbour, sinter plant, ore yards and primary steelmaking.\n\nPA Media Unite union workers are protesting against Tata Steel's plans to cut 2,800 jobs\n\nSharon Graham, the Unite general secretary, said the union is \"fighting for the future of the steel industry\". She said Unite has secured \"serious investment\" from Labour to safeguard jobs. \"Tata putting out a statement to shut or pause its blast furnaces three months earlier than they intended to is the latest in a long line of threats that won't deter us. \"The Unite campaign is not about selling jobs, it's about securing the long-term future of steel making in this country for thousands of workers in Port Talbot and South Wales.\" Unite said it is calling on the \"real decision makers\" in Mumbai to realise that \"the investment secured will be good for the company and workers.\" GMB union said Tata must \"step back\" from this \"irreversible decision\" and instead \"safeguard steelmaking assets\". GMB national officer, Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, said that the upcoming general election could \"change so much\", and that GMB's next actions would be decided by its members. The Community union condemned Tata's \"unacceptable\" decision to bring forward the closure and said it continued to support the Labour Party's call for Tata not to make irreversible decisions before the general election.\n\nAnalysis by Ben Price, BBC Wales News\n\nDevelopments have escalated quickly in the past two weeks. Unite is one of three unions which represents steelworkers and it has so far been the most militant in its action in the face of significant job cuts across Tata’s UK operations. Members are currently working to rule and there’s a ban on any overtime. However, the decision to walk out indefinitely is an escalation which now potentially threatens the early closure of the UK’s largest steelmaking operation in Port Talbot. Tata says it would have no option but to close if the strike goes ahead, but in the meantime the company has filed for an injunction at the High Court to try to prevent the strike happening. It suggests Unite’s ballot on industrial action wasn’t carried out properly. With the action due on 8 July, Tata will need a ruling quickly. The other unions, Community and GMB, say they’ll wait until after the general election before deciding whether to strike too. But having spoken to a number of steelworkers in Port Talbot, the sense is that many don’t want a strike which could cost them the current offer on the table from the company. What happens during the course of the next week could be crucial to the future of thousands of livelihoods, although Tata says no redundancies will be made until the end of September, regardless.\n\nWorkers and local people have protested about the closure plans\n\nFirst Minister Vaughan Gething described the news from Tata as \"extraordinary\" and urged the company to wait for the result of next week's general election. In a statement, Mr Gething said: \"The news that Tata could switch off blast furnaces four and five at Port Talbot next week is extraordinary and will cause huge anxiety for the workforce, their families and the community. \"The Welsh government cannot and will not support the closure of both blast furnaces\". He added that acting whilst the nation went to the polls did not help de-escalate matters. Samuel Kurtz, the Welsh Conservative shadow minister for economy and energy,said it was \"disappointing news that will cause additional distress to communities already dealing with enough as it is\". \"Tata have shown no goodwill to their workforce at what is an anxious time. “The Welsh Labour government have also only paid lip service to Tata's workforce, failing to contribute a penny to the transition board, and UK Labour's manifesto says nothing on what it would do differently to support Port Talbot's steelworkers,\" he added. Luke Fletcher, Plaid Cymru's economy spokesperson, said steel should be brought under the control of the next UK government, which Plaid believes will be led by Sir Keir Starmer. Mr Fletcher said: \"The time has come now for an incoming Labour government to put words into action on steel. \"Save our steel is no good as just a slogan, if we are going to save our steel, nationalisation needs to happen on day one.\"",

    "Marks & Spencer to launch clothing repairs service": "M&S to launch clothing repairs service\n\n17 hours ago By Liv McMahon , BBC News Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nMarks & Spencer is launching a new service for clothing repairs and alterations. From August, customers will be able to book through a dedicated online hub and have their fixed items posted back to them within seven to ten days. The work will be carried out by Deliveroo-style repairs start-up Sojo, and its in-house team of tailors, with prices starting at £5. The move comes as retailers try to encourage more sustainable habits among their shoppers.\n\nSojo launched during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021 with a mission to make repairing, not simply replacing, clothing more mainstream. M&S said its partnership with Sojo aimed to provide customers with ways to extend the life of their clothing. “Through the launch of our repair service, we’re making it even easier for customers to give their clothes Another life, whether they are using our new repair service or long-standing clothes recycling scheme,\" said Richard Price, managing director of clothing & home at M&S.\n\nSojo's Josephine Philips wants to make repairing clothes more mainstream\n\nJosephine Philips, Sojo's founder and chief executive, said the partnership marked \"an incredibly big step\" towards its mission of making clothes repairs more accessible. Siobhan Gehin, a retail expert and senior partner at consulting firm Roland Berger, told the BBC that by partnering with smaller, independent repair firms, large brands can provide customers with convenient alterations without having to create the infrastructure for these services themselves.\n\nGrowing trend among retailers\n\nM&S is not alone in looking to repair services as a way to seemingly embrace and encourage sustainability. In January, Sojo took up a permanent space in Selfridges on London’s Oxford Street to provide customers with access to its clothing repairs service. The central London department store also gives shoppers access to handbag and trainer restoration services. Japanese fashion retailer Uniqlo, perhaps best known for its viral shoulder bag, offers clothing repairs and additional services such as embroidery for Uniqlo items at six of its UK stores. John Lewis has made its fashion rental service and recycling scheme a key part of its consumer-facing sustainability strategy, alongside accepting and reselling pre-loved products such as electronics and furniture. High Street stores Primark and H&M provide customers with online guides for repairing and maintaining their clothes, such as how to sew buttons and zips on to items or rework them entirely. Primark has also held free repair workshops for customers across the UK and Europe since 2022.\n\n'Regulatory pressures'",

Law firm Fieldfisher said on Friday it had issued letters of claim for breach of the Consumer Protection Act over own-brand sandwiches purchased in Tesco and Asda. The claims for compensation relate to a man from the South East and an 11-year-old girl in the North West. One person in England has died linked to the ongoing E. coli outbreak, the UK Health Security Agency said on Thursday, although they had underlying health conditions. The E. coli outbreak is thought to be caused by some supermarket sandwiches containing salad leaves. The large majority of cases reported so far developed symptoms before 4 June and the number of cases being reported is now falling, offering hope the outbreak may have ended. Several food manufacturers recalled some of their products as a precaution. The Food Standards Agency said lettuce is the likely source, based on tests.\n\nFieldfisher said the claim against Asda related to a young girl who contracted E. coli after eating an own-brand chicken salad sandwich from the supermarket. \"The girl, aged 11, developed the serious condition haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), which attacks the kidneys and has been on dialysis for three weeks,\" it said. \"She was discharged home two days ago but could be at risk of permanent kidney damage. Her mother bought three of the sandwiches as part of an online delivery.\" An Asda spokesman said that it had not yet received any letter from Fieldfisher regarding these claims, but added: \"As soon as we do we will review the details of the claim as a matter of urgency.\" Harvinder Kaur, a director at Fieldfisher, told the PA News agency earlier on Friday that she had issued a separate letter to Tesco on behalf of a man from the South East. He was also hospitalised with E. coli symptoms after eating Tesco-branded sandwiches containing salad, the law firm claims. \"Luckily, this client did not go on to develop HUS and is now home, but for a time he was seriously ill,\" she said. \"Under the Act, companies producing food must ensure it is safe to eat. \"If it causes illness, it is a breach of their duty and those injured are eligible to claim compensation, not least to fund possible ongoing medical care.\" She added that the man was a \"regular shopper\" at Tesco, buying his lunch there most weekdays as it was very close to his work. The BBC understands Tesco has yet to receive the letter from Fieldfisher.\n\nHow do you treat E. coli and what are the symptoms?",
    "Household incomes up only 7% since 2010": "Incomes have risen 'at a crawl' says think tank\n\n24 hours ago By Faarea Masud and Lucy Hooker , Business reporters, BBC News Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nSlow economic growth and three major economic shocks have meant households' disposable incomes have grown very slowly since 2010, according to a think tank report. Typical household incomes went up by just £140 a year, new analysis from the Resolution Foundation showed. That is a total rise over the 14 year period of just 7% - or an average of half a percent a year - in the amount people had left over to spend after paying tax. By contrast, disposable incomes rose 38% over the 14 years up to 2010, the poverty-focused think tank wrote. However, poorer households had seen stronger income growth than richer ones, it said. The Resolution Foundation said the 2008 financial crisis, the Covid pandemic and high inflation had all contributed to the slowdown, but that growth in general had also been \"sluggish\". That resulted in income rises \"slowing to a crawl\" it said, hampering progress in reducing poverty levels. The state of the economy, and especially the squeeze on ordinary families through the cost of living crisis, is a central theme in the general election, with the Conservatives defending their record in government since 2010.",
    "Fujitsu expert: I didn't think Horizon was a monster": "Fujitsu expert: I didn't think Horizon was a monster\n\n1 day ago By Tom Espiner , BBC business reporter Share\n\nBBC\n\nFormer Fujitsu engineer and Horizon expert Gareth Jenkins has said he didn't think the software was \"a monster\" and that he was \"trapped into doing things I shouldn't have done\". Speaking at an inquiry into the Horizon scandal, Mr Jenkins was accused by lawyer Flora Page of \"protecting\" it when he gave evidence as an expert witness between 2010 and 2013. Ms Page represents Horizon victims including former sub-postmaster Seema Misra, who Mr Jenkins gave evidence against in 2010. Ms Misra told the BBC the system was a monster which \"had blood on its hands, and so do the people who protect [it]\".\n\nBetween 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted hundreds of sub-postmasters on the strength of faulty Horizon data, with 700 convicted of offences such as theft and false accounting. Horizon falsely flagged discrepancies in accounts, with many sub-postmasters using their own savings to make good the imaginary shortfalls. The wrongful prosecutions, which have been called one of the biggest British miscarriages of justice, had a devastating effect on the lives of the sub-postmasters affected. They faced financial ruin and the loss of standing in their communities. Some sub-postmasters ended up taking their own lives after being pursued by the Post Office for supposed losses, including Martin Griffiths, whose widow was later paid in instalments by the Post Office for her silence, the inquiry heard in April.\n\nGiving his fourth day of evidence at the inquiry into the Horizon scandal, Mr Jenkins was questioned by Ms Page, a barrister who represented Horizon victims including Seema Misra. Ms Misra was pregnant with her second child when she was convicted of theft and sent to jail in 2010. She later told the BBC she would have killed herself had she not been pregnant at the time. In a charged atmosphere at the hearing, with Ms Misra sitting next to her, Ms Page accused Mr Jenkins of being a \"Fujitsu man\". She said Mr Jenkins \"knew the Misra trial was a test case for Horizon\". Ms Page alleged his role was to make sure Horizon had a \"clean bill of health\" and that he had \"tailored\" his evidence accordingly. \"My role was to tell the truth,\" Mr Jenkins said. \"I attempted to answer as best I could the questions I was asked\". Ms Page responded: \"Never mind whether a by-product of protecting the monster was that a woman was sent to jail\". Mr Jenkins said he was \"sorry for had happened to Mrs Misra\" but he felt that was down the to way that the Post Office had behaved and wasn't \"purely down to me\". \"I clearly got trapped into doing things I shouldn't have done, but that was not intentional on my behalf,\" he said.\n\nMr Jenkins was part of the Fujitsu team that developed the Horizon software, and part of his role was dealing with bugs in the system. Mr Jenkins has maintained throughout his evidence that he didn't understand his previous duties as an expert witness to tell the court about problems with Horizon, and that he didn't know that he shouldn't just narrowly answer questions about the technology. Under questioning at the inquiry on Friday, Mr Jenkins said: \"I appreciate that I got things very wrong, but it was done through ignorance rather than maliciousness\". He added that the Horizon system \"as a whole was working well\". Mr Jenkins is currently being investigated by the Metropolitan Police on suspicion of perjury - lying to a court, and perverting the course of justice. No criminal charges have been brought.",

    "Does immigration matter to the election in Scotland?": "Does immigration matter to the election in Scotland?\n\n1 day ago By Douglas Fraser , Business and Economy Editor, Scotland Share\n\nPA Media Small boats crossing the English Channel have become part of the election debate\n\nMigration: the movement of a person across an international border or within a state, settling for more than one year - sometimes voluntary, sometimes not, by regular or irregular means. It's a simple definition but one of the hottest political topics around the world. It probably always has been, as a vital part of the human story. In the UK, opinion surveys suggest the salience of the issue and opposition to immigration has declined since the Brexit referendum. But the numbers of migrants into the UK have soared since the pandemic, fuelling concerns about the effect on public services and the need for more housing. Scottish political parties approach the issue differently, due to demographic pressures to replace working age Scots as they age. Some argue there should be a different and more welcoming approach, controlled from Holyrood.\n\nWhat is 'net migration'?\n\nThe immigration count is the number of people in a year who come to the UK, intending to stay for at least a year. The emigration number covers those who leave for at least a year. Arrivals minus departers equals net migration. It's not always that way round. Scotland's story is more often about net emigration. That only changed this century, through free movement within the European Union. In 2019, the net UK figure was 184,000. Last year it was 685,000, according to the Office for National Statistics, slightly down from the record high of 764,000 in 2022. The 2023 figure counted 1,218,000 arrivals, and 532,000 emigrants from the UK.\n\nWhy have numbers soared?\n\nIt's not Europeans. They're more likely to be going home. Last year, 202,000 EU citizens left the UK, while 126,000 EU citizens arrived. Of arrivals, 1,000,031, or 85%, were from outside the European Union. Some 61,000 were British citizens, many of them coming home after being immigrants somewhere else. Many have come in recent years from Hong Kong and Ukraine, though the number of these declined last year.\n\nPA Media Universities bring many overseas students to Scotland\n\nWork visas are backed by employers who cannot fill vacancies. The process is costly. A three-year skilled worker visa with health surcharge will soon cost £10,700. Last year, the number of work visa arrivals was up from 277,000 to 423,000, almost half of them from India and Nigeria, mostly in health and social care. The figures also include students coming to the UK to study for at least a year, up from 91,000 in 2022 to 133,000 last year. In 2022, the main non-EU sources of student recruits were India, Nigeria, China and Pakistan. Most are required to return at the end of their courses. Some 133,000 non-EU nationals did so last year. One area where the Conservative government has tightened rules is dependant family members. Last year, those numbers nearly doubled to 219,000.\n\nHow significant are the small boats?\n\nMuch of the attention to immigration has focussed on the small open boats that bring people to England's southern shores, many seeking asylum. This is partly because the journey is so dangerous, costing lives as criminals profit from this human traffic. But the attention is also because it plays on fears of uncontrolled immigration. Last year, 29,437 people arrived in the UK on \"the boats\" - one in 41 immigrant arrivals in the UK. From a higher number in 2022, they made up 45% of those seeking asylum in the UK. So they are a relatively small part of a more complex picture.\n\nWhere do immigrants go when they arrive in the UK?\n\nLondon is a big magnet for new arrivals, often to stay with relatives and within settled communities. Scotland receives around 6% of net migrants into the UK, which is lower than its 8.4% population share. Scotland may, however, have a higher proportion of those arriving on student visas. Some 21% of the \"economically active\" population in England was born outside the UK, and 14% in Scotland. Half of those in Scotland were EU nationals, a higher share than other parts of the UK. In 2020-22, nearly a quarter of NHS workers in England were not born in the UK, while in Scotland, the ratio was closer to one in nine.\n\nIs immigration seen differently in Scotland?\n\nUsing data from 2017, attitudes in Scotland, when comparing the same survey answers in England and Wales, found similar attitudes. In Scotland, more people believed immigration was good for the British economy than believe it is bad, by 47% to 17%. The figures for England and Wales were very close. In Scotland, 43% of respondents to the Social Attitudes Survey thought immigration enriches British culture, and 20% thought the opposite. The picture in England was again similar, with 43% believing immigration has a positive impact upon British culture and 23% seeing it negatively. Last month, Migration Policy Scotland, which has a favourable view of 'well-managed migration', published its survey findings. This suggested that 42% of Scots would prefer to see a reduction in immigration to Scotland, and 31% say it should be raised - reversing the position with the first such survey, published last year. A majority - 53% - say those who come to Scotland should be given longer to remain and integrate. In 2022, an opinion survey, asked which government should have control over immigration: 53% answered Holyrood and 47% said Westminster (excluding 11% ‘don’t knows’).\n\nPA Media Health is one area which employs many immigrant workers\n\nCould there be a different policy for Scotland?\n\nFor more than 20 years, there has been a cross-party consensus on the need to use immigration to address Scotland's demographic challenge of an ageing population and a low birth rate. Conservatives argue that much of this could be addressed if more UK and non-UK nationals were attracted from other parts of the UK to live and work in Scotland. That net flow is taking place this century, reversing the flows last century. In the 50 years between 1951 and 2001, it is estimated that 399,000 more people left Scotland for other parts of the UK than the other way round, while a net 474,000 Scots left the UK. Since mid-2001, population flows from the rest of the UK have increased Scotland’s population by 137,000, while foreign inward migration boosted the population by 222,000. Short of independence and control of immigration policy, the argument is made by some for control over issuing visas for people to come to Scotland, which could be on condition they do not work in other parts of the UK. Such devolved systems operate in Australia and Canada.\n\nWhat about emigration?\n\nOne way of reducing net migration is to boost the number of people leaving the country. The data is not as robust, because not all emigrants declare at passport control that they are leaving for years or for ever. With more than half a million people leaving the UK last year, many were departing after their studies ended. The more who arrive, the more will leave, though there is the option of a graduate visa to work for up to two years in the UK. Last year, the number of UK citizens leaving for at least a year was estimated at 98,000. That has trended down since Brexit. The end to free movement in the European Union cut down the options for living elsewhere.\n\nWhat are the parties' responses?",
    "How can I pay off my debts and what help is available?": "How can I pay off my debts and what help is available?\n\n2 days ago By Kevin Peachey & Lucy Hooker , BBC News Share\n\nBBC\n\nTwo years of rising prices have left many people struggling to pay their bills and in debt. If you are in that position one option is to seek a debt relief order (DRO) which lets people who have got into severe difficulties start afresh. The maximum amount these can write off has increased from £30,000 to £50,000 from Thursday. It comes after the £90 application fee was scrapped in England and Wales in April. But there are other ways to tackle your debt. So what can you do if you find yourself in difficulty?\n\nWhat should I do if I'm struggling with debt?\n\nFirst, work out how much you owe, who to, and how much you need to pay each month, says the charity Citizens Advice. Next, create a budget by adding up your income, such as your wage and any benefits you receive, then taking away the amount you need for essential living costs like food and housing. The amount left is what you have available to pay your debts. Once you have taken stock of your situation, see whether you can reduce your outgoings: you may be eligible for a reduction in your council tax or a lower tariff on your broadband or TV package for example. You may also be able to boost your income. Check which benefits you are entitled to on the independent MoneyHelper website, backed by the government, or using benefits calculators run by Policy in Practice and charities Entitledto and Turn2us.\n\nWhere can I get free debt advice?\n\nIt is important to talk about your financial difficulties - the earlier, the better - or you may find yourself in a spiral of debt. If you think you cannot pay your debts or are feeling overwhelmed, seek support. Help is available. A trained debt adviser can talk you through the options available. Information and support is free of charge - here are some organisations who may be able to help.\n\nHow do I start paying off my debt?\n\nIdentify which bills and debts are most urgent and pay them first, says debt advice charity StepChange. That will include your rent or mortgage repayments, and any other loans secured on the home. It also includes gas and electricity bills, child support and maintenance payments, council tax, income tax, VAT and other taxes, TV licence payments, court fines and payments. These are all what are known as priority debts and bills, because there can be serious consequences if you do not pay them, such as losing your home or facing court proceedings. You may have additional debts, such as credit card and store card debts, pay-day loans, buy-now-pay-later payments, overdrafts, unsecured loans and water bills. If you do not pay these off, their cost can spiral and could lead to legal action or bailiffs seizing your property. StepChange advises trying to make the minimum payments on every debt to avoid default charges, which can affect your credit rating. After that pay most towards whichever debt has the highest borrowing cost or interest rate.\n\nWhat can I do about energy bill debt?\n\nYour energy supplier must give you a chance to clear your debt through a payment plan - that means you agree to pay off the outstanding amount you owe, but spread out in smaller amounts over a longer period. If you don't agree a plan they can switch you onto a pre-payment mode to make sure you do not fall further into arrears.\n\nWhat is a breathing space?\n\nPeople in England and Wales who are getting debt advice can apply for a break, lasting up to 60 days, as part of the \"breathing space\" scheme. It shields them from further interest and charges to prevent them falling into a spiral of debt.\n\nGetty Images\n\nIf you are receiving mental health crisis treatment you can also apply for a breathing space scheme which lasts for the length of your treatment, plus another 30 days. Consultation is under way for a similar scheme in Northern Ireland. In Scotland, an alternative short-term debt relief system is known as a Statutory Moratorium and lasts for six months.\n\nWhat if I can't afford to pay off my debts at all?\n\nIf you think there is no way to pay off your outstanding debts, you may have to consider some form of personal insolvency. This should only be done after seeking advice. Going through an insolvency process can have an impact on your personal and professional life, debt charities warn, and will affect your credit rating for up to six years.\n\nShould I apply for a debt relief order?",
    "Horizon expert 'pressurised' by Post Office over Misra evidence": "IT expert 'pressurised' by Post Office over evidence\n\n2 days ago By Tom Espiner , BBC business reporter Share\n\nAlamy Thursday was the third day the inquiry heard from Gareth Jenkins. He will conclude his oral evidence on Friday\n\nA Fujitsu software expert who helped build the Horizon system has said he felt pressurised by the Post Office over evidence he gave in the 2010 prosecution of sub-postmistress Seema Misra. Gareth Jenkins said the Post Office \"clearly\" wanted him to say that \"everything was perfect, and I don't think I actually said that\". However, in an email discussing the case at the time, he said Mrs Misra had \"jumped on the bandwagon\" in blaming Horizon for shortfalls in accounts. Mrs Misra told the BBC that this was an example of a culture that went \"right through the Post Office... [that] Horizon is perfect\".\n\nMrs Misra was one of hundreds of sub-postmasters and postmistresses prosecuted by the Post Office between 1999 and 2015 on the strength of faulty data from the Horizon accounting system. The technology made it look as though money was missing from Post Office branch accounts when it wasn't. At Mrs Misra's trial in 2010 she was accused of theft and false accounting. The sub-postmistress from West Byfleet, Surrey, was found guilty and sent to prison when she was eight weeks pregnant. Her conviction was quashed in 2021.\n\nMr Jenkins said he felt, prior to the prosecution, that he was being pressurised by the Post Office to make out that Horizon was \"perfect\" in commenting on a report written by an expert witness for the defence. He added that the management of Mrs Misra's case was \"fairly chaotic\", and that requests from the Post Office legal department had been unclear. Nevertheless, in an email discussing Mrs Misra's case in 2010, he wrote that Mrs Misra \"saw an article in [tech publication] Computer Weekly indicating that Horizon was unreliable and decided to jump on the bandwagon\". Mr Jenkins said this was \"totally inappropriate wording\" and apologised. Lead counsel for the inquiry Jason Beer asked Mr Jenkins whether he had been able to give evidence dispassionately, or had he been \"afflicted\" with the belief that sub-postmasters were jumping on the bandwagon in blaming Horizon for shortfalls. Mr Jenkins said that he didn't think Horizon was the problem, and that there were \"other reasons\" for shortfalls. Responding to Mr Jenkins' evidence, Mrs Misra said she felt that the former Fujitsu engineer's comments showed the culture in the Post Office at the time, which was that sub-postmasters were to blame for shortfalls, rather than Horizon being at fault.\n\nGuidance sought\n\nThe inquiry was also shown an email sent on 27 January 2010 where Mr Jenkins had read a report on a separate prosecution and wrote that Horizon data “probably needs some further investigation”. However, he said the decision to do so would be “highly political”. \"We don't really want to be seen to be undermining a Post Office prosecution!\" he wrote. Mr Jenkins said he wanted guidance from senior management on \"what exactly we should be doing\". Mr Beer asked: \"Why did you need guidance on whether or not Fujitsu should just present the facts irrespective of whether they supported or undermined a Post Office prosecution?\" Mr Jenkins replied: \"The guidance I got was to just tell the truth, which is what I would have liked to have done anyway.\" \"Did you need guidance from management on whether you should tell the truth or not?\" Mr Beer asked. Mr Jenkins said he would just tell the truth, but said he needed guidance from management on whether he was covered by management in this. Mr Beer asked: \"You needed top cover for telling the truth?\" Mr Jenkins responded: \"I don't know what to say to that.\" Mr Jenkins is being investigated by the Metropolitan Police for suspected perjury - lying to court.\n\n'I can't remember what I believed'",

    "Supreme Court rules against Jan 6 riot obstruction charges": "Experts say homelessness ruling will be costly Samantha Granville\n\nReporting from Los Angeles\n\nThe Supreme Court's Grants Pass decision does not end homelessness. It doesn't give a mandate on how cities and governments should handle the growing crisis - but it does now allow cities to take more severe measures without the fear of legal recourse.\n\n“Giving cities the full breadth of tools so that they can address this problem and all its complexities make sense,” says Elizabeth Funk, founder of DignityMoves, a nonprofit dedicated to ending unsheltered homelessness.\n\n“But a city who decides that they're going to put someone in jail because they are sleeping on the streets because they don't have another place to go? It's pretty nonsensical.”\n\nThe first problem with putting homeless people in jail is that it is extremely expensive, and when they get out, the person is still homeless and now even less apt to finding employment with a criminal record.\n\n“We're stacking the cards against them, if we criminalise them or if we fine them or put them in jail, and give them a record,” says Ms Funk.\n\n“We need to be thinking about how to get this problem solved. It's not going to be fining people for doing something they can't avoid. It's helping them.”\n\nResearch from Housing Matters, an Urban Institute initiative, shows that it costs taxpayers $31,065 a year to criminalise a single person suffering from homelessness, opposed to the yearly cost for providing supportive housing, at $10,051.\n\nCriminalising homelessness and pushing homeless people to other parts of an area will only make encampments grow.\n\nThese camps are usually set up in areas that are obscured by trees and brushes, and adding dry fuels like camp stoves could create an environmental crisis with more wildfires.",

    "Is this really the TikTok general election?": "Is this really the TikTok general election?\n\n12 hours ago By Brian Wheeler , Politics reporter Share\n\nBBC\n\nSnarky, silly and sometimes downright rude - TikTok has breathed new life into the political meme. But how much influence is it actually having on the general election? Nigel Farage is the unlikely breakout star of TikTok at this election, with a five second clip of him mouthing the words to an Eminem song - “guess who’s back?” - pulling in more than eight million views. The 60-year-old Reform UK leader was not previously known for his love of hip-hop - the clip was the brainchild of his young social media team. But other Farage-branded content is regularly outperforming material produced by his political rivals and his personal account has more than twice as many followers as Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats combined. The Reform UK account has fewer followers, and far fewer videos of Mr Farage playing up to the cameras, but with 197,000 followers is still more popular than the Tory offering.\n\nThe Tories’ best-performing clip was the first one they produced, entitled “this will change lives,” in which Rishi Sunak spends 50 seconds eagerly promoting his national service policy. This got a creditable 4.2m views. But Labour’s 11-second takedown of it got 5.1m views. This featured archive footage of showbiz legend Cilla Black belting out “Surprise, Surprise” with a caption that reads: “Rishi sunak turning up on your 18th birthday to send you to war” (the lower case S in Sunak presumably adding to the rough, authentic feel). It was a version of an existing TikTok meme - something Labour has been adept at doing, says Sam Jeffers, of Who Targets Me, which tracks political advertising. “Labour have people who are dripping in internet culture, the way they format videos, the way people talk. “It is so clear that they have got people who are just incredibly switched on.”\n\nAntler Social The parties shouldn't resort to 'playground bullying,' says Vic Banham\n\nVic Banham, CEO of TikTok ad agency Antler Social, was less impressed. “It makes me question their sincerity and what they are going to be like in government,” she says of Labour’s efforts, although she concedes “they are all as bad as each other”. “It feels like your dad getting on TikTok to get down with the kids. It feels like a strategy that is not authentic.” There is no doubt that brash, attention-grabbing clips get results, says Ms Banham, but she adds: “On TikTok there is a way to reach that younger audience without bringing that childish, playground bullying energy.” She says she would like to see manifesto policies explained in a jargon-free way by people “who look and feel like the people they are trying to reach”. The Lib Dems and Greens have played it straighter than the big two on TikTok, although the Lib Dems have spoofed the Simpsons and Spongebob Squarepants to attack the Tories. But like their larger rivals they have mainly relied on party leaders to deliver their core messages.\n\nThe Tories did use “ordinary people” to comment on the national service policy, but the universally glowing reviews in the clip raised unfounded suspicions in the comments that they were actors. TikTok does not accept paid political advertising, so it is a cheap way of reaching a large, youthful audience. But it is dwarfed by Facebook and YouTube when it comes to audience reach. More than 90% of online adults in the UK use Facebook and YouTube, according to Ofcom, compared with 48% for TikTok. For this and other reasons Sam Jeffers believes the hype about this being the first TikTok election is massively overblown. “’The TikTok battle’ is a narrative in this campaign that simply won’t die,” he says. “It’s filling space because the ‘AI election’ never showed up.”\n\nThe real battle is being played out on Facebook and YouTube, he argues, where the main parties are ramping up their spending as the campaign enters its final stretch. The Conservatives are spending most of their budget on Facebook, where they can use targeting tools to get their message out to core, older voters across the UK. Labour is also spending big on Facebook but unlike the Tories they are pumping money into YouTube and Google ads as well, targeting them at specific towns and cities. Some platforms, such as X, formerly known as Twitter, do not publish spending records so it's difficult to get the full picture. But according to Who Targets Me’s analysis of available social media ad libraries, £4.2m has been spent on election ads on Meta, which includes Facebook and Instagram, in the first month of the campaign. Meta ad spending doubled between 16 and 22 June, largely thanks to a significant increase in Tory spending, although they remain slightly behind Labour. Reform has also ramped up its Meta spending in the past week and started pouring money into Facebook ads in Nigel Farage’s name. Like the Green Party, Reform is concentrating its resources on far fewer seats than the bigger parties. Since the election was called the Greens have spent more than £39,000 on Meta adverts for their co-leader Carla Denyer in Bristol Central, but all the adverts began their run before the beginning of the regulated election spending period on 30 May. By contrast, her co-leader Adam Ramsay spent £932 on Meta ads in the same period. In Scotland, the SNP has largely eschewed TikTok and is being outspent by Scottish Labour on Meta. But it is a very different political landscape. One of the SNP's core messages is \"rejoin the EU\" - something that you would not hear from any party south of the border. Scottish Conservatives' advertising has focused a great deal on highlighting seats where they claim only they can beat the SNP. In Wales, since the start of campaigning, Labour have spent almost as much on the softer tone of adverts of their Wales’ Future brand (over £74,000) as with Welsh Labour (over £80,000) on Meta platforms. These sums are significantly more than their rivals - neither Plaid Cymru or Welsh Conservatives has spent more than £5,000 on their main accounts. Plaid’s advertising on Meta platforms has yet to exceed £1,000 for any single candidate.\n\nThe Tories' iconic 1979 election poster would almost certainly be a meme today",
    "Social media makes young people accidental election influencers": "How social media is making young people accidental election influencers\n\n1 day ago By Marianna Spring , Disinformation and social media correspondent Share\n\nBBC\n\nAt 15, Tolu isn’t old enough to vote in this election. But, one night from her bedroom in London, she posted a video on TikTok criticising politicians’ anti-immigration rhetoric. She woke up to find it had reached tens of thousands of people, more than many posts from the major political parties. “The post was blowing up really quickly,” she says. “I was shocked.” Miles away in Somerset, with political views on the other side of the spectrum, another 16-year-old, Will, was having a similar experience. He had shared clips of politicians he agrees with, highlighting concerns over knife crime and supporting Brexit, and discovered they were racking up hundreds of thousands of views. “I find it incredibly interesting that most of the time I’m the one who is breaking news to people and not the mainstream media,” Will tells me. Unlike Tolu, who posts her views from a personal account alongside takes on music and fashion, Will has created his own logo and posts exclusively about politics. These are just two of dozens of accidental influencers, with a range of political views, to have emerged this general election across the social media sites. Some of their amateur content is getting as much traction as the parties’ own posts - and more than some of their online ads. Plucked from obscurity by the social media sites’ algorithms and pushed into millions of people’s feeds, the accidental influencers’ content can reach an audience who are disengaged from mainstream political commentary.\n\nSeveral users I spoke to said they had been recommended content about Reform UK - such as this clip posted by Will\n\nTheir videos have appeared on the feeds of the younger characters among my Undercover Voters - 24 fictional people with private online profiles and no friends. I created them to investigate what content the algorithms are promoting during the election. About 90% of the political posts on the feeds of the Undercover Voters aged under 35 are not from the parties themselves but from fellow social media users sharing political content. Dozens of the accidental influencers I have identified - aged between 16 and 31 - have received on average about half a million views for each of their posts. Several have had close to a million views on individual videos - and collectively they have racked up more than 15 million. Giving young people a platform can encourage them to voice their opinions and take part in the democratic process - and lots of these profiles are sharing reliable updates and hot takes. But with great virality comes great responsibility - some other accounts like this have shared misleading claims, as well as finding themselves a target for threats and abuse.\n\nSome other viral accounts have shared misinformation, like this faked image of Sir Keir Starmer in a Palesintian flag T-shirt\n\nSeveral of the influencers say they have been told their posts have changed other people’s minds about whether to vote and who for. Some say they have felt encouraged to post the content they know will rack up the most likes, regardless of whether they believe in it. One even says she has been in contact with a political party about her content. Alex, 20, from West Yorkshire says he was encouraged to start posting election content after more UK political posts were pushed to his own feed. His social media feeds used to recommend videos about football, as well as influencer Andrew Tate - who is facing a trial in Romania over rape and trafficking charges. There was some political content in between too, he says, about former US President Donald Trump and some European right-wing politicians. But more recently, the political content has become dominated by posts about Reform UK, usually on the subject of immigration or opposing “wokeism”, he says. Reform UK content has also been recommended to other users who have very different interests to Alex. After Nigel Farage became leader of Reform UK, Alex says he was inspired to make political content on the same topics he had seen on his feed. “I have always liked him,” he says. Within days his posts were reaching tens of thousands of views - equal to many of those from official party accounts.\n\nMarianna Spring: Why am I tracking 24 phones this election?\n\nWhat happened to Alex, Tolu and Will is symptomatic of how social media sites have changed since the last general election. TikTok, Instagram and X all work by recommending content to users’ “For You” pages or feeds - often from people they don’t follow or know, allowing individuals to go viral instantly, without building up a big following first. This evolution means that paid political advertising on some social media sites, like Facebook or Instagram, is getting less attention than the content created by individual users and then promoted by the social media algorithms - including on apps like TikTok, where paid-for political ads are not allowed. Several of the social media users whose political content has gone unexpectedly viral also did not anticipate the hate, trolling and threats which followed. Tolu says she received racist abuse with graphic descriptions about slavery, while Alex says he has received messages threatening to release his home address and details about his family in response to his posts. The BBC is not using the online usernames of the people featured in this story to protect them from the risk of further abuse. While Alex was already sympathetic to Reform UK before its content was pushed into his feed, I spoke to several other users in their 20s - such as 28-year-old Pete who lives in West Yorkshire - who had shown no interest in Reform UK previously, but whose feeds had also become dominated by political content featuring Reform UK talking about immigration. I found the same on my fictional Undercover Voters’ feeds.\n\nHandout Pete says his feed has been dominated by Reform UK content, although he went viral with a post urging voters to consider the Green Party\n\nThomas, 30, from Lancashire, told me he had responded to the prominence of Reform UK content by uploading “a fair amount of old clips of Farage speaking in the EU, as it attracts views” even though they do not reflect his own opinions. While we know some reasons why certain content is likely to be promoted - such as whether it is on a topic already generating a lot of engagement - we don’t know exactly why and how social media algorithms choose what to push. On the accounts of my Undercover Voters, I have noticed the political content popping up does not always reflect trends in recent polling, which indicate young people leaning heavily towards Labour. As well as support for Reform UK, the feeds feature criticism of Labour from a left-wing perspective and also backing for the Green Party.\n\nThese viral posts were pushed to our young Undercover Voter profiles in six battleground constituencies\n\nWhile most of these accidental influencer profiles I have spotted have no political affiliations, 21-year-old Kate who runs a left-leaning political account does tell me she has been in contact with the Labour Party about her profile. But she says she is not paid and the party has no control over what she posts. This is the first general election she can vote in, but she has been posting about politics for several years. She says she has racked up 2.1 million likes and more than 18 million views - more than most of the parties’ official TikToks. “In the past, I’ve had people comment they didn’t know something I’ve included and now they wouldn’t vote Tory,” she tells me. The ability to influence other voters, though, comes with risk. Unlike media outlets, which are subject to regulation, there is little oversight of these posts which can reach millions of people.\n\nPosts from the real accidental influencers were spotted on the feeds of our seven fictional Undercover Voter profiles aged under 35\n\nSome of the other profiles which have gone unexpectedly viral have shared misleading posts mixed in with reliable updates and opinions. One posted a doctored image falsely suggesting Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer wore a white T-shirt with the Palestinian flag to watch an England match in Euro 2024, calling him a traitor and provoking abusive comments. Another shared a conspiracy theory falsely suggesting that a milkshake thrown at Nigel Farage while he was out campaigning had actually been staged by his own political party. Other accidental influencer profiles have used graphics of real polls to make misleading predictions about the election outcome - and some have posted incorrect claims about the positions of different political parties on issues such as immigration and Brexit. Georgina, 18, a student in Edinburgh, says it was “quite overwhelming” when her post urging young people to vote Labour, not Green, and giving her opinion that Sir Keir could be replaced as leader after the election, racked up 100,000 views. She thinks many people - like her - are not prepared for going viral during an election campaign. “If you post with the idea that your post could be seen by millions, then you’d probably be a lot more careful about what you’re saying,” she says. “I was concerned that maybe I didn’t provide enough context and official information.”\n\nGeorgina said she wished she had added more context to her post suggesting Sir Keir Starmer could be replaced as Labour leader\n\nSome of these accidental influencers tell me they are putting lots of effort into researching their own posts and ensuring they are accurate. Several also say, though, that they are finding it hard to work out what to share, because they are unsure what to trust on their own feeds. They say opinions can sound like facts and several tell me they have seen a lot of AI-generated content about the election - predominantly parody clips. That includes faked satirical clips that purport to show Sir Keir Starmer, Rishi Sunak and Nigel Farage “live streaming” the video game Minecraft. Other altered images the influencers have come across include a faked image of Rishi Sunak at a Morrisons supermarket made to look like the sign behind him reads “moron”, with his head obscuring part of the brand name. Several people told me that while some of these fakes are obvious, there are others that “blur the line between fact and fiction”.\n\nParody videos of leaders such as Rishi Sunak live-streaming Minecraft were among the AI fakes seen by these influencers",
    "Bradford: 'Sport putting children off physical activity'": "Sport 'not the only answer' to childhood obesity\n\n1 day ago By Adam Laver , BBC News Share\n\nGetty Images Organised sport can be a barrier to improving children's health, a Bradford expert said\n\nAn academic at the University of Bradford has said that a focus on sport is not helping children become more physically active. Dr Andrew Daly-Smith said sport is seen as a \"barrier\" to moving more by children who do not enjoy taking part. The child health expert has worked with 50 schools in the city to identify the reasons for pupils' inactivity and rates of obesity. Bradford Council figures suggest that one in five children in reception classes are overweight, and one in three primary school leavers.\n\n'Good choices'\n\nDr Daly-Smith told the BBC that he wanted to see more emphasis on general lifestyle changes rather than children being encouraged to join sports clubs. He said headteachers had told him that team sports were not always effective in helping pupils to enjoy exercise. “While establishing healthy nutrition in schools is a priority to lower levels of obesity, there is also a need for schools to help children move more,\" said Dr Daly-Smith. “Sadly, the persistence of governments to focus on sport is turning many children and young people off being physically active. \"It's not about joining a sports club, it's more about ensuring physical movement and good lifestyle choices - like a healthy diet - are built into the school day.\" He said alternative ways of getting children active could involve incorporating movement into classroom learning. He suggested that teachers encouraged pupils to explore their school grounds and write a story about what they had found, or used games of hopscotch to teach times tables. Dr Daly-Smith's comments followed Bradford Council's campaign to collect data from parents on what their children eat in an attempt to tackle the city's obesity problem. Head of public health Tim Howells said: \"In a cost of living crisis, people are more likely to access cheaper foods, which are generally less healthy. \"Their choices are being decided for them based on what's available.\"\n\n'Unacceptable'\n\nSobering statistics about health inequalities in Bradford were discussed at the university's Whole-School Physical Activity conference earlier in June. Professor Mark Mon-Williams from the University of Leeds told delegates that babies born in inner-city neighbourhoods close to Bradford Royal Infirmary were likely to die 10 years sooner than those from rural Wharfedale. He added: “All the data shows children born into poorer families are 13 times more likely to have poorer health outcomes by the age of 70. \"It is absolutely imperative we start to support young people and change the systems to enable them to live healthy and prosperous lives.\" Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram.

To its supporters, the whistleblowing website is a key player in exposing secrets governments and companies would rather keep hidden. But to those who found their documents exposed on the web, it is a dangerous and reckless force. The US government has argued that the publication of the Wikileaks files - which disclosed information about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars - went as far as endangering lives. Here are a few of the leaks which went on to make headlines around the world.\n\nThe helicopter attack\n\nWikileaks Helicopter footage was posted on Wikileaks\n\nIn 2010, Wikileaks published a video from a US military helicopter showing the killing of civilians in Baghdad, Iraq. A voice on the transmission urged the pilots to \"light 'em all up\" and the individuals on the street were fired at from the helicopter. When a van arrived on the scene to pick up the wounded, it too was fired at. Reuters photographer Namir Noor-Eldeen and his assistant Saeed Chmagh were both killed in the attack.\n\nUS Army Intelligence\n\nWikileaks has published hundreds of thousands of documents leaked by former US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. Documents relating to the war in Afghanistan revealed how the US military had killed hundreds of civilians in unreported incidents.\n\nAFP\n\nFurther documents from the Iraq war revealed that 66,000 civilians had been killed - more than previously reported. The documents also showed that prisoners had been tortured by Iraqi forces. Among the leaks were more than 250,000 messages sent by US diplomats. They revealed that the US wanted to collect \"biographic and biometric\" information - including iris scans, DNA samples and fingerprints - of key officials at the UN.\n\n9/11 pager messages\n\nAbout 573,000 intercepted pager messages sent during the 9/11 terror attacks in the United States were published by Wikileaks. The messages include families checking up on their loved ones and government departments reacting to the attacks. \"President has been rerouted won't be returning to Washington but not sure where he will go,\" one message said.\n\nDemocrat emails\n\nWikileaks published thousands of hacked emails from the account of Hillary Clinton's campaign boss John Podesta, in the run-up to the US presidential election in 2016. In the emails, Mr Podesta called Mrs Clinton's election rival Bernie Sanders a \"doofus\" for criticising the Paris climate change agreement.\n\nAFP\n\nThe emails also suggested that a CNN contributor tipped off the Clinton campaign about a question that was going to be asked during a debate hosted by the broadcaster. The timing of the leaks led to accusations that Wikileaks was deliberately trying to discredit Mrs Clinton.\n\nThe site also published leaked information from Republican Sarah Palin's Yahoo email accounts in 2008.\n\nBritish National Party members\n\nIn 2008, Wikileaks published the names, addresses and contact information of more than 13,000 members of the British National Party. The political party's manifesto proposed banning immigration from Muslim countries and encouraging some UK residents to return to \"their lands of ethnic origin\".\n\nPA Nick Griffin, pictured in 2006\n\nA former member was later fined £200 for the leak.\n\nThe Sony Pictures hack",
    "Apple in breach of law on App Store, says EU": "Apple in breach of law on App Store, says EU\n\n5 days ago By Imran Rahman-Jones , Technology reporter Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nEuropean Union regulators have accused Apple of being in breach of new laws designed to rein in big tech companies. The European Commission, which regulates competition in the EU, said Apple's App Store squeezes out rival marketplaces, marking the first time it has found a company in breach of the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The firm faces a potential fine of up to 10% of its global revenue if it fails to comply with the rules. Apple said it is \"confident our plan complies with the law\".\n\nThe tech giant has been given the opportunity to review the investigation's preliminary findings, and it can avoid a monster fine if it comes back with a proposal which is satisfactory to the EU. The European Commission says that developers should be able to freely tell customers when there are cheaper app stores available beyond the one run by Apple. The firm charges developers an average of 30% commission on its App Store. Previously, it was told to allow alternatives in the EU in March. \"We have reason to believe that the App Store rules not allowing app developers to communicate freely with their own users is in breach of the DMA,\" said EU Commissioner Thierry Breton. The Commission also alleges that Apple's fees \"go beyond what is strictly necessary\".\n\nIn response, Apple said it has made changes in the past few months to ensure it complies with the DMA. \"We estimate more than 99% of developers would pay the same or less in fees to Apple under the new business terms we created,\" it said in a statement. \"All developers doing business in the EU on the App Store have the opportunity to utilize the capabilities that we have introduced, including the ability to direct app users to the web to complete purchases at a very competitive rate.\" Another of Apple's main arguments is that users benefit from strong security measures by sticking to the official App Store. In response, the Commission says it will happily discuss security issues.\n\nNew terms",

    "TikTok confirms it offered US government a 'kill switch'": "TikTok confirms it offered US government a 'kill switch'\n\n21 June 2024 By Imran Rahman-Jones , Technology reporter Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nTikTok says it offered the US government the power to shut the platform down in an attempt to address lawmakers' data protection and national security concerns. It disclosed the \"kill switch\" offer, which it made in 2022, as it began its legal fight against legislation that will ban the app in America unless Chinese parent company ByteDance sells it. The law has been introduced because of concerns TikTok might share US user data with the Chinese government - claims it and ByteDance have always denied. TikTok and ByteDance are urging the courts to strike the legislation down. \"This law is a radical departure from this country’s tradition of championing an open Internet, and sets a dangerous precedent allowing the political branches to target a disfavored speech platform and force it to sell or be shut down,\" they argued in their legal submission.\n\nThey also claimed the US government refused to engage in any serious settlement talks after 2022, and pointed to the \"kill switch\" offer as evidence of the lengths they had been prepared to go. TikTok says the mechanism would have allowed the government the \"explicit authority to suspend the platform in the United States at the US government's sole discretion\" if it did not follow certain rules. A draft \"National Security Agreement\", proposed by TikTok in August 2022, would have seen the company having to follow rules such as properly funding its data protection units and making sure that ByteDance did not have access to US users' data. The \"kill switch\" could have been triggered by the government if it broke this agreement, it claimed. In a letter - first reported by the Washington Post - addressed to the US Department of Justice, TikTok's lawyer alleges that the government \"ceased any substantive negotiations\" after the proposal of the new rules. The letter, dated 1 April 2024, says the US government ignored requests to meet for further negotiations. It also alleges the government did not respond to TikTok's invitation to \"visit and inspect its Dedicated Transparency Center in Maryland\".\n\nThe US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia will hold oral arguments on lawsuits filed by TikTok and ByteDance, along with TikTok users, in September. Legislation signed in April by President Joe Biden gives ByteDance until January next year to divest TikTok's US assets or face a ban. It was born of concerns that data belonging to the platform's 170 million US users could be passed on to the Chinese government. TikTok denies that it shares foreign users' data with China and called the legislation an \"unconstitutional ban\" and affront to the US right to free speech. It insists that US data does not leave the country, and is overseen by American company Oracle, in a deal which is called Project Texas. However, a Wall Street Journal investigation in January 2024 found that some data was still being shared between TikTok in the US and ByteDance in China.",

The firm's internet safety boss, Marnie Wilking, said there had been \"anywhere from a 500 to a 900% increase\" in the past 18 months.

    "Joey Barton to pay an extra £35,000 to Jeremy Vine": "Joey Barton to pay an extra £35,000 to Jeremy Vine\n\n19 June 2024 By Mark Savage , Entertainment correspondent Share\n\nPA Media Joey Barton has apologised for his statements\n\nJoey Barton will pay a further £35,000 in damages to settle a libel claim with Jeremy Vine, the broadcaster's solicitors have confirmed. The Radio 2 presenter sued Mr Barton earlier this year, after the former footballer wrote a series of posts suggesting Mr Vine had a sexual interest in children. In May, the High Court ruled that Mr Barton's posts were defamatory. On Tuesday, the sportsman apologised and agreed to pay £75,000 in damages and legal costs. But Mr Vine later said the payment was \"not the final outcome\" of the case. In a statement, his lawyers said Mr Barton would pay a further £35,000 for posts published after Mr Vine took legal action.\n\n\"Mr Barton responded to being served with Mr Vine's claim by making additional damaging and untrue publications about Mr Vine and his legal complaints,\" wrote Judith Thompson of Samuels Solicitors. These statements \"gave rise to additional claims for defamation, harassment and invasion of privacy\" which were not covered by the first settlement. \"Mr Vine is pleased that his claims have been resolved and that he has been vindicated in respect of Mr Barton's appalling allegations and conduct,\" she added. As part of the settlement, Mr Barton \"is also required to participate in a statement in Open Court, in which he will make a comprehensive formal apology\" for his actions and \"give undertakings\" not to repeat them. The BBC has approached Mr Barton's lawyers for comment, but is yet to receive a response.\n\nWarning: the next section of this article contains strong language.\n\nLawyers acting for Mr Vine said the abuse began last year after Mr Barton called the female football pundits Eni Aluko and Lucy Ward “the Fred and Rose West of football commentary”, referring to the British serial killers. This led to a series of posts criticising women involved in football and football punditry, after which Mr Vine asked: \"Are we dealing with a brain injury here?\" In response, Mr Barton - who was manager of Bristol Rovers until October last year - began what lawyers characterised as a \"calculated and sustained attack\" on the broadcaster. In a series of tweets, he called Mr Vine a “weasel” and a “government shill” and said: “If you see this fella by a primary school call 999.” He went on to call him a \"big bike nonce\" and a \"pedo defender\". Mr Barton's barrister said the posts contained \"vulgar abuse\" written by \"someone who is posting in the heat of the moment\" but denied libel. In May, however, a high court judge ruled that the comments were defamatory. In her judgment, Mrs Justice Steyn wrote: \"While I do not consider that the hypothetical reader, who would read the post quickly and move on, would infer a causative link, i.e. that the claimant defends paedophiles because he shares the same propensity, the juxtaposition of the words 'nonce' and 'pedo' is striking and would reinforce the impression that the former was used in the sense of 'paedophile'.\"\n\nPA Media Jeremy Vine said he was vindicated by the court's decision",
    "Glastonbury 2024: Seventeen bring K-pop party to Pyramid Stage": "K-pop boy band Seventeen make Glastonbury history\n\n22 hours ago By Mark Savage , Music Correspondent Share\n\nBBC Only Taylor Swift sold more records around the world than Seventeen last year\n\nBoy band behemoth Seventeen have made history at the Glastonbury Festival, by becoming the first K-pop group to play the main Pyramid Stage. Pouring onto the stage on Friday afternoon, the 13-piece group delivered an hour of precision choreography and sticky pop melodies to an audience of diehard fans and curious onlookers. \"We are just extremely honoured to be here,\" they said. \"Even though the language, country and culture are all different, we can still connect as one, through music.\"\n\nThe band, who typically play Taylor Swift-length three hour shows, delivered a compact and energetic 60-minute set\n\nSeventeen were the biggest-selling group in the world last year, shifting more than 10 million albums – but they only scored their first Top 40 single in the UK last month. Mindful of that, they put together a setlist that focused on their most immediate and accessible songs. They opened with their big hit, Maestro, which mixes honeyed vocals and fast-paced rapping with choppy piano riffs and unexpected rhythmical switch-ups. It's one of their most ambitious tracks - but it was the songs with guitar riffs and easily-chanted English lyrics that fared best - among them, the rap-heavy track Lalali, the rocky 2 Minus 1, and the sinagalong anthem Hot.\n\n\"Have you heard of Seventeen before,\" asked band leader S Coups at one point. \"So many members, right?\" The clever staging allowed all 13 members to shine. The group splits into smaller \"sub-units\" based on their rap, vocal and dancing prowess – with each given a solo spot. Seungkwan and band leader S Coups were the most exuberant, riling up the crowd during and between songs, while Woozi’s airy vocals were juxtaposed with Vernon and Joshua’s more soulful tones.\n\nThe audience grew continually throughout the band's one-hour set\n\nEven so, the Glastonbury audience seemed sceptical at first. The field in front of the Pyramid Stage cleared out after packed sets by Squeeze and Olivia Dean earlier in the day, and there were large patches of empty space as Seventeen launched into their first track, Maestro. But over the course of an hour, doubts were dispelled as the band worked hard to get the audience on side – racing onto the wings of the stage, and descending into the crowd to whip up enthusiasm. It culminated with the brilliantly daft disco-dance anthem Very Nice – which had half a dozen of false endings, the energy building every time the group launched back into another chorus. The show was a sign of K-pop’s growing chart dominance. Four of the top 10 best-selling acts in the world last year hailed from South Korea, with Seventeen joined by Stray Kids, TomorrowxTomorrow and NewJeans. In fact, Glastonbury is relatively late to the party. Boy band BTS played two shows at Wembley Stadium in 2019, while girl group Blackpink headlined both Coachella and London’s BST festival last year. Seeing a K-pop band on the Pyramid Stage was \"so unexpected but really, really brilliant\", said Australian fan Milia, who came in a custom football T-shirt bearing the name of Seventeen heartthrob Hoshi. \"These acts are touring globally and it’s really amazing to see Glastonbury actually putting them on. You can see by the crowd, there’s a lot of people here – whether they’re fans or they’re just looking for something different. We should see more of it.\"\n\nThe band utilised every inch of the Pyramid Stage\n\n\"K-Pop coming to the UK is the way to go,\" agreed Ami, who’d been in the front row with her daughter Molly. \"I’ve been working at Glastonbury for 22 years, we’ve got a Thai food stall, and I’ve never stepped foot near the Pyramid Stage,\" she added. \"This is our first time, and I loved it. \"They’re just so handsome, aren’t they? They’re so fit!\" \"Did you notice that one of the members came down and cheered with the audience?\" said London-based fan Qi. \"That was Seungkwan, who’s our bias. \"It's not like they were nervous or trying to behave themselves. They were so relaxed, they were energetic and they were confident, just like always. That's why we love them.\" The band certainly seemed relaxed, despite the significance of the moment – occasionally breaking out of their precision-tooled choreography to interact with fans and throw heart signs into the air. \"Thank you so much for inviting us,\" said Joshua. \"We’re Seventeen. Remember that.\" Their fans will never forget.\n\nSetlist\n\nThe band will be followed on stage by PJ Harvey, LCD Soundsystem and Dua Lipa",

    "Mean Girls: Tina Fey's musical is pretty fetch, West End critics say": "Critics say Mean Girls musical is pretty fetch\n\n1 day ago By Yasmin Rufo , @YasminRufo, Culture reporter Share\n\nBrinkhoff-Moegenburg The musical has transferred to London from Broadway\n\nIn the 2004 film Mean Girls, Regina George - queen of the Plastics - told her fellow clique member Gretchen: \"Stop trying to make fetch happen.\" Two decades on, it seems writer Tina Fey has made fetch happen with her West End musical adaptation. The Telegraph said the show has \"a rare combination of warmth, goofiness, snarky wit and perceptiveness\" in a four-star review. \"This snarky adaptation never allows a dull minute, even if its general thrust is cosily predictable,\" wrote Dominic Cavendish. Another four-star review from the i newspaper called the show a \"whooping hit\" filled with \"a riot of peppy, poppy songs\". The show first debuted on Broadway in 2018 and was met with a lukewarm response from the New York critics, but did receive 12 Tony Award nominations. Now with with a bit of tweaking, it has arrived in London. While the premise of the musical remains true to the original film - in which “fetch” is slang for cool - the jokes and language have had a Gen Z update: Jesus is referred to as a \"nepo baby\", the girls are \"slaying\", and social media filters are all the rage.\n\nGetty Images Tina Fey and husband Jeff Richmond worked on the stage show together\n\nSpeaking to the BBC at the premiere, Fey said she the show needed updating from the 2004 film because \"the way teens speak and interact with each other is different\". \"I have two teenage daughters and I wanted to make sure this new version rings true for them,\" she said. Husband Jeff Richmond, who composed the songs for the musical, added that teenagers nowadays \"are smarter, bright and a lot more aware about what is going on in society\". Fey said she is most proud \"of having created five female leads that are so distinctively different\".\n\nA three-star review from The Times praised actress Georgina Castle, who plays Regina - the long-legged, super blonde queen bee who rules over her ruthlessly materialistic brood, the Plastics. Critic Clive Davis said Castle was \"convincingly steely\", but \"best of all is Tom Xander’s camp outsider, Damian, who worships at the shrine of George Michael and launches cheerful barbs in all directions\". Xander told the BBC the updated musical \"shows society as a lot more accepting\". \"Playing an openly gay character - I don't think that when I was a teenager it would have been widely accepted, but now it is and that's something we should be really proud of.\" The Guardian commended Xander and co-star Elena Skye, who plays his art-freak companion Janis. Chris Wiegand said they \"make a charming double act and Skye is superb singing the bird-flipping anthem I’d Rather Be Me\". However, Wiegand's three-star review said that despite the \"high-grade performances, the songs and production don’t get quite enough As\". He added that the musical doesn't have \"one killer tune\" and some of the \"bland songs result in a sometimes flat production. Adam Bloodworth from City AM disagreed, saying Nell Benjamin’s \"pumping musical score neatly translates the sassy characters’ stories\". His four-star review said: \"Instant ear worms include My Name Is Regina George, and Revenge Party, two of a gamut of well constructed pop bangers.\"\n\nBrinkhoff-Moegenburg Critics called Georgina Castle, who plays Regina George, a \"formidable threat\"",
    "Glastonbury: Dua Lipa to 'throw a party' on the Pyramid Stage": "Glastonbury gears up for Dua Lipa's headline set\n\n1 day ago By Mark Savage , Music Correspondent Share\n\nGetty Images Dua Lipa last played Glastonbury in 2017, before the release of her breakout single New Rules\n\nAfter two days of build-up, Glastonbury Festival kicked into gear on Friday, the first full day of music on the main stages. Veteran band Squeeze kicked off proceedings on the Pyramid Stage at midday, racing through hits like Hourglass, Up The Junction and Pulling Mussels. \"This is what Glastonbury's all about - smiling faces,\" declared frontman Glenn Tillbrook. Pop star Dua Lipa is the opening night headliner, and is expected to play disco-pop anthems like New Rules, Don’t Start Now, One Kiss, Levitating and Houdini. “I’ve got to figure out a way to make 150,000 people feel like they’re in a small little nightclub,” she told the BBC earlier this year. “That’s the goal, and if there’s one place to do it, it’s got to be Glasto.”\n\nPA Media Fans gathered to watch Squeeze kick off the action on the Pyramid Stage\n\nThe star has been rehearsing her set in Birmingham all week, following warm-up shows earlier this month in Croatia, Germany and France. The rehearsals were briefly interrupted by a TikTok influencer who broke in and tried to film the star, according to The Sun. However, they were intercepted before they made it into the studio. Genuine behind-the-scenes footage was posted last month by Lipa's friend and fashion designer Guiliano Calza, who shared a snippet of her athletic dance breakdown during Houdini on Instagram. The show will also include “incredible surprises and some unexpected moments”, said Lipa’s record label boss, Max Lousada. “She’s just going to bring the party to Friday night,” he told Variety magazine. For the first time ever, the star's Glastonbury performance will be broadcast outside the UK, via a livestream on BBC.com.\n\n'Time to wake up!'\n\nGetty Images DJ Annie Mac worked the crowd on the Other Stage\n\nThe main stages opened for business on Friday morning, with Peru's Sofia Kourtesis up first in the West Holts arena. Pirouetting around the stage in a flowing white dress, she warmed up the crowd with a sun-shiny blast of tropical house at 11.00 BST. \"This is such a big dream for somebody from South America,\" she told the audience. \"I am very lucky to have all of you supporting me.\" Shortly afterwards, Brazilian environmentalist Chief Raoni opened the Other Stage - the festival's second-biggest arena - with an impassioned speech about the Amazon rainforest. \"Politicians are constantly attacking our land,\" he said, speaking through a translator. \"They want to destroy everything. We have to stop them. I need your help.\" He was followed by DJ Annie Mac with a set of uplifting dance anthems, including That's How The Good Lord Works, Everybody's Free and a bass-heavy remix of Hall & Oates I Can't Go For That (No Can Do). \"Time to wake up the campsites!\" she laughed.\n\nGetty Images Indonesian all-female Muslim metal band Voice of Baceprot were the first act in the Woodsies tent\n\nOther headliners across the weekend include Coldplay, SZA and country star Shania Twain, who says she wants to “ride a horse to the stage” when she plays on Sunday. However, festival organiser Emily Eavis said she’d previously turned down that exact request. “It's unfair on the horse because it’s so busy,” she said, without confirming who had demanded an equine entrance.\n\nGetty Images Shania Twain follows in the footsteps of Kylie, Dolly Parton and Lionel Richie by playing Glastonbury's legend slot\n\nGlastonbury is the UK’s biggest festival, with more than 100 stages catering to 200,000 fans over the course of the weekend. Early birds were treated to a spectacular drone display on Wednesday night, while Thursday saw music begin on the outer stages - with DJ sets by The Orb, MJ Cole, Kurupt FM and Skream. The festival's co-founder, Sir Michael Eavis, also made an appearance on The Park Stage, singing covers of Frank Sinatra's My Way and Elvis Presley’s Suspicious Minds. The 88-year-old, who performed from a wheelchair, received a warm reception from the crowd, who chanted \"we love you Michael\" between songs. \"Thank you very much,\" he responded. \"That's fantastic, thank you.\"\n\nSir Michael Eavis makes his first appearance at Glastonbury 2024\n\nAs well as music, ticketholders can enjoy poetry, comedy, circus acts, and even pottery throwing. Health guru Joe Wicks launched The Park Stage at 10.00 on Friday with a morning workout; while BBC Radio 3 presenter Georgia Mann eased festivalgoers into the day with a classical DJ set in the Crow’s Nest. Speaking beforehand, she said: “We want to take classical music out of its box. And we want to show everybody that this music doesn't need to be kept in a very solemn concert hall. \"It can absolutely stand on its own alongside reggae and rock and pop.”\n\nShortly after lunchtime, Seventeen will become the first K-pop band to play the Pyramid Stage, joining a bill that also includes Paul Heaton and LCD Soundsystem. “There's a great sense of responsibility,” said Seventeen band leader S Coups. “We’ll keep coming back to that feeling and do our best to prepare, so that we can blow everybody away... Not just our fans, but every other member of the audience.”\n\nFans who arrived on Wednesday were treated to a spectacular drone show\n\nPerformance artist Marina Abramovic will also hold a seven-minute silence for peace on the Pyramid Stage, shortly before PJ Harvey’s set at 18:00. “We’ve been working on this for a while,” said organiser Emily Eavis, without giving away too many details. “She’s going to speak from the Pyramid and then she’s got a plan… which I’ll leave to her to describe,” she told BBC 6 Music. This year marks the first time in Glastonbury’s history that the festival will have two female performers at the top of the bill. Eavis said achieving gender balance across the line-up was a “huge passion project” – adding that she was particularly proud of giving Dua Lipa her first UK headline slot. “We’re creating a moment for her. And that's really as exciting as anything.”\n\nDua Lipa on stage in 2017",

The refurbishment of Beckford’s Tower in Bath was originally just for essential repair works but it was extended to reimagine the museum and excavate a hidden grotto, that had been underground for more than 100 years. Senior curator at Bath Preservation Trust, Dr Amy Frost said it was important to clearly explain William Beckford's connection to the slave trade. The project, which has also seen new energy sources installed, was funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund among others.\n\nCasper Farrell A grotto has been restored as part of the works\n\nDr Frost said: “The creation of Beckford’s Tower and the collection within it was all underpinned by the exploitation and suffering of thousands of enslaved people. “It has been vital that we work with others to tell this story as openly and accurately as possible.\" The new museum will have displays showcasing pieces from Beckford's varied collections, including furniture, cutlery and fine art. The project also aims to bring the story of Beckford's \"complex and controversial\" life to a wider audience.\n\nAmy Frost pictured in the museum Dr Frost said there is a \"brutality\" behind William Beckford's buildings\n\nHis wealth came from his ownership of sugar plantations in Jamaica and the transatlantic trafficking of enslaved people. \"It's a very complex story,\" added Dr Frost. \"William Beckford built beautiful buildings, created a beautiful collection. \"But there is a brutality behind all of that beauty because all of the funds that paid for it came from the transatlantic trafficking of enslaved African people. \"And that's fundamental to the story that we tell at the museum.\"\n\nCasper Farrell The tower has also been connected to its surroundings with new footpaths\n\nThe new exhibition spaces will explore the themes of wealth and power, exploitation and abuse. Patrizia Ribul, the director of museums at Bath Preservation Trust, said the newly excavated grotto will redefine people’s experience while touring the destination. “The grotto in particular forms a really intriguing part of the visitor experience, expanding the visitor route far beyond the previous climb up the tower. “People will be able to book behind-the-scenes tours up the architecturally iconic staircase to the tiny golden lantern at the top of the tower, with extraordinary views over Bath,” she added. The refurbishment included making a step-free accessible space in the tower’s vault, conservation works to remove the building from the Heritage At Risk register, restoration of lost design elements and building the tower's connection to its wider landscape with footpaths. Ms Ribul went on to thank the National Lottery Heritage Fund, Historic England, Bath Preservation Fund and group funders for financing the restoration. The tower will be open on weekends and bank holiday Mondays from 29 June to 31 October, before switching to weekends only from 1 November.\n\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

    "Bristol City Council under fire for art collection worth £134m": "Council under fire for £134m art collection\n\n5 hours ago By Adam Postans , Local Democracy Reporting Service Share\n\nbbc One of the five Banksy pieces that the city council owns is The Grim Reaper, which is on display at M Shed\n\nA council has come under fire after new figures revealed it owns £134m worth of art - yet almost 90% of the collection is not on display. Campaigners have criticised the value of the collection, owned by Bristol City Council, which is believed to be the third highest for any local authority in the country. Pressure group the TaxPayers' Alliance is urging the authority to sell some of the collection to help balance its books. The council said Bristol museums' collection is a \"vital part of the city's cultural and educational offer\", adding that there are \"ethical principles and standards of practice\" it must follow.\n\nThe council owns nearly 38,000 works of art, including five by Bristol street artist Banksy, with each worth an average of more than £3,500. But only 4,245 pieces - 11.2% - are on public display, said the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\n\nBANKSY The council owns The Empty Plinth t-shirt by Banksy, also on display at the M Shed\n\nIn February, councillors approved City Hall's annual budget which contained £39.3m of cuts over the next five years, including £24m for 2024/25, after finance officers warned that the authority faces a peak funding shortfall of £32.2m in the period up to 2028/9. The number of art items and proportion on public display was revealed in a response to the TaxPayers' Alliances' Freedom Of Information request, which it sent to all 397 councils and resulted in a report by the organisation in May called 'Wasting Monet?'. Bristol City Council withheld the total value of the collection but this is included in its own annual draft accounts, published earlier this month. This meant it was not included in a table in the report naming the UK's top 10 local authorities who own the most expensive amount of artwork. If it had, the city council would have been third, behind Manchester's £384m and Southampton with £190m - but ahead of fourth-placed Leeds which has a £110m art collection.\n\n'Record-busting tax hikes'\n\nThe average local authority collection's is worth £8.7m, of which only 28% is on public display, with Bristol's collection valued far higher and its proportion on show much lower. The Taxpayers' Alliance said that despite being in nearly £100bn of combined debt, UK councils had built up art collections worth almost £1.5bn. Report author Jonathan Eida said: “These findings won’t paint a pretty picture for hard-pressed taxpayers who have been hammered year after year by record-busting council tax hikes.\" Bristol's collection of 37,983 works of art is nearly 15 times bigger than the National Gallery's and six times that for the average council. A Bristol City Council spokesperson said: “Bristol museums’ collection is a vital part of the city’s cultural and educational offer, with a value that extends beyond an insurers’ estimate. “Although some may call for cultural assets to be sold off, there are ethical principles and standards of practice that museums are expected to uphold and promote, which include how collections are treated and the sale of items for financial purposes.\"\n\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "'Why I'm photographing every London Chinese takeaway'": "'Why I'm photographing every London Chinese takeaway'\n\n7 hours ago By Tim Stokes , BBC News Share\n\nHarriet Armstrong Harriet Armstrong's project has taken her across London, including to this takeaway in Wood Green\n\nGazing out of a bus window as she travelled through east London one rainswept evening, Harriet Armstrong was struck by a flash of inspiration. \"There's a Chinese takeaway in Leyton called Good Friend and I peered in through the window and there were just people sitting there waiting for their food. \"And I just had this pang of nostalgia,\" she says. Chinese takeaways played a central role in Armstrong's upbringing in Portsmouth, then later in London, with both her family and many of her relatives owning such establishments. The British-born Chinese artist says that while she faced \"a lot of struggles in a naval city\", with her family having \"fireworks being thrown through our letterbox and things like that\", seeing the inviting glow of the Good Friend in the rain swelled deeper memories within her that night.\n\nHarriet Armstrong Armstrong works as a medical photographer with the NHS by trade\n\n\"I just had that intense feeling of being taken right back to when I was seven years old, just hearing the woks going. \"In a Chinese takeaway kids aren't trusted with anything else other than putting the lids on the boxes and the food's burning hot, and just all those memories came flooding back in that moment,\" she says. The following night the 49-year-old returned to Leyton but this time with her camera, and she started taking pictures of the outside of the takeaway, along with other Chinese eateries in the area. These evening journeys have since spread further around London from her base in Walthamstow, each night plotted in advance to take in as many establishments as possible in a certain area. The images are then documented on Instagram under the pseudonym Jing Soeng, meaning \"to take a photograph\" in Cantonese. \"It's got really addictive actually,\" she laughs. \"My step-count's got pretty high.\"\n\nGetty Images London's first Chinatown developed where Chinese communities settled in Limehouse\n\nNoodle shops were initially developed by Chinese communities around some UK ports around the early 1900s, but over the decades the number of Chinese eateries increased, before booming in the years after World War Two to become ever-present on streets across the country. As the number of establishments rose so did the dishes they served develop, with chips and curry sauce mingling with chow mein and crispy duck to appeal to British palates - much to the disgust of TikTok in recent years. But it is this melting point of tastes which drew Armstrong, who by day works as a medical photographer for the NHS, to her project. \"My dual identity has always been quite complex,\" the artist explains. \"I've always felt that I'm a bit stuck somewhere between my Britishness and Chineseness, but also feeling a bit like I'm on the outside of both.\"\n\nHarriet Armstrong Armstrong says she photographs the eateries from outside \"because I've always felt slightly on the outside of that part of my culture\"\n\nShe believes this complexity developed as she grew up. \"I was probably the only Chinese person in my class at the time, and there was a lot of prejudice and a bit of ignorance from my peers. And then when I was learning to speak English, my family actually didn't like it because they thought it was becoming too English. \"So it's that kind of really weird space,\" she says. Armstrong therefore sees the project as a way to \"re-establish my connection between my British and Chinese parts\", but in light-hearted way. \"I've actually become to really embrace that and I think the Chinese takeaway to me represents where East meets West,\" she says.\n\nHarriet Armstrong All the photos of Chinese takeaways are posted on Instagram\n\nArmstrong also sees her artwork as a way to \"document a slice of history from my culture\" as she worries that changes in society are threatening those familiar takeaway sights of a fading yellow menu in the window and noodles being piled into foil trays. \"My generation of British born Chinese are not wanting to do the ridiculous hours or want to work in a Chinese takeaway like the generation before us,\" she says. The increasing use of delivery couriers also means that some takeaways do not present themselves in ways to appeal to people passing by on the street any more, the photographer adds. \"They're almost like factories and I've been getting a bit worried thinking ‘oh no that's a whole part my heritage starting to disappear’, so I feel a slight urgency as well to get around as many as I can.\"\n\nHarriet Armstrong The British born Chinese artist says her go-to dish of choice is a king prawn chow mein\n\nAs such Armstrong is encouraging people to recommend their favourite Chinese takeaway in London to her on Instagram to include in her artwork, with potential plans to further expand the project to other parts of the UK in time. \"I just see them as these brightly lit beacons - they're very inviting and there's a whole life going on behind there.\"",

The 1974 film was inspired by Arthur Ransome's novel from 1930, which charts the adventures of four children who set off in their sail boat in Coniston. The actors and crew will come together for a free event at the Windermere Jetty Museum, in the Lake District, over the weekend. Several members of the Altounyan family, who inspired Ransome's novel, will also attend the event on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nARTHUR RANSOME LITERARY ESTATE Arthur Ransome (left) in Aleppo with some of the Altounyan children, including Titty (second left) and Roger (front centre)\n\nThe Altounyan family met Arthur Ransome while on holiday in the Lake District in 1928, and it was their experiences of learning to sail that gave him the idea for his story. They were Taqui, Susan, Mavis (known to her family as Titty) and Roger Altounyan, an Anglo-Armenian family who lived in Aleppo in Syria. Ransome then penned the story about four Walker children - John, Susan, Titty and Roger - who sail to reach an uninhabited island in the middle of Coniston water. The film adaptation of the book was shot near the Bank Ground Farm boathouse in Coniston.\n\nThe Arthur Ransome Society People will have the chance to sail in the Amazon\n\nIn celebration of 50 years since the production, the Arthur Ransome Society is hosting the two-day reunion at Windermere Jetty Museum. The society said it wanted to give a \"unique opportunity to meet the cast and crew and hear their stories and secrets of filming 50 years ago\". The two original boats used in the film would be there, with a chance to sail in Amazon too, the group said. Actors Suzanna Hamilton, Sophie Neville, Simon West and Kit Seymour will join script writer David Wood and make-up artist Peter Robb-King at the event.\n\nFollow BBC Cumbria on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "BBC Introducing acts 'so excited' to play Glastonbury": "BBC Introducing acts 'so excited' to play Glastonbury\n\n1 day ago By Harriet Robinson & James Threlfall , BBC Introducing in the West Share\n\nBBC Tianna's dad played the festival in the 1980s but she had never been before\n\nEmerging artists say they are \"so excited\" and \"very blessed\" to perform on the BBC Introducing stage at Glastonbury Festival. The area of the festival is the best spot to catch the country's next big acts, all of which are supported by BBC Introducing shows across the country. Bristol neo-soul artist Tianna plays on Saturday afternoon, her first time ever at the festival. \"I can't even explain it,\" she said. \"I didn't think I'd ever get here.\"\n\nTianna is \"excited and terrified\" to play Glastonbury for the first time\n\nTianna's dad performed on the Pyramid stage in the 1980s with his reggae band Talisman. \"So it's kind of full circle,\" she told BBC Introducing in the West. It is the first time she and her band have performed at a festival. \"We've been working really hard on our rehearsals. I'm so excited,\" said Tianna. Her first gig was in January 2023 and since then, via BBC Introducing, she has been supported by BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra and supported Hak Baker. The singer has just released her EP Bittersweet and said she was feeling \"excited and terrified\" to perform the new tracks at Worthy Farm.\n\nSam Evans and his band said following the performance they are feeling inspired to release more music\n\nSinger songwriter Sam Evans played the stage on Thursday afternoon with his band. Speaking from backstage afterwards he said: \"That felt amazing, looking at out there, seeing all those smiling faces. That's exactly what we do music for.\" Guitarist Jonny added: \"This is such an amazing festival and it's just a pleasure to be here.\" The band is used to playing in pubs and said they had to rethink their performance to suit a bigger festival crowd. Jonny explained he took a minute to \"just soak it up\" during the performance as they could see the Pyramid stage in the background. The band ended up playing the festival after winning the Pilton Stage competition, judged by Michael Eavis and industry experts. Sam, who grew up in Midsomer Norton and now lives in Wells, said the festival is extra special to him as it is so local. \"Very blessed to be here,\" he added.\n\nCousin Kula said the tracks from their new album went down \"really well\" with the crowd\n\nBristol psych-pop band Cousin Kula also played on Thursday and said it was an \"awesome\" and \"absolutely incredible\" experience. It was their first \"official\" time playing the festival and they chose to perform in bright pink matching outfits that they dyed themselves. \"I think it's a good move to think about the visual side of the set as well,\" said singer Elliot. The band have just toured their new album Vitamin D so Elliot said the timing of the Glasto set was \"well placed\". He added: \"We just feel like we can play the tunes really well.\" While the rest of the band were off to enjoy the festival, one of the members, Doug, had to leave site straightaway to perform with his other band Hippo in Italy.\n\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

Glastonbury Festival opened its gates on Wednesday. 200,000 people are descending on Worthy Farm for a weekend of music, comedy, poetry, dance and theatre. This year's line-up is one of the most diverse in years and the full list, of more than 100 stages and over 2,000 acts, is on the official Glastonbury website.

    "Reform UK drops three candidates over offensive comments": "Reform drops three candidates over offensive comments\n\n23 minutes ago By Becky Morton , Political reporter Share\n\nFarage on Reform's candidate controversies\n\nReform UK has dropped three of its candidates following reports they had made offensive comments, a spokesman has said. Edward Oakenfull, who is standing in Derbyshire Dales; Robert Lomas, a candidate in Barnsley North, and Leslie Lilley, standing in Southend East and Rochford, will still appear on the ballot paper as Reform candidates as it is too late for them to be removed. A Reform spokesman said if any of the three were elected they would sit as independent MPs. However, he said people should still vote for the candidates if they wished to register support for Reform. It comes after leader Nigel Farage disowned the candidates during an appearance on BBC Question Time on Friday evening, when their remarks were put to him. Mr Farage told the programme: \"I want nothing to do with them.\" Asked what Reform would say to voters in the constituencies where the candidates had been dropped, the party spokesman said he would “encourage them to vote for the party, by voting for these people on the ballot paper\". This way, he said people could still vote for Reform's \"policy platform\". He added: \"I’m not saying the situation is ideal, but the size of the Reform vote share nationally is what matters.\"\n\nWarning: This story contains language that may offend Mr Oakenfull posted derogatory comments about the IQ of sub-Saharan Africans on social media last year. He previously told the BBC the remarks had been taken out of context. Mr Lomas reportedly said black people should \"get off [their] lazy arses\" and stop acting \"like savages\". The comments were reported by the Times on 8 June, with Reform at the time claiming they were \"out of context part quotations\" and it needed more time to respond. Mr Lilley reportedly described people arriving on small boats as \"scum\" in a social media post, adding: \"I hope your family get robbed, beaten or attacked.\" Asked about the comments on a BBC Question Times Leaders' Special, Mr Farage said: \"You get people in all parties saying bad things and wrong things.\" However, he argued this was partly the consequence of having to find candidates quickly following the surprise announcement that there would be a general election in July.\n\nSince the start of the election campaign, Reform has faced persistent questions over its selection of candidates, after numerous examples of offensive social media posts emerged. All the main parties have had to drop potential parliamentary candidates over inappropriate comments, however this has been the case for more Reform candidates than other parties. The party has blamed a company it hired to conduct background checks on would-be candidates, claiming it failed to carry out vetting before the election was called. Mr Farage also faced angry questions from the Question Time audience about a recording broadcast by Channel 4 which showed Andrew Parker, a canvasser for Reform UK, using a racist term about Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. On Friday Mr Sunak said it made him \"angry\" that his daughters had to see a Reform campaigner using racist language about him. Mr Farage described the comments as a \"tirade of invective abuse\" but suggested the man may have been paid and claimed it was \"a political setup of astonishing proportions\". Channel 4 News said it stood by its \"rigorous and duly impartial journalism\", adding that it met Mr Parker for the first time at Reform UK party headquarters and had not paid him any money. In a statement, Mr Parker said he wanted to \"apologise profusely to Nigel Farage and the Reform Party if my personal views have reflected badly on them and brought them into disrepute as this was not my intention\". Essex Police have said they are \"urgently assessing\" comments in the programme \"to establish if there are any criminal offences\".",

It’s there whenever you sigh at the cost of a cuppa, put off paying a bill, celebrate a new job, move home or just wonder about the future.\n\nBecause politics is the constant conversation we have as a country; about the things we believe, the things we know, the things that happen to us - or others - and the things we fear might happen.\n\nPolitics is everyday stuff.\n\nSo do you really not do politics?

    "Five key takeaways from Green and Reform leaders' Question Time": "Key takeaways from Green and Reform leaders' Question Time\n\n17 hours ago By Chas Geiger , Politics reporter Share\n\nBBC\n\nGreen co-leader Adrian Ramsay and Reform UK's Nigel Farage each fielded half an hour of questions from a BBC Question Time audience in Birmingham, in the final leaders' special of this election campaign. Just six days before voters go to the polls, the two answered questions on immigration, tax, Brexit and their parties' candidates.\n\nSharp contrast in leaders' tones\n\nThere was a distinct difference in the way the two leaders responded to the studio audience. Adrian Ramsay repeatedly began his answers with \"good question\" or similar - though some of his answers appeared to elicit some scepticism. By contrast, Nigel Farage took a more combative approach. There was applause for critical questions, and when he was pressed on why some Reform candidates were still standing, his \"I have no idea!\" response elicited laughter in the room. But the Reform leader seemed to relish the challenge from the Birmingham audience, saying he would not apologise for mistakes made by some candidates and activists.\n\nFarage asked how he will handle racism within Reform UK\n\nBoth leaders challenged about candidates\n\nBoth Mr Ramsay and Mr Farage were on the defensive when pressed about some of their election candidates who have made controversial comments, largely on social media. Presenter Fiona Bruce pushed Mr Ramsay on some Green candidates who have been accused of making extreme comments on the Gaza conflict. He said he did not support any of their views and concerns raised would be independently investigated, but he declined to go further. Mr Farage appeared to withdraw support for one of his candidates live on TV, saying he \"wouldn’t want anything to do with them\". Any candidate who's had party support withdrawn now will still appear on the ballot paper in their party's name on 4 July.\n\nEven the Green leader doesn't have an electric car\n\nWhile emphasising the need to improve public transport, Mr Ramsay said he had a car and used it when he needed to. But he added it was hybrid and not fully electric - even though he would like it to be - because he lived in a terraced house where a charging point could not be installed. Mr Ramsay argued that was an example of a lack of transport infrastructure in the UK, with expensive trains, no buses to catch in many rural areas, and too many domestic flights. His call for the railways to be brought back into public ownership got a round of applause. How much would a scrappage scheme to get fossil-fuel vehicles off the roads by 2035 - as set out in the party's manifesto - cost, he was asked. He said all Green policies were fully costed, but couldn't specify what car owners would get to scrap their petrol and diesel vehicles.\n\nAdrian Ramsay on the Green Party's immigration plan and electric car timescale\n\nBoth leaders outspoken on foreign policy\n\nNo qualms from either leader about giving their verdict on the US presidential debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Mr Ramsay said he was very worried about the prospect of Donald Trump returning to the White House, particularly after Joe Biden's performance. Mr Farage said Mr Biden was a weak president and argued Mr Trump would make the world a safer place because he was a peacemaker. And asked about the Green pledge to scrap the UK's Trident nuclear deterrent, Mr Ramsay was repeatedly pressed about co-leader Carla Denyer's claim that Trident made the country more of a target - but declined to use her words.\n\nFarage doubles down on Clacton campaigners claims",
    "Who should I vote for? Compare 2024 election manifestos and policies": "Who should I vote for and what are the parties promising?\n\n22 hours ago By the Visual Journalism team , BBC News Share\n\nThe UK's main parties are announcing their campaign promises ahead of the general election on 4 July. Unsure who to vote for? This guide offers a summary of where parties stand on issues most important to voters. Click on the drop-down list to select the nation, political parties and issues that interest you.\n\nA manifesto is the list of pledges parties make to voters, explaining what they would do if elected. This interactive has been put together by the BBC's Visual Journalism team, the BBC's political research unit in London and BBC journalists in Belfast, Cardiff and Glasgow. Its aim is to summarise where the parties stand on key topics to help voters make informed decisions at the ballot box.\n\nHow were the issues chosen?\n\nWe have selected issues highlighted in polling company Ipsos Mori's Issues Index, a monthly survey that measures the things the public believe to be the most important facing the country. We analysed surveys from the twelve months before the election was called and selected the issues based on their aggregate score over that period. In some cases we have combined similar issues for simplicity. For example, \"NHS, hospitals, healthcare and social care\" are included under the one category of \"NHS and care\". \"Democracy\" was added as an issue on the editorial grounds that it help fulfil the BBC's public service commitments.\n\nHow have parties been chosen and ordered?\n\nIn order for a party to be included in the guide it must be standing candidates in at least one sixth of seats in the nation it is campaigning in as well as meeting one of the following criteria: Had been represented by at least one MP when Parliament was dissolved in June 2024\n\nHas at least one elected representative in a national assembly\n\nWon more than 1% of the vote share in the previous general election, national assembly election or the 2019 European Parliament elections Parties are ordered by their vote share in the 2019 general election - and then alphabetically. You can see a full list of all parties standing at the general election here.\n\nHow are the policies selected and summarised?\n\nThis is an editorial process overseen by BBC journalists. All parties included in the guide have contacted by the BBC and given the opportunity to identify their key policies in each area.\n\nWhat about issues that are devolved from the UK parliament?\n\nBecause of devolution, the UK parliament cannot rule on, or has limited powers over, some of the issues highlighted in the guide. For example, \"health\" is devolved to Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Parties do still campaign locally on these devolved issues in the run up to a general election. For this reason, the guide highlights issues that are devolved or partly devolved to acknowledge that these policies may not become law in that nation even if they are passed in Westminster. What is devolution and how does it work across the UK?",
    "Question Time debate fact-checked": "Rail fares, small boats and Brexit - Green and Reform claims tested\n\n17 hours ago By Verify team , BBC News Share\n\nBBC\n\nThe co-leader of the Green Party Adrian Ramsay and Reform UK’s leader Nigel Farage faced audience questions on Friday evening in a Question Time Leaders’ special programme. From small boats, to leaky homes and Brexit - we examined some of their answers.\n\nGreen Party’s Adrian Ramsay: Does the UK have some of the most expensive train tickets in Europe?\n\nCalling for greater investment in public transport, Mr Ramsay said: “We have some of the most expensive rail prices in Europe.” Comparing train fares across countries is difficult because prices differ depending on the distance travelled, when the journey is taken and how far in advance tickets are bought. A European Commission report did try to compare fares across Europe in 2016. It found the UK had the most expensive inter-city fares for peak single tickets, the fourth most expensive regional, peak, single fares bought on the day of travel and the third most expensive if bought a week or a month in advance. For off-peak travel, UK regional return fares were close to the average for Europe. Since 2016, rail fares in the UK have increased by 35% - the fourth highest increase in Europe, after Lithuania (63%), Sweden (40%), and Poland (36%). The EU-average increase was 12%. By Gerry Georgieva\n\nReform UK’s Nigel Farage: Could migrants in small boats be returned to France?\n\nAnswering a question about migrants coming to the UK in small boats, Mr Farage said: “We’ll pick them up in the Channel and take them back” to France. Returning migrants to France is one of his party's \"core pledges\" to voters. However, it is not clear how it would be able to do this under international law. International maritime laws do allow a state to pick people up at sea if they are “in danger of being lost” but they do not allow them to be taken to another state without that country agreeing.\n\nBBC Verify spoke to two legal experts. James M Turner KC, a shipping lawyer at Quadrant Chambers, told us: \"The French would have to grant express permission for UK vessels to carry rescued people through their territorial waters and to leave them ashore in France.\" While Ainhoa Campàs Velasco, a maritime law expert from the University of Southampton, said migrants could not be returned to French shores “without prior agreement with France\". There is no such agreement between the UK and France. The two countries agreed a joint action plan in 2019 which does provide for co-operation, but it does not allow one country to bring people rescued in the English Channel to the other country's ports. Mr Farage also said in his answer that, if necessary, he would use the Royal Marines.

    "East Lothian Council latest to set up emergency postal vote centre": "Another council sets up emergency postal vote centre\n\n2 hours ago Share\n\nBBC Most councils say any voters in the second batch of mailouts should receive a voting pack on Saturday\n\nAnother Scottish council has set up an emergency facility for voters planning to be away next week who have not yet received their postal voting ballots. East Lothian Council said replacement voting packs would be issued in Prestonpans for those who will be away from Monday. The move follows similar measures in Edinburgh and Fife. BBC Scotland News has contacted all 32 of the country's councils to ask for guidance for voters who have not yet received their postal ballot. Most councils said the last remaining voting packs should be delivered on Saturday, and anyone still waiting should get in touch on Monday. Lothian East constituency voters can obtain replacement postal ballot papers from 14:00 to 16:00 on Saturday and from 11:00 to 16:00 on Sunday from the Meadowmill Sports Centre in Prestonpans. ID must be shown. Replacements were also being issued at Edinburgh City Chambers over the weekend, and at Fife House in Glenrothes until 16:00 on Saturday.\n\nThe UK deadline to apply for postal vote applications was 19 June Any long-term postal voters or those who applied before 7 June should have received their voting pack last week. But many people were unaware that if they applied after 7 June, their voting papers would be sent out in a second tranche, with some only despatched in recent days. In Scotland, where the school term ends earlier than elsewhere in the UK, some voters had left the country for summer holidays before their postal ballots arrived. For those still in the country and without a voting pack, replacement packs can be obtained from council offices early next week. If voters are concerned about posting dates for returning them, many councils have arrangements for handing them in at council offices, or they can be handed in by voters in person on polling day itself at their local polling station. But for anyone already out of the country there is little that can be done, barring a return home to vote. The deadline for proxy votes has passed and emergency proxy votes are only possible in limited circumstances such as being called away suddenly for work.",

The former Islwyn MP said Reform \"harvests and plants lies\" and tackling that \"must start now\". Mr Farage has been facing accusations that Reform \"attracts racists and extremists\" but he has said support has been withdrawn from candidates who have made offensive comments. Speaking to the Guardian, Lord Kinnock said if Labour win on Thursday, they need to make an impact with \"change which is positive and cumulative\". Reform UK leader Mr Farage has been challenged over racist comments apparently made by one of the party's canvassers in undercover footage broadcast by Channel 4.\n\nHe said Reform have withdrawn support to candidates who made offensive comments, and in a TV debate on Friday he repeated his assertion that the footage broadcast by Channel 4 was a \"set-up\". \"You get people in all parties saying bad things and wrong things,\" he said during questions from a BBC Question Time audience, arguing it was partly the consequence of having to find candidates quickly. Lord Kinnock - the Labour leader from 1983 to 1992 - told the Guardian \"now\" was the time for his party to start targeting Reform. \"We have to combat this populist nationalism with words and explaining to people what these people are not just who they are. \"People like Farage, love the personal attention, like all narcissists, so we have to focus on explaining what they are, and all that inconsistencies and falsehoods, they plant and harvest lies\". Lord Kinnock added: \"The populist right have to be combated with actions that means the implementation of change which is positive and cumulative and driven by strong purpose in the service of community.\"",

The band they formed - Voice of Baceprot - are playing the festival this year and when they found out they'd been invited they were “confused”. “Because we didn’t know how exciting [the festival] is… We didn’t know what to do next,” the band’s lead singer Firdda Marsya Kurnia said. The pressure was on after the trio realised they would be the first Indonesian band to play at Europe's largest music festival. Headliners at this year’s five-day festival include Coldplay and Dua Lipa. Voice of Baceprot - made up of Marsya, drummer Euis Siti Aisyah and bassist Widi Rahmawati - are performing on Friday. Baceprot (pronounced “bah-che-prot”) means “noise” in Sundanese, one of the most widely spoken languages in Indonesia. The three women have come a long way since their village school 10 years ago. They have made international headlines for challenging gender and religious norms, and have toured internationally, including in Europe and the US. They have also been praised by the likes of Rage Against the Machine, whose guitarist Tom Morello said he watched one of their videos “10 times in a row and was just blown away by it”. Flea from Red Hot Chilli Peppers once tweeted, “I am so down with Voice of Baceprot.” But Glastonbury will be their biggest stage yet.\n\n(Fom left to right) Siti, Marsya and Widi were encouraged by their school counsellor to express their emotions through music\n\nMarsya, Siti, both 24, and Widi, 23, sat down with the BBC a week before their historic show to talk about their journey since they started playing music together as three restless schoolgirls.\n\n'Rebel' girl band\n\nGrowing up in the rural town of Singajaya in Indonesia’s West Java province, Marsya and Siti became friends in elementary school. They met Widi in junior high school – at the school counsellor’s office where they were regularly summoned for “rebellious behaviour”. It was in this unlikely place where their love for heavy metal took root. They struck up a friendship with the counsellor, Father Ersa. “We listened to music from our counselling teacher Abah Ersa’s laptop… We get an adrenaline rush when we listen to heavy metal and we thought, it would be so cool if we can cover those songs,” Siti said. Ersa says he realised the girls were not rebellious in the same way as some other teenagers, who might take drugs or get into trouble. Instead, they often spoke up for what they felt was unfair in school. “They opposed the system and often clashed with their teachers. Their statements were then considered provocative,” he said.\n\nVoice of Baceprot\n\nIn 2014, Ersa encouraged the girls to express their emotions through music. He introduced Marsya to the guitar, Widi to the bass, and built Siti a makeshift drum using unwanted parts left behind by the school’s marching band. “We let our anger flow through our music… because we don't want to get into trouble by getting angry with others. “If we protest, it will be a problem. We will be accused of being radical. In our village, the women who protest will be called crazy,” said Marsya, who comes over as the most outgoing of the three. Back then, playing music also motivated them to go to school, she added. “We were just told to get good grades… memorise, write, flip the books, that’s it. This was our daily routine for 12 years. We were bored. Then, there was music. It was something new.” The band credits Ersa as their founder. He was the first to publish their music on YouTube. Today, they have 360,000 subscribers on YouTube and 230,000 followers on Instagram.\n\nShaking off criticism\n\nBut the band and their music have also struck some nerves. Some people in their town, dominated by conservative Muslims, did not respond well when they ventured into heavy metal. Marsya was once hit on her head by a rock attached to a note telling her to “stop making the devil's music”. About 87% of Indonesia’s population are Muslims. West Java is among the more conservative provinces and includes denominations that forbid music and singing. Some people find the combination of hijab-wearing women and heavy metal music particularly provocative. “Some even said I should take off my hijab [as our music] does not reflect a true Muslim. But these are separate things. Metal is just a genre of music. I wear a hijab because it’s my identity as a Muslim… It’s not because I want to be sensational,” Marsya told BBC Indonesian in an earlier interview in 2018. Marsya, Siti and Widi have earned their families’ support over the years, though not without pushback - Widi’s older sister had warned her that playing heavy metal would “ruin her future” while Siti’s family had described her music career as “unserious”. Even the principal of the Islamic school they went to after junior high criticised their music. The girls later dropped out. In 2021, they released the single God, Allow Me (Please) to Play Music, which serves as an empathic plea against these criticisms. The band composed the tune, while Ersa wrote the lyrics. Its chorus goes, “I'm not the criminal, I'm not the enemy, I just wanna sing a song to show my soul… God, allow me, please, to play music.”\n\nGetty Images Voice of Baceprot has toured internationally, including in Europe and the US",
    "'A bottle of wine a night was normal for me'": "'A bottle of wine a night was normal for me'\n\n21 April 2024 By John Darvall, Jonathan Holmes and Sarah Turnnidge , BBC News West of England Share\n\nNiteOwlArt Photography Anna Doneghey has launched a podcast confronting our relationship with alcohol\n\nFor almost 20 years it was not unusual for Anna Donaghey to drink a bottle of wine every night. The advertising professional said it was a part of normal life, nothing \"atypical or abnormal\", until it began to impact her relationships with her husband and children. Her story, she told BBC Radio Bristol, is a \"frighteningly common\" one. Since becoming sober, the Thornbury resident has launched a podcast to encourage more conversations about our relationships with alcohol.\n\nNow in her early 50s, with two children, Ms Donaghey has worked in advertising and marketing for many years - an industry where alcohol frequently features at client lunches and social events. She told the BBC how at her first job at Rover in Filton she quickly turned to after-work drinks to become \"one of the guys\". \"The image is work hard and play harder,\" she said. \"That is what we tell ourselves, that's how we normalise drinking behaviours.\"\n\nShe was known as a highly sociable person who liked a drink, and she continued to climb the career ladder. But while drinking remained the norm at work, Anna said it also became part of her identity. It reached a point, when her children were still young, that her husband would offer her a glass of wine when he returned home - not realising she had already drunk a bottle.\n\n'Pushed as a drug'\n\nEventually, drinking became a \"crutch\" to manage the demands of everyday life. \"We are told...that there are many jobs that we can give alcohol to do,\" she said. \"Alcohol will make me sleep better, feel more confident, feel more happy. \"It is impressed upon us that alcohol can help, it becomes our coping mechanism. It is pushed as a drug really.\"\n\nBut it reached a point where those casual evening drinks began to affect many different areas of her life. \"Thankfully I never had a rock bottom moment,\" Anna said. \"I just bounced along the bottom in an unsustainable way. My children were growing older and they could notice how I was behaving and it was causing friction with my husband. \"I was exhausted by the façade I was keeping up. I knew that I was addicted to alcohol but I was terrified of staying where I was and doing anything about it. \"I was scared to death.\"\n\nNiteOwlArt Photography Anna has not drunk alcohol for three and a half years\n\nShame\n\nHaving struggled with alcohol for decades, at 49 she finally found a support group that clicked. \"I knew I had an addiction [but] I don't like the term alcoholic,\" she said. \"I felt an awful lot of shame in my drinking, but there was something very strong within me that wanted to work out why I had got there and how to reverse and course-correct rather than just say 'well that's that then'\".\n\nShe said: \"I've been dry for 3.5 years now. I don't measure it any more, I never have. I've never got into a place where I count days. I just don't drink any more.\" With the Big Drink Rethink podcast, as well as her work as an alcohol mindset coach, Anna hopes to reach people who have a similar relationship with alcohol. \"We have an alcohol-centric society that is shifting,\" she said. \"Let's explore why, let's think about our relationships...and have an open conversation about alcohol in the same way we do about mental health or menopause or any other aspects of our health.\"",

Jessie Reid, 29, from Shrewsbury, Shropshire, said she received a surprising reply in January to tell her she had got the gig. She will perform on Saturday at 13:00 BST on the stage which will also host acts including Scouting for Girls and Ocean Colour Scene across the weekend. \"He messaged back and said 'yeah I love it, please do come and play - we'd love to have you' [and] I thought 'that can't be real',\" said Ms Reid.\n\nJessie Reid Ms Reid described her music style as indie-folk\n\nIn her email, Ms Reid, who is currently studying for a PhD at the University of Leicester, attached a YouTube video of one of her performances. \"As an independent artist, you're so used to getting rejected. It was strange to firstly have a response and secondly a positive response,\" she told BBC Radio Shropshire. \"I'm really looking forward to just playing in a massive tent basically. \"I've got my guitar ready and I’ve got my ticket, that's the most important bits packed.\" Ms Reid describes her music as indie-folk with harmonies and percussive guitar skills.\n\n'Everyone wants to have a good time'\n\nThe five-day festival runs from Wednesday to Monday, with performances on the main music stages beginning on Friday. Ms Reid will play with some band members that join her on-stage regularly. \"We've put in the upbeat numbers, it's a festival, everyone wants to be having a good time,\" she said. \"I'm also playing with a band called Squeeze, I'm doing a songwriters circle with them so I've been also trying to learn their songs. \"I didn't realise it would be quite so hard. Some of the chords are just so complicated, I've never heard of them!\"\n\nMs Reid said she also hoped to make the most of her time at Glastonbury, outside of her performance. \"I've made a spreadsheet where I'm basically full up for the whole day with watching people,\" she said. \"When I finish my set, I'm running to see someone immediately, so I'm not sure what I'm going to do with my guitar.\"\n\nFollow BBC Shropshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

The car, driven by Hamilton when he won the British Formula Renault championship in 2003, took two years to rebuild. It was bought by collector Alex Thornton who said the work was a \"total labour of love\". The racing car will go on display outside Stevenage Museum in his hometown in August.\n\nLee Cunningham The car was tested at the Donington Park racetrack and was \"running well\", said Alex Thornton\n\nFinding the car was a bit of a \"lucky coincidence\" said Mr Thornton, who works in the motorsport industry. He was visiting a friend from the 2003 team when \"I spotted it in the back of a storeroom - it was all in bits, completely in pieces\". \"I think it was under the stairs for about two decades; they meant to get round to restoring it themselves.\" It was loaned to the National College for Motorsport in Towcester, Northamptonshire, so students could understand how \"things go together and, apart from that, it was almost gathering dust,\" he added.\n\nLee Cunningham Mr Thornton said he did not know the value of the car now and had no plans to sell it\n\nAfter two years of nagging, he purchased it, and then the project became \"a bit of a labour of love, it was quite an adventure\". Working with restoration expert Nick Edginton, they sourced parts from across the world and it now drives like it would have done in 2003. \"It's a really important piece of history, we're so lucky to find it,\" Mr Thornton said. \"So the last thing we want is for it to sit under a dust sheet. \"We want to get it out there and hopefully inspire the next generation of kids to go into racing.\" His dream is to have it on long-term display in Stevenage, but this cannot happen yet as it would not fit through the museum doors. \"We might be able to fire it up when it comes to Stevenage,\" he added, excitedly.\n\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "Private car parks to offer 10-minute 'grace period'": "Private car parks to have 10-minute 'grace period'\n\n2 days ago By Anna Lamche , BBC News Share\n\nPA\n\nPrivate car parks in the UK are to offer motorists a 10-minute \"grace period\" before they impose a charge for overstaying. The measure was announced as part of a new code of practice companies have pledged to implement in the autumn. Industry trade bodies say the code will also introduce a fairer appeals system and maintain an existing cap on charges. Motoring organisations say the code \"falls far short\" of the standards required to protect \"innocent\" drivers from the \"sharks running private car parks\" and government legislation is required.\n\nThe code of practice was published by the British Parking Association and the International Parking Community, the two trade bodies representing private car park operators. It features requirements for a single set of rules for operators on private land, more consistent signage and an \"appeals charter\" for drivers. The introduction of a grace period means that every vehicle in a private car park will be given 10 minutes after the time paid for has expired before a parking charge notice is issued. The code maintains a cap on charges of £100, reduced to £60 if paid within 14 days. While the industry bodies say they would like the new code to be introduced by October, private parking companies are being permitted a \"period of transition\" and will only be required to \"fully\" meet the new standards by December 2026.\n\n'Self-authored code'",

Pensions and retirement age are two issues people are focused on, and voters in Somerset have spoken to the BBC as part of the Your Voice Your Vote campaign.\n\nDoug Workman, a 63-year-old builder from Chilcompton, near Radstock, wants the retirement age to be lowered as he is finding it \"more difficult\" to physically manage at work. \"I don't know how I'm going to cope until I'm 67,\" he said. “How can it possibly be fair that I started work when I was 16, and I have to work until I’m 67?\" He said he finds it \"most unfair\" that children who stay in full time education until the age of 18 will work two years less than he has. “I’ve obviously paid more stamps [National Insurance contributions] than they ever will, and have worked two years longer than they will,\" he added. He disagrees with the rising retirement age, and wants it to be lowered back to 65.\n\nMichael Stancliff wants a better deal for pensioners from the next government.\n\nMichael Stancliff lives in Bridgwater. The 86-year-old, who is originally from Yorkshire, had a career working in newspapers prior to his retirement. He has voted throughout his life, but is currently unsure if he will in this election. The current government has \"let pensioners down badly\", by failing to implement any changes on tax or payment increases, he said. “All my life it’s been tax, tax, tax,\" he added. In the future, Mr Stancliff wants to see private pensions become tax-free. He receives four different pensions, and is taxed on all of them. He receives £53 a week from one, but pays a \"ridiculous\" £12 tax on it. \"It’s all about pensions for me,\" he said. \"I've been paying tax for 71 years. I'll pay tax until I die.\"\n\nThe public will have their say when polls open on 4 July\n\nThe government pays the state pension every four weeks to people who have reached the qualifying age and have paid enough in National Insurance contributions. According to the Department for Work and Pensions, there are more than 12 million recipients in the UK. Check your state pension age Check your state pension forecast Men and women born between 6 October 1954 and 5 April 1960, become eligible for the payments when they turn 66. But for people born after this date, the state pension age is increasing: a gradual rise to 67 for those born on or after 5 April 1960\n\na gradual rise to 68 between 2044 and 2046 for those born on or after 5 April 1977 A triple lock was introduced by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government in 2010. It was designed to ensure the value of the state pension was not overtaken by the increase in the cost of living or the working population's income. Under the system, the state pension increases each April in line with inflation, average wage increase, or 2.5% - whichever figure measures highest. Both the Conservatives and Labour have committed to keeping the triple lock. The Conservatives have promised to introduce a \"triple lock plus\", meaning fewer would pay income tax on their pensions. But Labour said the plan is not \"credible\". The state pension cost the government £110.5bn in 2022/2023, but the Office for Budget Responsibility predicts the figure will grow.\n\nGetty Images More than 12 million people receive the state pension\n\nHow will different parties tackle issues around pensions?\n\nThe Conservatives have promised to introduce the \"triple lock plus\", which will increase the personal tax-free allowance for pensioners. This would mean future rises in the state pension will not be hit by income tax. Labour has said it will maintain the triple lock, which means the state pension is increased by whichever is highest of average earnings growth, CPI inflation, or 2.5%. The party has also said it will adopt reforms to workplace pensions. The triple lock would also be maintained by the Liberal Democrats, the party has said, alongside a pledge to introduce measures to end the gender pension gap in private pensions. The Green Party manifesto sets out a pledge to ensure that pensions are always uprated in line with inflation and keep pace with wage rises across the economy, as well as ordering UK pension funds to remove fossil fuel assets from their portfolios. Reform has said it would undertake a review of pension provision, adding that the current system is too complex and comes at a huge cost.\n\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

    "Gardening: How to brighten up your life on a budget": "How to make your garden grow on a budget\n\n27 May 2024 By Colletta Smith , Cost of living correspondent Share\n\nBBC About £8bn was spent on garden products in the UK in 2023\n\nWith summer on the horizon, lots of people will be getting in the mood for sprucing up their outdoor space, however big or small. According to the Horticultural Trade Association the average household spends around £300 per year on gardening - about £8bn in total across the UK. But while some people spend big, the stretch on budgets mean most people cannot spend much. And experts say it is possible to garden without breaking the bank.\n\nPick the right plants\n\nCloud Gardener Jason Williams says people should focus on what is most likely to work\n\nManchester-based Jason Williams has become known as the Cloud Gardener. Living on the 18th floor of his building, he is an expert in small space gardening, and has made it his mission to convince people renting flats that it is possible to create gardens in the sky without pots of cash. \"Figure out which direction your balcony faces because that’s going to affect your planting,\" Jason says. He says there is no point wasting money on plants that are not going to survive in your space. Despite sunflowers being his favourite plants, he does not bother on his balcony because of the wind. \"Sometimes they can snap over and that means you’ve wasted all that time and space growing that plant.\" He says people should focus on what is most likely to work, so they don’t waste money, or lose their enthusiasm.\n\nWork round your housemates\n\nPlant and seeds swaps have been set up across the country\n\nAnother crucial consideration about gardening as a tenant is that lots of people are sharing their space with others. \"There might be two of you living in that apartment,\" says Jason. \"One of you might have an interest in gardening, the other not.\" He thinks that navigating that problem might mean not going down the cheapest route of planting seeds. \"You may have to purchase some plug plants and put them into pots to reduce the amount of mess and clutter around your apartment,\" he says, adding buying the small plug plants and growing them will still be cheaper than buying full-sized plants. He says by using upcycled shelves and even open chests of drawers to house plants, everything can be moved to a new location if someone should decide to move into another home.\n\nUse anything to grow in\n\nLisa Hudson says you can collect seeds from sunflowers or marigolds to plant next year\n\nLisa Hudson is an expert grower for the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) in Salford, and she agrees you can save a fortune by using any container to grow things in. \"Start small,\" she says. \"Start on your windowsill if you’ve got one, use whatever containers you’ve got to hand.\" But she warns people should \"make sure they’ve got some drainage in them, because plants do not like to sit in a puddle of water\". One of the main parts of Lisa’s job is what is known as propagating, or making more plants. And she loves the fact that people can do this for free. At the basic level, she says, you can collect seeds from sunflowers, nasturtiums, or marigolds to plant next year. She says lots of plants can be divided. \"Anything that’s got a decent amount of root you can quite often split. \"Mint works really well, but a lot of ornamental plants where they’ve just got a single woody stem – you’re going to kill it.\" But if you cannot divide it \"you can probably take a cutting of it\", Lisa says. \"So that’s usually a small section of stem then you stick in a pot and get to grow roots.\" And once you have got your extra plants, you can use them in your own space, or swap them for free.\n\n'A liberation'\n\nMusician and broadcaster Tinie Tempah has been supporting nature projects for urban areas\n\nCreating a little green space can have huge benefits for nature and for people’s mental health too. One man who has felt those benefits first hand is the rapper Tinie Tempah. \"The pressure of life and the cost of living, it can all sort of get the better of you so sometimes,\" he says. \"So to be in a place of nature and be still, you would be surprised at how much that can do in terms of creativity.\" Famous for his urban grime rap, Tinie says his early childhood was grey. \"When I was in the flat I used to look out and all I could see was essentially concrete. \"Even the playground that they had made in that council estate was like a concrete playground.\" But all that changed when Tinie was 12. His family moved house and, for the first time, he had access to a garden. \"The minute that we had our own garden space, it just felt like liberation,\" he says. \"It just felt like we were living in an environment that we were more able to thrive in.\"",

    "Rules 'force disabled woman to choose love or benefits'": "'I'm forced to choose love or disability benefit'\n\n2 days ago By Rachael McMenemy, Katy Prickett and Richard Daniel , BBC News, Suffolk Share\n\nQays Najm/BBC Rose Kindred said the system forced disabled people \"to choose between the security of living and love\"\n\nA woman with a chronic pain condition has said she is being forced to choose between love and affording to live due to benefit restrictions. Rose Kindred, from Ipswich, lives with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) and wants to move in with her partner, but current benefits rules mean her payments would be slashed, making it unaffordable for them both. She got in touch with the BBC via Your Voice, Your Vote, concerned about the way disabled people were treated within the benefits system. \"I think it’s a cruel system that forces disabled people to choose between the security of living and love,\" she said.\n\nMs Kindred, 26, has been declared unfit for work by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) because of her condition, which causes the body's collagen to mutate on a genetic level, leaving her with joint hypermobility and poor balance and co-ordination. She receives a £405.40 Personal Independence Payment (PIP) per month and £809.64 in universal credit every four weeks. Ms Kindred said she found it \"nonsensical\" that her parents' income was not considered but if she moved in with her partner, who earns about £30,000 a year, a government benefits calculator suggested she would lose her universal credit payments.\n\nRose Kindred Rose Kindred says she would like to move in with her partner Denis Gibbons\n\n\"I’d like to move in with my partner of five years but unfortunately we can’t because of the living-as-if-married clause from the Department for Work and Pensions. \"That’s £405 a month to live on entirely, that's before I pay for a private physio, which makes up for what the NHS can’t provide for me.\" “I’m basically stuck living with my parents because that’s the only option available to me.\" Ms Kindred also raised concerns about proposed changes to PIP by the Conservatives that would see changes to the way payments are made. The charity Ehlers-Danlos Support UK said it had concerns about proposed changes to PIP. In a statement, it said: \"EDS is misunderstood and diagnosis can take decades. This makes it hard to evidence the daily struggle of living with this illness. \"We are concerned by the proposed changes to PIP and reached out to our members to better understand their experiences. \"We have encouraged them to respond to the consultation. \"Our Adviceline has also seen a significant rise in members asking for help with benefits which is indicative of the growing problems people with EDS face in the UK.\"\n\nWhat the parties say\n\nThe Liberal Democrats say they will give disabled people and organisations representing them a stronger voice in the design of benefits policies and processes. They will bring work capability assessments in-house, reform PIP assessments to make the process more transparent and stop unnecessary reassessments, and end the use of informal assessments. The Greens say they will restore the value of disability benefits, with an immediate uplift of 5%. They will reform intrusive eligibility tests like PIP and the unfair targeting of carers and disabled people on benefits. And in the long term, introduce a universal basic income to give everybody the security to start a business, study, train and live their life in dignity. Labour want to work with local areas to create plans to support more disabled people and those with health conditions into work. They will devolve funding so local areas can shape a joined-up work, health, and skills offer for local people. While they pledge to tackle a backlog of Access to Work claims, they do not say anything about benefits such as PIP. Reform UK says says PIP and work capability assessments should be face-to-face. They will require independent medical assessments to prove eligibility for payments. Those registered with severe disabilities or serious long-term illnesses would be exempt from regular checks. The Conservatives say they will reform benefits to stop a projected rise in PIP payouts. But the manifesto does not give details of changes beyond pledging a “more objective” assessment of an individual's needs. They say they will make the assessment process simpler and fairer for those with the most severe conditions.",

A Dartmoor Zoo spokesperson said they were \"elated\" at the birth of two kits after Emily, who travelled from Germany in February, was introduced to long-term resident Flaviu. The zoo said after the successful introduction on 19 March, the pair became \"inseparable\" and have now become parents. It said it was able confirm the births on 29 May after \"squeaks\" were heard in the cubbing den with their mother, with initial sightings as they started to explore.\n\nCanva The zoo is not taking photos of the kits to avoid distressing them, but provided this stock image.\n\nThe zoo also said Emily seemed \"calm and in good spirits\" while Flaviu was \"already showing signs of protection and attentiveness towards Emily and their litter\". Flaviu hit the news in 2016 when he went missing from the zoo, causing it to temporarily close before he was found. Animal manager Madeleine Millin said the keeper team will be monitoring the family to allow the kits to adjust, explore and feel safe and calm in their environment. CEO David Gibson said they were \"absolutely thrilled\" by the new additions. \"This species is under severe threat across much of its home range in central Europe, so every captive born individual is extremely important for the future survival of the species,\" said Mr Gibson.\n\n'Great achievement'\n\nThe zoo explained Emily and Flaviu were a subspecies of Eurasian Lynx, the largest of the four species of the animal. It added the majority of this species could be found in Romania, Slovakia, Poland and Ukraine, whilst the population in Hungary, Serbia and Bulgaria was \"scattered\". \"With a population of around 2100 – 2400, breeding and reintroduction programmes within zoos are essential to stabilising and subsequently increasing these numbers,\" the zoo said. \"To announce that our breeding match has been successful is a great achievement.\"\n\nFollow BBC Devon on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "T20 World Cup: Will this be the farewell for India's icons?": "Could the World Cup signal goodbye for India's batting legends?\n\n3 days ago By Suresh Menon , Cricket Writer Share\n\nAFP Virat Kohli, Tendulkar’s natural successor who turns 36 this year, is in the twilight of his own career\n\nIn 2011, the last time India won a cricket World Cup, everybody knew it would be batter Sachin Tendulkar’s final chance. He was 39, it was his sixth attempt, and the team’s unofficial slogan was \"Let’s do it for Sachin\". After skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni hit the winning six, Virat Kohli, who was among those who carried Tendulkar on their shoulders, said memorably, “He has carried our batting on his shoulders for so long, it is time we carried him on our shoulders.” And now Kohli, Tendulkar’s natural successor who turns 36 this year, is in the twilight of his own career. The next T20 World Cup is in 2026, and the 50-over version in 2027. Kohli is fitter than Tendulkar was, but it is difficult to see him play white ball cricket at that level again. Captain Rohit Sharma, 37, might be playing his last World Cup too. There has been no “Let’s do it for Kohli” or “Let’s do it for Rohit” cry in the Indian team, unless these have been done more discreetly than before. Perhaps there is a “Let’s do it for [Rahul] Dravid,” lingering in the air. For the Indian coach, who missed the 2011 World Cup, this is his final assignment with the national team.\n\nGetty Images Rohit Sharma, 37, might be playing his last World Cup too\n\nIncreasingly, T20 is turning into a young man’s game, a young man who can’t be bothered about personal statistics, but is focused on where his next six is coming from. This is a cultural change in Indian cricket that is going unnoticed - too many big players in the past have shown an unhealthy concern about how they look in the record books where figures stand shorn of context. Sharma’s stunning 92 against Australia pointed out to the next generation how strike rates mattered more than averages in T20. When Tendulkar made his 100th international century it was much lauded. But India lost the match. India win to reach semi-finals and put Australia in peril India’s white ball team - especially in T20 - is in transition. Ten members of this squad are over 30, three above 35. And more determined hitters are coming through the system. Shubhman Gill is leading an Indian T20 squad to Zimbabwe for a five-match T20 series next month. India’s future is represented there, with the likes of Yashasvi Jaiswal (unlucky not to play in the T20 World Cup, although he might still do so), Riyan Parag, Abhishek Sharma, Dhruv Jurel, Nitish Kumar, Ravi Bishnoi, all under 25, and Rinku Singh a shade over.\n\nGetty Images The two batting icons are wildly popular among Indian fans seen here in West Indies",

Taylor Swift dazzles on Eras Tour\n\n6 hours ago Share\n\nGetty The long-awaited Eras tour got under way in Dublin on Friday night\n\nTaylor Swift fans are experiencing the sold-out Eras tour in Dublin this weekend. The singer has brought her record-breaking tour to the Aviva Stadium in Ireland’s capital for three nights, beginning on Friday, with more than 150,000 Swifties in attendance. Before Friday, it had been six years since Swift's last show in Dublin. The 152-date Eras tour has become the most lucrative set of concerts in history. And its arrival in Dublin is not the only big event in the Irish capital over the weekend - Pride, Latitude Festival, the GAA football All-Ireland quarter-finals and Shania Twain are attracting their own crowds to the city.\n\nGetty Images Taylor addressed the ecstatic crowd saying \"Dublin we've arrived\"\n\nWhat happened on the first night of the Eras Tour in Dublin?\n\nAbout 50,000 fans filled the Aviva Stadium to see the US musician on Friday evening. Swift kicked off her time on the Emerald Isle with high praise for Ireland and its culture. \"Dublin, we've arrived!\" she said. \"You guys are making me feel so good, it's gone straight to my head. I feel very, very powerful.\"\n\nGetty Images Swift is playing three sold-out shows in Dublin this weekend\n\nThe concert was filled with elaborate production, multiple costume changes and a setlist that spanned more than three hours and included dozens of songs, taking her fans on a chronological journey through her albums. \"Nobody does it like you. You know that right?\" she said, going on to call Irish people \"unmatched storytellers\", with the \"best accents\".\n\nGetty Images A young girl in the crowd receives the '22 hat' and a hug from the US mega-star\n\nIn a now viral segment, Swift's dancer took on the Irish language, hollering \"póg mo thóin\" (which means kiss my butt), during a rendition of We Are Never Getting Back Together. Before the gig, Swift had received a bouquet of flowers from Irish rock band U2, alongside a welcome note.

Special measures are being implemented to ensure that there are enough gardaí (officers) to police the city. The policing bill for five Garth Brooks concerts in Croke Park in 2022 came to €380,000 (£320,000), and it is expected policing Taylor Swift’s three nights will cost about the same.\n\nSwifties are travelling from Belfast to Dublin for the concerts\n\nIn Belfast, about 300 fans were preparing to make their way to Dublin on buses on Friday morning. Speaking to BBC News NI, Lucy Glover, 18, said she had been looking forward to the gig “for so long\". \"It's been a landmark and now it's here,\" Ms Glover said. Lauren Shannon said \"it’s like Christmas\". Monique Uprichard, 23, who was wearing a Lover album inspired dress, said: “I had to plan for the outfit, it's Taylor Swift.\"\n\nMonique Uprichard is wearing a Taylor Swift-inspired outfit to the event\n\n'Swiftonomics'\n\nThe economic impact of this global superstar is now known as Swiftonomics. Last year’s US leg of the Eras tour was the first in history to make more than $1bn (£792m). Now, it’s estimated the international tour will increase that figure to as much as $4bn (£3.1bn). The hugely-anticipated UK leg could generate close to a £1bn boost for the economy and the only Irish city on the tour is expecting to be a beneficiary of a boost too. The only similar global star who has had a run in Dublin has been Garth Brooks. An estimated 400,000 fans attended his five-night stint in Croke Park. Dublin Chamber of Commerce estimates that tourists travelling to those concerts provided a €35m boost to the economy. Could Swift do the same?\n\nGetty Images Tickets to see Swift at London's Wembley Stadium started at £110, not far off the Dublin price of €126\n\nDublin Chamber said the real benefit comes from those travelling from overseas. Aebhric McGibney, its director of public and international affairs, said tourism will be the biggest beneficiary of the Eras tour. “You can see people coming from all over the country to visit Dublin, and spend a bit of time here, which is fantastic. \"But the real economic impact comes from those who travelled from overseas and coming from Great Britain, Northern Ireland as far away as United States. And in general, the longer the person has to travel both the more time they'll spend here.” Mr McGibney added that the 2,000 to 3,000 people who have come from the US “could easily spend a few thousand” euro each during their visit. There are still hotel rooms available, some reaching more than €500 (£420) for one night, but there are still more pocket-friendly rooms available too. Businesses around the Aviva and Dublin are planning on a bumper weekend with bottomless brunches, Taylor quizzes, and mug-making among the quirkier offerings.\n\nThe Bridge, a popular bar near the Aviva Stadium, has developed a Taylor Swift themed menu. The manager, Colm Ryan, said they are used to big events but none as big as Taylor. “We always have rugby matches, Six Nations, things like that,” he said. “And obviously a lot of concerts as well. We've had Pink and Rammstein both playing last weekend. But Taylor, she’s something on another level, the amount of people that come to support her is huge. “She’s probably one of the biggest artists in the world right now. “We've designed special cocktails this weekend named after a couple of her songs. So we have a Lavender Haze cocktail, and an Enchanted cocktail, along with slushies, you know, frozen daiquiris, I thought to go with the kind of stuff that hopefully weather permitting will fly out.” Dublin Pottery Studio is running a Taylor-themed mug-making class for two nights, both of which sold out within an hour. Manager Ciara Fullam said the idea came when most of their customers were painting their own Taylor Swift pottery regardless of the concerts. “We noticed every weekend, people were painting Taylor Swift themes anyway,” she said.\n\nHow to get to the Aviva\n\nPA\n\nIf you were lucky enough to have secured tickets, there are some extra public transport services for the Taylor Swift concert. Additional Dart train services, which operate around the Dublin city area, are available on all three nights. Also 60 different bus routes from all over the country that have been approved by the National Transport Authority to provide dedicated services to the Aviva. Translink is also running special return train services from Northern Ireland. The concerts coincide with a number of other events in the Dublin area such as Pride and Longitude, so public transport will be busy. Aviva Stadium is relatively close to the centre of Dublin and for those able to do so, it may make more sense to do that part of the journey on foot.\n\nWhat time do the concerts start and end?\n\nThe event promoter MCD has said gates to the Eras Tour open at 17:00 local time, however, some fans with early entry packages may be let into the venue from 15:00. The shows start at 18:00 with opening act Paramore. Swift then begins her mammoth three-and-a-half hour set from about 19:00. MCD has also warned that briefcases, bags, luggage or purses larger than a clutch bag are prohibited. For those looking for merchandise, it is available at the 3Arena in Dublin's North Wall Quay until Sunday.\n\nWhat else is happening in Dublin that weekend?",
