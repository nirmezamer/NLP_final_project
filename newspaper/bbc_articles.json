    "South African parliament to elect president after government of national unity agreed": "Zuma's MK likely to trouble ANC as official opposition Farouk Chothia\n\nBBC News\n\nImage source, AFP Image caption, Jacob Zuma's party may form an alliance with the radical Economic Freedom Fighters\n\nWith the Democratic Alliance (DA) joining the government, the third-biggest party - ex-President Jacob Zuma’s MK - will now play the role of official opposition and be tasked with holding the executive to account.\n\nBut Zuma is facing corruption charges over a 1999 arms deal and is barred from becoming an MP because of a 2021 prison sentence for contempt of court.\n\nHis party is also plagued by infighting and boycotted today’s historic sitting of parliament. They allege that the poll was rigged in favour of the ANC and DA, but have not provided any evidence to back up this claim.\n\nIf and when MK takes up its seats, the party is likely to form an alliance with another radical party - Julius Malema’s Economic Freedom Fighter's (EFF) - to give the new coalition government a tough time.\n\nExpect them to revive demands that impeachment proceedings be instituted against President Cyril Ramaphosa.\n\nIt emerged in 2022 that Ramaphosa stashed at least $580,000 (£458,000) in a sofa on his game farm. That money was later stolen by robbers.\n\nA panel of legal experts appointed by parliament recommended that impeachment proceedings be instituted against Ramaphosa, but the ANC used its then-parliamentary majority to block this.\n\nIn the build up to the 29 May election, Zuma made the scandal a major issue as he campaigned for votes - and MK and the EFF are likely to demand a full-scale parliamentary investigation.\n\nWill the DA - which fought corruption from the opposition benches - join them or will it help the ANC in shielding Ramaphosa?",

    "Gaza war: Israel announces daily military pause along road to let in aid": "Israel announces military pause on Gaza road to let in aid\n\n5 hours ago By Kathryn Armstrong , BBC News Share\n\nAnadolu Israel is under pressure from its allies to enable sufficient aid to reach those living in Gaza\n\nThe Israeli military says it will hold a daily \"tactical pause of military activity\" along a road in southern Gaza to enable more humanitarian aid to enter, but emphasised that there is no ceasefire and combat would continue in Rafah. The pauses, which are said to have begun on Saturday, will last from 08:00 local time (05:00 GMT) until 19:00 local time until further notice. They will only affect a route that leads northwards from the key Kerem Shalom crossing, which Gaza shares with Israel. Aid agency ActionAid told the BBC it was getting a \"confused\" picture over what the pauses mean. Israel has been under continuous pressure from its allies, including the US, to prevent the humanitarian crisis in Gaza from worsening.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Sunday's announcement follows \"additional related discussions with the UN and international organizations\". The route of the humanitarian pause leads from the Kerem Shalom crossing in the south of Gaza to the Salah al-Din Road - a main highway - and then northwards to the European Hospital near the city of Khan Younis. In a post on X, the IDF clarified that there is no ceasefire in the southern Gaza Strip, and fighting would continue in Rafah. A spokesman for ActionAid, which is helping to deliver supplies in Gaza, told the BBC that the pause would help aid getting in but that they needed more details about logistics. \"We're still getting confused pictures around what these tactical pauses mean, how it will enable aid, not only to get inside the Gaza Strip, but to be distributed safely to the civilians there who need it,\" Ziad Issa said. He added that ActionAid had seen \"significant attacks on aid convoys that are trying to get from to Gaza from Kerem Shalom in the last few weeks\". A spokesperson for the United Nations' humanitarian office (OCHA) told the AFP news agency that the organisation welcomed the announcement. \"We hope this leads to further concrete measures by Israel to address longstanding issues preventing a meaningful humanitarian response in Gaza,\" said Jens Laerke.\n\nAccording to Israeli media, neither Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nor the defence minister Yoav Gallant were aware of plans for a pause before they were announced. Mr Netanyahu's office reportedly said the prime minister had told his military secretary that the plan was \"unacceptable\" after hearing about it on Sunday. He has also reportedly been told that there has been no change to the IDF's policy and that the fighting in Rafah \"continues as planned\". Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir said the decision to pause fighting had been made by a \"fool\" who was \"evil\". Hundreds of thousands of people have fled Rafah since Israeli troops entered it more than a month ago, seizing control of the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing with Egypt and ordering many people to evacuate. The crossing - once the main point of entry for aid - has been closed since then. Israel says its operation in Rafah is necessary to oust Hamas from what it calls the group's “last major stronghold”. International agencies have warned of a dire humanitarian situation in Gaza and made repeated calls for more aid to be let in. On Wednesday, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said a significant proportion of Gaza's population was facing \"catastrophic hunger and famine-like conditions\". The number of aid trucks entering Gaza continues to be well below what agencies have said is required. OCHA reported that in May, the daily average number of trucks delivering humanitarian aid into Gaza - excluding fuel - was 97. In April that figure was 169 and in March it was 139. Prior to the outbreak of the war on 7 October, around 500 trucks carrying aid - including fuel - were entering Gaza every day. OCHA points out that since 7 May, it has been unable to directly observe the arrival of aid from the private sector through the Kerem Shalom crossing.",

    "Climate change: The Kenyan influencer promoting denial": "How a Kenyan farmer became a champion of climate change denial\n\n15 hours ago By Marco Silva , @BBCMarcoSilva, Climate disinformation reporter Share\n\nX/JusperMachogu\n\nClimate change deniers have found a new champion in Kenyan farmer Jusper Machogu. On social media, he has become known as a flagbearer for fossil fuels in Africa, but there is more to his campaign than meets the eye. At first glance, the 29-year-old Mr Machogu is just a young farmer with a knack for social media. On X, formerly Twitter, he regularly posts videos of himself weeding his land, planting garlic, or picking avocados - offering viewers a window into life in rural Kisii, south-west Kenya. While farming content may get him clicks, likes, and retweets, it is Mr Machogu’s denial of man-made climate change that has helped supercharge his online profile. Since he began posting debunked theories about climate change, he has received thousands of dollars in donations – some of which came from individuals in Western countries linked to fossil-fuel interests. Mr Machogu insists this has not influenced his views, saying they are genuinely held.\n\nScientists have proven that the Earth is heating up because of greenhouse gases that are emitted into the atmosphere when we burn fossil fuels - like oil, gas, or coal. But Mr Machogu disagrees. “Climate change is mostly natural. A warmer climate is good for life,” Mr Machogu wrongly claimed in a tweet posted in February, along with the hashtag #ClimateScam (which he has used hundreds of times). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says Africa is “one of the lowest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change”. However, it is also “one of the most vulnerable continents” to climate change and its effects - including more intense and frequent heatwaves, prolonged droughts, and devastating floods. Despite all this, Mr Machogu continues to insist “there is no climate crisis”. On social media, he has repeatedly posted unfounded claims that man-made climate change is not only a “scam” or a “hoax”, but also a ploy by Western nations to “keep Africa poor”. “[His views] are definitely coming up from a place of lack of understanding,” says Joyce Kimutai, a climate scientist from Kenya who has contributed to IPCC reports.\n\nDr Joyce Kimutai Joyce Kimutai says Mr Machogu’s views are not shared by many Kenyans\n\n“This is not religion, this is not just belief. It's about analysing the data and seeing changes in the data. “Saying that climate [change] is a hoax is just really not true,” Dr Kimutai added. Mr Machogu began tweeting false and misleading claims about climate change in late 2021, after carrying out his “own research” into the topic. Since then, he has launched his own campaign - which he dubbed “Fossil Fuels for Africa” - arguing that the continent should be tapping into its vast reserves of oil, gas, and coal. “We need fossil fuels to develop our Africa,” Mr Machogu tweeted last year. This view appears to be shared by some African governments, who have given their go-ahead to new oil and gas projects despite pledging to \"transition away\" from fossil fuels. Leaders like Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni have argued that it is hypocritical for Western nations to impose restrictions on African states, when they have become rich from fossil fuels. But climate activists like 24-year-old Nicholas Omonuk, from Uganda, point out that fossil fuel exploration has not always been a synonym for growth and development in Africa. “In [Nigeria’s] Niger Delta, there’s been oil extraction since the 1900s, but people there are still poor and are still suffering from health risks and from pollution,” he said.\n\nGetty Images Crude oil pollution has affected fishing and farming communities in Nigeria's Niger Delta\n\nAnd yet, Mr Machogu believes he has found a willing audience for his message - he has more than 25,000 followers on X. “I think Africans are really embracing the fact that I'm saying: ‘Fossil fuels for Africa’,” he told the BBC. But by tracking conversations involving Mr Machogu’s X handle, BBC Verify found that most users engaging with his account are actually based in the US, the UK, and Canada. Many of those users also promote conspiracy theories online - not just about climate change, but also about vaccines, Covid-19, or the war in Ukraine. However niche its views may be, this online community has thrown its support behind Mr Machogu and helped him fund his campaign. “Through saying whatever I say, I have seen my follower count going up and I've got people reaching out to me saying: how can we help you?,” he said.\n\nOn X, Mr Machogu has accused climate activists of alarmism\n\nBBC Verify looked at fundraising pages set up by Mr Machogu and found that, in the last two years, he has raised more than $9,000 (£7,000) from donations. Mr Machogu has posted online about using some of these funds to furnish his new home. But he also claims to have used donations to help dozens of local families by building a borehole for water, distributing gas bottles for cooking, or connecting their homes to the electricity grid. Among his donors were individuals with links to the fossil fuel industry and to groups known for promoting climate change denial. But Mr Machogu rejects suggestions that those donations have had any impact on his opinions on climate change. “Nobody has told me to change my views,” Mr Machogu insists. “I don’t have a problem with making money while saying what I believe I should say or doing what’s good for my community.”\n\nBy sharing his views online, he has undoubtedly caught the eye of many in the West who share his stance on fossil-fuel exploration and climate change. Canadian author Jordan Peterson retweeted one of his posts about fossil fuels, describing him as an “actual African”, in contrast with what Mr Peterson called the “poor, oppressed, useless African” supposedly imagined by “globalist utopians\". A US fossil fuel advocate paid for Mr Machogu to travel to South Africa for a conference promoting African oil and gas late last year. And, just months before, a film crew from the UK travelled to Kisii to interview him for a new documentary that described climate change as an “eccentric environmental scare”.\n\nTo some, Mr Machogu’s new-found popularity has not come as a surprise. “There’s been a real explosion in fossil fuel development projects in Africa,” says Amy Westervelt, a US investigative climate reporter who covers attempts to obstruct climate policy. “And because a lot of countries are passing policies that are limiting fossil fuels, Africa is also seen as a big market. “So, it’s very helpful to have people in Africa saying: ‘We want these projects’.” That is certainly a point Mr Machogu has made - again and again - on social media. But Dr Kimutai says his promotion of fossil fuels, along with his denial of man-made climate change, could have consequences. “Because we still have low climate literacy levels in Africa and in Kenya, and if that conspiracy theory spreads to communities or to people, it could just really undermine climate action. “That is really, really dangerous.”",
    "Bullfighting: Spanish child grapples with tradition in The Boy and the Suit of Lights": "Boy grapples with tradition in Spanish bullfighting town\n\n13 hours ago By Steven McIntosh , Entertainment reporter Share\n\nAconite Productions Borja comes from an underprivileged background and is encouraged to pursue bullfighting by his grandfather\n\nA new documentary follows a boy living in a small town in Spain, whose family expects him to become a professional bullfighter. It may sound like an unusual career choice in an era where bullfighting is considered a cruel and outdated sport, primarily due to issues of animal welfare. Social attitudes in some parts of Castellón, however, are not quite as progressive as those in nearby Valencia and Barcelona, and the boy's grandfather, unbothered by the controversy surrounding bullfighting, encourages his grandson to pursue it. A new documentary, The Boy and the Suit of Lights, which has just premiered at the Sheffield Documentary Festival, follows the child, Borja, and the relationship with his grandfather, Matias, over several years. Director Inma De Reyes, who is from Castellón, grew up with the bullring in the centre of her hometown and saw coverage of bullfights on television, but didn't realise her birthplace was considered Spain's bullfighting capital. \"It's a small city where time hasn't passed, people have very traditional jobs, they work in fishing, the orange fields, or bullfighting, and every so often there would be a traditional celebration which is religious. \"So I see my hometown as where nothing ever changes. That's why I left, I didn't fit in there, I wanted to explore the world and find out who I was outside of that place. \"And by coming back and making a film there, that's how I started to look more in depth at how families are putting values onto children and the children's personalities are being shaped.\" When de Reyes began looking into the subject for a documentary, her mother sent her local newspaper articles highlighting the bullfighting traditions, and the film-maker was opened up to a world she \"hadn't taken an interest\" in previously. \"My granddad owned books and posters about bullfighting, but I did think that was generations ago,\" de Reyes recalls. \"I didn't know how big the culture was.\" A friend of the Spanish director, who is now based in Edinburgh, connected her to a bullfighting school, through which she ultimately met Borja.\n\nDirector Inma de Reyes was unaware of her hometown's reputation as Spain's bullfighting capital\n\nThe practice sees the bullfighter, usually in bright and decorated clothing, attempt to subdue, immobilise, or kill a bull, in a ring in front of a live audience. It's clear from the film that Matias harbours his own unfulfilled dreams of becoming a professional bullfighter, and pins his ambitions on his grandson succeeding where he failed, partly in the hope it might help lift the family out of poverty. Coming from underprivileged background, Borja feels limited by a life with seemingly little opportunity, and goes along with his family's wishes to begin with. Producer Aimara Reques says becoming a bullfighter is \"a romantic idea\", adding: \"That's what Borja is holding on to.\" \"Everybody sees the bullfighter as a figure with status, you don't think of the killing. As a child, he's fantasising just as the family does. 'Oh, wow, he's going to be standing up there'. \"It's a theatrical event, it's quite camp in a sense, you dress up, the mothers are so proud. But then you have to kill the bull, that's the biggest paradox.\"\n\nAn industry in 'decay'\n\nFilmed over five years, The Boy and the Suit of Lights doesn't shy away from the controversy surrounding bullfighting. Borja watches as protestors storm the ring during one fight with banners which say \"No violence.\" However, for a film with bullfighting at its centre - it contains noticeably little bullfighting footage. Instead, it's the backdrop of a subtle coming-of-age story about adolescence, family and poverty. \"We knew that the film couldn't have bullfighting at the front,\" says de Reyes. \"Borja's coming-of-age story had to be front and centre, and also to make the film watchable. \"You can watch bullfighting on YouTube, I was not interested in capturing any more of that. It's more about forming a personality as a child.\" On a practical level, there also wasn't a huge number of bullfights taking place - only two took place as the documentary was shooting.\n\nAconite Productions The boys practice using a replica bull's head mounted on a wheel\n\nDe Reyes, who is now based in Edinburgh, describes Borja's personality as \"gentle and caring\" - a temprement possibly unsuited to the bullfighting world. \"At the beginning, I was very impressed by Borja's dedication and he was so diligent about his duty. He was almost like, 'this is what I've been told to do and this is what I'm going to do'. I thought he was an amazing child,\" says de Reyes. \"And as time goes by, I hope you can see in the film how his mind doesn't fully engage with the commitment of killing a bull. And I also felt that as a director, that Borja wasn't made for this, and he kind of knew it.\" The film includes footage of Borja and his brother rehearsing using replica bulls' heads mounted on wheeled frames, with their grandfather looking on. It also follows Borja in other settings - spending time with his friends and getting a traditional bullfighter's costume fitted. However, the challenge of putting Borja's own story front and centre was that, like many boys his age, he wasn't always prone to sharing his feelings. \"Making the film, I was trying to capture what Borja was thinking without him saying it,\" says de Reyes, \"because I don't feel like he would ever say to anybody that he wasn't going to do this - but you could tell. \"So trying to capture that in cinema, saying he's starting to have these thoughts, without any voiceovers or interviews, was really hard.\" She credits her cinematographer with capturing Borja's emotions via facial expressions and body language. \"You start to realise he's got a lot going on, just by looking at him.\"\n\nGetty Images Barcelona's last bullfights were held in 2011 (pictured) after the Catalan regional Parliament voted to ban bullfighting",
    "Jordan Bardella could be French PM at 28. But who is he really?": "Jordan Bardella could soon be French PM at 28. But for many he remains an enigma\n\n15 hours ago By Hugh Schofield , France Correspondent Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe French would dearly love to know who is the real Jordan Bardella. The question was interesting when Mr Bardella was merely president of the country’s biggest party, the far-right National Rally (RN). Now that he is being openly spoken of as the country’s next prime minister, it has become a matter of urgency. In two weeks the country goes to the polls in a snap election called by President Emmanuel Macron following his humiliation by the RN at the European elections last Sunday. If the RN has pulled off another big win after the second round of voting on July 7, then Macron will have no choice but to offer it a chance to govern. And if that happens, Mr Bardella – who shares the party leadership with Marine Le Pen – is expected to be named as prime minister. The French all know the basics about Mr Bardella, and his lightning rise from jobless school-leaver in the northern Paris suburbs to Le Pen protégé and president of the party. They know that he is ridiculously young, just 28, but that this seems to matter less nowadays, when experience no longer counts for much. The current president is just 46, and the prime minister 35. They know he is perpetually neat, that he speaks well, is ultra-presentable. But what he thinks, where he stands ideologically, what kind of person he is – these are unknowns. The French have the distinct feeling that the man they see is a package. Nicely-wrapped, but the contents are a mystery.\n\nJordan Bardella's potential was quickly spotted by Marine Le Pen\n\nThe official version of Mr Bardella – the one on the label – is a young man who grew up in a deprived estate in Seine-Saint-Denis and after living with the scourge of drugs, poverty, lawlessness and uncontrolled immigration came to believe that only the hard-right had the answer. This is “le story-telling”, a French borrowing from the world of marketing. As he himself has said: “I am in politics because of everything I lived through there. To stop that becoming the norm for the whole of France. Because what happens there is not normal.” The truth is more nuanced. Mr Bardella was indeed brought up by his single mother, Luisa, in the Cité Gabriel-Péri in the town of Saint-Denis, so his experience is real enough. Both his parents are of Italian origin, and his father had an Algerian grandmother. But Mr Bardella’s father, Olivier, who moved out when Jordan was very young, ran a drinks distribution business, and was relatively well off. He lived in the commuter town of Montmorency. And Mr Bardella did not go to the nearest state school, but to a semi-private Catholic establishment popular with the middle-classes. “The young Bardella had a foot on either side of the tracks,” said Pierre-Stéphane Fort, the author of a critical biography of the RN president. For a recent profile in Le Monde newspaper, the authors went back to Saint-Denis to find friends and acquaintances of the young Mr Bardella. They found he had left little trace. Friends – of mixed racial backgrounds -- remembered that he was a fan of video games, and set up a YouTube channel to discuss the latest releases. They recalled that he had given literacy classes to immigrants after hours at his lycée when he was 16. But they did not remember any particular interest in far-right politics. “My theory is that he looked around the political world and spotted the place where there was the best chance of climbing the ladder,” Chantal Chatelain, a teacher at his lycée, told Le Monde. Mr Bardella joined the party at 17, and his rise was meteoric. It happened because he became part of Ms Le Pen’s outer circle. Much at the top of the RN operates around personal relationships and clan loyalties, as it did when Ms Le Pen's father, Jean-Marie, was at the helm of the party that was then known as the Front National (FN). Mr Bardella became the boyfriend of the daughter of an old FN hand, Frederick Chatillon.\n\nJordan Bardella joined the Front National age 17\n\nWithin days of being introduced to Le Pen in 2017, she had named him the party spokesman. In 2019 she asked him to head the party’s candidate list at the European elections, which the RN won. He became an MEP. Then in 2022, she made him party president. According to Pascal Humeau, a media trainer who worked with Mr Bardella for four years, Ms Le Pen spotted straightaway how the young man – with his perfect tale of banlieue hardship – would be of service to the party. She called him her “lion cub.” But Mr Humeau is far from complimentary about Mr Bardella himself. The two parted ways after a row over money, so his testimony needs to be treated with caution. But today he describes the RN leader as a product of pure PR. “He was an empty shell. In terms of content there wasn’t much there,” Mr Humeau said. “He didn’t read much. He wasn’t curious. He just absorbed the elements of language given him by Marine.” Mr Humeau said he worked for months on getting Mr Bardella to shed his stiff bearing, and to smile more naturally. “I had to humanise the cyborg. My job was to get people who would otherwise hate him to say, ‘huh! for a fascist he’s nice!’” The biographer Pierre-Stephane Fort is another critic of Mr Bardella who says there is little substance behind the personable image. “He is a chameleon. He adapts perfectly to the environment around him,” he said. “And he is a chronic opportunist. There is no ideology there. He’s pure strategy. He senses where the wind is blowing, and gets in there early.” Indeed, identifying Mr Bardella with any of the RN’s different courants or political clans is impossible. At different times he has been with the “social” wing, with its focus on the poor and building social housing, and the “identity” wing with its focus on race and preserving French culture. But mainly he goes where Ms Le Pen goes. Like her, and the party as a whole, he has a general standpoint built around a tough response to crime and immigration, and has spoken of France being “submerged by migrants”. But on specifics, the answers are left deliberately hazy.\n\nEmmanuel Macron shocked France when he called an election\n\nOn the stump with Mr Bardella, there is no denying his popularity. Young women think he is “gorgeous”, and he has a smile and a selfie for everyone. But watch for a while, and you see the smile routine coming round again rather too automatically. And listen for a while, and you hear the same tropes and formulae coming round again too. At a recent TV debate with the prime minister Gabriel Attal, Mr Bardella held his own, but it was obvious who was the smarter. Luckily for Mr Bardella, Mr Attal blew his advantage by adopting a constant smirk – exactly the kind of condescension that the RN feeds on. For Ms Le Pen, the lion cub has been a huge asset, and has allowed her to broaden the party’s appeal far beyond its traditional social categories. With his TikTok habit, Mr Bardella obviously connects with the young. He regularly posts short videos of himself (which have been packaged up by a media company) to his 1.3 million followers. He also has a good rating among graduates, pensioners and city-dwellers – segments that have proved resistant to the RN in the past. But the question has still not been answered. Is his appeal merely the result of brilliant communication, or is this a man with the right stuff to run the country? He is 28, never went to university, and has no experience of government. He has never held a job outside the RN, apart from a month one summer at his father’s company. Until recently, this would have made it inconceivable that he be named prime minister of France. But do the old rules still apply?",
    "Bengal famine: Susannah's grandad ran Bengal as famine killed millions": "Susannah's grandad ran Bengal when famine killed millions\n\n15 hours ago By Kavita Puri , Presenter, Three Million podcast Share\n\nBBC\n\n\"I feel enormous shame about what happened,\" Susannah Herbert tells me. Her grandfather was the governor of Bengal, in British India, during the run-up and height of the 1943 famine which killed at least three million people. She is only just learning about his significant role in the catastrophe, and confronting a complex family legacy. When I first meet her, she is clutching a photograph from 1940. It's Christmas Day at the governor's residence in Bengal. It's formal, with people sitting in rows, in their finery, staring straight into camera. In the front are the dignitaries - Viceroy Linlithgow, one of the most important colonial figures in India, and her grandfather Sir John Herbert, Bengal's governor. At their feet is a little boy, in a white shirt and shorts, knee-high socks and shiny shoes. It's Susannah's father.\n\nSusannah Herbert Susannah's father, the boy in white in this picture from 1940, told her little of her grandfather\n\nHe had told her some stories of growing up in India, like the day Father Christmas came in on an elephant, but not much more. But little was spoken of her grandfather, who died in late 1943. The causes of the famine are many and complex. While John Herbert was the most important colonial figure in Bengal, he was part of a wider colonial structure. He reported to his bosses in Delhi, who reported to theirs in London. Dr Janam Mukherjee, historian and the author of Hungry Bengal, tells me Herbert \"was the colonial official most directly linked to the famine because he was the chief executive of the province of Bengal at that time\". One of the policies he executed during World War Two was known as \"denial\", where boats and rice – the staple food – were confiscated or destroyed in thousands of villages. It was done because of the fear of a Japanese invasion and the aim was to deny the enemy local resources to fuel their advance into India. However, the colonial policy was catastrophic for the already fragile local economy. Fishermen couldn't go to sea, farmers weren't able to go upstream to their plots, and artisans were unable to get their goods to market. Critically, rice could not be moved around.\n\nHerbert family Susannah says there is no doubt the policies of Sir John Herbert, pictured here with his wife Lady Mary in 1940, \"contributed enormously to the scale and impact of the famine\"\n\nInflation was already high, as the colonial government in Delhi was printing money to pay for the vast war effort on the Asian front. The hundreds of thousands of Allied soldiers in Kolkata - then Calcutta - were straining food resources. Rice imports to Bengal from Burma had halted after it fell to the Japanese. Rice was hoarded, often for profit. And a deadly cyclone hit, wiping out much of Bengal's rice crop. Repeated demands - in the middle of the war - to the war cabinet and Prime Minister Winston Churchill for food imports were denied or partially heeded at the time. The numbers who died are overwhelming. I wondered why Susannah, the granddaughter of Bengal’s governor, felt shame so many decades later. She tries to explain. \"When I was young there was something almost glamorous about having a connection with the British Empire.\" She says she used to borrow a lot of her grandfather's old clothes. \"There were silk scarves, with a nametape saying 'Made in British India'. \"And now when I see them at the back of a cupboard, I kind of shudder and say, why would I even want to wear these things? Because the words 'British India' on the label seem inappropriate to wear now.\"\n\nHerbert family Scarves with British India labels don't feel appropriate today, Susannah finds\n\nSusannah is determined to know more about her grandfather's life in British India, and to make sense of things. She is reading everything she can on the Bengal famine, going through stacks of her grandparents' papers at the Herbert archive in the family home in Wales. They're kept in a climate-controlled room, and an archivist visits once a month. She starts to realise more about her grandfather. \"There's absolutely no doubt that the policies he implemented and initiated contributed enormously to the scale and impact of the famine. \"He had skills, he had honour. And he should not have been appointed to the post of running the lives of 60 million people in a faraway corner of the British Empire. He just should not have been appointed.\" In the family archive she found a letter from Lady Mary, her grandmother, written to her husband in 1939, on hearing he had been offered the job of governor. It's a letter of pros and cons. She clearly had no desire for them to go, though she writes she would accept whatever decision he took.\n\n\"You read them [the letters] with hindsight, you read them knowing what the writer and reader did not know. If you could reach out to the past, you'd say: don't do it. Don't go, don't go to India. You will not do a good job.\" Over the months I have been following Susannah Herbert’s journey into the past, she has had many detailed questions about her grandfather. She has been keen to meet Janam Mukherjee, the historian, to ask him directly. They meet in June. Janam admits he never imagined he would ever be sitting opposite the granddaughter of John Herbert. Susannah wants to know why her grandfather, a provincial MP and government whip, was appointed in the first place, when he had virtually no experience of Indian politics, beyond a brief spell in Delhi as a young officer. \"It's part and parcel of colonialism and stems from an idea of supremacy,\" Janam explains. \"Some MP who has no colonial experience, who has no linguistic capacities, who has not worked in a political system outside of Britain, can simply go and inhabit the governor's house in Kolkata, and make decisions about an entire population of people that he knows nothing about.\"\n\nGetty Images Sir Archibald Wavell, Viceroy of India from late 1943, visiting victims of the famine\n\nWhile Herbert was not popular among elected Indian politicians in Bengal, even his seniors in Delhi seem to have doubted his competence, including Viceroy Linlithgow. \"Linlithgow called him the weakest of the governors in India. They, in fact, were interested in removing him, but they were worried about how that might be received,\" says Janam. \"That is hard listening,\" Susannah replies. I am struck that for both there is a personal connection. Janam and Susannah had fathers in Kolkata who were little boys at the same time but were living completely different lives. They've both died now. Susannah at least has photographs. For Janam, there were no pictures of his father as a child. \"So what I knew was from his nightmares and from the few stories he told me of his experience in childhood, in a colonized war zone. \"I come from a sense of trying to think about my father's very damaged life and understand how that impacts me as his descendant.\" And then he says something I wasn't expecting. \"My grandfather also worked for the colonial police force. So my grandfather himself was complicit with the colonial system in many ways. So there are these interesting similarities in our motivations of understanding.\"\n\nAt least three million people died in the Bengal famine and there is no memorial - or even a plaque - to them anywhere in the world. Susannah can at least point to a memorial to her grandfather. \"The church where we worship has a plaque honouring him.\" She explains it's in the absence of a grave. She's not sure where his remains are, perhaps in Kolkata. Honour is a word that Susannah used to describe her grandfather, even though she acknowledges his failures. \"While I find it relatively easy to accept that history is much more complicated than what we were originally told, I still find it hard to envisage John Herbert […] acting in any way, dishonourably.\" Janam takes a different view. \"These questions of intention have never interested me in many ways. I'm much more interested in the historical course of events because I think intentions can always mask what happens.\"\n\nSusannah suggests it is hard to imagine her grandfather acting dishonourably, but Janam says he is more interested in studying historical events than intentions",
    "Ultra-running: Inside the mind of the woman who ran 1000km in 12 days": "'I feel broken': Inside the mind of the woman who ran 1,000km in 12 days\n\n15 hours ago By Kelly Ng , BBC News Share\n\nProject 1000 Natalie ran at least 84km a day - the equivalent of two marathons\n\n\"I just have to take one step, one kilometre at a time… Ultra-running is a love-hate relationship,\" said Natalie Dau, in a voice message she recorded somewhere along the eastern coast of Malaysia. The 52-year-old had covered a third of her 1,000km run from Thailand to Singapore, and the going was getting tough. \"Today is the first time in four days I have questioned if I would actually finish this thing. I love the challenge of the sport, love the rawness of it all, but hate these low points. And they come often,\" she said. Natalie had to clock at least 84km a day - the equivalent of two marathons - to achieve her goal of finishing her run in 12 days. Natalie is an ultra-runner - they race distances that exceed 42.2km, the length of a marathon. But she has not trained as an athlete all her life. She began racing only in her late 30s to get fitter. While running has taken off globally, most data shows that growth in Western countries. Figures for Asia are hard to come by, although several countries in the region host popular marathons, such as Taiwan, Cambodia and Japan. The challenge is finding more takers among non-professional athletes who, like Natalie, run for causes, often documenting their arduous runs on social media. \"Whether you come in first or last, it doesn't matter. You've done something almost superhuman, something that only 0.05% of the world’s population will ever do,\" she said. But it takes a toll. She was sunburnt and exhausted from running for hours under the searing South East Asian sun. Her hip had started to seize up on the first day. On day three, she got a urinary tract infection. She eventually crossed the finish line in downtown Singapore on 5 June, along with hundreds of runners who had come to support her on a weekday. Clad in bright running gear, they ran through the city's industrial estates in the early hours, just as daily-wage workers, with their backpacks and plastic lunch bags in tow, made their way to work.\n\nProject 1000\n\nTwelve days of ups and downs\n\n\"The longest I have run before this was 200km,\" Natalie told the BBC the day after she finished her run. \"I was looking for a different way to challenge myself.\" She had the idea to run from the Thai border, through Malaysia, to Singapore in September. Over the next eight months, several friends came on board to help plan for the run, which was later named Project 1000. \"I was a bit naive back then and knew little about what planning for such a run would take. My team asked me things I hadn’t thought of - what happens if you need a hospital? How do we plan the border crossings? How many safety vans will we need?\" Through the 12-day ultra-marathon, Natalie sent nightly voice notes to the BBC recapping the highs and lows of each day. On day five, she said: \"We had a moment to have some breakfast from a roadside stall and enjoyed the view for five minutes before we headed off again. Today was a good day, but I’m not expecting all days to be good. We’ve still got a long way to go.\"\n\nProject 1000 Getting up each day was the “scariest”, Natalie said\n\nShe and her team would sleep just two to three hours each night because they decided on day three that she should start running shortly after midnight to beat the heat. \"Finishing dinner at 8pm and setting your alarm for 11.30pm is not a lot of fun,\" she said in another message. Getting up each day was the \"scariest\", Natalie said after the run. \"I would wake up every morning wondering, 'What if I can't run today?'\" \"The finish line is so far away, you can't envisage it. I couldn't even see the end-of-the-day finish line… You have to get your head mentally in the zone without knowing what that finish line looks like.\" Nearing the end, she described her body as \"feeling extremely broken\". She plastered her toes because they \"were all blistered\". \"I am struggling to walk, tired and just want to get home and see my family. I’ll try to enjoy tomorrow, but I really can’t wait to cross the border [into Singapore], to be honest,\" she said in her note on day 10.\n\n'Ultra-runners want to get uncomfortable'\n\nUltra-runners are \"a certain personality type\", Natalie said. \"In some parts of the world, we all live pretty comfortably. [So] people are trying to get a bit more uncomfortable, and ultra-running is a really good way to do that.\" Beyond that sense of personal achievement, Natalie said she had hoped that Project 1000 would empower women. The run raised about S$50,000 (US$37,000) for GRLS, a charity funding projects that encourage more girls and women to play sports. \"Whether people donated or not, it was a platform to get a message out,\" Natalie said. \"Also, doing this as an older female, I really wanted to prove to people that you can keep challenging [yourselves]. We’re only limited by our own beliefs.\" Ultra-running of this level, however, remains a privilege because it takes time and often needs sponsors and support staff.\n\nProject 1000 Ultra-runners are of “a certain personality type”, Natalie says",

The post reads: \"We love you, Papa. Happy Father's Day\", followed by two red hearts and signed \"G, C & L\". In the picture, taken by Catherine, the Princess of Wales, William can be seen standing on a beach with his arms round his children, looking out to sea. Kensington Palace said it was taken on a trip to the Norfolk coast last month.\n\nIt marks the first time that a personal message from the prince's three children has been posted on the family's social media accounts.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, William posted his own Father's Day tribute, to his father, King Charles III. The prince shared a photograph of himself as a child, playing football with the King in the gardens of Kensington Palace. Taken on 12 June 1984, the then nearly two-year-old prince can be seen smiling while kicking a brightly coloured football. A few months after the picture was taken, William’s younger brother would be born – the Duke of Sussex. The post is personally signed off by the prince, with the caption: “Happy Father’s Day, Pa.” As well as marking Father’s Day, it’s also a potential nod to the England football team, who start their Euro 2024 campaign later on Sunday.\n\nPA Media The photo was taken in June 1984, just before Prince William's second birthday",

    "Afghanistan: What happened to the women who protested against the Taliban?": "What happened to the women who took on the Taliban?\n\n2 days ago By Mahjooba Nowrouzi , BBC Afghan Service Share\n\nParwana Ibrahimkhail Nijrabi Parwana Ibrahimkhail Nijrabi was imprisoned after protesting against the Taliban\n\nAfter the Taliban restricted Afghan women's ability to work, learn and go out in public, some women initially defied these new rules, taking to the streets to protest. But soon, those who gathered in the capital Kabul and other major cities to demand \"food, work, freedom\" felt the full force of the Taliban. Protesters tell the BBC they were beaten, abused, jailed and even threatened with death by stoning. We speak to three women who challenged the Taliban government after it began to place restrictions on women's freedom following the Taliban's takeover on 15 August 2021.\n\nMarching through Kabul\n\nGetty Despite protests against Taliban rules, participation of Afghan women in employment has fallen drastically since the takeover\n\nWhen Taliban militants took over Kabul on 15 August 2021, Zakia's life began to crumble. She had been the breadwinner for her family before the Taliban returned to power - but quickly lost her job following the takeover. When Zakia (who is using a pseudonym) joined a protest more than a year later in December 2022, it was her first chance to express her anger at losing the right to work and to education. Protesters were marching to Kabul University, chosen for its \"symbolic importance\", but were stopped before they could reach their destination. Zakia was loudly shouting slogans when Taliban armed police put an end to her short-lived rebellion. \"One of them pointed his gun right into my mouth and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't shut up,\" she recalls. Zakia saw fellow protesters bundled into a vehicle. \"I resisted. They were twisting my arms,\" she says. \"I was being pulled by the Taliban who were trying to load me into their vehicle and other fellow protesters who were trying to release me.\" In the end, Zakia managed to escape - but what she saw that day left her terrified for the future. \"Violence was not taking place behind closed doors any more,\" she says, \"it was taking place on the streets of capital Kabul in full public view.\"\n\nArrested and punched\n\nMariam (not her real name) and 23-year-old student Parwana Ibrahimkhail Nijrabi were among the many Afghan protesters who were detained after the Taliban takeover. As a widow and sole breadwinner for her children, Mariam was terrified she wouldn't be able to provide for her family when the Taliban introduced rules restricting women's ability to work. She attended a protest in December 2022. After she saw fellow protesters being arrested, she tried to flee but didn't get away in time.\n\nGetty Images The Taliban government is increasingly intolerant towards protests like this one, which took place in Kabul in April 2023\n\n\"I was forcefully pulled out of the taxi, they searched my bag and found my phone,\" she recalls. When she refused to give Taliban officials her pass code, she says one of them punched her so hard she thought her ear drum had burst. They then went through the videos and photos in her phone. \"They got furious and grabbed me by pulling my hair,\" she says. \"They caught my hands and legs and threw me into the back of their Ranger.\" \"They were very violent and repeatedly called me a whore,\" Mariam continues. \"They handcuffed me and put a black bag over my head, I could not breathe.\" A month later, Parwana too decided to protest against the Taliban, along with a group of fellow students, organising several marches. But their action was also met with swift reprisal. \"They started torturing me from the moment they arrested me\", says Parwana. She was made to sit between two male armed guards. \"When I refused to sit there, they moved me to the front, put a blanket over my head and pointed the gun and told me not to move.\" Parwana started feeling \"weak and like a walking dead\" among so many heavily armed men. \"My face was numb as they slapped me so many times. I was so scared, my entire body was trembling.\"\n\nLife in jail\n\nMariam, Parwana and Zakia were fully aware of the potential consequences of public protest. Parwana says she never expected the Taliban to \"treat her like a human being\". But she says she was still stunned by her degrading treatment. Her first meal in jail left her in shock. \"I felt a sharp thing scratching the roof of my mouth,\" she says. \"When I looked at it, it was a nail - I threw up.\" In subsequent meals, she found hair and stones. Parwana says she was told she would be stoned to death, leaving her crying herself to sleep at night and having dreams about being stoned while wearing a helmet. The 23-year-old was accused of promoting immorality, prostitution and spreading western culture and was in jail for about a month. Mariam was kept in a security unit for several days, where she was interrogated with a black bag covering her head. \"I could hear several people, one would kick me and ask who paid me to organise [the] protest,\" she recalls. \"The other would punch me and say 'Who do you work for?'\" Mariam says she told her interrogators she was a widow who needed work to feed her children - but says her answers were met with more violence.\n\nParwana Ibrahimkhail Nijrabi Parwana is continuing her activism from abroad\n\nConfession and release\n\nParwana and Mariam were both separately released following intervention by human rights organisations and local elders, and they are now no longer living in Afghanistan. Both say they were forced to sign confessions admitting their guilt and promising not to take part in any protests against the Taliban. Their male relatives also signed official papers pledging that the women would not take part in any more protests. We put these allegations to Zabihullah Mujahid, senior spokesman of the Taliban government, who confirmed women protesters were arrested but denied they were badly treated. \"Some of the women who were arrested were involved in activities that were against the government and against public safety,\" he said. He disputes the women's account and denies torture was used: \"There is no beating in any of the Islamic Emirate's prisons and their food is also approved by our medical teams.\"\n\nLack of basic facilities\n\nHuman Rights Watch's own interviews with some protesters following their release corroborated the accounts heard by the BBC. \"The Taliban use all kinds of tortures and they even make their families pay for these protests, sometimes they imprison them with their children in terrible conditions,\" said Ferishtah Abbasi of HRW. Amnesty International researcher Zaman Soltani, who spoke to several protesters after they were released, said prisons lacked basic facilities. \"There is no heating system in winter, prisoners are not given good or enough food and health and safety issues are not taken into consideration at all,\" Soltani said.\n\nLonging for a normal life\n\nGetty A group of Afghan women protesting in Herat in September 2021 to urge the Taliban to allow their daughters to continue going to school",

    "Are animals conscious? Some scientists now think they are": "Are animals conscious? How new research is changing minds\n\n15 hours ago By Pallab Ghosh , @BBCPallab, Science Correspondent Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nCharles Darwin enjoys a near god-like status among scientists for his theory of evolution. But his ideas that animals are conscious in the same way humans are have long been shunned. Until now. \"There is no fundamental difference between man and animals in their ability to feel pleasure and pain, happiness, and misery,\" Darwin wrote. But his suggestion that animals think and feel was seen as scientific heresy among many, if not most animal behaviour experts. Attributing consciousness to animals based on their responses was seen as a cardinal sin. The argument went that projecting human traits, feelings, and behaviours onto animals had no scientific basis and there was no way of testing what goes on in animals’ minds. But if new evidence emerges of animals’ abilities to feel and process what is going on around them, could that mean they are, in fact, conscious? We now know that bees can count, recognise human faces and learn how to use tools. Prof Lars Chittka of Queen Mary University of London has worked on many of the major studies of bee intelligence. \"If bees are that intelligent, maybe they can think and feel something, which are the building blocks of consciousness,\" he says. Prof Chittka’s experiments showed that bees would modify their behaviour following a traumatic incident and seemed to be able to play, rolling small wooden balls, which he says they appeared to enjoy as an activity. These results have persuaded one of the most influential and respected scientists in animal research to make this strong, stark and contentious statement: \"Given all the evidence that is on the table, it is quite likely that bees are conscious,\" he said. It isn't just bees. Many say that it is now time to think again, with the emergence of new evidence they say marks a \"sea change\" in thinking on the science of animal consciousness. They include Prof Jonathan Birch of the London School of Economics. \"We have researchers from different fields starting to dare to ask questions about animal consciousness and explicitly think about how their research might be relevant to those questions,\" says Prof Birch.\n\nwikimedia/canvas\n\nAnyone looking for a eureka moment will be disappointed. Instead, a steady growth of evidence for a rethink has led to murmurings among the researchers involved. Now, many want a change in scientific thinking in the field. What has been discovered may not amount to conclusive proof of animal consciousness, but taken together, it is enough to suggest that there is \"a realistic possibility\" that animals are capable of consciousness, according to Prof Birch. This applies not only to what are known as higher animals such as apes and dolphins who have reached a more advanced stage of development than other animals. It also applies to simpler creatures, such as snakes, octopuses, crabs, bees and possibly even fruit flies, according to the group, who want funding for more research to determine whether animals are conscious, and if so, to what extent. But if you're wondering what we even mean by consciousness, you're not alone. It’s something scientists can’t even agree on. An early effort came in the 17th century, by the French philosopher René Descartes who said: \"I think therefore I am.\" He added that \"language is the only certain sign of thought hidden in a body\". But those statements have muddied the waters for far too long, according to Prof Anil Seth of Sussex University, who has been wrestling with the definition of consciousness for much of his professional career. \"This unholy trinity, of language, intelligence and consciousness goes back all the way to Descartes,\" he told BBC News, with a degree of annoyance at the lack of questioning of this approach until recently. The \"unholy trinity\" is at the core of a movement called behaviourism, which emerged in the early 20th Century. It says that thoughts and feelings cannot be measured by scientific methods and so should be ignored when analysing behaviour. Many animal behaviour experts were schooled in this view, but it is beginning to make way for a less human-centred approach, according to Prof Seth. \"Because we see things through a human lens, we tend to associate consciousness with language and intelligence. Just because they go together in us, it doesn’t mean they go together in general.\"\n\nwikimedia/canvas\n\nSome are very critical of some uses of the word consciousness. \"The field is replete with weasel words and unfortunately one of those is consciousness,\" says Prof Stevan Harnad of Quebec University. \"It is a word that is confidently used by a lot of people, but they all mean something different, and so it is not clear at all what it means.\" He says that a better, less weasley, word is \"sentience\", which is more tightly defined as the capacity to feel. \"To feel everything, a pinch, to see the colour red, to feel tired and hungry, those are all things you feel,\" says Prof Harnad. Others who have been instinctively sceptical of the idea of animals being conscious say that the new broader interpretation of what it means to be conscious makes a difference. Dr Monique Udell, from Oregon State University, says she comes from a behaviourist background. \"If we look at distinct behaviours, for example what species can recognise themselves in a mirror, how many can plan ahead or are able to remember things that happened in the past, we are able to test these questions with experimentation and observation and draw more accurate conclusions based on data,\" she says. \"And if we are going to define consciousness as a sum of measurable behaviours, then animals that have succeeded in these particular tasks can be said to have something that we choose to call consciousness.\" This is a much narrower definition of consciousness than the new group is promoting, but a respectful clash of ideas is what science is all about, according to Dr Udell. \"Having people who take ideas with a grain of salt and cast a critical eye is important because if we don’t come at these questions in different ways, then it is going to be harder to progress.\" But what next? Some say far more animals need to be studied for the possibility of consciousness than is currently the case. \"Right now, most of the science is done on humans and monkeys and we are making the job much harder than it needs to be because we are not learning about consciousness in its most basic form,\" says Kristin Andrews, a professor of philosophy specialising in animal minds at York university in Toronto. Prof Andrews and many others believe that research on humans and monkeys is the study of higher level consciousness – exhibited in the ability to communicate and feel complex emotions – whereas an octopus or snake may also have a more basic level of consciousness that we are ignoring by not investigating it. Prof Andrews was among the prime movers of the New York Declaration on Animal Consciousness signed earlier this year, which has so far been signed by 286 researchers. The short four paragraph declaration states that it is “irresponsible” to ignore the possibility of animal consciousness. \"We should consider welfare risks and use the evidence to inform our responses to these risks,\" it says. Chris Magee is from Understanding Animal Research, a UK body backed by research organisations and companies that undertake animal experiments. He says animals already are assumed to be conscious when it comes to whether to conduct experiments on them and says UK regulations require that experiments should be conducted only if the benefits to medical research outweigh the suffering caused. \"There is enough evidence for us to have a precautionary approach,\" he says. But there is also a lot we don’t know, including about decapod crustaceans such as crabs, lobsters, crayfish, and shrimp. \"We don’t know very much about their lived experience, or even basic things like the point at which they die. \"And this is important because we need to set rules to protect them either in the lab or in the wild.\" A government review led by Prof Birch in 2021 assessed 300 scientific studies on the sentience of decapods and Cephalopods, which include octopus, squid, and cuttlefish. Prof Birch’s team found that there was strong evidence that these creatures were sentient in that they could experience feelings of pain, pleasure, thirst, hunger, warmth, joy, comfort and excitement. The conclusions led to the government including these creatures into its Animal Welfare (Sentience) Act in 2022. \"Issues related to octopus and crab welfare have been neglected,\" says Prof Birch. \"The emerging science should encourage society to take these issues a bit more seriously.\" There are millions of different types of animals and precious little research has been carried out on how they experience the world. We know a bit about bees and other researchers have shown indications of conscious behaviour in cockroaches and even fruit flies but there are so many other experiments to be done involving so many other animals. It is a field of study that the modern-day heretics who have signed the New York Declaration claim has been neglected, even ridiculed. Their approach, to say the unsayable and risk sanction is nothing new. Around the same time that Rene Descartes was saying \"I think therefore I am\", the Catholic church found the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei \"vehemently suspect of heresy\" for suggesting that the Earth was not the centre of the Universe. It was a shift in thinking that opened our eyes to a truer, richer picture of the Universe and our place in it. Shifting ourselves from the centre of the Universe a second time may well do the same for our understanding of ourselves as well as the other living things with whom we share the planet.",
    "Avicii's dad on his son's legacy, mental health and survivor's guilt": "Avicii’s dad: 'I miss him every minute, but I get angry at him for leaving'\n\n14 hours ago By Alex Taylor , @tayloredword, BBC News Culture reporter Share\n\nGetty Images The Bergling family want people to know Tim, their son behind the Avicii moniker\n\nOn April 20, 2018, the world lost a music superstar, chart-topping DJ Avicii. Aged just 28, he tragically took his own life while on holiday in Oman. For Klas Bergling, he lost his son, Tim. \"I miss him every minute,\" Klas Bergling shares over a candid, deeply personal video call. \"Of course, I talk to him every day. But,\" he pauses, \"I admit, I get angry at him sometimes. Why did you do it? Why did you leave us?\" Avicii rose to fame as explosively as the bouncing synths on his breakout smash Levels. The 2011 hit, joyously sampling Etta James' \"good feeling\" refrain, catapulted the then 22-year-old Swede to pop superstardom. Over the next five years, as club dance music evolved into the ubiquitous, chart-topping genre known as EDM, with Levels as its anthem, Avicii became its blond, high-cheekboned poster boy - reportedly earning $250,000 (£180,000) a night on tour. Avicii: The superstar DJ behind some of the decade's biggest hits But at 26, he retired from live shows. In a personal note to fans, he referenced his physical and mental health without detailing the full extent of his struggles, which involved anxiety, pancreatitis, alcohol and painkiller addiction. Despite a period of recovery - producing music away from the spotlight - Tim continued to struggle with inner demons in his search for existential answers about his life. Two years later, the darkness overcame him a final, fatal time. If you are affected by any of the issues in this story, the BBC Action Line has information about services that can provide support and advice.\n\nBjörn Terring/Avicii Music AB\n\nNow, his family wants people to know Tim beyond the stage lights, releasing a picture book to honour his legacy. It’s part of the the family's efforts through the Tim Bergling Foundation, set up in his memory in 2019, to open up the conversation around the mental health crisis among young people. Klas, who carefully curated the pictures from Tim's childhood to his superstar life, explains: \"We want to help people see beyond the Avicii fame. That's also why we named his posthumous album 'Tim.'\" Reflecting on the deep connection fans still feel, shown by the thousands of letters and memoriam messages on his website, Klas says: “Tim meant a lot to young people - his music, his lyrics, and his person. \"At first, I didn’t understand why, but then a fan said, 'Tim was authentic.' I understood. Many young people relate to that authenticity, his honesty, and struggles.\"\n\nMillennial star\n\nTim found fame the millennial way, by posting tracks online. He adopted the name Avicii in 2008, a reference to Buddhist levels of hell after discovering his own name was taken on MySpace. Signed briefly by BBC Radio 1 DJ Pete Tong after winning a talent competition, he caught the attention of DJ Laidback Luke by posting on his forum. But Tim struggled with anxiety from a young age, often having catastrophic thoughts and fearing he had cancer. Cannabis use led to fears of madness, disassociation, and derealisation. Klas recalls Tim having intense \"identity questions\" during adolescence. After a few meetings with a psychologist, Tim felt better. However, touring exacerbated his anxiety. A text message in Tim’s 2021 biography revealed Klas' concerns: \"Hi Tim, hoping your inspiration is enough for this huge tour, with gigs every day. One needs to pause and breathe a little, but it’s your choice. Kisses and hugs. Your old man.\" The hectic schedule took its toll. As Levels garnered nearly 20 million views on YouTube before its official release, Tim's tour included performances across the US, New Zealand, Australia, and Asia, often doing multiple shows in different cities on the same day.\n\nCim Ek/Avicii Music AB Avicii's dad is publishing previously unseen photos in a book\n\nTo soothe his nerves, Tim turned to alcohol. \"I found the magical cure of just having a couple of drinks before going on,\" he said in the documentary Avicii: True Stories. This dependence grew as he travelled, telling GQ in 2013: \"You’re travelling around, you live in a suitcase, you get to this place, there’s free alcohol everywhere.\" In 2012, he embarked on a 26-day US tour, which triggered stomach pains from his drinking, leading to hospitalisation and opioid prescriptions for worsening pancreatitis, starting a cycle of health issues and addiction. The following year in Australia, his pancreatitis returned, but he refused gallbladder removal to avoid cancelling more dates and was prescribed opioids again. His appendix eventually ruptured, forcing surgery.\n\nKlas emphasises the need for systemic change in the music industry, but is careful to avoid individual blame. \"I still think that [record] labels, touring people, agents and managers should really have a driver's licence to show they are fit. This is the way artists should be handled,\" he asserts. While he acknowledges some positive changes since Tim's death, noting that \"Swedish managers at major labels are more aware nowadays\", he stresses that more comprehensive measures are necessary to ensure artist wellbeing.\n\nSurvivor’s guilt\n\nTim’s health problems coincided with his (now Grammy nominated) commercial success. His debut album True, which introduced country sounds, produced hits like Wake Me Up and Hey Brother. By 2015, his mental state had deteriorated with pill abuse, anger outbursts and erratic behaviour. Despite promising his second album Stories would be his best, his struggles led to delays, on-stage nihilism and clashes with paparazzi. That summer, Klas and his management knew something had to be done. With a therapist, they planned an intervention in Ibiza. In a Times interview, Klas said he felt he betrayed his son. I ask what he meant and his eyes well. \"You confront your child who is completely unaware of what's going to happen.\" Tim's distressed reaction was evident. \"You see that he realises something is planned behind his back.\"\n\nGetty Images Klas speaking at a 2021 tribute concert for Avicii to raise mental health awareness\n\nBut it was necessary, Klas says. \"There is no doubt about doing it, but coming to that point is not easy.\" Tim, always stubborn, appeared confused, thinking he was being criticised despite working endlessly. After hours of resistance, he agreed to rehab, telling Klas: \"I had decided hours ago but just wanted to test you.\" Klas smiles, feeling proud of his son's \"bravery\". After rehab, Tim fought to escape what he described as the \"machine that was Avicii\" and quit working with his manager.\n\nHillergen Andreas/Aftonbladet/IBL Bildbyrå Avicii's parents Klas and actress Anki Liden stand behind him on stage in 2016\n\nThe Avicii: True Stories documentary, completed before his death, depicted Tim on a beach, apparently at peace no longer touring. The reality of his suicide had to be added as a jarring post-script. Klas admits the grief is compounded by the fact that \"my wife and his brothers and sister were glad that he was improving in many ways.\" It \"may sound contradictory, but that's the way it was - he was improving\". Klas explains guilt is \"such a big burden\" for survivors, who often ask, \"what have I done wrong?\" He acknowledges, as therapists have told him, \"many times you cannot do anything.\"\n\n'50-year legacy'\n\nThis confusion of loss highlights the universal impact of suicide on those left behind as well as the direct victims. The foundation's funding supported Sweden's new national suicide prevention hotline, with the government working on legislation to better investigate suicide. It is part of Klas’ 50-year plan to cement his son’s legacy. At a tribute concert, Klas promised to push suicide up the political agenda. \"We tried to get as many young people there as possible, as well as politicians.” Klas recalls. \"One of the most impactful moments was a big group of parents coming up on stage who had lost their children to suicide. It was such a strong moment.\"\n\nPrivate/Avicii Music AB",
    "Continuous glucose monitors on the rise after FDA approval": "Going down the 'rabbit hole' of wearable blood-sugar monitors\n\n1 day ago By Holly Honderich , BBC News Share\n\nGetty Images Continuous glucose monitors have become powerful tools for those living with diabetes\n\nBlood-sugar monitoring devices could soon be on the arms of millions of Americans after regulators cleared two new devices for use without a prescription. Is it a way to improve our health? Or is the data just another distraction? In the middle of the night last June, Cindy Bekkedam woke up to the sound of an unfamiliar alarm. It was loud, like an emergency alert, and it was coming from her phone. More specifically, it was coming from a newly installed app linked to a glucose sensor embedded in her arm. According to this app, her blood sugar had dropped to a concerning low while she slept, which had triggered the alarm. “So I got up in the middle of the night and ate a granola bar,” she said. Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), which monitor glucose levels in real time, have been used by millions of diabetics for years. As a dietitian in Ontario, Canada, Ms Bekkedam had hers installed to better understand the technology for her patients with diabetes. But her two-week trial became somewhat of a cautionary tale. “I was freaking out,” she said. “I actually questioned, oh my goodness, do I have diabetes?” She didn’t. And, after some extra research, she found that her glucose levels were entirely normal. But constantly getting updates on her blood sugar highs and lows, without having a medical condition that required it, incited some unnecessary fear. “That’s where I think people could go down a rabbit hole,” she said. But these devices may be in the hands - or on the arms - of many more people very soon, thanks to two recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals for more widespread use. This week, Abbott Laboratories announced it had received federal clearance for two over-the-counter CGMs, including one for those without diabetes. Use of CGMs is already rising, with the tell-tale arm patches easily spotted during morning commutes in major American cities. But experts say that even if there is no proven harm, there is little evidence to warrant spending the hefty fees - as much as $300 (£240) a month - if you’re not a diabetic. Abbott’s Lingo, which is a CGM for people without diabetes, is marketed to consumers “who want to better understand and improve their health and wellness”. It was one of two devices cleared by the FDA for sale, and is already available in the UK. The FDA’s 510(k) regulatory process evaluates medical devices for safety and efficacy, but marketing claims are not part of the review. \"Understanding your body's glucose is key to managing your metabolism so you can live healthier and better,\" an Abbott spokesperson told the BBC.\n\nGetty Images Many experts say evidence is scant that CGMs are beneficial to those without diabetes\n\nAbbott said that flattening glucose curves could help improve energy, mood and sleep and pointed to studies showing the impact of glucose spikes on overall health, and the role of CGMs in monitoring them. There is scepticism about such claims in the medical community, but one thing experts agree on is that CGMs have significantly improved the care of some people living with diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is when an individual's pancreas stops producing insulin, so regular injections are needed. Type 2 diabetes is more common and occurs when the cells in the body become resistant to insulin and so more is needed to keep blood glucose levels within a normal range. It can usually be controlled through medication, diet, exercise and close monitoring, although some take insulin. Traditionally, diabetics monitored their blood sugar with finger-prick tests, but CGMs can alert people with diabetes when their blood sugars are running dangerously high and low, and if insulin needs to be injected. But many experts say that the evidence for CGMs improving the health of non-diabetics is effectively non-existent. They insist the devices are, at best, a distraction and at worse could lead to dangerous fixations.\n\nA growing trend\n\nCGMs are big business. Market leaders have estimated sales will reach $20bn globally over the next four years. Earlier this year, the FDA cleared the sale of an over-the-counter CGM made by Dexcom, meant for Type 2 diabetics who don’t use insulin but want to avoid regular finger-prick tests. And some new CGM startups, like Signos, Nutrisense and Levels Health, now market prescription devices off-label as tools for energy, mood and metabolism. The devices are becoming popular among some in health, wellness and sports industries. Dutch marathoner Abdi Nageeye, who will compete in the Paris Olympics, told Reuters earlier this week he is wearing a CGM to try to better track his body's available energy.\n\nGetty Dutch marathoner Abdi Nageeye wore a CGM during the Rotterdam marathon in 2022, according to Reuters\n\nOthers, including some in the scientific community, have also expressed interest in the effects of glucose on metabolic health. Nick Norwitz, 28, who graduated from Oxford University with a PhD in nutrition and is currently in his fourth year of medical school at Harvard, said he believes CGMs can be powerful tools because glucose is “a bellwether for what’s happening hormonally in your body”. He has studied their use while at Harvard, and said he welcomes more research in the field. Mr Norwitz said he believed that over the long term, the hormonal changes associated with frequent glucose spikes could cause negative effects, including through fat gain. But, he added, glucose is just one metric, and shouldn’t drive all health decisions. “To be clear, I don't think that means if you eat a mango and have your blood sugar go up that it’s 'worse' for you than were you to have a plate of bacon,” he said. Interest in how CGMs can help you change your diet has flourished in some corners of the internet too. Depending on your algorithm, a search for glucose monitors on TikTok or Instagram could lead you to dozens of testimonials from health and wellness influencers espousing the technology’s benefits. One such influencer, Brittney Bouchard, who promoted a particular CGM start-up on her TikTok and offered her followers a discount code, said wearing a CGM helped her adjust her diet to reduce glucose spikes. She received an affiliate commission when people bought the device through her link. “I could tell a difference immediately, in my energy, my sleep and my brain fog,” said Ms Bouchard, a 41-year-old health coach from Los Angeles.\n\nBrittney Bouchard Brittney Bouchard, a wellness influencer, said she's adjusted her diet after using a CGM\n\nIn her opinion the CGM showed her that her body “was unfortunately very, very sensitive to carbohydrates… even fruit”, she said, recalling that eating a pineapple had made her feel “jittery” and sick. “If I have oatmeal I will be tired within an hour.”\n\nA solution in search of a problem",
    "US declines to charge Merrick Garland for contempt of Congress": "US declines to charge Merrick Garland for contempt\n\nThe US Department of Justice (DoJ) has declined to press charges against Attorney General Merrick Garland for contempt of Congress after the House of Representatives narrowly voted to punish him for his refusal to hand over audio tapes from an investigation into President Joe Biden.\n\nThe Republican-controlled House voted 216-207 on Wednesday to recommend that the DoJ, the department that Mr Garland oversees, file criminal charges against America's top law enforcement officer.\n\nThe move stems from Mr Garland's refusal to turn over to Republican lawmakers recorded interviews from a justice department probe of Mr Biden's handling of classified documents.\n\nIn a letter sent to Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson on Friday, a top DoJ official said the department found that Mr Garland's actions \"do not constitute a crime\". Mr Johnson called the move \"sadly predictable\".\n\nCarlos Felipe Uriarte, an assistant attorney general, said it was a \"longstanding position\" of the department not to bring charges in cases where the president has made the decision to conceal the requested material using his power of executive privilege.\n\nExecutive privilege is legal doctrine that grants presidents the right to withhold executive branch information from the other two branches of US government.\n\n\"Accordingly the Department will not bring the congressional contempt citation before a grand jury or take any other action to prosecute the Attorney General,\" Mr Uriarte wrote.\n\nThe House Speaker said he would go to federal court to force the attorney general to hand over the audio.\n\nMr Johnson called the DoJ decision “another example of the two-tiered system of justice brought to us by the Biden Administration”.\n\nHe cited the case of two ex-Trump aides, Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro, who tried to cite executive privilege in flouting congressional subpoenas. They were found in contempt of Congress, criminally prosecuted and sentenced to prison terms.\n\nLast month, Mr Biden invoked executive privilege to block congressional Republicans from accessing tapes of his interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur, who was investigating his retention of classified documents after he served as vice-president.\n\nMr Biden turned in the documents once they had been discovered. The DoJ special counsel who interviewed the Democratic US president said that although he had retained the files, he should not be charged as jurors would probably view him as a \"well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory\".\n\nThe White House said that Republicans had no legitimate need to access the five hours of audio, since a transcript had already been released. They argued that Republicans wanted to use the audio for campaign attack ads against Mr Biden as he seeks his second term as president this November.\n\nAs the oldest US president, 81-year-old Mr Biden's age is seen by opponents as a key political vulnerability. His Republican challenger, Donald Trump, just turned 78.\n\nTrump is facing a federal prosecution on charges of having retained documents that were meant to be handed over to government archivists after he left office.\n\nHe allegedly attempted to obstruct justice by hiding the classified memos after he had been ordered to submit them.\n\nTwo other attorneys general have been held in contempt of Congress in recent years.\n\nIn both cases Eric Holder, a Democrat, and Bill Barr, a Republican, received similar letters from the DoJ stating that prosecutors were declining to press charges.",

    "Military ‘pause’ on Gaza road inflames divisions in Israeli government": "Military ‘pause’ on Gaza road inflames divisions in Israeli government\n\n43 minutes ago By Lucy Williamson , Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nWhen is a ceasefire not a ceasefire? According to the Israeli army, when it’s a “local, tactical pause of military activity for humanitarian purposes”. Israel’s humanitarian aid coordinator for Gaza set out the details of the scheduled daily pause in fighting between 08:00 and 19:00 local time, along a key route running north from the Kerem Shalom crossing point, where aid is waiting to be delivered. The announcement almost immediately triggered a furious political assault from far-right government ministers – and a rapid defence from Israel’s army, insisting that it did not signal an end to the fighting in southern Gaza, or any change to the entry of humanitarian aid. The fact that this announcement has proved so explosive highlights the increasingly fraught situation of Israel’s prime minister, caught between the costs of his vague and so far unattainable military goals of dismantling Hamas and bringing home the hostages, and the political allies he relies on to stay in power.\n\nAgencies will still need to coordinate their movements with the Israeli army, and the Gaza director for the World Food Programme, Matt Hollingworth, said the test would be whether that coordination became smoother and faster as a result. But he also said that coordination was only part of the obstacle agencies faced in delivering aid inside Gaza. Sunday's announcement \"doesn’t resolve the issue of insecurity and criminality,” he said. “And this is the most dangerous area of the Gaza Strip right now for moving aid.” Aid agencies reported over the weekend that the continuing war was fuelling acute malnutrition in parts of Gaza. Israel is under pressure – from NGOs, allies and its own High Court – to get more aid into Gaza. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces stiff opposition from two far-right cabinet colleagues, who say they will bring down his government if he agrees to end the war, and who see aid deliveries as delaying Israel’s victory. They reacted furiously to today’s announcement, with Internal Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, describing “whoever made this decision” as “evil” and “a fool”. Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said that humanitarian aid helped keep Hamas in power and risked putting “the achievements of the war down the drain”. That the army could issue this message on a day when Israel was burying eleven of its soldiers, he said, was a symptom of the leadership giving too much weight to international opinion and not enough to the forces on the ground. Both men have threatened to bring down Mr Netanyahu’s coalition government if he ends the war, as America wants. But pressure over the costs of that war are rising at home too. Israel’s parallel conflict with Hezbollah in Lebanon has escalated in recent days, highlighting the broader risks of continuing the war with their Hamas allies.\n\nEPA In Israel, thousands of people joined a protest calling on the Israeli war cabinet to bring hostages home",
    "Saulos Chilima: Funeral service held for Malawi's vice-president": "Malawians pay tribute to vice-president killed in plane crash\n\n2 hours ago By Peter Jegwa , BBC News, Lilongwe Share\n\nReuters Saulos Chilima was planning to run for president next year\n\nTens of thousands of Malawians have taken part in a funeral service at the national stadium to pay tribute to the vice-president who was killed in a plane crash last week. Saulos Chilima, 51, was considered a breath of fresh air in Malawian politics. He was an eloquent public speaker and energetic campaigner who held huge sway among the youth who account for more than half of Malawians. At the service, President Lazarus Chakwera promised a full investigation into the cause of the crash and said that he had asked foreign governments to help.\n\n\"I also have the same questions that Malawians have,\" he said. President Chakwera had previously said the military aircraft had crashed because of poor visibility caused by bad weather but Mr Chilima's UTM party has called for a thorough and independent investigation. The president said that the Malawian military would carry out an investigation but that another, independent, one was needed as well. Mr Chakwera and other government officials were booed by some members of the crowd at the Bingu National Stadium. The 41,000-capacity stadium was full, with more people outside. Calm was only restored after the intervention of Catholic priests. Mr Chilima was a devout Catholic and the service included a full mass. He will be buried in his home district of Ntcheu, 180km (112 miles) south of Lilongwe on Monday, which has been declared a public holiday. His coffin, draped in Malawi's red, green and black flag, was brought into the stadium by a guard of honour. The 'magnetic' Malawi vice-president who inspired hope\n\nPODCAST: What will the death of Saulos Chilima mean for Malawi? The service began with moving tributes from his family. His son, Sean, recalled what a loving father he was, how he always had time for children and played games with them. He added that his father had been extremely competitive and always wanted to win. \"Dad was a hard worker who always made sure he got things done,\" he said. His brother, Ben, said the family was grateful to have been given the personal belongings he had on him at the time of the accident, including his watch and rosary.\n\nChimwemwe Innocencia/BBC His coffin was brought into the stadium by a guard of honour\n\nMalawi State House Saulos Chilima was a devout Catholic\n\nMr Chilima died last Monday as he was flying to the northern town of Nkhata Bay where he was to attend the funeral of a former cabinet minister. The entire crew and other passengers on board, including former First Lady Shanil Dzimbiri, also perished. Mr Chilima had a successful career working in the private sector where he held various senior, well-paid positions in business before taking what many thought was a risky decision, venturing into politics aged just 40. He had been vice-president since 2014, initially under former President Peter Mutharika. After falling out with Mr Mutharika, Mr Chilima formed his own party, the UTM. He ran for president in the 2019 elections, coming third behind Mr Mutharika and Mr Chakwera, but the election results were nullified by the Malawi high court following complaints of fraud. In the 2020 presidential election, Mr Chilima agreed to be Mr Chakwera's running-mate, in an alliance of nine opposition parties. In June 2022, he said that as part of that agreement, President Chakwera was to serve for only one term and he would then back Mr Chilima in the next elections in September 2025. President Chakwera has not publicly disputed Mr Chilima’s claim, but in recent public pronouncements he started to hint that he might seek re-election next year. In public appearances, Mr Chilima and Mr Chakwera looked to be on good terms but many thought a fall-out was inevitable particularly after senior leaders of their respective parties had started to openly endorse the candidatures of the two in next year’s elections.\n\nMore Malawi stories from the BBC:\n\nGetty/BBC",
    "General election 2024 poll tracker: How do the parties compare?": "General election 2024 poll tracker: How do the parties compare?\n\n19 hours ago Share\n\nUse our interactive poll tracker to check the latest trends measuring how people say they intend to vote.\n\nWhat do the latest polls tell us?\n\nPolls conducted over the last fortnight suggest support for Labour has dipped a bit but there's not any good news for the Conservatives, writes BBC senior political analyst Peter Barnes.\n\nLabour are still on average around 20 points ahead of the Conservatives, but both parties have edged down since the election was called..\n\nThere's been a lot of attention paid to a YouGov poll, published on Thursday evening, which put Reform UK on 19%, one point ahead of the Conservatives. That's just one poll and, on average, Reform are still back in third place but they've certainly gained a considerable amount of support since Nigel Farage announced he was taking over as party leader and standing as a candidate.\n\nSupport for the Liberal Democrats has also edged up a little in the most recent polls but we still need to wait to see if that turns into a more sustained trend.\n\nHow big are the gaps between parties?\n\nAll polls are based on a sample of people interviewed, typically more than 1,000, which is then weighted to be representative of the country.\n\nThere is always a margin of error, meaning the real percentage could be higher or lower than any one poll suggests.\n\nWe estimate that the true support for each party lies within the ranges shown here.\n\nWhat is a poll tracker?\n\nEach dot in the chart shows one poll result for a party.\n\nWe summarise all that information with an average line that makes it easier to understand the trend.\n\nWhich polls do we use?\n\nTo get an appropriate range of polls for our averages, we use those conducted by members of the British Polling Council.\n\nIts members agree to the same rules on transparency, but the council has said membership should not be seen as a guarantee of quality.\n\nThe polls we include have come from BMG, Deltapoll, Electoral Calculus, Find Out Now, Focaldata, Ipsos, JL Partners, More in Common, Opinium, Norstat (formerly Panelbase), People Polling, Redfield and Wilton Strategies, Savanta, Survation, Techne, Verian (formerly Kantar Public), WeThink (formerly Omnisis), Whitestone Insight and YouGov.\n\nWe only include the headline percentages on voting intention, which pollsters calculate by excluding those people who answered \"don't know\" or \"won't vote\".\n\nMost of the polls included cover Great Britain, although some do poll the whole of the UK. People surveyed do not get the option to choose parties which only stand in Northern Ireland.\n\nWe include data that is in the public domain. Some polling companies will not publish all data for all parties at the same time.\n\nWho pays for polls?\n\nWhere polling companies have stated in their data tables who their client is, we have included this in our table. It is common for polling companies to do their work for news organisations, television programmes and campaign groups.\n\nWhat is the margin of error?\n\nThe true position for the Conservatives and Labour might be within five percentage points of our average.\n\nNine out of 10 polls just before election day have been within that range of the eventual national vote shares in the 2010 to 2019 general elections.\n\nThe gap has been smaller for other parties which campaign throughout Great Britain, such as the Liberal Democrats, Green party and Reform UK (formerly the Brexit Party) and smaller still for the SNP and Plaid Cymru.\n\nHow do we average the polls?\n\nOur estimate of a party's support is a rolling average of polls.\n\nA party's share on any given day is the average of their results from polls taken over the previous fortnight. We only take the most recent poll from each company for that day's averages.\n\nWhy do polling companies have different results?\n\nAll opinion polls will differ a bit because they are interviewing different people. There are also other things that can lead to differences between polling companies. For example:\n\nDifferent companies find the people who take part in their polls in different ways\n\nThe precise wording of the question varies between pollsters, and some pollsters ask more than one question to reach their voting intention figures\n\nPollsters apply \"weights\" to their data to try to make their results reflect the make-up of the voting population. So if a particular poll has a smaller proportion of female respondents than there are in the wider population, their responses will be given extra weight in the final results. But different companies take different factors into account\n\nThe companies have different ways of treating people who initially say they do not know how they will vote, or are not certain if they will vote.\n\nWhat do pollsters ask?\n\nFor voting intention, polling companies typically ask interviewees a question along the lines of: \"If a general election were held tomorrow, which party would you vote for?\"\n\nSome polling companies have not given their interviewees the choice of some parties, including them within the \"other\" category.\n\nFor example, Reform UK, formerly the Brexit Party until 2021, has only been included as an option in every poll featured in our tracker since autumn 2022, while support for Plaid Cymru is included among \"other\" parties in polls released by Techne.\n\nProduced by Grace Richardson, Scott Jarvis, Becky Rush, Allison Shultes, Libby Rogers, Daniel Wainwright, Aidan McNamee, Jana Tauschinski, Debie Loizou, Preeti Vaghela, Robert Cuffe, John Walton.\n\nWhat questions do you have about the general election?\n\nUse this form to ask your question:",

    "Boeing investigated after 'Dutch roll'": "Boeing plane investigated after 'Dutch roll'\n\nThe issues have emerged at a time when the safety record of Boeing planes is under intense scrutiny.\n\nThe agency is also involved after Boeing reported learning of potentially falsified documents used to certify titanium in its planes.\n\nIt is one of two new inquiries involving Boeing planes that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has recently confirmed.\n\nUS regulators are investigating after a Boeing 737 Max 8 flown by Southwest Airlines rocked side to side while in air, a potentially dangerous movement known as a Dutch roll.\n\nBoeing referred questions about the Southwest flight to the airline, which said it was co-operating with the investigation.\n\nBoeing also said that the titanium issue was \"industry-wide\", involving shipments from a limited set of suppliers.\n\nIt said tests performed so far indicate that the correct alloy was used, despite the false documentation.\n\nThe company said it sourced the metal separately from its supplier and it believed a small number of parts had been affected.\n\n\"To ensure compliance, we are removing any affected parts on airplanes prior to delivery. Our analysis shows the in-service fleet can continue to fly safely,” the company said.\n\nThe New York Times, which first reported the issue, said a supplier to Spirit AeroSystems, which makes parts for Boeing and European plane-maker Airbus, started looking into the issue after noticing holes from corrosion.\n\nSpirit, which had alerted the two manufacturers to the problem earlier this year, said more than 1,000 tests had been completed on the suspect parts, which had been removed from production.\n\n\"It is the documents that were counterfeit, not the titanium,\" spokesman Joe Buccino said. \"The problem is we've lost traceability.\"\n\nThe FAA said Boeing had issued a bulletin to suppliers to be on the alert for counterfeit records and that it was probing the scope of the issue.\n\nCanadian transportation safety officials said in a separate statement that they were working with foreign regulators to determine a co-ordinated approach to the titanium issue, and that officials \"will not hesitate to take action\".\n\nThe so-called Dutch roll, said to have been named after an ice-skating technique attributed to the Netherlands, occurred on a 25 May flight from Phoenix, Arizona, to Oakland, California.\n\nThe FAA said the aircraft regained control and no-one on board was injured, but the plane suffered \"substantial\" damage.\n\nA post-flight inspection of the two-year-old plane revealed significant damage to a unit that provides backup power to the rudder.\n\n\"Dutch roll can be unpleasant but the 737 exhibits relatively benign characteristics. The time elapsed since the incident, and the absence of airworthiness action on the fleet, suggest that this is a one-off, not another widespread problem for Boeing,\" said Tim Atkinson, a former UK accident investigator-turned-consultant.\n\nSafety campaigners have raised alarm about the quality of recent planes produced by Boeing.\n\nAn incident in which a panel broke off a plane in mid-air in January reignited concerns, sparking lawsuits and increased oversight of Boeing.\n\nBoeing has slowed its production and last month presented the FAA with an action plan aimed at resolving the issues.\n\nTheo Leggett contributed to this article.",
    "Betting the House: The world of political wagers": "Lifting the lid on the world of political betting\n\n2 days ago By Sam Francis , @DavidSamFrancis, Political Reporter Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nAn investigation into Rishi Sunak's parliamentary aide Craig Williams placing a £100 \"flutter\" on the general election has thrown a spotlight on the world of political betting. Gambling on sporting events is now very big business in the UK. Millions will be wagered this summer on the Euros and the Paris Olympics, most of it online rather than the traditional way of entering a bookmaker's. But betting has long been part of the political world too. From the outside, betting on an obscure by-election or a party leadership contest may seem strange - but for some political obsessives it combines the unpredictability and excitement of sport with the intrigue of a dramatic narrative.\n\nOne of the proudest moments in the life of political betting guru Mike Smithson was correctly predicting the result of the 2021 Chesham and Amersham by-election. \"I got the Lib Dems to win at 20-to-1, and I got it right,\" he said. Mr Smithson, who runs the politicalbetting.com website after years as a BBC political journalist, said: \"I love politics and there's nothing like predicting winner and losers. \"People love to look at things and think they know the answer - when you go for a drink in the pub people always end up saying 'I think it's going this way, or that'\". Political betting is often used by betting companies as a gateway to entice new punters to more lucrative - for the firms - betting platforms. \"Most bookies get into political betting because they like signing up new customers who will then be attracted in other areas,\" said Mr Smithson. But some remarkable amounts of money have been wagered over the years. In 2017, an anonymous student placed a series of wagers amounting to £10,000 on Jeremy Corbyn's Labour winning the general election. They lost their money. Mike Smithson estimates \"between £10m and £20m will be bet on the election this year\".\n\nEPA Gambling firms say betting on political events is on the rise\n\nOnline betting exchange Betfair suggests more than £8m has been staked on the outcome of the general election. But these figures do not include bets with the larger betting firms. This makes it a miniscule slice of the £15.1bn UK gambling market. But according to William Kedjanyi, head of political content at Star Sports, political betting has been \"growing steadily over the last ten years\". \"It has been helped by the fact we’ve had particularly volatile events - the 'yes' and 'no' Brexit referendum was perfect for betting. \"People like to bet on very tight events.\" Over the years, the types of political bets have diversified. Traditional bets on election outcomes remain popular, but novelty bets, such as predicting specific political events or decisions, are gaining traction. \"Elections by themselves are perfect betting events – there are lots of options across the 650 constituencies, betting on each one or overall victory,\" says Mr Kedjanyi.\n\nBetting on politics has a surprisingly long history in the UK. Charles James Fox, the 18th-century Whig prime minister, was known to bet \"frequently, largely, and judiciously, on the social and political occurrences of the time\" according to his biographer. During the Victorian and Edwardian periods, gambling laws became stricter, impacting political betting. But in 1963 Ladbrokes began openly accepting bets on political events and by the following year's general election, William Hill had joined in. But people who work at Westminster - like those who work at horse racing stables or football clubs - need to be careful. Using confidential information to gain an advantage could amount to cheating under the Gambling Act - which is a criminal offence. The Gambling Commission is making inquires into Craig Williams, a Conservative Party election candidate and former aide to Rishi Sunak, amid claims he placed a £100 bet on the date of the election days before the PM announced it. Mr Williams has apologised and said he made a \"huge error of judgement\" but has not confirmed the details of his bet. Mr Sunak has described his actions as \"very disappointing\" and the opposition parties are calling for him to be suspended as a candidate or face a Cabinet Office investigation. It is understood the watchdog wrote to all licensed bookmakers this week requesting information on anyone who stood to gain more than £199 by betting on a July election in the UK. Westminster's gamblers will be watching the results of this one with particular interest.",
    "Is Elon Musk worth his £44bn Tesla pay package?": "Is Elon Musk worth his $56bn Tesla pay package?\n\n2 days ago By Zoe Kleinman , Technology editor Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nElon Musk might, once again, get his own way. His Tesla pay deal - worth up to $56bn (£44bn) depending on the firm's share price - which has now been backed by shareholders is 75% of the entire spending for schools in England in 2024-25 (£60bn) and around a quarter of the budget for the NHS (£192bn). To his many admirers, Mr Musk is worth every single cent which comes his way - and shareholders agreed, with around 72% of the voting shares backing the deal. His businesses include Tesla, SpaceX, X (formerly Twitter), Starlink, Neuralink and X.ai, his latest AI project. You could argue Tesla opened up the US market for electric vehicles, SpaceX has just sent the world’s most powerful rocket into space, and a man who volunteered to be the first human to be implanted with a Neuralink microchip into his brain can now control a computer using his thoughts. Today, the $56bn question is: would this portfolio have been as successful without him?\n\nTesla's growth\n\nYou could say Mr Musk's pay deal was really about getting him to stay put at Tesla. Prior to 2018, when it was agreed by the company’s board, there had been speculation about his future at the electric car maker. The deal was structured in such a way that if Mr Musk didn’t hit certain milestones – such as Tesla’s market value, sales and underlying profit – he wouldn’t get paid at all. Though, at that stage, he was hardly digging down the back of the sofa for loose change given he was worth nearly $20bn, according to Forbes magazine’s rich list of 2018. But if he did hit certain goals, the potential payday was astronomical. In fairness, Mr Musk has achieved the targets laid out for him. For example, Tesla’s market value had grown from $54bn to the $650bn goal set out in the original deal. It has since slid back down to $570bn. ‘Why I voted no on Musk pay hike’\n\nMusk's profile\n\nWhen Tesla wobbled in 2022, it was said to be because Mr Musk had taken his eye off the ball to concentrate on X – so it was his absence rather than his presence which caused a problem. Yet his profile clearly adds massive value to these firms. Mr Musk doesn’t believe in communications teams, preferring instead to broadcast prolifically to his 187m followers directly on his social network. If you’ve got Mr Musk in your corner, your PR does itself, with mixed, but always high profile, results. He generates endless global news headlines from behind his keyboard, and you could argue that very, very few people have that power - publicity that money can’t buy. Tesla investors back $56bn Musk pay deal\n\nMusk opposes US tariffs on Chinese electric cars\n\nElon Musk sees $56bn Tesla pay deal cancelled in Delaware court\n\nHe also has enormous political clout: he’s met with several world leaders, including China’s President Xi Jinping. He claims to have spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin on the phone, and he once livestreamed a conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He is a fierce and demanding boss, a workaholic who doesn’t take no for an answer. Former employees say even the most dedicated among them burn out, while he does not. Dolly Singh, who worked at SpaceX for Mr Musk between 2008 and 2013, previously told BBC News he was an \"incredible leader\". \"If that wasn't the case, he wouldn't be accomplishing the things that he is,\" she said in 2022. But she also conceded that working for him was “exhausting”.\n\nRisky business",

    "Are fake pro-Reform UK social accounts influencing the election?": "Bot or not: Are fake accounts swaying voters towards Reform UK?\n\n2 days ago By Marianna Spring , Disinformation and social media correspondent Share\n\nBBC\n\n\"Vote Reform UK\", \"Only Reform UK has a real plan for Britain\" - an account on X has posted these and similar messages every couple of hours since the start of the election campaign. The account, GenZBloomer, is one of dozens across X, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok which the BBC has identified as posting hundreds of repeated messages in comment threads expressing support for Reform UK. Their behaviour has prompted claims from other social media users that they are fake - automated \"bot\" accounts - and they are distorting the online conversation to try to exaggerate the popularity of Reform UK. The BBC contacted people behind the accounts and found that some are genuine UK voters who believe they are helping the party through their own initiative. Others, however, failed to prove they were authentic. I spotted this pattern of comments in posts recommended to the feeds of our Undercover Voters - 24 fictional people based around the UK with social media accounts, created to investigate what content is recommended to different types of voters during the election. The profiles are private, with no friends. They just like, follow and watch relevant content.\n\nMarianna Spring: Why am I tracking 24 phones this election?\n\n\"The main purpose of my account at this time is to restore British culture and values,\" the GenZbloomer account told me in a message. Following concerns about foreign interference in previous elections, some social media users have suggested that GenZbloomer - and other similar accounts - may not be based in the UK. They have pointed out phrases a native speaker would be unlikely to use, such as \"make an article\" instead of \"write an article\" and \"neighbourhood tavern\" instead of \"local pub\". Others are convinced the GenZbloomer profile must be parody - particularly referring to a blog post the account shared on X about how \"young men are struggling out here to find traditional British women to date\" because women think they are \"better than everyone else because of Love Island and Starmer\", referring to the Labour leader Sir Keir. The person who claimed to be behind GenZbloomer told me they were based in \"the Annesley England area\" - an unusual way to describe the small village in Nottinghamshire - and gave me a UK mobile phone number. They agreed to speak to me on the phone, but then did not answer any of my calls.\n\nGenZBloomer has posted hundreds of times about Reform UK on X\n\nOn WhatsApp, their account is labelled as a business account for a \"consulting agency\", and features a profile image of a faceless cartoon figure with a microphone headset on. In messages with grammatical mistakes, they claimed to be a \"generation Z voter\" who wants a \"proper Brexit but the conservatives party ruined\". The account claimed to be working \"with Reform UK\" in order to \"help them win and spread their values across the UK\". The person who had been messaging me provided no evidence to support this claim - and a Reform UK spokesperson said this profile was not connected to the party at all. Reform UK told the BBC it had been in touch with social media companies about other accounts falsely purporting to be connected with the party. Some responses to my messages from GenZbloomer sounded like parody - describing how they would have to speak to a Reform Party county organiser before they spoke to me, but adding that it \"should not be an issue Reform has a super lax vetting process\". After a back-and-forth over text message, my phone number then appeared to have been blocked. Since this article was first published, the GenZbloomer account has been suspended by X for violating its rules.\n\nSome social media users have claimed comments in support of Reform UK are being posted by bots\n\nSocial media users now seem more likely to accuse other accounts of being bots - alleging they undermine trust and disrupt the online debate, even when some of these profiles turn out to be genuine. In the past decade, there have been documented attempts by hostile foreign powers, such as Russia, to sow division and promote particular points of view during Western elections. They have used networks of what social media firms call \"inauthentic accounts\" and what users call bots or \"troll farms\". Whether the actions of these accounts changed anyone’s mind is unclear. In recent weeks, Reform UK has seen a genuine rise in the polls - which may partly explain its growing role in the online conversation. A spokesman for Reform UK told the BBC: \"We are, of course, delighted about the organic growth of online support, but with that come some accounts that are not formally associated with the party, but actively subvert and lie about who we are.\" The spokesman said some people wrongly believe the only way others could end up supporting Reform UK was if they had been fooled in some way by the internet. In total, I found more than 50 profiles that had the hallmarks of inauthentic accounts, posting in support of Reform UK across the different social media sites - although they could still have been genuine. These hallmarks can include a username and profile picture with no identifying features, no followers or seemingly real friends - and engaging entirely with political or divisive content, or reposting the same repetitive phrases.\n\nThe BBC's Undercover Voter profiles in Bridgend were pushed content which included the alleged bot comments\n\nSome had no posts of their own. Others, seemingly based outside the UK, previously posted about US politics and sports or animal cruelty before switching to Reform UK. Several had also shared conspiracy theory content about Covid-19 or posts opposing Ukraine and supporting Russia. I have not found other accounts posting about other political parties in the same way - or being met with the same accusations. Many of these accounts did not respond when I contacted them. But one called username341317847855 did. He said his name was Martin and he agreed to speak to me on the phone from the quiet of his van in London. \"Of course I'm a real person. I'm just fed up with the government. I'm fed up with MPs,\" he said. He made light of the bot claims, joking that I could call him \"Martin the Bot\" and telling me he was not worried that these accusations might undermine Reform UK’s social media posts. Martin said no political parties or users have encouraged him to post. He said he decided to vote for the first time in this election.\n\nThis account had some of the hallmarks of a bot, but the BBC traced it to a first-time voter named Martin in London\n\nSeveral more of these accounts told me they were real people based in the UK, who were just sharing their political views. Some shared evidence with me to demonstrate this. One account run by someone called Matt said: \"I can assure you I'm not a bot. I'm politically homeless.\" He said he was from Bury, was aged 46 and a welder by trade. He does not have any profile picture or posts on his TikTok account, only comments on the videos of others. He told me that no political party or anyone else had instructed him to comment in support of Reform UK. Matt said that when he saw the other profiles posting these comments similar to his on social media, it helped him and others realise \"they are not the only ones who feel this way and have these views\". What Matt’s experience seems to show is that comments that boost the perceived support for a political party - whether they come from UK voters or inauthentic accounts - can embolden more real people to join in. It is one more piece of evidence in this election that suggests individual social media users and anonymous accounts have the ability to shape the online conversation just as effectively as the content coming from the political parties themselves. A TikTok spokesperson has previously told the BBC it has introduced \"more policies to aggressively counter foreign election interference\". \"Creating fake accounts or engaging in inauthentic activities goes against Meta's policies\", a spokesperson for Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, told the BBC. X, formerly Twitter, said they \"remove accounts engaged in platform manipulation\".\n\nTwo of the three Bridgend Undercover Voters were recommended content linked to the Reform UK bot claims",
    "Elon Musk wins record-breaking Tesla pay deal from shareholders": "Tesla investors back $56bn Musk pay deal\n\nTesla shareholders have backed a record-breaking pay package for boss Elon Musk and approved a plan to move the firm's legal headquarters to Texas.\n\nThe deal was blocked earlier this year by a judge in Delaware over concerns it was unfair to shareholders.\n\nThe vote is a victory for the multi-billionaire, who had campaigned fiercely for the payout, which is worth up to $56bn (£43.9bn). The exact amount depends on the Tesla share price.\n\n\"Hot damn, I love you guys,\" he told a crowd of enthusiastic shareholders who had gathered in Texas for the firm's annual meeting.\n\nThe deal is worth more than 300 times what the top-earning boss in the US made last year, and more than 3,000 times the average CEO's pay package.\n\nHowever, the vote is not binding and legal experts have said it is not clear if the court that blocked the deal will accept the re-vote and allow the company to restore the pay package.\n\n\"The vote changes nothing,\" said Mathieu Shapiro, a managing partner at law firm Obermayer Rebmann Maxwell & Hippel.\n\n\"It only offers Tesla opportunities to try to use the vote to obtain a better decision going forward.\n\n“It will be interesting to see if another court is willing to credit a vote taken after the trial court’s decision.”\n\nThe eye-popping sum had sparked criticism and raised concerns that the board of Tesla was too submissive and close to Mr Musk.\n\nIn the January court ruling, Delaware judge Kathaleen McCormick ruled the sum was \"unfair\" and the process for determining the package, by a board dominated by Mr Musk, was \"deeply flawed\".\n\nChancellor McCormick had pointed out that Antonio Gracias, who had been a board director at Tesla, had \"the sort of personal relationship that had him vacationing with Musk’s family on a regular basis\".\n\nShe also highlighted Todd Maron, Tesla's former general counsel, \"who was Musk’s former divorce attorney and whose admiration for Musk moved him to tears during his deposition\".\n\nMr Musk announced that he wanted to move the firm's legal headquarters to Texas after the court in Delaware, where it is currently incorporated, voided his pay package, siding with a small investor who had sued over the deal.\n\nThe fight over the plan had aired concerns about Mr Musk's leadership, at a time when Tesla's share price has fallen from its height and its position in the electric car industry is under pressure.\n\nBut Mr Musk rallied his fan base in support of the deal, appealing particularly to individual investors, who make up an unusually large portion of the firm's shareholder base.\n\nThe pay proposal received 72% of the votes cast, similar to the 73% total in 2018, when it was first approved.\n\n\"It's a pretty ringing endorsement,\" said car industry analyst Karl Brauer.\n\nMr Musk got more than enough shareholder support \"to justify the package,\" he added.\n\nMr Musk had previewed the results in a post on his social media company, X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nShares in the company closed up nearly 3% after Mr Musk's announcement.\n\nThe compensation plan gives Mr Musk rights to roughly 300 million shares - the equivalent to a 10% stake in the firm - as a reward for Tesla meeting a number of goals set out in 2018 which are linked to sales, profits and the share price.",
    "The Contestant: Reality TV show saw man live on competition prizes": "Naked, alone and living on dog food – all for a TV show that gripped a nation\n\n2 days ago By Steven McIntosh , Entertainment reporter Share\n\nHulu Nasubi appeared on Japanese TV in 1998, before The Truman Show and Big Brother\n\nIn 1998, a Japanese man was stripped naked and left alone in an almost-empty apartment as part of a challenge for a reality TV show. Tomoaki Hamatsu, known as Nasubi, was left with only a pen, some blank postcards, a telephone and rack full of magazines. But he was not there to read. The concept of the show was to see if a human being could survive on competition prizes alone. In order to win the challenge, the value of the prizes he won had to reach a certain financial threshold - 1m yen, around £6,000 at the time. He would not emerge for 15 months, following a gradual descent into depression and mania, driven by hunger and isolation. Nearly three decades later, Nasubi's ordeal is being revisited as part of a new film that has just screened at the Sheffield Documentary Festival. \"I came across his story when I was working on a different project and got lost down one of those internet rabbit holes,\" recalls Clair Titley, director of The Contestant. \"But I found that a lot of what I had come across was almost derogatory. Nothing had really talked about Nasubi's story in depth. [I had] all these questions such as, why did he stay in there, and what effect it had on him. So I contacted him with that premise, that I wanted to make a film about his experience.\"\n\nHulu Nasubi entered thousands of magazine competitions to win prizes that would help him survive\n\nNasubi, who had been randomly selected at an open audition, knew he was being filmed, but the explanation given to him about where the footage would end up was vague, and left him with the impression it probably wouldn't be broadcast. In reality, the 22-year-old was gradually becoming one of the country's biggest celebrities as weekly updates on his progress became one of the most popular segments of variety show Denpa Shōnen. Critics mostly hated the programme, but it attracted a huge audience of young viewers. The show began airing before the release of The Truman Show, starring Jim Carrey as a man who doesn't know his life is being broadcast as a TV series. And it would be another year before Big Brother would launch in the Netherlands, ushering in a whole new era of reality television. But despite being a harbinger of things to come, there remains relatively little awareness of A Life in Prizes, as the segment was known, outside his home turf. \"I think people have heard about it more in the last decade, since YouTube has really exploded,\" Titley tells BBC News. \"But at the time, it was never shown outside of Japan and South Korea. It was never intended to be shown outside of that world.\" Nasubi, an aspiring comedian at the time, knew little detail of what the challenge would be before it started. He was left in the windowless room without clothing or basic essentials - not even toilet paper - and had no contact with the outside world.\n\nHulu The film features a new interview with Nasubi as he reflects on his ordeal nearly three decades later\n\nThe Contestant features new interviews with both Nasubi and the producer who masterminded the segment, Toshio Tsuchiya. Other contributions come from those who were involved in covering it - including a former BBC correspondent who was based in Japan. But so much of the story is contained within the footage itself, with viewers of the documentary following Nasubi's progress in the same way TV viewers did at the time. Titley says she and her team went through the original footage \"painstakingly\" to strip out much of the original furniture. \"All the footage was covered in Japanese graphics, it's got Japanese narration, canned laughter, sound effects, it's a cacophony of noise and graphics,\" she explains. \"So we tried to allow an English-speaking audience to understand what it was like.\" The team covered the Japanese graphics with English equivalents, and recreated the audio as accurately as they could. An English-speaking narrator was employed to translate the original commentary. The resulting documentary has already been released on Hulu in the US - with critics as fascinated by the story as they are repulsed by Nasubi's ordeal. The Contestant is \"both a can’t-look-away car wreck and an indictment of viewer complicity,\" said Rolling Stone's David Fear. \"A chronicle of a media phenomenon, a reality TV landmark and a psychological nightmare packaged as entertainment, it is the type of documentary where you’re aware that what you’re witnessing is 100% true, and you still can’t quite wrap your brain around what you’re seeing.\"\n\nHulu The show's producer says there was a possibility of Nasubi dying if he hadn't won rice\n\nIndieWire's David Ehrlich described the original footage as \"so hypnotically sadistic\" that the newer footage struggles to compete with it. \"None of the film’s retrospective interviews, candid and thoughtful as they are, prove as gripping as the raw video of Nasubi’s ordeal,\" he said. \"Titley’s film is ultimately less of a commentary on an entire medium than it is a study of one of that medium’s most remarkable characters.\" As the show progressed, Nasubi was successful in many of the competitions he entered - but the prizes he won weren't always of much use. Among them were tyres, golf balls, a tent, a globe, a teddy bear and tickets to Spice World: The Movie. The fact he was getting weaker seemed of little concern to the producers, one of whom suggests in the documentary that Nasubi could have died if he didn't win rice in one of the prizes. He later also won sugary drinks and dog food, which he survived on for several weeks. Around 15 million viewers tuned in to see his wins, and how he used them in his efforts to survive. Nasubi remained naked for his entire time taking part, because he never won a wearable item of clothing (his genitals are covered by a floating aubergine emoji added by producers).\n\nJoe Short (@joeshortetc) Left to right: Producers Andee Ryder and Megumi Inman with Nasubi and director Clair Titley\n\nThe door to the apartment wasn't locked and Nasubi was theoretically allowed to leave any time he wanted. So why didn't he? \"I think there are a lot of reasons,\" Titley says. \"One is he's very stoic, and that's because of where he comes from in Fukushima, and his parents, who were very strict. \"He's also a very loyal person. He didn't want to get into trouble, and he was very young and naive. He's still incredibly trusting now. And there is also that Japanese Samurai spirit of 'I will prevail and I will stick through this'.\"\n\nSuffering\n\nNearly three decades later, Nasubi has described the show as \"cruel\", adding that there was \"no happiness and no freedom\". \"Maybe three or five minutes a week out of my life [were shown]. And that was edited to highlight my happiness when I won [a prize],\" he told Deadline. \"Of course, viewers would say, 'Oh, see, he's doing something fun and something that he’s enjoying…' But the majority of my life was suffering.\" And yet, he doesn't come across in the documentary as bitter about this experience, and Titley says her impression was that \"he's in such a positive place now\". \"When people have asked him if he regrets it, he always says that while he wouldn't want to do it again, he wouldn't be the person that he is [otherwise],\" she says.\n\nHulu Nasubi was astounded when he was greeted by a live studio audience cheering his name as the show ended\n\nNasubi was finally released via a Michael McIntyre-style stunt, in which he was taken into a new fake room before the walls collapsed to reveal he was actually on stage in front of a live audience cheering his name. The documentary also follows Nasubi after his release, showing his efforts to use his newfound fame for good causes - finally providing him with a sense of fulfilment. Titley says Nasubi felt the timing was right to revisit his story, adding he \"had maybe found some peace with what had happened\". Duty of care practices in the 1990s are not what they are today - and it's unlikely viewers would stand for such a format now. But the documentary raises questions about where to draw the line when it comes to entertainment - and how much audience appetite is to blame. \"I would love people to reflect on their own relationships with social media and reality television,\" Titley says, \"and how complicit we all are as viewers and consumers.\"",

The award-winning news anchor also spoke about the impact the Windrush scandal has had on him and his family. Myrie, who is co-presenting the BBC's election night coverage with Laura Kuenssberg, said he feels an adrenaline buzz in what he describes as \"being on the frontline of what it means to be British\". He hopes the election coverage will cater to audiences beyond \"political geeks\". \"I want people to be able to tune in, and get a sense of where this country is going,\" Myrie added. Listen to the full episode on BBC Sounds\n\nAsked about his experiences as a foreign correspondent in war zones, Myrie said: \"You tend to find the best of humanity, and the worst of humanity.\" The difference in narratives made telling stories from conflict zones \"fascinating\", he added. Referring to his many broadcasting roles - as the host of the BBC's Mastermind and travel programmes about Italy and the Caribbean - the 59-year-old said he believed the more people know about him, the more likely audiences were to trust him and the BBC. Myrie spoke to host Lauren Laverne about the importance of role models like Sir Trevor McDonald, who inspired him to become a journalist. But he emphasised he wanted to be a journalist \"who just happens to be black\" - rather than a journalist who solely covered stories about black communities. \"I didn't want my colour to define who I am, and the BBC understood that.\"\n\nClive Myrie will anchor the BBC's election coverage in July alongside Laura Kuenssberg\n\nMyrie is one of seven children to Jamaican parents. Born in Farnworth, near Bolton, he said his family's front room held strong memories of Jamaica and the Caribbean, where his parents and older siblings were born. When asked about the impact of the Windrush Scandal on his own family, Myrie shared an emotional account. The scandal emerged in 2018 when hundreds of Commonwealth citizens part of the Windrush generation had been wrongly detained, deported and denied legal rights. British citizens, mainly from the Caribbean, had been denied access to healthcare and benefits and had been threatened with deportation despite having the right to live in the UK. Myrie's brother Lionel \"now has the right to remain here\", he said. But in an emotional exchange, he said his other brother, Peter, died from prostate cancer before the situation was resolved. \"There are still people who haven't received their compensation. It's just very, very sad.\"",

Except, in a strange twist, its owner is now uncertain whether it really is the desk of the famous 18th Century dictionary author. It's been suggested that despite many years of being treated as a literary relic, it could have been part of a Victorian hustle to make money. It will be the star attraction of a new museum exhibition, but visitors will be asked whether they now believe it's authentic.\n\nPembroke College Oxford The plaque records the desk being given to the Oxford college in 1867\n\nDr Samuel Johnson was an 18th Century literary giant, remembered for compiling in 1755 what was then the most comprehensive dictionary of the English language. In the TV comedy Blackadder the Third, Dr Johnson was portrayed by Robbie Coltrane, with the painstakingly researched dictionary ending up on the fire. What's now in dispute is the fate of the desk on which he wrote the dictionary when he was living in Gough Square, in a house which is now a museum to his memory. Since the 19th Century the wooden desk has been in Pembroke College Oxford - and the college is lending this prized possession to the Dr Johnson House museum. But when Lynda Mugglestone, professor of the history of English at the college, began to check out the provenance of the desk, there were some unexpected questions. \"The real story is that we don't quite know if it's the real desk,\" she says.\n\nPembroke College Oxford The desk will be on show at the Dr Johnson House in London\n\nIt had come to the college through a clergyman who had been close to Dr Johnson's god daughter, Elizabeth Ann Lowe, and her sister. A plaque was attached to signify its historic importance. But the puzzle is whether those sisters ever really had the desk or whether they used their literary connection as a way of guilt-tripping some famous writers of their era for money. Prof Mugglestone says that as the centenary of Johnson's dictionary was being marked in 1855, the Lowe sisters began writing asking for cash, describing themselves as in penury and with nothing left but a desk which they said had been left to them by the great writer. They were \"living in poverty\" in Deptford in south London, says Prof Mugglestone, and they made clear that \"donations were welcome\". Writers such as Thomas Carlyle and Charles Dickens, who had just written Hard Times, began to fund raise for the sisters. Literary London was mobilised to help the sisters who were the surviving connections to Dr Johnson. The desk became part of that story.\n\nGetty Images Dr Johnson's House, where he wrote his dictionary, is now a museum\n\nDickens wrote of the sisters being in \"great poverty, but undemonstrative and uncomplaining, though very old - with nothing to speak of in the wide world, but the plain fir desk on which Johnson wrote his English Dictionary\". Such pleas from Dickens helped to raise large donations for the sisters, with the desk being saved as a \"proud possession to the English nation\". But Celine Luppo McDaid, director of the Dr Johnson House, says it is now seems unclear whether this desk was actually Johnson's. The case for it being authentic, she says, is that the sisters could have been thinking: \"We've sold everything else, but we still have this treasured desk, it's the last thing we have.\" Or else it might have been a chance to turn a bit of spare furniture into a financial lifeline. \"They might have seen an opportunity and decided that the knackered old desk in the corner was 'Johnson's desk',\" says the museum director Ms McDaid.\n\nOxford University Prof Lynda Mugglestone has researched the history of the desk\n\nProf Mugglestone says women in this era could be extremely financially vulnerable, with few ways to support themselves and such attempts to get money from rich connections might have been their only chance. The Lowe sisters did have a link with Johnson through their father, an impecunious painter Mauritius Lowe, who had lost a grant from the Royal Academy after some rather murky \"misconduct\". Ms McDaid says the painter and his children were living in \"abject poverty\" and Johnson, often broke himself, was sympathetic and helped them with money. But the so far unanswerable question is whether the Lowe family really ended up with the famous desk and had kept it for more than 70 years after Johnson's death. It's from the right era, but is it the actual desk? Researching the desk's origins revealed records of other petitions for money by Elizabeth Ann Lowe and her sister, essentially begging letters - with stories that were not always consistent. The prime minister and the royals were among those getting requests for support. \"She is lying to someone,\" says Prof Mugglestone. But that doesn't ultimately prove either way the authenticity of the desk.\n\nDr Johnson's House The desk will be in Dr Johnson's former home in Gough Square",
    "Antarctic whale 'acrobatics' revealed in drone footage": "Drones reveal Antarctic whale 'acrobatics'\n\n2 days ago By Victoria Gill , @vic_gill, Science correspondent Share\n\nA humpback whale shows its 'acrobatic' skill as it creates a bubble net to trap krill\n\nFootage of humpback whales captured by drones has revealed how the animals manoeuvre their whole bodies when they feed. As BBC News filmed with scientists in the Antarctic Peninsula, one whale used its four-metre-long fin to sweep a net of bubbles around its prey and trap them, known as \"bubble-netting\". \"The flick of that of that flipper really shows how adaptable, how creative, these animals can be,\" said Dr Ari Friedlaender from the University of California Santa Cruz. Humpbacks are \"much more acrobatic\" than other similarly sized whales, Dr Friedlaender said.\n\nThe wildlife charity WWF’s global whales expert, Chris Johnson, said the solo whale we watched \"bubble-netting\" was \"using its fin as a tool\" to trap krill, the tiny crustaceans that Antarctic whales eat more than one tonne of each day. Humpback whales are the only species known to produce these solitary \"bubble nets\". The act can only be seen in detail from the air, so the use of drone cameras has revolutionised scientists’ ability to study it.\n\nChris Johnson/WWF/UCSC/Research under NOAA permit Humpback whales working together to trap the krill in a \"bubble net\"\n\nFootage of humpback whales twisting and turning has also revealed how efficiently they can manoeuvre their huge bodies. \"Because of the size of their [tails] and flippers - and their ability to use them to pivot - they’re much more acrobatic than other whales,\" Dr Friedlaender explained.\n\nThe aerial view that drones provide has also shed light on the recovery of whale populations in parts of the world where they were hunted to the brink of extinction in the 20th Century. An international team of researchers, including some from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), has used drone cameras to study whales in South Georgia, a key location for the whaling industry in Antarctica. BAS researcher Stephanie Martin shared with the BBC what she says is the first drone footage of a mother-calf pair of southern right whales off the coast of South Georgia. \"Seeing mother and calf pairs [here] is a strong indicator that these populations are slowly recovering,\" she said. She and her colleagues also filmed an Antarctic blue whale mother and calf - the biggest animals on Earth - feeding in the same area.\n\nMothers and calves, filmed by an international research team and shared with the BBC by the British Antarctic Survey, show whale populations are rebounding\n\nBefore the 1930s, an estimated 40,000 blue whales were killed by whalers in South Georgia waters. Ms Martin said it took until 2020 for researchers to find the giant mammals in those waters again. A survey that year recorded 58 sightings of adult blue whales there.\n\nShrinking whales\n\nKevin C Bierlich Gray whales off the Pacific Northwest coast have shrunk by about 13%, according to research\n\nScientists can also measure whales’ bodies using drones. There is evidence emerging that some of the animals are actually shrinking, which scientists have linked to climate change affecting their food supplies. A study just published in the journal Global Change Biology revealed gray whales that feed in the shallow waters off the Pacific Northwest coast have shrunk significantly in the last two decades. A gray whale born in 2020 is expected to reach an adult body length 1.65 metres (5ft 5in) shorter than a gray whale born before 2000. The researchers say this could be an early warning that the population is starting to decline, or that it is not healthy. \"Size is critical for animals,\" said Dr Enrico Pirotta from the University of St Andrews. \"It affects their behaviour, their physiology, and it has for the ecosystem they’re a part of.\"\n\nChris Johnson/WWF/UCSC/Research under NOAA permit Drones are able to capture playful interactions such as these two humpback whales with a seal\n\nAs well as helping researchers to monitor the emerging threats to whales, drones shine new light on some fascinating marine mammal behaviour. By filming humpback whales working together to feed - something we witnessed in Antarctica - scientists gain insight into how the animals learn and co-operate. \"[When we’ve studied humpbacks] feeding in Alaska and off the US coast, the rules are very prescribed,” said Dr Friedlaender. \"There's generally one animal blowing a bubble net around the prey and the other animals have these individual roles. “In Antarctica, we often see multiple animals in a feeding ground all blowing bubbles at the same time.” Researchers are still working to understand what this means, but some suspect that the Antarctic whales might still be learning the feeding technique and have not yet \"refined it\" to give each animal a role.\n\nAsked if behaviour that we witnessed - humpbacks spinning, circling our boat and even interacting with other species - could be described as \"play\", Dr Friedlaender said yes. \"They have the opportunity to be curious and interact with new objects or to interact with each other,\" he said. \"It strengthens social bonds and I think that's an absolutely critical thing for them.\"\n\nAri Friedlaender/UCSC/NMFS Permit 14809, ACA and UCSC IACUC permits Antarctic minke whales, one of which has been fitted with an orange scientific research tag, photographed from a drone",
    "The Hoof GP: The Scottish cow hoof trimmer watched by millions": "The cow hoof trimmer who is watched by millions\n\n8 hours ago By Giancarlo Rinaldi , South Scotland reporter Share\n\nMillions of people watch Graeme Parker's hoof trimming videos\n\nWhen Graeme Parker started filming himself at work little did he suspect the global phenomenon he would become. From a beautiful corner of south-west Scotland, he is now regularly greeted by strangers on the street when he visits the United States. It is all due to what would appear to be the most unlikely material to grab social media's imagination. As the Hoof GP, his videos of trimming the hooves of cows are now viewed by more than 100 million people a month.\n\nGraeme is often recognised on the street in the United States\n\nThe 41-year-old grew up on the family farm in Wigtownshire but - after his father's death when he was a teenager - he ended up going into hospitality and moving around Scotland. \"My mother remarried a hoof trimmer, he became ill and I wasn't enjoying the place that I was running,\" he said. \"So I came back to look after his business.\" It does not sound all that glamorous a career.\n\n\"I was freeze branding cows - so basically putting numbers on cows' bums all over Scotland, the Highlands, the islands - I absolutely loved it, I really, really did,\" he said. \"My customers would always constantly tell me - you should be hoof trimming because you've got an eye for detail.\" \"And I said: 'Who on Earth would want to be at the wrong end of the cow, trimming their feet? It is a dirty job, I'll never, ever trim a cow's foot'.\" Things have changed pretty quickly. \"Fast forward a few years and I'm now probably the best-known person in the world for trimming cows' feet,\" he said. \"It was reluctant to begin with but I absolutely love what I do now.\" The filming was initially meant to share with the local agricultural community.\n\nHoof GP Graeme wants to share the reality of working in agriculture\n\n\"To begin with, it was nothing to do with the public, it wasn't for public consumption,\" he said. He used to take photos to show his work to farmers but it became clear it would be easier to stick a video on YouTube and share the link. \"At the time there were hoof trimming videos on YouTube but they were all of a cow's foot that looked almost perfect being made to look a bit more perfect,\" he said. \"Nobody wanted to show lameness and part of that is part of the problem, I think within agriculture, people are scared to show the reality of it. \"The reality of it is there are problems, but everybody tries to fix those problems.\" He quickly started to realise that the questions he was being asked online were not coming from the agricultural sector.\n\n\"The videos grew,\" he explained. \"Within the first month we had about 1,000 subscribers - that was five years ago. \"Now there are 6.8 million people who follow us religiously across all social media channels, and we get anywhere from 120 to 160 or 170 million views per month.\" It has become a business that employs five people and has a worldwide reach. \"Things have got quite big, but I'm still a hoof trimmer who hoof trims and that is my job,\" he said. \"All the other stuff, I always think, I just kind of play at.\" He never for a minute imagined it would be so popular and its reach would go so far. \"I've met people who have these fantastic stories attached to the Hoof GP who are completely removed from my life,\" he said. He is keen for people to see beyond the image displayed on social media, however, and is now writing a book.\n\nThe Hoof GP is also passionate about the corner of Dumfries and Galloway where he lives"
