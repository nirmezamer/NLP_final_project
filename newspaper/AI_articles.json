    "Duo euthanasia: Why a happily married couple decided to die together": "## Duo Euthanasia: Why a Happily Married Couple Decided to Die Together\n\nJan Faber (70) and Els van Leeningen (71) died together on June 3, 2024, after receiving lethal medication from two doctors in the Netherlands. This practice, known as duo-euthanasia, is legal but rare. Each year, more couples choose to end their lives together, citing unbearable suffering. \n\nJan, plagued by chronic back pain, and Els, suffering from dementia, decided to end their lives after years of living on boats and in their campervan. They had discussed euthanasia before, concerned about the quality of life they would face with their conditions. \n\n“If you take a lot of medicine, you live like a zombie,” Jan said in an interview with the BBC. “So, with the pain I have, and Els’ illness, I think we have to stop this.\"\n\nThe couple's decision to die together was not without controversy.  Some, like Dr. Theo Boer, professor of healthcare ethics, worry that the growing acceptance of duo-euthanasia is eroding the taboo on intentional killing. \"In the past year we’ve seen dozens of cases of duo-euthanasia, and there’s a general tendency to ‘hero-ify’ dying together,” said Dr. Boer. \n\nJan and Els' son, however, supported their decision, stating, \"There is no other solution.\"  The family shared a final dinner together the night before and listened to music as the doctors arrived. \n\nThe case of Jan and Els highlights the complex ethical issues surrounding end-of-life decisions, particularly for couples facing debilitating illnesses. \n",

Discussions are ongoing within the party, the White House, and the Biden-Harris campaign about a range of options, including a possible withdrawal of Biden's candidacy. \n\nDemocratic officials and political operatives express concerns about the president's stamina and mental fitness, raising questions about his capacity to compete with Donald Trump in November.  Some sources, including prominent political columnist David Ignatius and New York Times columnist Ezra Klein, have previously voiced concerns about Biden's age and called for him to step aside. Following the debate, these concerns have escalated, with high-profile Democrats calling for the president to consider withdrawing from the race.\n\nDespite this growing pressure, the decision ultimately rests with Biden himself. While some sources suggest the president's wife and sister may influence his decision, it is unlikely he would be removed from the ticket against his will.  \n\nThe situation remains fluid, with Biden's campaign team seeking to counter the negative narrative surrounding his recent performance. The president himself addressed concerns about his age at a rally in North Carolina, expressing his commitment to the role. However, the possibility of a change in his candidacy remains, with sources indicating a potential 5% chance of his stepping aside.  The next few weeks will be crucial in determining whether Biden can regain momentum or succumb to mounting pressure within his own party. \n",

After months of fighting in a “forgotten” mission on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River, he describes the difference in fighting as “huge.” \n\n“We’d managed to maintain the bridgehead, but no equipment has crossed it, and we haven’t once broken through Russian defences,” Oleksiy says. He describes the area as a “moonscape” with heavy losses for both sides. \n\nHe also notes the increased use of drones in the Kharkiv region compared to the southern front. “Everything happened in a hurry and there was no preparation,” he says.  “Everyone is here: marines, air assault forces, the State Border Guard Service, regular infantry, territorial defence and national police.” \n\nOleksiy’s account highlights the strain on Ukraine's military as Russia continues its offensive in the east.  Dmytro Pletenchuk, spokesman for Ukraine’s South Defence Forces, acknowledges the challenge, saying, “Those who have been forced to defend their country are yesterday’s civilians…They will of course have a different perception of the army.\" \n",

Attal warned that an RN win would unleash “impulses of hate and aggression,” but the party led by Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella has solidified its lead in opinion polls.  \n\nThe RN, which has faced accusations of racism, could secure an absolute majority in the National Assembly after the second round of voting on July 7.

Attal's Ensemble alliance is in third place with 20.5%. \n\nThe RN's success follows its strong showing in the European elections in June, which saw a surge of support across France.  If the party wins an absolute majority, it will pose a significant challenge to President Emmanuel Macron, who has pledged to remain in office until 2027.

The 42-year-old was a key player in organized crime during the early 2000s, when Nottingham was labelled the “gun crime capital of the UK”. Following his release from prison in 2017, a surge in firearms offences in the city was linked to Moran’s drug trafficking activities. He subsequently fled to Marbella, Spain, where he was attacked by rivals, before moving to Dubai and being extradited in 2020. \n\nNottinghamshire Police Assistant Chief Constable Rob Griffin described Moran as a “gangster” who posed a significant threat to the city. “He is frankly a gangster,” Griffin stated, highlighting Moran's leadership of the Bestwood organised crime group. “He was arranging the delivery of guns and significant quantities of drugs into Nottingham.” \n\nThe operation, dubbed Operation Encyclic, involved the seizure of firearms, drugs, and cash, along with the arrest of numerous individuals associated with Moran's network.  The investigation ultimately led to Moran's extradition from Dubai and his subsequent conviction.

    "Can Biden be replaced as Democrat nominee? Who could replace him?": "##  Can Biden be Replaced as Democrat Nominee? Who Could Replace Him?\n\nFollowing a less-than-stellar performance in the first 2024 presidential debate, questions are swirling around President Joe Biden's future as the Democratic nominee. Democratic sources report panic and confusion within the party, sparking discussions about whether the 81-year-old president should step aside. While the New York Times editorial board has called for Biden to withdraw, the question remains: could Biden be replaced?\n\nIf Biden chooses to withdraw, the party could easily replace him, according to political historian Leah Wright Rigueur.  The Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago will officially select the nominee from August 19-22, where delegates, largely pledged to Biden, would be free to choose a new candidate. However, Rigueur notes, \"If he were to get replaced, part of the negotiation for him stepping down would be that he would get the final say in who replaces him.\"\n\nForcing Biden out is unlikely. While DNC rules allow delegates to \"reflect the sentiments of those who elected them,\" experts doubt a revolt among delegates would occur. Replacing Biden would be a messy affair, with potential legal challenges from conservative groups, as well as an uncertain path to selecting a new nominee. \n\nWhile Vice President Kamala Harris would automatically take over if Biden withdrew during his presidency, the same rules don't apply in this scenario.  Harris would need to win the majority of delegates just like any other candidate. Other possible contenders include Minnesota congressman Dean Phillips, writer Marianne Williamson, and governors Gavin Newsom, Gretchen Whitmer, and Josh Shapiro.\n\nThe situation remains fluid, with Biden showing no sign of stepping down. However, the possibility of a new Democratic nominee is a significant development in the 2024 race. \n",

In a 6-3 decision along ideological lines, the court overturned a lower court ruling that had found the practice unconstitutional. The ruling, issued on Friday, is the court's most significant decision on homelessness since the 1980s. \n\nThe case stemmed from a lawsuit filed by three homeless individuals in Grants Pass, Oregon, who received citations for sleeping and camping outside. The city argued that criminal penalties were necessary for public safety and cleanliness. Justice Neil Gorsuch, writing for the majority, stated that the city's regulations do not constitute cruel and unusual punishment, as they focus on actions rather than the \"mere status\" of being homeless.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, in her dissenting opinion, countered that \"sleep is a biological necessity, not a crime.\"\n\nThe ruling has been met with mixed reactions. Some cities, including San Francisco, welcomed the decision, stating it will help them manage public spaces more effectively. However, advocates for the homeless, such as the National Alliance to End Homelessness, expressed concern that the ruling will harm those experiencing homelessness and push them further into the criminal justice system. \n\nThis decision comes as homelessness continues to rise in the US, with an estimated 653,000 people experiencing homelessness in 2023, the highest number since tracking began in 2007. \n",

    "Cyril Ramaphosa hits out at John Steenhuisen in South Africa coalition row": "South Africa's fragile coalition government is facing a major crisis just weeks after its formation, as President Cyril Ramaphosa accuses Democratic Alliance (DA) leader John Steenhuisen of trying to establish a \"parallel government.\" In a letter dated June 25, seen by local media, Mr. Ramaphosa alleges that the DA is breaking the terms of their coalition agreement. The letter was written after the DA rejected Mr. Ramaphosa's offer of six cabinet positions, demanding two more. Mr. Ramaphosa also criticized DA federal chairperson Helen Zille for \"offensive\" and \"inconsistent\" demands. This dispute has led to the DA threatening to withdraw from the coalition, citing the ANC's breach of their prior agreement, including the allocation of the Trade and Industry Ministry. The potential collapse of the coalition has sent shockwaves through South African markets, with the rand plunging against the dollar. The business sector, which had advocated for a strong coalition, is now expressing deep concern over the political instability. \n",

The search, led by experienced local firefighters, police and mountain rangers, is focusing on the ravines and trails around the village of Masca in the Rural de Teno national park.  Authorities had hoped for a “massive search” but less than 12 members of the public had arrived at the meeting point before it began.\n\nMr. Slater, 19, has not been heard from since the morning of June 17th, after he told a friend he was lost in the mountains and had 1% battery on his phone. Police confirmed the search would be more extensive and detailed, covering areas previously explored. Volunteers included British climber and TikTok personality Paul Arnott, who has been searching on the island for the past week, and Tenerife local Livia Karczeysky, who said she was taking part because she too had a 19-year-old son.\n\nSince Mr. Slater disappeared, authorities have deployed helicopters, search dogs, and drones but no trace of him has been found. His mother, Debbie Duncan, previously told the BBC her son was on his first holiday abroad without parents. “He's just an all-round nice, bubbly guy with hundreds of friends who love being in his company,\" she said. \"He's gorgeous, he's beautiful.

The ruling, in a case involving herring fishermen, was met with cheers from conservatives who have long sought to curtail the power of federal agencies.  \n\nThe Chevron deference, established in *Chevron v Natural Resources Defense Council*, allowed federal agencies to interpret ambiguous laws and fill in \"gaps\" in legislation.

    "Nike shares tumble as it loses ground to upstart rivals": "Nike shares plummeted over 12% in after-hours trading on Thursday following the company's announcement of a surprise 10% drop in quarterly revenue. The decline, attributed to growing competition from upstart brands like On and Hoka, could result in a $15 billion loss in market value. Nike CEO John Donahoe cited weakening international demand, including in China, as a contributing factor.  However, he remains optimistic about the upcoming Paris Olympics as a platform for re-engaging consumers through new products and a targeted marketing campaign.  \"The Paris Olympics offers us a pinnacle moment to communicate our vision of sport to the world,\" Donahoe said.  Analysts like Neil Saunders of GlobalData Retail suggest that Nike's recent struggles stem from a lack of innovation and effective marketing, particularly in comparison to newer brands.  \"There's a sense that Nike just hasn't innovated enough, it hasn't marketed enough, it hasn't told enough stories around its products,\" Saunders told the BBC.  Nike's shift to a direct-to-consumer model, prioritizing its own stores and website over wholesale partnerships, has also contributed to the decline in sales, according to Reuters. The company's future success hinges on regaining its footing in the market and effectively communicating its value proposition to consumers. \n",

The city has been gradually phasing out the legacy trains since December, replacing them with modern, wheelchair-accessible vehicles.  \n\nThe two final trains, which have each clocked an estimated 2.6 million miles, were driven out for their last trips by Julie Baker, a veteran driver with 35 years of experience on the subway.  \"I'm actually emotional, but it's time to change,\" Baker said, adding that she had driven the trains almost their entire lifespan.  \n\nThe old trains were first introduced in 1980 as part of a modernization project, replacing the original 19th-century carriages.  One of the legacy trains has now been retired to Glasgow's Riverside Museum for display. The £288m upgrade program, which also includes platform doors and driverless trains, marks the third modernization of the subway since 2012. \n",

    "India heat: What record air conditioner sales reveal about heatwave": "## India's Heatwave Drives Record Air Conditioner Sales\n\nThe unprecedented heatwave gripping India has spurred a surge in air conditioner sales, revealing a growing disparity in how people are coping with rising temperatures.  Govind Ram, a Delhi resident, recently purchased an air conditioner for his children, citing unbearable heat as the reason. “I’ve endured the worst summers under just a fan. But this year, my children suffered so much that I had to buy our family’s first air conditioner,” he said.\n\nAir conditioner sales are expected to see a 60% increase this summer, a sharp contrast to the usual 25-30% growth in previous years.  \"In my 45 years in the air-con industry, I've never seen anything like this,\" says B Thiagarajan, managing director of Blue Star.  \n\nDespite only 8% of Indian households owning air conditioners, India is the world's fastest-growing AC market. This surge is attributed to rising disposable incomes, increased aspirations, and a growing awareness of the need for climate control. However, experts warn that reliance on air conditioning could exacerbate existing inequalities.  A recent nationwide survey found that while only 1 in 8 four-wheeler owners felt uncomfortable in their homes during the heatwave, almost half of those without vehicles did.  The study highlighted the widening gap between wealthier households with access to cooling technologies and poorer households struggling with extreme temperatures.\n\nThe rising demand for air conditioning underscores the urgency for India to implement sustainable solutions to mitigate the effects of climate change. This includes revitalizing aquatic habitats, promoting energy-efficient buildings, and encouraging the use of cool roofs and chilled water systems. \n",
    "Supreme Court rejects plan to shield Sacklers in Purdue opioid deal": "## Supreme Court Rejects Plan to Shield Sacklers in Purdue Opioid Deal\n\nThe US Supreme Court has struck down a key provision in the bankruptcy deal for Purdue Pharma, denying the Sackler family protection from future lawsuits related to their role in the opioid crisis. The Sacklers, owners of the OxyContin maker, had agreed to pay $6 billion towards a wider settlement in exchange for immunity from civil claims. \n\nHowever, the court ruled that granting such protections to the Sacklers, who did not themselves declare bankruptcy, was unauthorized under law. \"The Sacklers have not agreed to place anything approaching their full assets on the table for opioid victims,\" wrote Justice Neil Gorsuch, delivering the 5-4 majority opinion. \n\nThe ruling is a victory for the US government and others who argued that releasing the Sacklers would misuse the bankruptcy system.  Ellen Isaacs, whose son died from an overdose, expressed gratitude for the court's decision, stating, \"I'd like to see them held fully accountable.\"\n\nWhile the ruling throws the future of the settlement into question, it leaves open the possibility of holding the Sacklers liable for their role in the opioid epidemic, which has claimed over 80,000 lives annually since 1999. \n",

    "What is GDP, how is it measured and why does it matter?": "## What is GDP, how is it measured and why does it matter?\n\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) is a key economic indicator that measures the total value of goods and services produced in a country. In the UK, the Office of National Statistics (ONS) publishes monthly GDP figures, but quarterly figures are considered more significant. \n\n\"A rising GDP generally indicates a healthy economy,\" explained Dr. Emily Jones, an economist at the University of Cambridge. \"It suggests increased spending, job creation, tax revenue, and better wage growth.\" Conversely, a declining GDP signifies a shrinking economy, which can negatively impact businesses and workers. \n\n\"Two consecutive quarters of GDP decline constitute a recession,\" warned Dr. Jones. \"This can lead to pay freezes, job losses, and a broader economic slowdown.\" Understanding GDP is crucial for policymakers, businesses, and individuals alike as it provides a snapshot of the country's economic health and informs decisions regarding investment, spending, and employment. \n",

Talking about financial difficulties early can prevent spiraling debt. Debt advisors can provide free, personalized support.\n\nPrioritize urgent bills like rent, mortgage, utilities, and taxes. StepChange recommends minimum payments on all debts to avoid default charges.  Then focus on the debt with the highest interest rate.\n\nFor energy bill debt, your supplier must offer a payment plan. If you don't agree, they can switch you to pre-payment mode.\n\nConsider a \"breathing space\" scheme for a 60-day break from interest and charges. It’s available in England and Wales for those receiving debt advice or mental health crisis treatment. \n\nIf you can't repay your debts, explore personal insolvency options.

    "Is this really the TikTok general election?": "## Is this really the TikTok general election?\n\nThe 2023 UK general election has seen political parties embrace TikTok, but is the platform truly driving the campaign? While Nigel Farage has found success with a five-second Eminem-inspired video garnering over eight million views, the platform's overall influence remains debatable. \n\nLabour's use of TikTok memes has garnered attention, with their 11-second takedown of Rishi Sunak's national service policy generating 5.1 million views. However, some argue this approach feels inauthentic, while others believe it successfully targets a younger audience. \n\nDespite the buzz, TikTok's reach pales in comparison to Facebook and YouTube, where the main parties are focusing their spending.  According to Who Targets Me, £4.2 million has been spent on election ads on Meta platforms in the first month of the campaign. While the \"TikTok battle\" dominates headlines, the real fight is likely being waged on platforms with a larger and older audience. \n",

These individuals, often under the age of 30, are creating and sharing political content that is reaching millions of users, sometimes surpassing the reach of official party posts and advertising.  \n\nTolu, a 15-year-old from London, saw her TikTok video criticizing anti-immigration rhetoric reach tens of thousands of users overnight.  “The post was blowing up really quickly,” she said. \"I was shocked.\"  Similarly, 16-year-old Will from Somerset shared clips supporting Brexit and concerns over knife crime, garnering hundreds of thousands of views.  \"I find it incredibly interesting that most of the time I’m the one who is breaking news to people and not the mainstream media,” he said. \n\nThe BBC’s Marianna Spring, who investigated this trend, found that 90% of political posts seen by young \"Undercover Voters\" – fictional profiles designed to observe algorithmic content – were from individual users, not official parties.  Many accidental influencers have reported receiving threats and abuse, but they also see the platform as a way to engage in the democratic process.\n\nThe rise of these accidental influencers highlights the evolving landscape of social media and its impact on political discourse. Algorithms that promote content based on user engagement can amplify the voices of individuals, sometimes eclipsing official political messaging.  This phenomenon raises concerns about misinformation, manipulation, and the potential for young people to be unwittingly drawn into divisive or harmful narratives. \n",
    "Bradford: 'Sport putting children off physical activity'": "**Bradford: 'Sport putting children off physical activity'**\n\nA University of Bradford academic has argued that a focus on organized sports may be counterproductive in encouraging children to be more physically active. Dr Andrew Daly-Smith believes sport is seen as a barrier by children who don't enjoy participating.  He suggests that instead of pushing sports clubs, schools should focus on general lifestyle changes and integrate movement into everyday activities. \n\n\"While establishing healthy nutrition in schools is a priority to lower levels of obesity, there is also a need for schools to help children move more,\" said Dr Daly-Smith. \"Sadly, the persistence of governments to focus on sport is turning many children and young people off being physically active. It's not about joining a sports club, it's more about ensuring physical movement and good lifestyle choices - like a healthy diet - are built into the school day.\"\n\nDr Daly-Smith's comments come as Bradford Council faces a rising childhood obesity problem. Figures show that one in five children in reception classes are overweight, and one in three primary school leavers. This issue, along with broader health inequalities in the city, highlights the urgent need for effective strategies to promote healthy lifestyles among young people. \n",

The European Commission, responsible for competition within the EU, stated that Apple's App Store practices hinder rival marketplaces, marking the first violation of the Digital Markets Act (DMA).  Apple could face a fine of up to 10% of its global revenue if it doesn't adhere to these rules.

Edward Oakenfull, Robert Lomas, and Leslie Lilley, candidates for Derbyshire Dales, Barnsley North, and Southend East and Rochford respectively, will remain on the ballot paper as Reform candidates due to the late timing. \n\nDespite this, a Reform spokesman stated that if elected, the candidates would sit as independent MPs, encouraging voters to still support Reform through their ballot paper selection. This follows leader Nigel Farage disowning the candidates during Friday's BBC Question Time, citing their offensive remarks. \n\nThese developments follow a series of controversies surrounding Reform's candidate selection process, with numerous instances of offensive social media posts surfacing since the election campaign began.

    "WHY VOTE? HOW ELECTIONS AFFECT YOUR LIFE": "## Why Vote? How Elections Affect Your Life\n\nDespite a low turnout expected for the July 4th election, politics impacts everyone's daily lives, from the cost of a cup of tea to the security of a job, argues the BBC.  According to the British Social Attitudes survey, public trust in government and politicians is at a 50-year low. This disengagement is understandable, as political discourse can seem distant and removed from everyday realities. However, the BBC reminds us that \"politics is the constant conversation we have as a country,\" impacting our everyday lives in ways we may not even realize.  From the cost of living to future economic stability, the decisions made in Westminster directly affect our personal experiences.  The BBC encourages readers to explore their connections to politics by highlighting relevant news stories and demonstrating how our lives are intertwined with the political process. This upcoming election, therefore, presents an opportunity for citizens to engage in the conversation and shape the future of their communities and the nation. \n",

The two leaders sparred over a range of issues, including immigration, tax, Brexit, and their parties' candidates.\n\nA notable difference in tone emerged between the two. Mr. Ramsay, often starting his answers with \"good question\", faced audience skepticism while Mr. Farage took a more combative approach, even eliciting laughter with his \"I have no idea!\" response to a question about problematic candidates.\n\nBoth leaders were challenged about controversial comments made by some of their candidates on social media. Mr. Ramsay declined to comment on specific accusations against Green candidates, while Mr. Farage appeared to withdraw support for one candidate live on air.\n\nMr. Ramsay acknowledged his own car was a hybrid, not fully electric, due to infrastructure limitations, advocating for improved public transport and nationalized railways.  He also declined to specify the cost of the Green Party's car scrappage scheme.\n\nBoth leaders expressed strong opinions on foreign policy. Mr. Ramsay expressed concern about a potential Donald Trump victory, while Mr. Farage praised the former President's record.

The BBC Verify team fact-checked some of their claims. \n\nMr. Ramsay claimed the UK has some of the most expensive train tickets in Europe. While comparing fares across countries is complex, a 2016 European Commission report found the UK had the highest inter-city fares for peak single tickets. Since then, UK rail fares have risen 35%, the fourth highest increase in Europe.\n\nMr. Farage stated that migrants arriving in small boats could be returned to France. This is one of Reform UK's key pledges, but legal experts say it's unclear how it could be done under international law. Returning migrants to France would require explicit permission from the French government, which does not currently exist.  \n\nThese fact-checks highlight the importance of scrutinizing political claims to ensure accuracy in the public sphere. \n",

While Mr. Farage has stated that support was withdrawn from candidates who made offensive comments, he maintains the Channel 4 footage was a \"set-up.\"  \n\nLord Kinnock believes that combating Reform's message requires a proactive approach. \"We have to combat this populist nationalism with words and explaining to people what these people are, not just who they are,\" he told the Guardian. \"People like Farage, love the personal attention...so we have to focus on explaining what they are, and all that inconsistencies and falsehoods, they plant and harvest lies.\" \n\nHe concluded by emphasizing the need for Labour to act swiftly and effectively, stating, \"The populist right have to be combated with actions that means the implementation of change which is positive and cumulative and driven by strong purpose in the service of community.\" \n",

Doug Workman, a 63-year-old builder from Chilcompton, expressed his frustration with the rising retirement age, stating, \"I don't know how I'm going to cope until I'm 67.\" He believes it's unfair that he started working at 16 and will now have to work until 67, while those who stay in education until 18 will work for two years less.

He also suggests using upcycled shelves and chests of drawers for plants, ensuring mobility for potential relocation. \n\nLisa Hudson, an expert grower for the Royal Horticultural Society, recommends starting small, utilizing existing containers and ensuring drainage.

The current benefits system, she says, forces her to choose between moving in with her partner or receiving vital disability payments.  \n\nKindred, deemed unfit for work by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), receives £405.40 per month in Personal Independence Payment (PIP) and £809.64 in universal credit every four weeks.  However, if she moved in with her partner, who earns around £30,000 per year, government benefits calculators indicate she would lose her universal credit payments.  \n\n\"I think it's a cruel system that forces disabled people to choose between the security of living and love,\" Kindred stated, highlighting the \"living-as-if-married\" clause that prevents her from living with her partner without losing vital support. She also expressed concern about proposed changes to PIP, which she believes will further complicate the system for those with EDS. \n\n\"I’d like to move in with my partner of five years but unfortunately we can’t because of the living-as-if-married clause,\" Kindred said. \"That's £405 a month to live on entirely, that's before I pay for a private physio, which makes up for what the NHS can’t provide for me. I’m basically stuck living with my parents because that’s the only option available to me.\" \n\nThe case highlights the need for a more nuanced and compassionate approach to the benefits system, ensuring disabled individuals are not forced to choose between love and the financial means to live. \n",
