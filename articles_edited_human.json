For the right players and agents, that is really important and really powerful.\n\n\"Alexis (Mac Allister) was a loan player, who took his time to adapt to the club, rapidly progressed and moved on. Simon Adingra won Afcon [Africa Cup of Nations].\n\n\"Hopefully, we will have a player who wins the Euros \u2013 but I won\u2019t say which country.

Looking from the outside in, Forest shouldn't have any issues with potential PSR deductions for the season that has just ended.\n\n\"They have done it by selling players - yes, they have had to part with some players - such as Moussa Niakhate and Orel Mangala, who are fully expected to depart for Lyon.\n\n\"Elliot Anderson came in on 'PSR deadline day' which allowed goalkeeper Odysseas Vlachodimos to go the other way to Newcastle United in a separate deal.\n\n\"So Forest have lost some players, but the money they have been able to get in for those players should generate enough profit to see them safe in terms of PSR.\"\n\nListen to the full podcast on BBC Sounds"], "Simon Boas, aid worker: I'm as happy as I've been in my life": ["'I'm as happy as I've been in my life,' says aid worker Simon Boas as he faces death\n\nSimon Boas explains how cancer diagnosis helped him enjoy life more\n\nIn what he expects to be one of his final interviews, Simon spoke to Emma Barnett on the Today Programme, offering his reflections on life and death as he moved into hospice care.\n\nOver the following year, he knitted together his reflections on life into a book - A Beginner's Guide to Dying. The book is set to hit the shelves in October. It will be a posthumous publication.\n\nIn September 2023, Simon Boas was diagnosed with throat cancer. Aged just 46, he was told the disease was terminal, and that it would ultimately take his life.\n\nMy pain is under control and I'm terribly happy - it sounds weird to say, but I'm as happy as I've ever been in my life.\n\nI used to think I'd rather be hit by the proverbial bus, but having a couple of months knowing this is coming has really helped me both do the boring 'death-min', but also get my thoughts and prepare myself, and feel so accepting of what's to come.\n\nIt's been such a great bonus, actually.\n\nThe book is called A Beginner's Guide to Dying, but really what I'm trying to convey is how enjoying life to the full kind of prepares you for this.\n\nIn some ways I was lucky that my life and my career have taken me to quite a lot of places where death is more a part of life than it is for us in the West.\n\nI spent my life as an aid worker - quite a lot with the UN - and I've lived in places where death is something that not just exists in the background, but is imminently possible.\n\nI spent three years running a UN office in the Gaza Strip. I spent a lot of time in Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and I've been working in Ukraine. Seeing people there for whom death is such a part of life - they lose children, they don't know where the next meal is coming from - has really helped me.\n\nI've also been a Samaritan for the past four years. In some cases you are on the line while people end their lives, so I think death has been more a part of my life than for many people.\n\nIt does us all good to think about it.\n\nThat's not in a gloomy way... by kind of realising it's inevitable and it's a part of life, it actually throws life into perspective and helps you to enjoy it more and prioritise the important things.\n\nMy family are about to go through the most difficult thing in their lives. My lovely wife, Aurelie, and my parents... are well surrounded, and I hope that my cheerfulness in the leaving of life might perhaps help them in the next few years...\n\nAll our lives are little books - but they're not someone else's complete book. You're a chapter or a page or a footnote in someone else's life and they are going to keep writing beautiful chapters when you are gone.\n\nAnd those green shoots can grow around grief and put it in perspective.

I love the idea that most films about time travel revolve around changing one tiny thing in the past, and of course they come back to the present and everything is different.\n\nIf you project that forward, you can change huge amounts of things into the future.\n\nAll our tombs will be unvisited in a few years - all our actions will mostly be unremembered - but the smile you gave the checkout lady or the kind words you gave to a stranger in the street could still be rippling forward.\n\nWe all have that opportunity and it's a huge power. And I want everyone to realise how special and precious they are.\n\nI love melted cheese. Unfortunately I haven't been able to eat since Christmas. The chemotherapy killed my taste buds and the radiotherapy killed my salivary glands.\n\nSo, sadly, melted cheese and all the things I loved are off the menu.\n\nHowever, I've been given full permission by my oncologist and my hospice team to enjoy as much Muscadet and as many cheeky rollups as I want - and I shall certainly be indulging in those and spending time with my family.\n\nI'm sort of - not looking forward to my final day - of course that's the wrong way to see it. But I'm kind of curious about it, and I'm happy and I'm ready.\n\nAs Julian of Norwich said: \"All shall be well, and all shall be well and all manner of things shall be well.\""], "Weight-loss drug linked to rare eye condition": ["Study links weight-loss drug to rare eye condition\n\n3 days ago Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nPeople prescribed semaglutide, sold as Ozempic and Wegovy, to lose weight, may have a higher risk of developing a serious but rare eye condition, a study suggests. Analysing 17,000 patients over six years, US researchers found those taking the drug for type 2 diabetes were four times more likely to be diagnosed with the condition than patients not on the drug. Among those taking it for obesity, the risk of the condition was seven times higher. But the researchers cannot prove semaglutide caused the eye condition, which can lead to loss of vision in one eye, nor can they explain the increased risk or the difference between the groups. The numbers affected were small.\n\n'Beach-body ready'\n\nNovo Nordisk, the company that makes the drug, said patient safety was \u201ca top priority\u201d but the study had lots of limitations. Trials show semaglutide can help people with obesity lose more than 10% of their body weight, if they also make changes to diet and lifestyle. There has been huge hype around the drug after celebrities on social media starting posting about their sudden weight loss while taking it. Despite it being available on prescription only to people with type 2 diabetes (Ozempic) and the most obese (Wegovy), online pharmacies are selling semaglutide injections with few checks on the weight or underlying health of the person buying them. And as a result, health bosses say they are worried the drug is being misused as \"a quick fix\" for people trying to get \"beach-body ready\". All medicines carry potential side-effects. Some of the most common for semaglutide include: nausea\n\nvomiting\n\ndiarrhoea\n\nstomach pain\n\nconstipation A change in vision is listed as one of the more serious potential side-effects, on both Ozempic and Wegovy's safety information for patients.\n\nNon-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), affects up to 10 out of 100,000 people in the general population, the researchers, from Harvard Medical School, report in journal JAMA Ophthalmology. It is thought to be caused by reduced blood flow to an optic nerve and cannot currently be treated. The study revealed: 17 cases among type 2 diabetes patients taking semaglutide\n\nsix cases among type 2 diabetes patient taking other drugs\n\n20 cases among overweight and obese patients taking semaglutide\n\nthree cases among overweight and obese patients taking a different drug Harvard Medical School ophthalmology professor Dr Joseph Rizzo said: \"Our findings should be viewed as being significant but tentative, as future studies are needed to examine these questions in a much larger and more diverse population.\" UK eye experts from the Royal College of Ophthalmologists recommend patients taking semaglutide are informed of the small risk of developing eye diseases.\n\nBalance of side-effects and benefits\n\nBecause of the small numbers of patients affected by the eye condition in the study - who may not have been taking their medication as prescribed or be representative of the wider population - the statistics on risk may not be accurate.\n\nNovo Nordisk said the study did not take into account whether patients smoked or for how long they had had diabetes. And there were challenges in accurately coding and identifying cases of the eye condition. A spokesperson said: \"NAION is not listed as a known adverse drug reaction\" for marketed formulations of semaglutude - Ozempic, Rybelsus and Wegovy. \"Semaglutide has been studied in large real-world evidence studies and robust clinical development programmes.\" The drug is also being examined in a trial called Focus, which concludes in 2027, to assess its long-term effects on diabetic retinopathy - an eye condition in type 2 diabetes patients."], "Queensland orders sperm donation purge over mix-ups": ["Australian state orders sperm bank purge over mix-ups\n\nQueensland's fertility industry has come under scrutiny in recent years\n\nA purge of frozen sperm has been ordered in the Australian state of Queensland, after an audit by its health watchdog found almost half of fertility samples were at risk of misidentification.\n\nSuch mix-ups can rob parents and donor children of key genetic information and medical records, and advocates say creates a danger of accidental incest.\n\nQueensland is home to one of the country\u2019s largest IVF industries, however it is self-regulated and has come under scrutiny as some of its biggest providers face claims of malpractice.\n\nThe clean out compounds a national shortage of donated sperm which has been driven by high demand, tightening regulations, and pandemic-related disruptions.\n\nOne in six Australian couples face difficulty trying to start a family, government data shows, with many increasingly relying on donors to conceive.\n\nAn inquiry into the multi-million-dollar sector in Queensland by the state\u2019s health ombudsman this week found \u201csystemic issues\u201d concerning \u201cquality and safety\u201d and \u201csafeguards for consumers, donors and donor-conceived children\u201d.\n\nThe report detailed how 42% of sperm donations, egg samples and embryos in Queensland had \u201c identification and traceability\u201d issues - meaning clinics had lost track of or incorrectly labelled samples, or allowed them to deteriorate below laboratory standards.\n\nIt also aired allegations from patients who accused IVF providers of failing to disclose the medical conditions of donors, misidentifying eggs and embryos, and mixing up sperm - which one family said had resulted in them parenting children from different biological fathers.\n\nThe body recommended that all fertility providers destroy stored donor material that does not meet current identification standards.\n\n\u201cThe impact on consumers and the donor-conceived children... cannot be underestimated,\u201d the report concluded, adding that \u201cappropriate counselling should be offered\u201d by fertility providers.\n\nIt is unclear how many sperm samples could be destroyed, but the ombudsman deemed \"thousands\" frozen before 2020 as \"high risk\u201d because they \u201cdid not comply with double witnessing\u201d - a practice in which two IVF professionals check a patient\u2019s material has been labelled correctly.\n\nAnastasia Gunn - a mother suing one of Queensland\u2019s fertility providers for allegedly providing her with the wrong sperm in 2014 - told the Guardian Australia she was \u201chorrified [but] not surprised\u201d by the ombudsman\u2019s findings.\n\n\u201cIt is scary to think how many patients may have unknowingly conceived with the wrong sperm.\n\n\u201cWhy were the clinics not double-checking when they were making humans?

Now they're fighting back\n\n4 days ago By Hannah Ritchie , BBC News, Sydney Share\n\nHeidi Metcalf A recent government survey found that two thirds of women, like Heidi Metcalf, have encountered gender bias or discrimination in Australian healthcare\n\nThere\u2019s a memory, or more specifically a moment, that came to define Heidi Metcalf\u2019s second birth. It wasn\u2019t saying goodbye to her husband and newborn before being wheeled into an operating theatre, or the heart attack she thought she was having as she lay there on the table. It was when a male obstetrician \u201cripped the placenta\u201d out of her body, without word or warning. A nurse, Ms Metcalf knows the intervention - while immensely painful - was necessary. She couldn't push it out naturally, which was causing potentially fatal bleeding. But she hadn\u2019t \u201cseen or met this man before\u201d, and she can\u2019t get past the fact that her consent, during one of the most traumatic experiences of her life, \u201cmeant so little\u201d. \u201cIt felt like a violation - I needed to feel involved in what was happening to my body, and not just like a bystander.\u201d Ms Metcalf is one of thousands of Australian women who have come forward to tell their stories, after the federal government assembled a team of experts to tackle what it calls \u201cmedical misogyny\u201d. So far, they have uncovered that a staggering two-thirds of females nationwide have encountered gender bias or discrimination in healthcare. And many say it is taking place when they're at their most vulnerable, such as during intimate examinations, or like Ms Metcalf, while in labour. Others report having their pain dismissed or dangerously misdiagnosed. The BBC spoke to six women for this piece. They shared experiences of being called \u201canxious\u201d, \u201cpushy\u201d or even \u201chysterical\u201d while seeking treatment for a range of debilitating symptoms. They also said they felt that the men in their lives seemed to consistently have their pain taken more seriously.\n\n'I just don't feel safe'\n\nNadiah Akbar was once told by a doctor in Singapore that the extreme fatigue she was experiencing was due to the \u201cstress\u201d of being a busy mother. Tests would later show it was thyroid cancer.\n\nNadiah Akbar Nadiah Akbar says she has been misdiagnosed repeatedly - often having her symptoms dismissed as stress releated\n\nYears later, in remission and having migrated to Australia, staff at a Melbourne hospital failed to diagnose a cartilage tear in her hip socket and a slipped disk in her back. Instead, they suggested the crippling pain could be linked to \u201cdepression\u201d or being \u201covertired\u201d. It led to Ms Akbar paying for two costly MRI scans out of pocket to be taken seriously. \u201c\u2018Oh, it\u2019s nothing.\u2019 I\u2019ve heard that statement so many times... It\u2019s really disheartening as a human being to keep hearing that,\u201d she says. \u201cIt takes a lot of energy for you to keep advocating for yourself, and that\u2019s the part that\u2019s worrying - a lot of people just stop.\u201d Laura - who asked to have her name changed - is close to that point, after years of having symtoms of what would eventually be confirmed as a traumatic brain injury dismissed. \u201cI don\u2019t get healthcare without my partner with me, that\u2019s a blanket rule,\u201d she says, explaining that she feels her concerns are taken \u201cmore seriously\u201d when voiced by a man. \u201cI just don't feel safe, engaging with the system, because when you're young and you're told over and over that something is all in your head, it's easy to believe it.\u201d Like so many others across the country, both women say they\u2019re coming forward to share their experiences to seize on this moment of promised change. Assistant health minister Ged Kearney - who chairs the national council tasked with examining these issues - says that their stories, along with those of countless others facing additional disadvantage in First Nations, LGBTQ+, and migrant communities will guide its work. Her team's remit is vast and broad areas of focus have already emerged. But untangling gender inequity in medicine is no small task, and Australia\u2019s attempts could have far-reaching implications as other nations eye reforms.\n\nGed Kearney Assistant health minister Ged Kearney with her daughter and granddaughter\n\n'A one-size-fits-all approach'\n\nThe problem is not that \u201call healthcare professionals have some set agenda against women\u201d, Ms Kearny says. Rather it's that bias is woven into the fabric of modern medicine because for centuries it was \u201cdelivered by and designed for\u201d men. Women\u2019s health - by contrast \u2013 was often rooted in myth and pernicious gender stereotypes. \u201cHysteria\u201d, a now-defunct medical term, was a catch-all diagnosis for females presenting with an array of symptoms, meaning their pain was attributed to emotional causes, rather than biological ones. But today, some women say they continue to feel gaslit - disbelieved and patronised - in medical settings. And a lack of diversity in medical research compounds the issue. More than 70% of participants in early-stage clinical trials globally are still white men, while male cells and animals are used as standard in the lab, according to Professor Robyn Norton, a public health expert. The results are then applied to women, intersex, trans and gender-diverse people, causing issues when it comes to their treatment, diagnosis and how their symptoms are understood, Prof Norton says. She describes it as a \u201cone-size-fits-all, male-centric\u201d approach to healthcare that has created huge knowledge gaps. One analysis carried out in 2019 by the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research - which used data from the entire Danish population - found that, across 770 diseases they studied, women were diagnosed later than men, with an average lag time of four years. In Australia, research from the University of Sydney in 2018 found that females admitted to hospital for serious heart attack were half as likely as men to get proper treatment and that they died at twice the rate six months after discharge. Scientists have warned that another roadblock is the chronic underinvestment in women-specific health issues. Endometriosis is pointed to as a key example. Despite impacting roughly 10% of reproductive-age women and girls globally, there is no cure, and it takes seven years on average for patients to be diagnosed. One recent study found that 89% of Australian women were still being advised by health professionals that pregnancy would fix their symptoms - despite growing evidence it's a medical fallacy. Such disparities are being recognised and investigated globally, experts say - with countries comparing notes on what might be the best approach. The UK, for one, recently announced measures aimed at closing the \u201cgender health gap\u201d in its system. And in the US, the federal government has launched an initiative to improve funding and research into women\u2019s health, led by First Lady Jill Biden.\n\nBonney Corbin/Australian Women's Health Alliance Bonney Corbin has spent her career trying to make Australian healthcare more equitable"], "US pays Moderna $176m to develop bird-flu vaccine": ["US pays Moderna $176m to develop bird-flu jab\n\n4 days ago By Michelle Roberts , Digital health editor, BBC News Share\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe US government has given Moderna $176m (\u00a3139m) to develop a messenger-ribonucleic-acid-based (mRNA) pandemic influenza vaccine that would work against bird flu. It says it wants to be \"better prepared\" for public-health crises, having learned lessons from Covid. Bird flu is not a big threat to people, despite outbreaks in poultry and cattle. But experts want a working vaccine that could be quickly rolled out, in case the virus mutates and becomes a problem.\n\nVaccines using mRNA technology - which the Moderna's Covid jab is also based on - can be produced more quickly. And the US government says adding this technology to its pandemic-flu toolkit enhances its ability to be \"nimble and quick\" against bird flu.

In early June, they died together after being given lethal medication by two doctors. In the Netherlands, this is known as duo-euthanasia. It\u2019s legal, and it\u2019s rare - but every year, more Dutch couples choose to end their lives this way.\n\nSome people might find this article upsetting.\n\nThree days before they voluntarily take their last breath, Jan and Els\u2019 campervan sits on a sunlit marina in Friesland, in the Netherlands\u2019 north. They\u2019re a couple who love being mobile, and have lived most of their marriage in a motorhome, or on boats. \u201cWe tried sometimes [to live] in a pile of stones - a house,\u201d jokes Jan, when I visit them, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d He\u2019s 70, and sits in the swivel driving-seat of the van, one leg bent underneath him in the only position that eases his continuous back pain. His wife, Els, is 71 and has dementia. Now, she struggles to formulate her sentences. \u201cThis is very good,\u201d she says, standing up easily and pointing to her body. \u201cBut this is terrible,\u201d she says, pointing to her head. Jan and Els met in kindergarten - theirs was a lifelong partnership. When he was young, Jan played hockey for the Netherlands\u2019 national youth team, and then became a sports coach. Els trained as a primary school teacher. But it was their shared love of water, boats, and sailing that defined their years together. As a young couple they lived on a houseboat. They later bought a cargo boat and built a business transporting goods around the Netherlands\u2019 inland waterways. Meanwhile, Els gave birth to their only son (who asked not to be named). He became a weekly boarder at school and spent weekends with his parents. During school holidays when their child was onboard too, Jan and Els looked for work trips that would take them to interesting places \u2013 along the river Rhine, or to the Netherlands\u2019 islands. By 1999, the inland cargo business had become very competitive. Jan was experiencing serious back pain from the heavy-duty work he had been doing for more than a decade. He and Els moved on land, but after a few years they were again living on a boat. When that became too much to manage, they bought their spacious campervan. Jan had surgery on his back in 2003, but it didn\u2019t improve. He had halted a heavy regime of pain killers and could no longer work, but Els was still busy teaching. Sometimes they talked about euthanasia - Jan explained to his family he didn\u2019t want to live too long with his physical limitations. It was around this time the couple joined NVVE \u2013 the Netherlands\u2019 \u201cright to die\u201d organisation. \u201cIf you take a lot of medicine, you live like a zombie,\u201d Jan told me. \u201cSo, with the pain I have, and Els\u2019 illness, I think we have to stop this.\u201d When Jan says \u201cstop this\u201d, he means - stop living.\n\nJan pictured with his son in 1982\n\nIn 2018, Els retired from teaching. She was showing early signs of dementia but resisted seeing a doctor \u2013 perhaps because she had witnessed the decline and death of her father with Alzheimer\u2019s. But there came a point when her symptoms couldn\u2019t be ignored. In November 2022, after being diagnosed with dementia, Els stormed out of the doctor\u2019s consulting room, leaving her husband and son behind. \u201cShe was furious \u2013 like a steaming bull,\u201d remembers Jan. It was after Els learned her condition wouldn\u2019t improve that she and Jan, with their son, began to discuss duo-euthanasia \u2013 the two of them dying together. In the Netherlands, euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal if someone makes a voluntary request, and their suffering \u2013 physical or psychological \u2013 is assessed by doctors as \u201cunbearable\u201d, with no prospect of improvement. Every person who requests assisted dying is assessed by two doctors \u2013 the second checking the evaluation made by the first.\n\nWhere to get help\n\nIn 2023, 9,068 people died by euthanasia in the Netherlands \u2013 around 5% of the total number of deaths. There were 33 instances of duo-euthanasia, so 66 people. These are complex cases made even more so if one of the partners has dementia, where there can be uncertainty about their capacity to give consent. \u201cA lot of doctors don\u2019t even want to think about performing euthanasia on a patient with dementia,\u201d says Dr Rosemarijn van Bruchem, a geriatrician and ethicist at the Erasmus Medical Centre, in Rotterdam. This was the position of Jan and Els\u2019 GP. And that reluctance among doctors is reflected in the euthanasia figures. Of the thousands who died in 2023, 336 had dementia. So how do medics assess the legal requirement for \u201cunbearable suffering\u201d in patients with dementia? For many with early stage dementia, it's uncertainty about how things might progress that can lead them to think about ending their life, explains Dr van Bruchem. \u201cAm I going to not be able to do the things I find important? Am I going to not recognise my family anymore? If you can express that well enough, if it is perceivable for both the doctor that is willing to perform euthanasia, as well as the [second] doctor that is specialised in mental competency, the existential fear of what is to come can be the reason to consider euthanasia.\u201d\n\nEls, photographed in 1968, was diagnosed with dementia later in life\n\nWith their GP unwilling to engage, Jan and Els approached a mobile euthanasia clinic - the Centre of Expertise on Euthanasia. It supervised around 15% of assisted deaths last year in the Netherlands, and, on average, grants about a third of the requests it receives. In the case of a couple wishing to end their lives together, medics must be certain one partner isn\u2019t influencing the other. Dr Bert Keizer has attended two duo euthanasia cases. But he also recalls meeting another couple, when he suspected the man was coercing his wife. On a further visit, Dr Keizer talked to the woman alone. \u201cShe said she had so many plans\u2026!\u201d Dr Keizer says, explaining that the woman clearly realised her husband was gravely ill, but had no plans to die with him. The euthanasia process was halted and the man died from natural causes. His wife is still alive.\n\nDr Theo Boer, professor of healthcare ethics at the Protestant Theological University, is one of the Netherlands\u2019 few outspoken critics of euthanasia, and believes progress in palliative care often mitigates the need for its use. \u201cI would say that killing by a doctor could be justified. However, that needs to be an exception.\u201d What worries Dr Boer is the impact of duo-euthanasia cases \u2013 especially after one of the Netherlands\u2019 former prime ministers and his wife chose to die together earlier this year, and made global headlines. \u201cIn the past year we\u2019ve seen dozens of cases of duo-euthanasia, and there\u2019s a general tendency to \u2018hero-ify\u2019 dying together,\u201d says Dr Boer. \u201cBut the taboo on intentional killing - that\u2019s eroding, and especially when it comes to duo-euthanasia.\"\n\nJan and Els could probably go on living indefinitely in their campervan. Do they feel they might be dying too soon? \u201cNo, no, no \u2013 I cannot see it,\u201d says Els. \"I\u2019ve lived my life, I don\u2019t want pain anymore,\u201d says her husband. \u201cThe life we\u2019ve lived, we\u2019re getting old [for it]. We think it has to be stopped.\u201d And there\u2019s something else.

In early June, they died together after being given lethal medication by two doctors. In the Netherlands, this is known as duo-euthanasia. It\u2019s legal, and it\u2019s rare - but every year, more Dutch couples choose to end their lives this way.\n\nSome people might find this article upsetting.\n\nThree days before they voluntarily take their last breath, Jan and Els\u2019 campervan sits on a sunlit marina in Friesland, in the Netherlands\u2019 north. They\u2019re a couple who love being mobile, and have lived most of their marriage in a motorhome, or on boats. \u201cWe tried sometimes [to live] in a pile of stones - a house,\u201d jokes Jan, when I visit them, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d He\u2019s 70, and sits in the swivel driving-seat of the van, one leg bent underneath him in the only position that eases his continuous back pain. His wife, Els, is 71 and has dementia. Now, she struggles to formulate her sentences. \u201cThis is very good,\u201d she says, standing up easily and pointing to her body. \u201cBut this is terrible,\u201d she says, pointing to her head. Jan and Els met in kindergarten - theirs was a lifelong partnership. When he was young, Jan played hockey for the Netherlands\u2019 national youth team, and then became a sports coach. Els trained as a primary school teacher. But it was their shared love of water, boats, and sailing that defined their years together. As a young couple they lived on a houseboat. They later bought a cargo boat and built a business transporting goods around the Netherlands\u2019 inland waterways. Meanwhile, Els gave birth to their only son (who asked not to be named). He became a weekly boarder at school and spent weekends with his parents. During school holidays when their child was onboard too, Jan and Els looked for work trips that would take them to interesting places \u2013 along the river Rhine, or to the Netherlands\u2019 islands. By 1999, the inland cargo business had become very competitive. Jan was experiencing serious back pain from the heavy-duty work he had been doing for more than a decade. He and Els moved on land, but after a few years they were again living on a boat. When that became too much to manage, they bought their spacious campervan. Jan had surgery on his back in 2003, but it didn\u2019t improve. He had halted a heavy regime of pain killers and could no longer work, but Els was still busy teaching. Sometimes they talked about euthanasia - Jan explained to his family he didn\u2019t want to live too long with his physical limitations. It was around this time the couple joined NVVE \u2013 the Netherlands\u2019 \u201cright to die\u201d organisation. \u201cIf you take a lot of medicine, you live like a zombie,\u201d Jan told me. \u201cSo, with the pain I have, and Els\u2019 illness, I think we have to stop this.\u201d When Jan says \u201cstop this\u201d, he means - stop living.\n\nJan pictured with his son in 1982\n\nIn 2018, Els retired from teaching. She was showing early signs of dementia but resisted seeing a doctor \u2013 perhaps because she had witnessed the decline and death of her father with Alzheimer\u2019s. But there came a point when her symptoms couldn\u2019t be ignored. In November 2022, after being diagnosed with dementia, Els stormed out of the doctor\u2019s consulting room, leaving her husband and son behind. \u201cShe was furious \u2013 like a steaming bull,\u201d remembers Jan. It was after Els learned her condition wouldn\u2019t improve that she and Jan, with their son, began to discuss duo-euthanasia \u2013 the two of them dying together. In the Netherlands, euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal if someone makes a voluntary request, and their suffering \u2013 physical or psychological \u2013 is assessed by doctors as \u201cunbearable\u201d, with no prospect of improvement. Every person who requests assisted dying is assessed by two doctors \u2013 the second checking the evaluation made by the first.\n\nWhere to get help\n\nIn 2023, 9,068 people died by euthanasia in the Netherlands \u2013 around 5% of the total number of deaths. There were 33 instances of duo-euthanasia, so 66 people. These are complex cases made even more so if one of the partners has dementia, where there can be uncertainty about their capacity to give consent. \u201cA lot of doctors don\u2019t even want to think about performing euthanasia on a patient with dementia,\u201d says Dr Rosemarijn van Bruchem, a geriatrician and ethicist at the Erasmus Medical Centre, in Rotterdam. This was the position of Jan and Els\u2019 GP. And that reluctance among doctors is reflected in the euthanasia figures. Of the thousands who died in 2023, 336 had dementia. So how do medics assess the legal requirement for \u201cunbearable suffering\u201d in patients with dementia? For many with early stage dementia, it's uncertainty about how things might progress that can lead them to think about ending their life, explains Dr van Bruchem. \u201cAm I going to not be able to do the things I find important? Am I going to not recognise my family anymore? If you can express that well enough, if it is perceivable for both the doctor that is willing to perform euthanasia, as well as the [second] doctor that is specialised in mental competency, the existential fear of what is to come can be the reason to consider euthanasia.\u201d\n\nEls, photographed in 1968, was diagnosed with dementia later in life\n\nWith their GP unwilling to engage, Jan and Els approached a mobile euthanasia clinic - the Centre of Expertise on Euthanasia. It supervised around 15% of assisted deaths last year in the Netherlands, and, on average, grants about a third of the requests it receives. In the case of a couple wishing to end their lives together, medics must be certain one partner isn\u2019t influencing the other. Dr Bert Keizer has attended two duo euthanasia cases. But he also recalls meeting another couple, when he suspected the man was coercing his wife. On a further visit, Dr Keizer talked to the woman alone. \u201cShe said she had so many plans\u2026!\u201d Dr Keizer says, explaining that the woman clearly realised her husband was gravely ill, but had no plans to die with him. The euthanasia process was halted and the man died from natural causes. His wife is still alive.\n\nDr Theo Boer, professor of healthcare ethics at the Protestant Theological University, is one of the Netherlands\u2019 few outspoken critics of euthanasia, and believes progress in palliative care often mitigates the need for its use. \u201cI would say that killing by a doctor could be justified. However, that needs to be an exception.\u201d What worries Dr Boer is the impact of duo-euthanasia cases \u2013 especially after one of the Netherlands\u2019 former prime ministers and his wife chose to die together earlier this year, and made global headlines. \u201cIn the past year we\u2019ve seen dozens of cases of duo-euthanasia, and there\u2019s a general tendency to \u2018hero-ify\u2019 dying together,\u201d says Dr Boer. \u201cBut the taboo on intentional killing - that\u2019s eroding, and especially when it comes to duo-euthanasia.\"\n\nJan and Els could probably go on living indefinitely in their campervan. Do they feel they might be dying too soon? \u201cNo, no, no \u2013 I cannot see it,\u201d says Els. \"I\u2019ve lived my life, I don\u2019t want pain anymore,\u201d says her husband. \u201cThe life we\u2019ve lived, we\u2019re getting old [for it]. We think it has to be stopped.\u201d And there\u2019s something else. Els has been assessed by doctors who say she still has the capacity to decide for herself that she wants to die - but this could change if her dementia becomes more advanced. None of this has been easy for Jan and Els\u2019 son. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to let your parents die,\" explains Jan. \"So there have been tears - our son said, \u2018Better times will come, better weather\u2019 - but not for me.\u201d Els feels the same. \u201cThere is no other solution.\u201d\n\nEls and Jan on their wedding day, 1975\n\nThe day before their appointment with the euthanasia doctors, Els, Jan, their son and grandchildren were together.

Elliott Collins was one of the first to get the treatment when he took part in the trials that proved it worked. He says he \"feels cured\" and the gene therapy has given him a \"new lease of life\". The treatment is one of the world's most expensive, with an official cost of \u00a32.6m.\n\nWhen you cut yourself, the body senses the injury and activates a series of clotting proteins in the bloodstream. This makes the blood sticky at the site of the wound and then seals it with a clot. But from the day he was born, Elliott was unable to make enough clotting factor IX (nine). Without this crucial clotting component, bleeds are bigger and longer. Bleeds also happen spontaneously inside joints - such as the knee or elbow - causing long-term damage. Elliott, who is 34 and from Colchester, rebelled against his diagnosis as a child by sneakily playing rugby or skateboarding. But any injury risked a damaging bleed, like when he was tackled playing football. \"I got studs right across the shin and that came up like a cartoon, like Tom and Jerry,\" he said. Elliott needed injections of factor IX twice a week - and more if he was injured - for 29 years. \"I would have to think about it all the time,\" he said.\n\nElliott Collins Elliott Collins is one of a handful of people to have been treated with the gene therapy during the clinical trials\n\nBut he took part in trials of the gene therapy when it was still just an experimental idea in 2019. Since then, he has not needed any factor IX injections and says it has transformed his life. He told me: \"I don't think you can go through something like that for 29 years, for it to completely disappear and not change someone mentally and physically. \"I feel cured.\" He knew it was working when he clattered his knee into a cupboard. He whacked it hard enough to balloon up and need a factor IX injection, but instead he watched as only a small mark appeared. \"That solidified [the realisation] this is real, this is working and I can relax a bit.\" Tests showed that levels of factor IX in Elliott's blood had gone from nothing to 60% of normal.\n\nHow it works\n\nGetty Images The gene therapy uses a virus to \"infect\" Elliott's liver with DNA containing the ability to make factor IX\n\nElliot was born with a mutation in his DNA - his genetic code - that meant his body's instructions for making factor IX were faulty. So doctors gave him engineered viruses that contained copies of the fully functional factor IX instructions. The viruses act like a fleet of microscopic postmen, delivering those blueprints to the liver. The organ is then able to manufacture the clotting protein. It was a one-off infusion, lasting about an hour, that Elliott is benefiting from five years later. Not everybody will have as good a response as Elliott. In trials on 54 men, two still needed to take factor IX injections. And nobody knows how long it will last - some trials have suggested more than a decade. \"I'm very aware of the fact that this is new, I'm almost preparing myself for it to potentially wear off to avoid any kind of major disappointment,\" Elliott says.\n\nHow can the NHS afford it?\n\nUncertainty over how long patients benefit makes it hard to know whether the gene therapy is worth the money. Normal clotting factor injections cost between \u00a3150,000 and \u00a3200,000 per patient per year for life. But the gene therapy - branded Hemgenix - has an official list price of \u00a32.6m. Elliott says it's \"wild to think that\u2019s how much it costs\" and now he had multi-million pound blood he should \"probably get life insurance\". The treatment is being made available through a deal between the company CSL Behring, NHS England and the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence, the body that rules on cost-effectiveness. I have pressed all the parties involved for details of the deal, but it is bound up in confidentiality agreements. As I understand it, the NHS will track how much patients benefit for more than a decade and that will dictate how much CSL Behring are paid. If factor IX levels dip earlier than expected, then the NHS will pay less. It is essentially performance-related pay for drugs and it is the first such deal the NHS has agreed. The therapy will be available immediately at eight centres - Oxford, Manchester, Leeds, Bristol, Birmingham, Cambridge and two in London. Around 2,000 people in the UK have haemophilia B and the NHS anticipates treating 250 of them. Not everyone will be suitable for the gene therapy as some are too young or have other health conditions that rule them out. Prof Sir Stephen Powis, the NHS national medical director, said the \"transformative\" gene therapy could be \"truly life-changing\" and had been secured \"at an affordable price\".\n\n'Real milestone'\n\nHaemophilia runs in families. Elliott's younger brother was six days old when he died of a brain bleed. His great-uncle died from the condition at the age of 14. Those with haemophilia, mostly but not exclusively men, pass the affected genes onto their daughters who become carriers. This therapy will not change that genetic inheritance so it is not considered a true \"cure\". But Kate Burt, chief executive of the Haemophilia Society, said it was a \"real milestone\". \"It is life-transforming at its most effective, it can last for decades and put the bleeding disorder into complete remission.\" Similar gene therapies are being developed for haemophilia A, which is more common and affects nearly 9,000 people in the UK.

The virus, which can cause lesions across the whole body, is making some people very ill and can be deadly. The current outbreak has been driven by sexual transmission but there is evidence this strain can also be passed on through close skin-to-skin contact. Global health experts say the new variant risks cross-border and international spread of the virus, with one calling it the \"most dangerous strain yet\". A worldwide epidemic of mpox in 2022 was brought under control by vaccinating vulnerable groups. But there is poor access to vaccines and treatments in DR Congo and local health officials are warning the virus could reach other countries. \"The disease can go through airports. A person with lesions can go through borders because there are no controls,\" said Leandre Murhula Masirika, at the health department in South Kivu province - one of the worst affected areas in DR Congo. \"I'm very afraid it's going to cause more damage.\"\n\n'Risk of spread'\n\nCases of mpox, formerly called monkeypox, have been on the rise in the African country for decades. Official figures from the World Health Organization (WHO) show there have been nearly 8,000 cases this year in DR Congo, including 384 deaths - almost half of these among children under 15. An outbreak in South Kivu province, near the border with Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda, is causing particular concern. Lab testing of virus samples from the area recently found the new mpox strain, which contains mutations that appear to help it circulate among humans. In the mining town of Kamituga, where the strain is thought to have originated among sex workers in September 2023, cases are rising. Those now being infected include schoolchildren, healthcare workers treating mpox patients and entire households. The new strain has been detected in several cities along the border, including Goma, which borders Rwanda. The WHO said it represented \"a renewed risk of cross-border and international spread which may potentially lead to an increased risk of severe illness\".\n\nReuters A six-year-old girl with mpox in an outbreak in DR Congo in 2022\n\nScientists briefing journalists about the current outbreak said they feared the new strain was being spread more easily, causing more serious disease and more deaths in children and adults. There is also concern over the risk of asymptomatic spread between people who do not have symptoms and are unaware they have the virus. The current case figures are \"the tip of the iceberg\", said Prof Trudie Lang, professor of global health research at the University of Oxford. \"It's definitely the most dangerous strain yet. \"We don\u2019t know how many non-severe cases are hidden.\" It is also not clear how fast the new strain spreads or whether current vaccines will protect against it. Trials will be needed to work this out, which will take time. The global outbreak of mpox that spread across Europe and America in 2022 was sexually transmitted and driven by men who have sex with men. It was caused by the Clade II mpox virus. The new strain is from the more deadly Clade I but is distinct from other outbreaks which have previously affected the region. It can also be spread through non-sexual contact, which makes it more dangerous. Many children have been infected, including newborn babies during pregnancy. There have been reports of a small number of infected pregnant women miscarrying their babies. And some patients have been left with long-term complications with their eyes, skin and genitals. One healthcare worker looking after an infected patient is reported to have lost her sight after becoming infected herself. In cases in DR Congo to date, the new strain has a mortality rate of 4% in adults and 10% in children.\n\nPoor access to vaccines"], "Faces made of living skin make robots smile": ["Faces made of living skin make robots smile\n\n25 June 2024 By Michelle Roberts , Digital health editor, BBC News Share\n\n\u00a92024 Takeuchi et al.

The breakthrough came from copying tissue structures in people, according to the team at Tokyo University. The prototype may appear more Haribo than human-like.

Mpox, which used to be called monkeypox, is endemic in parts of west and central Africa and cases have been on the rise on the continent for decades. In 2022, a worldwide epidemic of mpox affected Europe, Australia, the US and many other countries.\n\nHow common is mpox?\n\nMpox disease is caused by the monkeypox virus, a member of the same family of viruses as smallpox, although it is much less severe. The virus was originally transmitted from animals to humans, and is more common in countries close to tropical rainforests. In these regions, there are thousands of cases and hundreds of deaths from the disease every year - with children under the age of 15 worst affected. There are two main strains of the virus known to exist. The milder one caused a global outbreak in 2022 which spread to nearly 100 countries that do not usually see the virus. The second, more deadly strain is endemic in central Africa - it is behind the new recently discovered strain in DR Congo. The two types carry different risks of disease and mortality.\n\nWhat are the symptoms?\n\nGetty Images Mpox, or monkeypox, is spread through close contact with infected people\n\nInitial symptoms include fever, headaches, swellings, back pain and aching muscles. Once the fever breaks, a rash can develop, often beginning on the face then spreading to other parts of the body, most commonly the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The rash, which can be extremely itchy or painful, changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. The lesions can cause scarring. The infection usually clears up on its own and lasts between 14 and 21 days. Serious cases can see lesions attack the whole of the body, and especially the mouth, eyes and genitals.\n\nHow is it spread?\n\nMpox spreads from person to person through close contact with someone who is infected - including through sex, skin-to-skin contact and talking or breathing close to another person. The virus can enter the body through broken skin, the respiratory tract or through the eyes, nose or mouth. It can also be spread through touching objects which have been contaminated by the virus, such as bedding, clothing and towels. Close contact with infected animals, such as monkeys, rats and squirrels, is another route. During the global outbreak in 2022, the virus spread mostly through sexual contact. The current DR Congo outbreak is being driven by sexual contact, but has also been found in other communities.\n\nWho is most at risk?\n\nGetty Images There are vaccines which protect against severe mpox\n\nMost cases are often found in people who are sexually active and men who have sex with men. People with several partners or new sexual partners can be most at risk. But anyone who has close contact with someone with symptoms can catch the virus, including health workers and family members. Advice is to avoid close contact with anyone with mpox and clean your hands with soap and water if the virus is in your community. Those who have mpox should isolate from others until all their lesions have disappeared. Condoms should be used as a precaution when having sex for 12 weeks after recovery, the World Health Organization (WHO) says.\n\nHow can it be treated?"], "India heat: Inside Delhi's first emergency room to tackle crisis": ["Inside India's first heat stroke emergency room\n\n19 June 2024 By Soutik Biswas , @soutikBBC, India correspondent Share\n\nEPA A construction worker drinks water during the heatwave in Delhi\n\nIn one of the largest hospitals in India\u2019s capital, Delhi, a physician says he has never seen anything like this before. \u201cThis is an unprecedented heatwave.

And people are dying from the heat, with media reports suggesting at least 20 fatalities due to heat-related illnesses. A heat stroke, the most severe heat illness, is identified by three key signs: exposure to high heat and humidity, a core body temperature of 40.5C (105F) or higher, and mental changes like mild confusion or impaired consciousness. Heat stroke is also a silent killer, and victims can begin to fall ill hours after exposure to sun. India's National Centre for Disease Control calls heat strokes a \"life-threatening\" condition with a mortality rate of 40-64%. Since Dr Chauhan's hospital in Delhi opened a heat stroke clinic in late May, seven people have died of heat stroke and more than 40 have been treated for heat-related ailments.\n\nAFP Ajay Chauhan, head of the Delhi heat stroke clinic, says he has never seen so many patients\n\nThe majority were men working outdoors and in small, unregulated factories with poor conditions, enduring extreme heat exposure. To be sure, the heatwave is not restricted to Delhi: dozens have died from heat-related illnesses since March, with more than 50 deaths in just three days in early June in the states of Uttar Pradesh and Odisha. At the RMLH clinic, possibly the first of its kind in India, the effort to save heat stroke patients underscores the challenge posed by rapid climate and health emergencies. A few days ago, a man was wheeled in with body temperatures soaring to 42C (107.7F). A body\u2019s normal core temperature is 37-38C. He was suffering from a heat stroke. At this temperature, a human body begins to shut down, cells deteriorate, and there\u2019s a risk of organ failure. Sweating ceases as blood flow to the skin stops, leaving it cold and clammy. At the clinic, doctors dunked the patient into the icy waters of a 250-litre ceramic tub where the temperature ranges from 0 to 5C. (The clinic is equipped with two ceramic tubs, a 200kg ice-making machine, rectal thermometers, ice boxes and inflatable tubs.) The patient took about 25 minutes to cool down and begin recovering before he was moved to the ward for further treatment.\n\nReuters A patient suffering from heat exhaustion being wheeled into a hospital in Ahmedabad\n\n\u201cEarly cooling saves lives. Every second counts,\u201d says Dr Chauhan. A delay can either prove to be fatal or leave the patient bleeding, or with damaged kidneys and liver. It is not difficult to fall ill in Delhi. Life is tough. A third of residents live in substandard and congested housing. The city\u2019s 6,400-odd slums, home to more than a million households, lack adequate cooling and face seasonal livelihood crises. Men fall ill working outdoors; women fall sick after spending extended periods in kitchen settings with traditional stoves. Green spaces are scarce. In the peak of summer, the city turns into a scorching furnace, trapped between the blazing heat from above and the searing ground below. Anjana Kumari, the wife of a daily wage worker admitted at RHML with heat stroke, told The Indian Express that their slum hutment's only fan wasn\u2019t working due to a power cut. Her husband, exhausted from working all day on Monday, couldn't sleep and later suffered seizures, vomiting, and diarrhoea. She rushed him to the hospital at night. \u201cDoctors have told me he won't be able to walk for some time and need a lot of care,\u201d Ms Kumari said. Those who work outdoors suffer the most. A large majority of respondents in a new Greenpeace survey on how heat impacts street vendors in Delhi reported health issues due to hot weather. Irritability was the most common (73.44%), followed by headaches, dehydration, sunburn, fatigue and muscle cramps. Most faced challenges accessing medical care due to lack of money.\n\nAFP At the Delhi heat stroke clinic, patients are dunked into ceramic tubs of icy water\n\n\u201cThe heat increases every day. We are living under the open sky. What resources can I gather? If possible, there should be some trees and plants nearby, so that fresh air keeps blowing and the body gets some relief,\u201d Guddi, a sugarcane juice vendor who operates a manual crusher, told Greenpeace. \u201cAfter being exposed to the heat of the sun all day, I don\u2019t feel like eating dinner at night. All I can think about is stretching my legs and going to sleep,\u201d she said. And all over India, people are falling sick due to the heat. A new nationwide survey by Centre for Rapid Insights (CRI) offers some startling insights into how heatwaves hurt people and cripple productivity. It showed that 45% of the households contacted reported at least one member getting sick from the heat last month. Among those affected, over 67% had household members sick for more than five days. This impact was particularly severe among the poorest. Specifically 32.5% of households with motorcycles and 28.2% with no vehicles had members ill for over five days; the figure was lower at 21.8% for households with cars.\n\nGetty Images There are more than 200,000 homeless people in Delhi, many of whom live in congested shelters in the sweltering heat"], "Alopecia and me: \u2018I embrace it, but I\u2019d love my old hair back\u2019": ["Alopecia and me: \u2018I embrace it, but I\u2019d love my old hair back\u2019\n\nPeople living with one of the most common types of alopecia could soon have access to treatment on the NHS in Scotland for the first time.\n\nThe drug - called Ritlecitinib - will go before the Scottish Medicines Consortium this week after it was approved for NHS use in England last month.\n\nAlthough the daily pill won\u2019t cure the condition, it could provide treatment to some who have severe alopecia areata, like 21-year-old Megan McCready, from Clydebank.\n\nSince her diagnosis at the age of 12, Megan has learned to embrace her condition and now supports other young people going through the same thing.\n\nVideo by Morgan Spence and Hazel Martin\n\n3 March 2024"], "Waddington man completes whacky 17-marathon charity challenge": ["Man completes whacky 17-marathon charity challenge\n\n3 hours ago By David McKenna , BBC News Share\n\nSupplied The 38-year-old took on the challenge under the pseudonym Neville to remain anonymous\n\nA man has completed a challenge to run the equivalent of about 17 marathons over 30 days on the same half-mile (0.8 km) \"mundane\" stretch of road in Waddington, Lincolnshire. The 38-year-old, who ran under the pseudonym Neville because he wanted to remain anonymous, raised more than \u00a38,500 for cancer research. Neville was also joined by co-runners each day, all of whom had been affected by cancer in some way. Describing the challenge as a \"bit spicy\", Neville said it was \"nothing compared to what people go through with cancer\".\n\nThe challenge involved running the same number of miles each day commensurate with the calendar date. He ran one mile on 1 June, two miles on 2 June, increasing to 30 miles on 30 June.\n\nSupplied The runner said the challenge had been hard, but nothing compared to what people with cancer go through\n\nNeville, who also ran the final mile of each day while carrying the Cancer Research UK flag, wearing springy eye glasses, and shouting \"just one more mile\", was joined by host of co-runners. These included a man who is undergoing treatment for throat cancer and is fed though a tube, a cancer nurse who travelled three hours to take part and people running in memory of a loved one. \"Nearly all of them pushed themselves several miles beyond any distance they had previously run, all because they believed in the work that Cancer Research UK do,\" he said. \"Each had their own motivation for getting involved; stories of beating the odds, stories of loss, stories of ongoing battles,\" he added.\n\n'Pretty tired'\n\nNeville said he was the antipode of the type of person who you might expect to take on such a challenge, adding that the final week had been especially hard due to the heat and the distance. \"But in the grand scheme of things, this was about raising money for cancer research, so tiredness and blisters are nothing compared to what people go through with cancer,\" he said. To date, including gift aid, the charity effort has raised more than \u00a38,500. The runner said donations were still coming in and he hoped \"it might just creep over the \u00a310,000 line\". People could also read the personal stories of those who took part on Neville's Instagram page, he said. He added that the character of Neville would now \"quietly slip away\" after being heard quoting Forrest Gump. \"I'm pretty tired.

The findings - carried out by a multi-disciplinary team commissioned by the Chief Medical Officer for Scotland - also found that each care plan should include \"a full assessment of the child\u2019s needs, both psychological and physical.\" Professor Graham Ellis, Scotland's Deputy Chief Medical Officer said the team had examined the Cass report from a \"clinical perspective\" while remembering that all children should grow up \"safe, respected and supported.\" He added: \u201cAt the heart of this question are children and young people in distress, and our ambition must remain focused on meeting their needs with holistic, person-centred care as close to home as practical. \u201cThe Cass Review identified the need to ensure that gender identity services for young people are more closely aligned with other areas of clinical practice, and that responsibility for the full range of services required should extend beyond specialist services.\"\n\nQuestioning identity"], "Covid hospital admissions in Scotland exceed last winter": ["Covid hospital admissions in Scotland exceed last winter\n\n22 hours ago Share\n\nGetty Images Figures for Covid-19 levels are based on tests taken on people within the healthcare system\n\nThe number of Covid cases requiring hospital treatment in Scotland has surpassed last winter's levels.

Sarah Frith, from Sheffield, was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) aged 48 in 2022 and was told she also had MND the following year. According to the MND Association, up to 15% of people originally diagnosed with FTD go on to develop MND. Mr Heslop said the stress of caring for someone that suffers from both conditions has put a \u201chuge strain on the family\u201d.\n\nMr Heslop said the couple, who have been together for 23 years and have two children, both lost their jobs in 2019 and initially thought his partner's behavioural changes were due to stress. However, when Ms Frith started a new job working from home towards the end of 2020 he saw she was struggling with tasks she would usually have managed. Following a GP visit in 2021, Ms Frith was diagnosed with stress and anxiety and signed off work, but a follow-up scan revealed deterioration in the front of her brain. After further scans and tests the following year, Ms Frith was formally diagnosed with FTD.\n\nFamily handout Mr Heslop says his partner had now lost about 75% of her speech\n\nMs Frith's talking started to change in 2023, he said, and she eventually lost about 75% of her speech. She also developed issues with eating and started to struggle swallowing her food. Tests in December 2023 revealed she had MND, with the further diagnosis adding \u201cextra complexities\u201d to her care, Mr Heslop said. While some patients are affected in their legs and require a wheelchair, Ms Frith has issues with her arms and throat. \u201cShe can\u2019t grip a glass any more,\" said Mr Heslop. \"She has to have special food so she doesn\u2019t choke.\u201d Listen: Sheffield mother diagnosed with dementia and MND\n\nThe treatment for MND and dementia patients \"doesn't always fit together\", Mr Heslop said.

The problem was identified at both the Luton and Dunstable (L&D) and Bedford hospitals during an inspection. Some ethnic minority overseas staff told the CQC discrimination had become \"normalised\". The Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said it was addressing these issues.\n\nThe regulator was alerted to concerns around the safety, culture, and management of the service by whistleblowers. On the first day of the inspection, last November, the Luton and Dunstable Hospital's maternity unit was at full capacity and the trust had to divert new arrivals. Low staffing levels also meant women and babies were not always kept safe. The trust was issued with a warning to improve and maternity services at both hospitals have now both been rated as 'inadequate'.\n\nAt the L&D some staff told the inspectors they did not feel able to report instances of racism. Management acknowledged some parts of the unit had a \"challenging culture\". There were concerns racist incidents being reported to the trust would not be investigated in line with the trust\u2019s values. At Bedford similar issues were reported.\n\nPA Images Some staff at the trust felt they could not speak out about the racism they had experienced\n\n'Undermined by racism'\n\nAccording to trust data, there were also disparities in pay among staff of different ethnicities. At the L&D, white staff were almost twice as likely to be appointed to jobs after being shortlisted. The hospital's board was also among the worst in the country for ethnic minority representation.\n\nStuart Dunn, CQC deputy director of operations in the East of England, said: \u201cWe were concerned to find low staffing for midwives was still a significant risk to the safety of women using these services and their babies despite us telling the trust they needed to address this previously.\" He said the trust had recruited midwives from abroad to help tackle this but this was \"being undermined by racism against staff, by their own colleagues, and a lack of support from leaders\". He continued: \u201cSome international midwives told us they often felt excluded, and that it was normalised for colleagues from ethnic minorities to experience discrimination from colleagues\". In the trust\u2019s 2022 staff survey, a third of all midwives reported experiencing at least one incident of bullying or harassment from colleagues, Mr Dunn said.\n\nVacancy rate\n\nIn response, the chief executive of Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, David Carter, said: \"As a trust committed to delivering excellent care, the CQC feedback was disappointing for us to hear but we are focussing our effort on ensuring that our maternity services consistently meets the standards of care we aspire to give. \u201cWe were disappointed to hear that our international midwives reported issues of discrimination. Any act of discrimination or racism is unacceptable and the trust is committed to ensuring any issues are addressed\". Mr Carter added that the vacancy rate for registered midwives had been reduced to 6.6% on the L&D site, while Bedford was now fully staffed.\n\nWhile maternity services are now rated \u2018inadequate\u2019 the overall rating of the Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust remained \u2018good\u2019.

In the Republic of Ireland 68 cases were logged within the same time frame. Measles is highly infectious and is caused by a virus that can easily spread between unvaccinated people. In February, Northern Ireland reported its first case of the disease since 2017. It led to the the Public Health Agency (PHA) launching a mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) vaccine catch-up campaign in an effort to prevent the spread of the disease. The PHA said there had been a decline in vaccine uptake in recent years with Northern Ireland falling behind the recommended 95% vaccination rate. That is the level that has been recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The number of people reporting cases of the disease increased in February, according to figures released by the PHA. Of the 68 confirmed cases in the Republic of Ireland, 18 were in children under 5-years-old. An additional 17 cases are currently under investigation for measles. There have been 10 measles outbreaks in the Republic of Ireland in 2024, according to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC).\n\nWhat are the symptoms of measles?\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious disease which is spread by coughs and sneezes. Common symptoms include: high fever\n\nsore, red and watery eyes\n\ncoughing\n\nsneezing Small white spots may appear inside the mouth. A blotchy red or brown rash usually appears after a few days, typically on the face and behind the ears, before spreading to the rest of the body. It can be harder to see on brown and black skin. Measles normally clears up within seven to 10 days. However, it can lead to pneumonia, meningitis, blindness and seizures. In rare cases it can lead to death. A list of symptoms and advice on what to do if you think you have measles is available on the NHS website.\n\nGetty Images Measles is highly infectious and can spread easily between unvaccinated people\n\nWhat is the MMR vaccination?\n\nThe MMR vaccine gives lifelong protection against measles. The first MMR dose is usually given when a child is 12 months old, while the second is administered at about three years and four months. However, it can be given at any age via a GP. Most MMR side-effects are mild. Babies and young children may develop a high temperature for up to 72 hours.\n\nPHA Louise Flanagan is a consultant in public health at the PHA\n\nLouise Flanagan, Consultant in Public Health at the PHA, said the MMR vaccine is important \"in helping to protect your children and preventing against this highly infectious and serious disease\". In a statement, she said that while the disease can be \"unpleasant\", it usually improves within a week without causing any further problems, however for some it can lead to serious and potentially life-threatening complications. Ms Flanagan says the introduction of the MMR vaccine meant cases in Northern Ireland were rare until recently.\n\nWhat should I do if I get measles?"], "'Aggressive' Bath nurse struck off after 'distressing' incident": ["'Aggressive' nurse struck off after 'serious' incident\n\n2 days ago By Harriet Robinson , BBC News, Somerset Share\n\nGoogle The nurse was working at a home caring for people with dementia\n\nAn \"aggressive\" nurse has been struck off after threatening to hit an elderly resident and \"potentially putting other patients at risk\".

However, he refused to engage with proceedings, and has since been sacked. The NMC ruled because of Mr Mohamed\u2019s \"failure to demonstrate safe practice and insight into his serious misconduct\" he could not remain on the NMC Register.\n\nThe report explained that on 12 April 2021, Mr Mohamed shouted at a resident, named Resident B, repeatedly telling him to go to his room. The nurse also \"got very close\" to him, said that he would hit him and shouted \"if you are a resident then behave as a resident\". He then invited Resident B to hit him. Staff witnessed him acting in an \"aggressive, threatening and demeaning manner\", and this caused distress to the nearby residents, the report stated. His actions were \"unprofessional and caused escalation of an incident which had the potential to put others at risk\", the report added. Mr Mohamed was suspended from practising as a nurse and has since not engaged with the proceedings into his actions.\n\nNo remorse\n\nThe report stated: \"The panel was of the view that if Mr Mohamed were to demonstrate full insight, genuine remorse and take steps to strengthen his practice then his misconduct would potentially be remediable.\" But the committee said the \"absence of any insight, remorse, lack of awareness\" has resulted in a striking-off order to \"adequately protect the public and serve the public interest\"."], "Butt lift company in Brentwood banned after hospitalisations": ["Inquiry after butt lift patients are hospitalised\n\n2 days ago By Louise Parry , BBC News, Essex Share\n\nGetty Images BBL surgery has the highest death rate of all cosmetic procedures, according to the NHS\n\nA council is investigating after people ended up in hospital following Brazilian butt lift procedures. Brentwood Borough Council in Essex wants to hear from anyone in the area who has had the non-surgical work done. The procedure - also known as BBL or Liquid BBL - which uses a hyaluronic acid filler, is not illegal but is currently unregulated and can be fatal if not performed properly. The council said \"an individual and associated companies\" in Brentwood had been banned from carrying out BBL procedures until any risks had been \"controlled\".\n\nEnvironmental health officers were \"investigating cases of hospitalisation due to members of the public undergoing a non-surgical aesthetic procedure, commonly known as a Brazilian Butt Lift, BBL or Liquid BBL in Brentwood,\" the council said. The authority has not named the firms involved or revealed how many patients have been hospitalised.\n\nIt is working with other local authorities and industry experts after a flurry of cases raised concern, including reports of treatment being carried out in hotel rooms. A spokesperson from Brentwood Borough Council said: \"Individuals who have undergone these procedures have experienced excruciating pain, discomfort and infections, some of which have required medical interventions and hospitalisation.\" They urged anyone experiencing symptoms to \"seek medical assistance immediately\".\n\nWhat is a Brazilian butt lift?\n\nBrazilian butt lifts, or BBLs, are procedures designed to make buttocks bigger, more rounded or lifted. Those carrying out the lifts insert silicone-filled implants and/or inject fat transferred from other parts of the body. In 2019, a woman from Norfolk died at a private hospital in Istanbul while undergoing the procedure. The surgery, as with many cosmetic procedures, can be expensive, but liquid or non-surgical BBLs are a cheaper option. In that version, hyaluronic acid, which is used in dermal fillers, is injected to manipulate the size and/or shape of the area. But if not performed in a proper way, it can lead to serious health complications.\n\n'Proceed with caution'\n\nBrentwood Borough Council is urging people \"to undertake extensive research\" before opting for BBL. \"If the cost of the treatment is lower than the market average, proceed with caution as the practitioner may not be using the products advertised,\" a spokesperson said. \"Please be aware that non-surgical aesthetic procedures still require a sterile clinical environment, therefore procedures should be performed in appropriate treatment rooms. \"If you have concerns or doubts about the procedure, contact us.\""], "Felixstowe art project explores healing power of the sea": ["Art project explores healing power of the sea\n\n2 days ago By Jon Wright , BBC News, in Felixstowe Share\n\nJon Wright/BBC Natalie Pace and Jilly Roberts installing the exhibition at Felixstowe Museum\n\nThe history of the coast as a place of healing and recovery is being explored in a new art project.

Since Monday, patients, visitors and staff are required to wear masks in clinical areas at the Royal Stoke University Hospital and County Hospital in Stafford. In Worcestershire, the Acute Hospitals NHS Trust said the measure was necessary \"to protect patients, their loved ones and hospital staff from risk of infection\" . They are currently treating 65 patients with Covid-19, the highest number since December 2023. Patients are also in hospital for longer so that would indicate they are sicker too.\n\nIn Staffordshire, there are 108 patients with the virus. At Royal Stoke Hospital two wards are currently full with Covid patients. But it is difficult to tell if this is some sort of \"summer Covid wave\" because we are doing a lot less testing than we used to. Most of the testing these days is done of hospital patients when they are admitted and yes, we are seeing a bit of an uptick, indeed it might be higher than the numbers suggest as not all new patients are tested.\n\nPart of life\n\nBut let's put these new cases in context. With about 170 infected patients in the last few weeks in Staffordshire and Worcestershire that is a lot fewer than we saw at the height of the pandemic. At the end of 2021 going in to 2022, we saw a peak in England of nearly 300,000 new cases a day and there are no signs we are even remotely close to a return to those sort of numbers. As for what is driving this small rise in cases, well Covid-19 as a virus is constantly evolving and yes that means new variants. If you remember it was the Omicron variant that drove that huge peak of 300,000 cases. Currently, we are seeing a descendent of that Omicron variant, JN1, dominating things and in fact, there are even newer mutations of JN1, that we are keeping an eye on collectively, called FliRT. (Flirt is an acronym that's to do with the locations of the mutations on the virus, if you are wondering.) But, it is too early to tell if FliRT variants are driving this small increase in infection. The truth is Covid-19 is now part of life. We will all be infected and re-infected over and over again. For many of us, that is not likely to be a problem, but those that can, should keep getting boosted, and yes, in hospital mask wearing is something we might see more of now and again as infection rates peak.\n\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

Mary Hapgood, 72, from Cobham, Surrey, said her life had been \"completely transformed\" after doctors used sound waves to operate deep inside her brain. It comes as the neurosurgeon who carried out the non-invasive procedure for essential tremor (ET) called for the treatment to be rolled out to more NHS hospitals. An NHS spokesperson said two centres which had been commissioned to provide the treatment would \"provide sufficient capacity to meet national demand\".\n\nThe condition causes involuntary shaking of parts of the body and affects over a million people in the UK, but new research has highlighted an ongoing lack of understanding. The National Tremor Foundation said ET is considered one of the most common neurological movement disorders and is estimated to be eight to 10 times more prevalent than Parkinson's disease. But 70% of people living with ET hadn\u2019t heard of it prior to diagnosis. It can sometimes be treated with drugs, which can have serious side effects, or with brain surgery, but this carries the risk of stroke and infection.\n\nBBC/Mark Norman Ms Hapgood is able to garden again after her treatment\n\nMs Hapgood lived with ET for 50 years and the condition slowly worsened over time. She says before the treatment \"it would have been very obvious\", with her hands \"flapping in the wind\" Eating and drinking became highly stressful because she could not get her hand to her face without shaking. But she was able to avoid the need for surgery with the MRI guided focused ultrasound treatment. As part of the treatment, MRI scanners are combined with powerful ultrasound waves which target very small parts of the brain.\n\nBBC/Mark Norman Professor Ludvic Zrinzo specialises in the surgical management of chronic neurological disease including tremor and Parkinson's disease\n\nProf Ludvic Zrinzo, at University College London Hospitals NHS Trust's National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, specialises in the surgical management of chronic neurological disease including tremor. \"I don't need to polish my knife or get my scalpel out... but I'm still going deep into the brain in a very precise way minimising the risks and improving patient outcomes,\" he said. The treatment is currently only available at two NHS centres, with patients waiting up to five years for focused ultrasound treatment on the NHS.\n\nBBC/Mark Norman Professor Ludvic Zrinzo says \"not enough\" NHS centres offer the treatment\n\n\"That is not enough, there are clearly too many patients and these centres are being overwhelmed,\" said Prof Zrinzo. \"We are very keen that the equipment we have at The National Hospital is commissioned by the NHS and we're working with commissioners for this to happen.\" Ms Hapgood echoed his call. \"I think there should be more MRI scanners. I am really supporting this having been through that awful time in my life when everything I did was shaking, it's really awful,\" she said. But the NHS spokesperson said it had commissioned the two specialised centres based on the estimated 50 to 150 patients a year who were eligible for the treatment. \u201cBased on current referral numbers and activity within the service, the two centres will provide sufficient capacity to meet national demand and this will continue to be monitored,\" they added."], "Virtual appointments as Nottinghamshire hospital reviews car parking.": ["Virtual appointments as trust reviews hospital parking\n\n2 days ago By Shannon Samecki , BBC News, Nottingham Share\n\nBBC Patients have said they have issues finding a car park space\n\nA hospital trust in Nottinghamshire has said it is offering more virtual appointments to patients while it reviews its car parking provision. Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said it had been treating \"growing numbers\" of people being treated at King's Mill Hospital, in Sutton-in-Ashfield, over the past year. Some patients attending appointments have complained about the lack of parking spaces, describing the situation as \"dire\" and \"absolutely manic\" at peak times. The trust said it was \"truly sorry\" for people's experiences, adding it was looking at ways to encourage more use of public transport.\n\nOne patient said they were waiting more than 45 minutes for a parking space\n\nAll public car parks at the hospital are barrier-controlled to provide safe parking and charge patients a fee for their stay. However, the barriers stopped working about six months ago, meaning people could park for free, and it was no longer controlled. The trust said: \u201cWe have seen growing numbers of people receiving treatment at our hospitals over the past year. \"To help manage this, we have been exploring ways to make the best possible use of our car parks, including by offering the option of virtual appointments to patients who don\u2019t need to attend their appointments in-person. \u201cWhile we know that public transport won\u2019t be practical for everyone, [we have] worked with partners to install two new bus stops within the grounds of King\u2019s Mill Hospital within the past year to make this a more convenient option, and [we are] also working with local providers to explore how we can encourage the use of public transport by both our staff and patients alike.\u201d\n\n'Absolutely manic'\n\nHospital users expressed their frustration with the parking situation. King's Mill hospital is the closest for Mark Housley, 61, however, he says he does not even try the hospital car park and leaves his car at the supermarket across the road instead. The 61-year-old said: \"[At peak times] it's absolutely manic, and then later in the day it becomes a little more civilised.\" Ian Randall is a blue badge holder and said parking is \"dire\". He said he was unable to find a disabled parking space for his hospital appointment, ending up being 15 minutes late and having to park in a parent and child space. Mark Ball, 60, will park down the street and walk to the hospital when he has an appointment. He said: \"It's just too busy, there's no spaces, and it's too expensive, you don't know how long you're going to be here so it could cost a fortune.\" Follow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

Four Democrats in the House of Representatives in Congress have now called for him to withdraw from the race - Lloyd Doggett of Texas, Ra\u00fal Grijalva of Arizona, Seth Boulton of Massachusetts and Mike Quigley of Illinois. \u201cPresident Biden has done enormous service to our country, but now is the time for him to follow in one of our founding father, George Washington\u2019s footsteps and step aside to let new leaders rise up and run against Donald Trump,\u201d Mr Moulton told radio station WBUR on Thursday. However, no senior Democrats have called on him to quit, as his campaign has pointed out to reporters. On Friday, reports emerged that Senator Mark Warner was attempting to form a group of fellow Democratic senators to ask Mr Biden to drop out of the race. The reports, including one in the Washington Post, suggested Mr Warner had deep concerns following the CNN debate. Speaking to reporters later on Friday, Mr Biden said he understood that Mr Warner \"is the only one considering that\" and that no one else had called for him to step down. The same day, Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey, a Democrat and ally of Mr Biden, issued a statement urging the president to \"carefully evaluate\" whether he remains the Democratic nominee. \"Whatever President Biden decides, I am committed to doing everything in my power to defeat Donald Trump,\u201d she said.\n\nMore on US election"], "Ukraine war: Ukrainians struggle as power outages worsen": ["'We've learnt to do surgery without electricity': Ukraine's power cuts worsen\n\n11 hours ago By Vitaly Shevchenko , BBC Monitoring Share\n\nEPA Extended blackouts are becoming increasingly common in Ukraine, as Russia targets its power grids\n\nPower supply is a matter of life and death for Tetiana's son. He was born with disabilities, and needs electricity-powered equipment to be able to breathe, to eat, and to receive medication. \"We are very dependent on electricity. If it wasn't for this bloody war, life would be difficult, but we'd be able to cope,\u201d Tetiana tells the BBC. Ukrainians are learning to live with extended blackouts as Russia continues to pummel its energy facilities across the country. Persistent Russian air strikes mean even previously unaffected parts of Ukraine have to go without electricity for hours on end, practically every day. Tetiana, who lives in the southern port city of Odesa, says that the endless power cuts make life extremely difficult because she needs to make sure the supply of electricity is constant. She has a generator which runs on petrol and needs to be topped up all the time, but it has to be stopped every six hours to cool down. Power cuts also affect mobile phone coverage, so getting through to the ambulance service for her son can be a struggle too. \"Sometimes it takes half an hour, sometimes it's an hour before the ambulance arrives when my child goes into convulsions and turns blue,\u201d she says. \u201cMy son can die if he doesn't get oxygen.

The lack of generated electricity is made worse by rising temperatures in the summer, when Ukrainians turn on power-hungry air conditioning systems.

Israeli officials had already said that expectations need to be lowered.\n\nThe latest rekindling of hope for a deal came after Hamas delivered its response to the three-phase proposal that President Biden set out several weeks ago.\n\nThe key to that formulation was to put off what has long appeared to be the main obstacle in either side accepting a deal - the demand by Hamas that there must be a permanent ceasefire and the counter-demand by Israel that it must have the freedom to resume fighting in Gaza if necessary.\n\nExactly what Hamas has presented has not yet been made public. But the Israeli response appears far more positive than in other instances in the past seven months when the process has regained momentum. A source in Israel's negotiating team said that the proposal put forward by Hamas included a \"very significant breakthrough\".\n\nThere are indications that this could be that Hamas has accepted the key point of the proposal announced by President Biden - that it would allow negotiations to achieve its goal of a permanent end to the war through the first six-week phase of the ceasefire, rather than demanding it as the starting point.\n\nHamas has throughout bridled at its portrayal by the US in particular as the main stumbling block in agreeing a deal. Should it become clear that it has indeed made this concession, then the ball would be firmly back in the court of Mr Netanyahu.\n\nAt no time has he personally yielded an inch in his public commitment to the complete eradication of Hamas - and Israel's right to continue fighting in Gaza after any ceasefire. He has resisted all pressure from inside and outside Israel to modify that stance.\n\nBut the pressure has been building on him from all sides, inexorably.\n\nThe latest push seems to have come from within his own military. A recent article in the New York Times, citing unnamed current and former security officials, said that Israel's top generals \"want to begin a ceasefire in Gaza even if it keeps Hamas in power for the time being\".\n\nMr Netanyahu dismissed this as defeatist. But he may not be able to resist such pressure forever - nor the ever growing anger on the streets of Israel from those who want the remaining hostages in Gaza to be brought home now.\n\nFor Hamas, there are also some signs of growing despair over the continuing war by those who suffer from it every day, the civilian population of Gaza. And internationally, the patience of mediators, like Egypt and Qatar, may be running out."], "Vatican excommunicates Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano for schism": ["Pope Francis critic excommunicated by the Vatican\n\nAn Italian archbishop and staunch critic of Pope Francis has been excommunicated by the Vatican, its doctrinal office has said.\n\nCarlo Maria Vigano was found guilty of schism - meaning he has split from the Catholic Church - after years of fierce disagreement with the pontiff.\n\nThe 83-year-old ultra-conservative has previously called on the Pope to resign, accusing him of heresy and criticising his stances on immigration, climate change and same-sex couples.\n\nArchbishop Vigano was a senior figure in the Church, serving as papal envoy to Washington from 2011 to 2016.\n\nIn 2018 he went into hiding after alleging that the Pope had known about sexual abuse by an American cardinal and failed to act. The Vatican rejected the accusation.\n\nOver time, the archbishop became associated with US conspiracy theorists, criticising Covid vaccines and alleging a \"globalist\" and \"anti-Christian\" project by the UN and other groups - both familiar conspiratorial themes.\n\nOn Friday the Vatican's doctrinal office said his refusal to submit to Pope Francis was clear from his public statements.\n\n\"The Most Reverend Carlo Maria Vigano was found guilty of the reserved delict [violation of the law] of schism,\" the statement said, adding that he had been excommunicated - or banished from the church.\n\nResponding by a post on X, the archbishop linked to the decree that was emailed to him and said:\n\n\"What was attributed to me as guilt for my conviction is now put on record, confirming the Catholic Faith that I fully profess.\"\n\nArchbishop Vigano was charged with schism and denying the pope's legitimacy last month. At the time, he write on X that he regarded the accusations against him as \"an honour\".\n\n\"I repudiate, reject, and condemn the scandals, errors, and heresies of Jorge Mario Bergoglio,\" he said, using Argentine Pope's given name.\n\nPope Francis has put himself at odds with traditionalist Catholics by making overtures towards the LGBTQ+ community, championing migrant rights and condemning the excesses of capitalism.\n\nLast year, he took action against another ultra-conservative critic, dismissing Bishop Joseph E Strickland of Texas when he refused to resign after an investigation."], "Andrew and Tristan Tate free to leave Romania but not the EU": ["Andrew Tate free to leave Romania but not the EU\n\nThe Tate brothers arrive at a court hearing in Bucharest\n\nThe brothers said the move represented a \"significant victory and major step forward\" in their ongoing case.\n\nThe decision to allow freedom of movement in the EU is not final and can be appealed.\n\nThey had previously been banned from leaving the country where they are awaiting trial, indicted on charges of human trafficking, rape and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women.

It was 2021 and his party had just lost the Hartlepool by-election to Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservatives. It was the first time Labour had ever lost the seat. Three short years feel like a political lifetime ago now. Sir Keir has become only the fifth person in British history to take Labour from opposition to power. His party has gone from a historic thumping at the general election in 2019 \u2013 to victory in 2024. The Hartlepool result though, is a reminder that Sir Keir\u2019s journey to Downing Street was far from straightforward. In fact, for a long time his life and career were on a very different path.\n\nKeir Starmer/Tom Baldwin Baby Keir was born to Labour-supporting parents\n\nKeir Starmer, one of four children, was brought up in the town of Oxted on the Kent-Surrey border. He was raised by his toolmaker father and nurse mother, who suffered from a debilitating form of arthritis known as Still\u2019s disease. Sir Keir has spoken about the challenges of growing up at a time of high inflation in the 1970s. \u201cIf you\u2019re working class, you\u2019re scared of debt,\u201d he said during the election campaign. \u201cMy mum and dad were scared of debt, so they would choose the bill that they wouldn\u2019t pay.\u201d The choice was the phone bill.\n\nLabour party/PA A young Keir, on the right, excelled at music, playing the flute, piano, violin and recorder\n\nSir Keir had a lot going on in his younger years. He was obsessed with football (on the centre-left of midfield, of course). He was a talented musician and learnt violin with Norman Cook, who went on to become chart-topping DJ Fatboy Slim. Sir Keir also had a rebellious streak. He and his friends were once caught by police illegally selling ice-cream on a French beach to raise cash. But what about politics? There were always clues, including his name which was given to him as a tribute to the first leader of the Labour Party, Keir Hardie. Sir Keir dabbled in left-wing politics over the course of his pre-parliamentary life.\n\nKeir Starmer/Tom Baldwin Sir Keir, pictured lying down, poses with flatmates during his student years in Leeds\n\nThat started at school, when he joined the Young Socialists, Labour\u2019s youth movement. After school, Sir Keir became the first person in his family to go to university, studying law at Leeds University and later at Oxford. At Leeds, he was influenced by the indie music of the 1980s, from The Smiths and The Wedding Present to Orange Juice and Aztec Camera. His biographer, Tom Baldwin, notes his favourite drink as a student was a mix of beer and cider - or Snakebite - and he had a taste for curry and chips. For a while after graduating, Sir Keir lived above a brothel in north London.\n\nKeir Starmer/Tom Baldwin His parents, Rodney and Josephine, joined him on graduation day at Leeds University\n\nMore importantly, he was building a reputation as a workaholic that would see him go on to become a successful and prominent human rights lawyer. At the same time, Sir Keir continued his left-wing activism, as a prominent contributor to the magazine Socialist Lawyer. But politics was a side interest and, for much of the next 20 years, his legal career was his focus. In 2008, he became Director of Public Prosecutions, the chief prosecutor for England and Wales. Sir Keir likes to talk about this period in life as an example of his dedication to public service, and often recalls his role in prosecuting terrorist gangs. But what else?\n\nKeir Starmer/Tom Baldwin Sir Keir spent most of his legal career as a defence barrister\n\nUnder the 2010-15 coalition government, he had to implement significant cuts, with the Crown Prosecution Service\u2019s budget reduced by more than a quarter. He also oversaw high-profile decisions including the prosecution of MPs over their parliamentary expenses following the 2009 scandal and prosecuting the then Lib Dem cabinet minister Chris Huhne for asking his wife to take speeding points for him. Sir Keir's legal work was rewarded with a knighthood in 2014. But how successful was his leadership? Towards the end of his tenure, Sir Keir admitted in a BBC interview that vulnerable victims were still being let down by the justice system.\n\nA late career change\n\nIt wasn't until the age of 52 that the career change came. Sir Keir was selected for a safe Labour seat in north London, winning comfortably. He and his predecessor Rishi Sunak became MPs on the same day. But it wasn\u2019t a happy time for the Labour Party. The Conservatives had just won the general election and a bitter factional battle loomed after Jeremy Corbyn became leader.\n\nQuestions have persisted over Sir Keir's backing of Jeremy Corbyn\n\nMuch has been said and written about Sir Keir\u2019s journey from backbencher to the Labour leadership \u2013 and now to Downing Street. But some things are worth highlighting. When he became leader, Jeremy Corbyn made Sir Keir shadow immigration minister but it didn\u2019t last long. He resigned after less than a year, one of dozens of frontbenchers who quit after the Brexit referendum in an attempt to force Mr Corbyn out. When that failed, and Mr Corbyn saw off a leadership challenge, Sir Keir returned to the fold as shadow Brexit secretary.\n\nLabour in the doldrums\n\nSir Keir\u2019s position on Mr Corbyn has evolved over time. In 2019, he was asked on BBC Breakfast to repeat the sentence \u201cJeremy Corbyn would make a great prime minister\u201d. He did. A few months later, he would tell the BBC he was \u201c100%\u201d behind Mr Corbyn and working with him to win a general election. While others refused to serve under Mr Corbyn, Sir Keir stayed in the tent and helped persuade the leader to back a second Brexit referendum at the 2019 election. That election was a disaster for Labour. Mr Corbyn quit and Sir Keir won the race to replace him. But when he took over, a lot of people thought Boris Johnson was destined to govern for some time. Many saw Sir Keir as a leader who could help rebuild \u2013 but few thought he was the man who would take them back to power.\n\nReuters Sir Keir made big changes to the Labour party during his time in opposition\n\nWhen did that change? The polls give us a good indication. Sir Keir\u2019s Labour trailed Mr Johnson\u2019s Conservatives in the polls for much of 2020 and 2021 when the Hartlepool by-election was held. But that started to change after the first reports of Downing Street parties during the pandemic, when strict restrictions were in place around social gatherings. There is a clear point in the polls where Labour overtakes the Conservatives in November 2021. Its lead increased significantly after the Liz Truss mini budget and has been consistent and significant ever since.\n\nA 'ruthless' leader\n\nSir Keir\u2019s allies argue that wouldn\u2019t have happened without big changes in the Labour Party. Sir Keir has sometimes been ruthless. Jeremy Corbyn was thrown out of the parliamentary party and ultimately barred from standing as a Labour candidate. Economic policy was tightened; meaning policies were junked if they weren\u2019t seen as affordable. Sir Keir embraced British patriotism, using the union jack as a backdrop for speeches and getting his conference to sing God Save the King. All of that has contributed to Sir Keir\u2019s message of change. He spent the campaign arguing he had changed Labour and could change the country too.\n\nKeir Starmer/Tom Baldwin Sir Keir and Victoria married in 2007", "Keir Starmer: From indie kid to prime minister\n\n24 hours ago By Nick Eardley , @nickeardleybbc, Political correspondent Share\n\nReuters\n\nThree years ago Sir Keir Starmer seriously considered quitting as Labour leader.

Not exactly bog standard stuff, you could say (sorry!).\n\nSign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.\n\nRachel Reeves is one of the prominent figures in Sir Keir\u2019s team, among them also Wes Streeting and Bridget Phillipson, who have been deeply involved for months in getting ready to govern. Senior civil servants and their shadow ministers have been talking for some time and Sir Keir and some of his team have been regular attendees at Cobra meetings, and security briefings. One, now a cabinet minister, told me: \u201cWe have got personal relationships with the permanent secretary and the senior officials already.\u201c The former civil servant Sue Gray, who will now be the PM's chief of staff, has been in regular contact with Cabinet Secretary Sir Simon Case, since the turn of the year. After the headlines of the Labour leader's missions had been turned into policies, they were then made into \u201cimplementation plans\" for government. The calls between Ms Gray and Sir Simon became almost daily. There has been some perhaps less obvious assistance, too. At least two former Conservative ministers have been helping them prepare, including one recent cabinet minister who told me: \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous we just hand over a trillion pound budget\u201d without the kind of transition that an American president, for example, enjoys.\n\nThe plan for government\n\nDespite the scale of victory, the Labour manifesto, based on Sir Keir\u2019s mission, is not about to be usurped with a huge bold unknown move. \u201cThere are no secrets,\u201d one senior figure told me. Another source told me the election result is a vindication of the PM's cautious approach and it is not a \u201cvote for a more radical, bold approach\u201d. Expect strong resistance to any calls from the left that the scale of the change \u201cproves\u201d Labour could have been more radical in what they put forward. Some in his party may demand a rapid cessation of arm sales to Israel. Labour losing seats and nearly losing others to opponents standing on a pro-Gaza platform will only make those calls more urgent. Other demands may include an overt commitment to safeguard public services, a longer-term promise to remove the two-child benefit cap and even regular trade union access to No 10. But with a massive majority, there is no suggestion that Sir Keir will feel he is in the mood to redraft his carefully worked out plans. Instead the new prime minister has held up the result as a rejection of the Tory Party and a vote for a different type of leadership, and frankly, less drama. But his style, and the gradual way in which his plans were built over a period of many months, belies some very significant changes Labour wants. These include an expansion of rights for workers, a rapid overhaul of the planning system and a state energy company. In the short-term, new ministers are likely to do everything they can to talk up how they want to get the economy to grow. It won\u2019t be entirely coincidental if within a few weeks, companies start writing cheques for the UK, or that pent -up investments that were waiting for a change of government start to come through.\n\nAnd it\u2019s likely that before long there will be new draft laws to give more powers to the government\u2019s independent economic watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility. One of the big first decisions the new chancellor needs to make is when to hold a huge review of the public finances with the teeth clenching decisions it might involve. The so-called spending review, which portions out cash between departments, expires at the end of the year. It sounds like a dull decision but it is massively important. Ms Reeves will have to decide whether to roll over the existing Tory spending plans for a year, to give her more space to work out a longer-term plan, or crack on with her own review by the end of 2024. Watch this space.\n\nBeware of drift\n\nThe Labour mantra in public, and in private has been not just to win, but to be ready to get things done. In their mind are what they see as the lessons of New Labour and Tony Blair\u2019s frustration with the slow pace of change. One new minister tells of a meeting where they briefed the former PM about their plans and he warned them: \u201cI so deeply regret that we didn\u2019t hit the ground running on reform.\" \u201cKeir has taken this incredibly seriously,\" the minister told me. Appointing the cabinet\u2019s been done, but there are dozens of other MPs to receive government jobs, with advisers and new members of the House of Lords. They include the former Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance who has been appointed as a minister of state at the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology. I\u2019m told the former health secretary, Alan Milburn, is likely to take a senior, though not ministerial, role at the Department of Health to help drive waiting lists down. Other departments and other appointments might throw up some interesting names. But for all the preparation and experience, the receipt of power and responsibility is huge. One official said of incoming prime ministers: \u201cThey come in exhausted from this now-seemingly endless campaign, they come in elated, they appoint their cabinet \u2013 that is a great moment for them. And then sour-faced people like me say, \u2018now, can I talk to you about the end of the world!\u2019\u201d Sir Keir is in a hurry not just to show the public that his government can actually get things done after years of visible political shambles. But he\u2019s also been counselled to make the most of the early goodwill from his vast ranks of new victors, before, inevitably in time, however long, the Parliamentary Labour Party starts to flex its muscles. One former Labour adviser told me, he should \"Go quick! Go fast, before they find the loos!\" It is true that his team has tried very hard to control the quality of candidates, and many loyalists will be picking up their pass for the first day in the big palace soon. But as former prime ministers have found, bright-eyed new recruits don\u2019t stay eager forever.\n\nProblems and Pitfalls\n\nLabour\u2019s scale of victory is something they could have hardly dreamed of not so long ago. But their elation this weekend doesn\u2019t make some of the very tricky realities of governing go away. Whenever she\u2019s been near a microphone in recent months, Ms Reeves has been warning of what she calls the \"worst economic inheritance since the Second World War\" or as she said at her election count in Leeds \"there is not a huge amount of money\". Waiting lists are sky high. Prisons are overcrowded. Millions of families are struggling to make ends meet. This was an election result driven partly by voters\u2019 clear feeling that nothing works. That sense is not confined to public perception. As one senior Whitehall official told me: \u201cThings really are worse on the inside than you can see from outside.\"\n\nLabour\u2019s ministerial teams have been discussing how to tell the public how bad, in their view, things really are. No sooner had Mr Streeting been appointed health secretary than he said: \u201cFrom today the policy of this department is that the NHS is broken.\u201d A sceptic might also say Labour will be keen to brand the problems once and for all as the Tories\u2019 fault.\n\nThe mission\n\nWhat of the new PM himself? It\u2019s not lost on the public, or his political critics, that he has been willing to junk old promises, and indeed, to junk old colleagues if need be. His backers say it\u2019s a sign of strength, and was a lesson he had to learn - ditching what one source described as \u201cnauseating\u201d pleas for party unity for a clearer priority, the desire to win. It is no easier now to get to the bottom of what Sir Keir believes in than it was when I first sat down with him. Back then he was pitching for the leadership of his party, when his aim to get them back into power looked fanciful. He and his team had come up with the phrase \u201cmoral socialism\u201d. Then, as now, it sounded like a slogan designed for a Guardian newspaper headline rather than something the public could latch on to. He told me he wanted to persuade people that Labour and politicians could be a \u201cforce for good and a force for change\u201c. That\u2019s a line that could feature in one of his many interviews or speeches four years later, where still, you might be searching for a grand ideological mantra. But perhaps to hunt for an ideology is to miss the point. He is not a factional politician who\u2019s been in the trade, man and boy, not a product of student union elections, decades of party conferences, fevered debates about the purity of particular policies. For his backers, that arguable absence of an ideology is his huge advantage. \u201cHe\u2019ll be the most normal PM we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d says one insider. One minister tells me he belongs not to any faction but to the party. \u201cHe is theirs,\u201d the new minister says. Whether Sir Keir can make the public feel that kind of direct connection with him as a leader seems ambitious and highly uncertain. He sometimes apes Tony Blair, saying he\u2019ll return politics to serve the people through what he terms national renewal. But despite the size of the majority, there is little sign at this moment that he could achieve that kind of incredible personal popularity the 1997 victor saw.\n\nA second term?\n\nIt was Sir Keir\u2019s belief that the modern electorate could be incredibly volatile that led him to have faith that he could turn the 2019 disaster round. The willingness of so many voters to change their minds has been Keir Starmer\u2019s friend at this election but if that volatility is here to stay, it could become his foe. In time, and perhaps soon, Labour will start plotting privately how this term in office can be extended into what Starmer has already set out as his goal of a \u201cdecade of renewal\u201c. Just before polling day, one insider joked: \u201cI\u2019m never not thinking about winning the next election.\u201d By any traditional measure, a majority on this scale would see a prime minister securely locked into two terms of office. But in 2024 that feels less certain. For now for Labour, there is a moment of profound celebration. No more the impotence of opposition. No more the pain of losing yet again. No more \u201cface of thunder\u201d for the new prime minister, or the frustration of being irrelevant. As we saw in Downing Street yesterday, after all the waiting, he can allow himself a smile.", "After the impotence of opposition, Keir Starmer prepares to wield power\n\n12 hours ago By Laura Kuenssberg , @bbclaurak, Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg Share\n\nGetty Images\n\n\u201cA face of thunder.\u201d As opposition leader, Sir Keir Starmer would go back to his office after the State Opening of Parliament deeply frustrated after witnessing the Conservatives\u2019 plans laid out year after year.

Advocates hope the June birth of a white buffalo calf - an exceedingly rare event - will translate into new momentum for a decades-long push to revive the species in America's Great Plains. Many tribes consider a white bison birth to be a sacred omen that signifies change. The herd this calf was born into has also become an important cultural symbol - it's the last wild buffalo herd in North America. The herd is entering a new chapter of its life as stewardship of the species is increasingly being overseen by indigenous communities again and advocates push to grow bison populations. The American buffalo, also known as bison, once numbered in the tens of millions before being brought to the brink of extinction in the 1800s. Now, the only wild herd in the US is limited to just 5,000 animals. But tribes and bison advocates see opportunity as Yellowstone, America\u2019s first national park and the home of the white calf, considers a proposal to expand the wild herd\u2019s size for the first time in decades. The white calf has added spiritual significance to buffalo advocates' efforts as they test a long-standing status quo where government policies prioritise beef ranching over the beliefs of native tribes.\n\nA prophecy revealed\n\nJust after noon on 4 June, Yellowstone photography guide Jordan Creech was sightseeing with clients when he spotted the freshly-born white buffalo calf, taking its first steps in the park\u2019s Lamar Valley. Bison calves can walk within two minutes of being born, and run alongside their herd within the first seven minutes of life. \u201cIt\u2019s the most unique experience I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Creech says. Erin Braaten, a photographer of Native American descent from Kalispell, Montana, also witnessed the calf\u2019s first moments of life before it disappeared into the herd. \"I thought I'd have a better chance of capturing Bigfoot than a white bison calf,\" she tells BBC News. For the last 2,000 years the people of the Lakota, Dakota and Nakoda tribes have told the story of a woman who arrived during a time of need. A version speaks of two scouts searching for food and buffalo in the Black Hills of South Dakota. The mysterious woman appeared and offered their tribe a bundle of sacred gifts, including a pipe carved from red rock, and instructed the people on how to live and pray. She transformed several times before taking the form a white buffalo calf with a black nose, black eyes and black hooves. As she departed, a great number of buffalo returned to feed the people. Dozens of other tribes have white buffalo stories, interpreting its arrival as both a blessing and a warning.\n\nBuffalo Field Campaign Chief Arvol Looking Horse, a Lakota spiritual leader, is the 19th generation to maintain the sacred pipe and bundle given by the White Buffalo Woman\n\nChief Arvol Looking Horse, a spiritual leader of the Lakota Tribe, is known as the Keeper of the Sacred Bundle \u2014 the bundle and pipe left by the spirit. He likens the white calf\u2019s return to the second coming of Christ.

Apart from appearances at Labour conferences, the odd state banquet and a Taylor Swift concert, Lady Starmer, nee Victoria Alexander, has sought to avoid public appearances Asked on LBC about his wife's low profile, Sir Keir pointed out that she had a full-time job at an NHS hospital and that their eldest child was doing his GCSEs. \u201cWe took the decision that whilst I was out and about on the road, we wanted to create the environment where he could study calmly in ordinary circumstances.\u201d However, now that Sir Keir has won the election and become prime minister, Lady Starmer may find it trickier to shun the spotlight.\n\nPA Up until now, Lady Starmer has only occasionally appeared on big public and ceremonial occasions\n\nWhen she first met Sir Keir in the early 2000s, he wasn't a politician but a barrister. She was a solicitor working on the same case. Sir Keir told ITV's Piers Morgan's Life Stories, of their first meeting: \"I was doing a case in court and it all depended on whether the documents were accurate. \"I [asked the team] who actually drew up these documents, they said a woman called Victoria, so I said 'let's get her on the line.'\" He grilled her forensically on the paper but as he hung up he heard one comment from her. \"She said, 'who the bleep does he think he is', then put the phone down on me,\" Sir Keir said. \"And quite right too.\"\n\nKeir Starmer/Tom Baldwin The couple got engaged just a few months after meeting\n\nDespite the rocky beginnings, the relationship blossomed after a first date in the Lord Stanley pub in Camden, north London. Speaking to his biographer Tom Baldwin, Sir Keir described her as \"grounded, sassy, funny, streetwise - and utterly gorgeous too\". He proposed just a few months later on a holiday in Greece. \"Won't we need a ring, Keir?\" was her down-to-earth response. They were married in 2007 at the Fennes estate in Essex, walking down the aisle to one of Sir Keir's favourite pieces of music - Beethoven's Piano Concerto No.5, 2nd movement. He later described her to Radio 4's Desert Island Discs as an \"incredibly warm, wonderful woman. My complete rock\".

She attended Channing School before studying law and sociology at Cardiff University. While there, she got involved in student politics, becoming president of the student union in 1994. In an interview with the student newspaper Gair Rhydd, she said her main priority was to campaign against cuts to student grants.

Geese already know how to do it. When you see them flying in a v-formation, they are surfing on the air currents created by formation members ahead and around them. At an airfield in Texas, Todd Graetz is hoping to use that concept to disrupt the market for air cargo. Aerolane has been mimicking the tricks used by migrating birds, aided by modified planes towed into the air by another aircraft. Smoke released from the leading plane allowed cameras installed in the towed aircraft to capture vortices in the air that a glider can exploit to stay aloft. Their latest test aircraft is known as the \u201cflying piano\u201d because of its poor gliding characteristics. Its twin engines idle for electrical power while it glides along with propellers turning for purely aerodynamic purposes. Other tests have measured the tension in the towing line. They spotted when the line went slack, indicating the glider is surfing along on currents generated by the aircraft ahead.\n\nAerolane's plan is to feed all this data into a program that will guide an unmanned cargo plane through wakes and turbulence to exploit the possibilities of gliding long distances without burning fuel. One or more such cargo planes could be towed by a jet, also carrying cargo, to their destination where they would land autonomously. The only fuel costs would come from supplying the towing aircraft\u2019s engines. In theory this should work like a truck pulling a trailer, with air currents doing much of the heavy lifting. This is what Mr Graetz calls \u201ca combination of gliding and surfing\u201d. The same idea occurred to Airbus, which tested the technique in 2021 with two A350 airliners flying 3km (1.9 miles) apart across the Atlantic. Although the aircraft were not connected by a tow line, the experiment saw one aircraft winning an uplift from the lead A350\u2019s wake to reduce CO2 emissions and fuel burn.\n\nAirbus Airbus has experimented with flying a jet in the wake of another to conserve fuel\n\nMr Graetz, a pilot with 12 years\u2019 experience, founded Aerolane with Gur Kimchi, a veteran of Amazon\u2019s drone delivery project, on the basis that \u201cthere has got to be a better way to get more out of existing aircraft\". The project has raised eyebrows among experienced pilots. Flying large gliders in commercial airspace means meeting strict flight safety regulations. For instance, the towing aircraft has to be confident it can release the tow line at any point in the flight, safe in the knowledge that the auto-piloted glider can make it down to a runway without dropping on top of the local population. Aerolane says a small electric motor driving a propeller will act as a safety net on their cargo gliders, giving them enough juice to go around again if a landing looks wrong or to divert to another location close by.\n\nAerolane Aerolane hopes that a glider something like this might one day carry air freight\n\nMr Graetz counters that Aerolane employs active commercial pilots who are hard-headed about the practicalities of the project. \u201cWe\u2019ve engaged outside advisors to be devil\u2019s advocates,\" he adds.

Labour's landslide victory is being digested by commentators all over the world, many dissecting what the results mean for relations with the UK - as well as for the future of the Conservative Party of Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher. The rise of Reform UK also generates many international column inches of coverage, especially in Europe where it didn't go unnoticed that its leader, the arch-Brexiteer Nigel Farage, became an MP for the first time.\n\nEurope: Centre-left success bucks a trend\n\nFor Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the results mean \"the British [have] had a burden lifted from their shoulders\", but any renewed stability in the UK is seen as fragile. Voters \"were primarily concerned with getting rid of the Conservatives,\" the paper says, adding that \"Labour has a stable majority, but also problems within the party\". German business daily Handelsblatt says the British election result \"opens up the opportunity to correct Brexit\". \"Now is the time to correct one of the biggest mistakes in British politics. A security pact with the EU can only be the beginning,\" the paper said. Mr Farage\u2019s success attracted a lot of attention. German Tabloid Bild dubbed it an \u201celection earthquake\u201d, albeit one for which the paper says Labour can be thankful, seeing that Reform took many votes from the Conservatives. French media largely hails Labour\u2019s victory, also noting the election of Nigel Farage. Le Figaro says that despite the Reform party leader\u2019s success in Clacton, \"the British people have overwhelmingly chosen a moderate centre-left leader\". According to Le Monde, the UK\u2019s return to the centre-left is \"striking, especially seen from France, where the far right has the wind in its sails on the eve of the second round of the legislative elections\". Italian newspaper Il Corriere della Sera says of the Conservative defeat: \"The party of Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher emerges from this election with broken bones: it will take years to recover. Has the right-wing wind that blows across the continent stopped at the English Channel? Obviously not... If the person in charge disappoints, he is replaced.\" Conservative Italian daily Il Giornale hopes for a return to stability in the UK, calling Prime Minster Sir Keir Starmer \u201ca reassuring institutional alternative\u201d. But for Poland's national broadcaster TVP, Mr Starmer is seen as \u201ca bit bland, even boring\u201d. But fortunately for him, the broadcaster says, \u201cprevious leaders of the Conservative Party achieved much worse results\u201d. In Hungary, the press there noted two issues: \u201cUnchanged support for Ukraine\u201d, according to pro-government paper Magyar Nemzet; and Hungarians in the UK hoping for \u201ca more relaxed stance on visa rules and work permits,\u201d said the left-wing paper Telex.\n\nUS sees 'frustrated' voters plump for 'dull competence'\n\nThe New York Times casts Labour's victory as \"a seismic moment in the UK\u2019s politics, returning to power a party that just five years ago suffered its most crushing defeat since the 1930s\". But it also notes the low voter turnout, reporting only about 60% of those eligible cast ballots. \"The low figure speaks to the mood of an electorate that seemed frustrated with the last government but hardly full of optimism about the next one. It also pointed to the challenge facing the new Labour government, which will have to work fast if it wants to restore disillusioned voters\u2019 faith in mainstream politics,\" the Times says. For ABC News, Rishi Sunak\u2019s campaign to remain Britain\u2019s prime minister showed a lack of political touch. \"Predecessors such as Tony Blair and Boris Johnson were more politically astute and able to connect with voters.\" As for Mr Sunak, he defied political advice by calling the election in May \u2014 \"with Conservative support dwindling steadily amid an economic slump, ethics scandals and a revolving door of leaders over the last two years,\" the broadcaster said. Meanwhile, a headline in the Wall Street Journal read: \"The UK elects a no-drama prime minister after years of post-Brexit chaos.\" \"Eight years after the UK voted to leave the European Union and entered an era of political and economic turmoil, voters have asked Keir Starmer to steady the entire country with his brand of dull competence,\" the paper said.\n\nIndia: 'Dismal end' for Sunak\n\nBy Rupsha Mukherjee\n\nMost TV channels and news sites in India focused on Rishi Sunak conceding defeat. \u201cBritish Indians Rishi Sunak, Suella Braverman win seats, but apologise for poor Tory performance,\u201d The Times of India noted. The Wire website called it \"a dismal end to his 20 months as head of government\". Everything Sunak tried during the campaign \u201creally failed\u201d, Times Now TV added. \u201cEveryone thought the Conservatives had a plan but now all those plans have fallen flat.\" But the Labour win \u201cis also a triumph for India\u201d, one news site thought, suggesting that Sir Keir Starmer would seek better relations with Delhi.\n\nChina: 'Can Starmer clean up UK's mess?'\n\nBy Kerry Allen, BBC Monitoring China team\n\nChina\u2019s only official statement so far has been via its foreign ministry, which said China \u201chad noticed the results of the British election\u201d and \u201cwe hope to get Sino-UK relations along the right track\u201d. Despite these hopes, state media outlets were not overly optimistic. \u201cWith six prime ministers in eight years, can Starmer clean up the UK\u2019s mess?\u201d asked broadcaster CCTV. Given the next government faces \u201cthe most challenging issues in 70 years\u201d, \u201cpublic dissatisfaction\u201d might soon follow, mused The Paper. The Global Times, however, published a positive profile of the prime minister-to-be, saying Sir Keir was \u201cnot the inflammatory politician that people imagine\u201d, and that media impressions of him are that he is \u201cconscientious, good at management, and a little dull\u201d. China can hope for a more pragmatic relationship with the UK, the paper said.\n\nRussia: No change in policy expected\n\nBy Anastasia Bazenkova and Yuriy Martynenko"], "Vladimir Kara-Murza: Russian dissident 'moved to Russian prison hospital'": ["Jailed Russian dissident moved to prison hospital\n\nRussian dissident Vladimir Kara-Murza, who was jailed after criticising President Vladimir Putin and the war in Ukraine, has been taken to a prison hospital, his wife says.\n\nEvgenia Kara-Murza said on X that officials refused to comment on his condition when his lawyers tried to visit him.\n\nLast year Mr Kara-Murza, a dual Russian-British citizen, was jailed and transferred to a prison colony in Siberia.\n\nHis wife says he suffers from a neurological condition as a result of poisonings.\n\nMr Kara-Murza, 42, has accused Russian authorities of trying to poison him in 2015 and 2017.\n\nOn Friday, lawyers for the dissident arrived at the Omsk prison colony but were not told where he was for five hours and then not permitted to visit him in hospital, Evgenia Kara-Murza says.\n\nThe outspoken critic of the Kremlin was arrested in April 2022.\n\nIn 2023 he was sentenced to 25 years for spreading \"false\" information about the Russian army and being affiliated with an \"undesirable organisation\".\n\nHe has criticised President Vladimir Putin over the Russian government's crackdown on dissent and the war in Ukraine.\n\nHe had also played a key role in persuading Western governments to sanction Russian officials for human rights abuses and corruption.\n\nThe US state department has described Mr Kara-Murza as \"yet another target of the Russian government's escalating campaign of repression\".\n\nMr Kara-Murza, who comes from a Soviet dissident family, received British citizenship when he moved to the UK as a teenager with his mother.\n\nHis wife has expressed concern over his wellbeing while in prison, particularly following the death of opposition leader Alexei Navalny earlier this year."], "Shania Twain surprises superfan, 81, at show": ["Shania Twain surprises superfan, 81, at show\n\nKen Northall has spent the last 25 years travelling the world to see Twain play live\n\nAn 81-year-old Shania Twain superfan has told his hero that meeting her was a \"dream\" after she called him up on stage at a show in his hometown.\n\nThe Canadian superstar, who recently lit up Glastonbury's legends slot with a set of her greatest hits, asked Ken Northall to join her during her show at Lytham Festival in Lancashire on Thursday night.\n\nShe even changed the lyrics to That Don't Impress Me Much in honour of him, swapping film star Brad Pitt's name for Ken's.\n\nThanking her as he left the stage, he told her it had been \"a dream\"."], "London: Building the Royal Festival Hall": ["The Royal Festival Hall has been the cornerstone of London's South Bank since it opened in 1951.\n\nThe hall was built as part of that year's Festival of Britain and while the rest of the festival site was cleared away and redeveloped once it ended, the Royal Festival Hall has remained a mainstay ever since, hosting some of the most famous musicians in the world such as Louis Armstrong, the Bee Gees, Frank Sinatra and David Bowie.\n\nWe've gone back into the archives to 1949 and the day the foundation stone was laid by Prime Minister Clement Attlee, when he described the venue as somewhere \"to give pleasure and refreshment of the soul to generations of Londoners yet unborn\"."], "California wildfires: Nearly 30,000 evacuated": ["Thousands evacuated from California wildfires\n\nBlazing infernos force evacuations in northern California\n\nTens of thousands of people in northern California have been allowed to return to their homes after evacuating as wildfires spread in the region during a heatwave.\n\nApproximately 16,000 people were under evacuation orders and warnings when the Thompson Fire broke out on Tuesday, according to Megan McMann, spokesperson for Butte County Sheriff\u2019s Office, although originally 28,000 was reported by officials.\n\nAll evacuations were lifted by 18:00 local time on Thursday (02:00 BST Friday), she said, but hours earlier, new orders were put in place elsewhere in the state.\n\nDangerously hot weather is expected to continue with temperatures of 118F (47C) forecast in some areas, feeding the state's 3,000-plus burning wildfires.\n\nThe heatwave -

A British-Chinese woman has told the BBC that she handed over her life savings to con men who wore uniforms in video calls and gave her a virtual tour of what appeared to be a police station.\n\nHelen Young still has nightmares about the fortnight that she was made to believe she was on China\u2019s most wanted list. Scammers posing as Chinese police manipulated the London-based accountant into believing she was under investigation for a massive fraud back in her homeland. Helen was presented with a mountain of fabricated evidence which appeared to implicate her in a crime she knew nothing about. When the fake police then threatened her with extradition to a jail cell in China, Helen sent them her \u00a329,000 life savings as \u201cbail money\u201d, in a desperate attempt to stay in Britain. \u201cI feel a bit stupid right now,\u201d she says. \u201cBut there's no chance I can know that's not real. It's so convincing\u201d. Helen\u2019s story may sound extraordinary but there have been numerous similar cases in the Chinese diaspora. China\u2019s embassies around the world have issued public warnings about police impersonation scams, as has the FBI after a number of cases in the US. One elderly woman in Los Angeles reportedly handed over $3m, believing it would stop her extradition.\n\nThe FBI and Chinese embassies around the world have issued warnings about police impersonation scams\n\nTypically these scams begin with the target receiving a relatively innocuous phone call. In Helen\u2019s case it was somebody claiming to be a Chinese customs officer who told her they had stopped an illegal parcel sent in her name. Helen hadn\u2019t sent anything, and she was told she must file a police report if she believed someone had stolen her identity. Although she was sceptical, Helen didn\u2019t hang up. \u201cChinese people like myself because we were born and bred in China, we were taught obedience,\u201d she says. \u201cSo when the party asked me to do something or my parents asked me it\u2019s very rare that I will say no.\u201d Helen was transferred to a man who said he was a policeman in Shenzhen called \u201cOfficer Fang\u201d. Helen asked for proof and he suggested they went on a video call. When they connected, Helen saw a uniformed man whose face matched the police ID he flashed. Officer Fang then used his phone to give her a tour of what looked like a fully functioning police station with several uniformed officers and a desk with a large police logo. \u201cThat moment all my suspicions are gone. So I say: 'I'm sorry, I just have to be careful nowadays, there are a lot of criminals out there',\u201d Helen says. While they were talking, Helen heard a message on the tannoy in the background, telling Officer Fang to take a call about her. Officer Fang put her on hold and when he returned he was no longer interested in the illegal parcel. He said he had been informed that Helen was suspected of involvement in a large financial fraud.\n\n\u201cI said: 'That\u2019s nonsense'. He said: 'Nobody says they\u2019re guilty. So it\u2019s the evidence that counts'.\u201d Helen was shown what looked like a bank statement for a vast amount of money in her name. Officer Fang told her that if she was innocent she must help them catch the real crooks. He made her sign a confidentiality agreement promising not to tell anyone about the investigation. Helen was warned that if she did, she would get an extra six months in prison \u201cHe said: 'If you tell anyone you have been interviewed by the Chinese police, your life will be in danger'.\u201d The scammers also made Helen download an app so they could listen in to what she was doing day and night. Over the next few days, Helen tried to act normally at work. She spent her evenings working on a personal statement that she was ordered to write, detailing every aspect of her life. Then Officer Fang called back with the news that several suspects were now in custody. He showed her written statements in which several people accused her. Helen was sent a video which appeared to show a male prisoner confessing to police, and naming her as his boss in the fraud.\n\nHelen's scammers used a personalised video confession to convince her she was facing criminal charges\n\nWe have taken a closer look at the video, and because the suspect is wearing a large Covid mask, it\u2019s impossible to tell if what you\u2019re hearing matches his lip movements. It would be easy to add a fake soundtrack that mentions Helen's name or another victim. But for Helen - who had been convinced she was dealing with genuine police officers - the effect was devastating: \u201cAfter I heard my name like that I was vomiting. It convinced me I was in deep, deep trouble.\u201d Helen believed Officer Fang when he then told her she would be extradited to China - even though she\u2019s a British citizen. \u201cHe told me: 'So you got 24 hours, you pack your bags. The police are coming to take you to the airport'.\u201d Helen was told she could halt her extradition if she could raise bail. After sending over her bank statements for inspection, she was told to transfer \u00a329,000. \u201cI felt terrible, because I promised my daughter to give her money for her first flat,\u201d Helen says. But a few days later the fake police were back. Helen was ordered to find another \u00a3250,000 or be extradited: \u201cI was fighting for my life - if I go back to China, I may never come back.\u201d After Helen tried to borrow the money from a friend, he alerted her daughter. Helen broke down and revealed everything. But not before she had put her phone in a kitchen drawer and taken her daughter into a bedroom, and put a duvet over their heads so the scammers couldn\u2019t listen in. Her daughter listened patiently and explained it was a scam. Helen\u2019s bank eventually refunded her money, but her ordeal could easily have had a bleaker ending: \u201cFor two weeks I hardly slept. How can you sleep when somebody is monitoring your phone?\" In her sleep-deprived state, she crashed her car twice. On the second occasion, she wrecked it entirely: \u201cI didn\u2019t kill anyone, but I could have.

A British-Chinese woman has told the BBC that she handed over her life savings to con men who wore uniforms in video calls and gave her a virtual tour of what appeared to be a police station.\n\nHelen Young still has nightmares about the fortnight that she was made to believe she was on China\u2019s most wanted list. Scammers posing as Chinese police manipulated the London-based accountant into believing she was under investigation for a massive fraud back in her homeland. Helen was presented with a mountain of fabricated evidence which appeared to implicate her in a crime she knew nothing about. When the fake police then threatened her with extradition to a jail cell in China, Helen sent them her \u00a329,000 life savings as \u201cbail money\u201d, in a desperate attempt to stay in Britain. \u201cI feel a bit stupid right now,\u201d she says. \u201cBut there's no chance I can know that's not real. It's so convincing\u201d. Helen\u2019s story may sound extraordinary but there have been numerous similar cases in the Chinese diaspora. China\u2019s embassies around the world have issued public warnings about police impersonation scams, as has the FBI after a number of cases in the US. One elderly woman in Los Angeles reportedly handed over $3m, believing it would stop her extradition.\n\nThe FBI and Chinese embassies around the world have issued warnings about police impersonation scams\n\nTypically these scams begin with the target receiving a relatively innocuous phone call. In Helen\u2019s case it was somebody claiming to be a Chinese customs officer who told her they had stopped an illegal parcel sent in her name. Helen hadn\u2019t sent anything, and she was told she must file a police report if she believed someone had stolen her identity. Although she was sceptical, Helen didn\u2019t hang up. \u201cChinese people like myself because we were born and bred in China, we were taught obedience,\u201d she says. \u201cSo when the party asked me to do something or my parents asked me it\u2019s very rare that I will say no.\u201d Helen was transferred to a man who said he was a policeman in Shenzhen called \u201cOfficer Fang\u201d. Helen asked for proof and he suggested they went on a video call. When they connected, Helen saw a uniformed man whose face matched the police ID he flashed. Officer Fang then used his phone to give her a tour of what looked like a fully functioning police station with several uniformed officers and a desk with a large police logo. \u201cThat moment all my suspicions are gone. So I say: 'I'm sorry, I just have to be careful nowadays, there are a lot of criminals out there',\u201d Helen says. While they were talking, Helen heard a message on the tannoy in the background, telling Officer Fang to take a call about her. Officer Fang put her on hold and when he returned he was no longer interested in the illegal parcel. He said he had been informed that Helen was suspected of involvement in a large financial fraud.\n\n\u201cI said: 'That\u2019s nonsense'. He said: 'Nobody says they\u2019re guilty. So it\u2019s the evidence that counts'.\u201d Helen was shown what looked like a bank statement for a vast amount of money in her name. Officer Fang told her that if she was innocent she must help them catch the real crooks. He made her sign a confidentiality agreement promising not to tell anyone about the investigation. Helen was warned that if she did, she would get an extra six months in prison \u201cHe said: 'If you tell anyone you have been interviewed by the Chinese police, your life will be in danger'.\u201d The scammers also made Helen download an app so they could listen in to what she was doing day and night. Over the next few days, Helen tried to act normally at work. She spent her evenings working on a personal statement that she was ordered to write, detailing every aspect of her life. Then Officer Fang called back with the news that several suspects were now in custody. He showed her written statements in which several people accused her. Helen was sent a video which appeared to show a male prisoner confessing to police, and naming her as his boss in the fraud.\n\nHelen's scammers used a personalised video confession to convince her she was facing criminal charges\n\nWe have taken a closer look at the video, and because the suspect is wearing a large Covid mask, it\u2019s impossible to tell if what you\u2019re hearing matches his lip movements. It would be easy to add a fake soundtrack that mentions Helen's name or another victim. But for Helen - who had been convinced she was dealing with genuine police officers - the effect was devastating: \u201cAfter I heard my name like that I was vomiting. It convinced me I was in deep, deep trouble.\u201d Helen believed Officer Fang when he then told her she would be extradited to China - even though she\u2019s a British citizen. \u201cHe told me: 'So you got 24 hours, you pack your bags. The police are coming to take you to the airport'.\u201d Helen was told she could halt her extradition if she could raise bail. After sending over her bank statements for inspection, she was told to transfer \u00a329,000. \u201cI felt terrible, because I promised my daughter to give her money for her first flat,\u201d Helen says. But a few days later the fake police were back. Helen was ordered to find another \u00a3250,000 or be extradited: \u201cI was fighting for my life - if I go back to China, I may never come back.\u201d After Helen tried to borrow the money from a friend, he alerted her daughter. Helen broke down and revealed everything. But not before she had put her phone in a kitchen drawer and taken her daughter into a bedroom, and put a duvet over their heads so the scammers couldn\u2019t listen in. Her daughter listened patiently and explained it was a scam. Helen\u2019s bank eventually refunded her money, but her ordeal could easily have had a bleaker ending: \u201cFor two weeks I hardly slept. How can you sleep when somebody is monitoring your phone?\" In her sleep-deprived state, she crashed her car twice. On the second occasion, she wrecked it entirely: \u201cI didn\u2019t kill anyone, but I could have. These types of criminal scam could kill people.\u201d Other victims of police impersonation scams have been pushed to even greater extremes.

He revealed the figure after government spokeswoman Prisca Thevenot, her deputy Virginie Lanlo and a party activist were brutally assaulted as they put up election posters in Meudon, south-west of Paris. The motive for the attack is not clear, but Ms Thevenot returned to Meudon on Thursday with Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, who condemned what he called \"attacks of intolerable cowardice\". The spate of assaults across France reflects the febrile mood on the final day of campaigning in an election that the far-right National Rally (RN) is poised to win.\n\nAlthough RN is well ahead in the polls, 217 candidates have dropped out from local run-off races so another candidate has a better chance of stopping them winning an outright majority in the National Assembly. Mr Darmanin told news channel BFMTV the attacks were taking place in a climate in which France was \"on edge\" and more than 30 people had been arrested. He said the attackers were either people who had \"spontaneously become angry\" or they were the \"ultra-left, ultra-right or other political groups\". Images filmed from a block of flats showed the youths swarming around the candidate, her deputy Virginie Lanlo and a party activist for President Emmanuel Macron's Ensemble alliance. Ms Thevenot told Le Parisien website that when she and her colleagues objected to the youths defacing party posters \"they immediately attacked one of my activists, injuring Virginie\". Ms Lanlo suffered an arm injury, while the activist was punched and hit with a scooter, ending up with a broken jaw. The car windscreen was also smashed by the scooter. Three teenagers and a man aged 20 were arrested by police and the incident was quickly condemned across the political spectrum. Mr Attal called on people to \"reject the climate of violence and hatred that's taking hold\", while RN leader Jordan Bardella said one of his \"big commitments as prime minister\" would be to \"combat record insecurity and repeat offending\".\n\nYOAN VALAT/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock National Rally head Marine Le Pen says there is still a chance of outright victory on Sunday\n\nMr Darmanin has announced that 30,000 police will be deployed across France for Sunday's vote in an attempt to prevent \"the ultra-left or ultra-right\" from stirring up trouble. The BBC spoke to voters in his constituency in northern France on Thursday who said they feared youths would go on the rampage whoever won, to express their anger at the political system. Law and order is one of RN's big priorities, alongside immigration and tax cuts to target the cost-of-living crisis. RN candidates have also come under attack. Marie Dauchy described being \"violently assaulted\" as she campaigned at a market in La Rochette near Grenoble in the south-east. A conservative candidate allied with RN, Nicolas Conquer, complained that he and a female colleague had been pelted with eggs. And last month another RN candidate was treated in hospital after he was set upon while handing out pamphlets."], "Recount begins for Inverness, Skye and West Ross-shire": ["Recount begins for Inverness, Skye and West Ross-shire\n\nJust now Share\n\nBBC Returning officer Derek Brown announced the recount was under way\n\nA second recount is under way to declare the winner of the Inverness, Skye and West Ross-shire constituency, the last seat in the UK to announce its result.
